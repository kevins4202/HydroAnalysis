12400,the low c n ratio poses a constraint on the tertiary nitrogen removal process in domestic sewage composite solid carbon sources have recently gained attention in recent years for improving nitrogen removal efficacy however little research has focused on the lengthy start up of denitrification systems caused by composite solid carbon sources in this study we employed a biodegradable sodium alginate sa and corn cob cc mixture implanted a polycaprolactone pcl and corn starch cs mixture and created a new composite solid carbon source polycaprolactone corn starch sodium alginate corn cob microspheres pcsc the early rapid carbon release and late stable carbon release properties of pcsc allow it to rapidly enrich denitrifying bacteria and form biofilms on its surface it only takes 5 days to start denitrification biological filters utilizing pcsc as a carbon source with an average nitrogen removal rate of 85 which is 60 and 10 higher than sa cc and pcl cs respectively the 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing revealed that the primary denitrifying bacteria on the surface of pcsc were chitinophagaceae comamonadaceae and blastocatellaceae overall pcsc can make the denitrification system start up fast steadily and efficiently and it has tremendous application prospects in tertiary nitrogen removal of wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords solid carbon source biological denitrification start up biofilm data availability all data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction nitrogen pollution has been a global environmental problem excessive nitrogen in water can cause eutrophication deteriorate water quality and affect the growth and reproduction of aquatic organisms in rivers and lakes 1 2 one of the sources of nitrogen in water is domestic sewage and the secondary effluent discharged by wastewater treatment plants wwtps often still contains excess nitrogen 3 in china the concentration of total nitrogen in wastewater that reaches class a standard is 15 mg l according to the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plants gb 18918 2002 4 which is 18 75 times that of the nitrogen threshold 0 8 mg l of eutrophication 5 7 therefore tertiary nitrogen removal of secondary effluent is an important way to reduce and alleviate nitrogen pollution in water at the source the key constraint factor of tertiary nitrogen removal is low carbon nitrogen c n especially the c n of secondary effluent is usually lower than 4 which cannot meet the energy required for denitrification 8 one way to accelerate denitrification is to supply extra carbon sources and there has been extensive research regarding the performance of various carbon sources 9 in contrast to liquid carbon sources like methanol and sodium acetate solid carbon sources offer the benefit of a long lasting steady release and effluent should not exceed the standard 10 commonly used polymer solid carbon sources like polycaprolactone pcl polyhydroxy butyrate phb polylactic acid pla and polybutylene succinate pbs are more stable and capable of long term carbon release 11 15 while natural solid carbon sources like corn cob cc wheat straw ws and corn starch cs are less expensive 16 17 in addition liang et al comprehensively compared the denitrification performance of six natural solid carbon sources on low carbon nitrogen ratio wastewater and discovered that corncob cc has the best denitrification performance when compared to rice straw rs wheat straw ws corn stalk cs soybean stalk ss and soybean hull sh but the start up time of the cc denitrification system is 11 d 17 to increase nitrogen removal efficiency and lower costs researchers typically combine the two to create a composite solid carbon source 18 22 composite carbon sources made of polymers often release carbon slowly and over time feeding microorganisms continuously and enabling stable denitrification of the system 21 however the biological denitrification system with polymer as the carbon source typically has a long period of start up in the tertiary nitrogen removal process of actual wastewater according to previous reports pcl was utilized as a carbon source for the tertiary denitrification of wastewater in wwtps the system took 53 to 58 days to start up 23 24 the system started up in 21 days when pbs alone was used as a denitrification carbon source 25 composite solid carbon sources are more biodegradable when pcl starch blends pla starch blends and pbs bamboo powder blends were utilized as carbon sources the start up period of the denitrification system was 20 days 8 19 days and 15 days respectively 11 26 27 the composite carbon source dominated by polymers has a low amount of carbon release and a smooth surface structure in the early stage 28 29 which may be the main reason for the slow formation of biofilms in the majority of current research little emphasis is given to the impact of composite carbon sources on the start up of denitrification systems which focuses primarily on using them to enhance the denitrification performance of systems although a denitrification system s robust and effective startup is crucial for enhancing nitrogen removal efficacy and reducing running expenses 30 31 therefore keeping the benefits of continuous carbon release of composite solid carbon make it capable of fast forming biofilms thereby minimizing the start up time of the denitrification system which is a critical issue that needs to be resolved polymer hydrogel sodium alginate sa has a high biodegradability and can greatly speed up starch biodegradation 32 nevertheless because sa has little mechanical strength and is readily degraded by the fast breakdown of microorganisms in sewage it is seldom employed alone as a solid carbon source but is frequently used to embed or encapsulate natural carbon sources to increase biodegradability 33 consequently to improve the denitrification and start up performance of the denitrification system we intend to embed the polymer carbon source with sodium alginate hydrogel to synthesize a bilayer composite solid carbon source with strong biodegradability and long lasting carbon release in this study we intend to create a new bilayer carbon source polycaprolactone pcl corn starch cs sodium alginate sa corn cob cc microspheres pcsc with the inner layer consisting of pcl cs and the outer layer consisting of sa cc the objectives of the study are 1 compare and analyze the characteristics of carbon release and nitrogen removal performance of pcsc pcl cs and sa cc 2 concentrate on the variations in start up performance of three denitrifying biological filters using pcsc pcl cs and sa cc as carbon sources and 3 investigate the microbiological mechanism of pcsc to speed up the start up of denitrification system according to the biofilm formation the abundance of denitrification functional genes and 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing 2 materials and methods 2 1 pcl cs and sa cc microspheres preparation sodium alginate sa and polycaprolactone pcl were purchased from shanghai maclin biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china cornstarch cs was obtained from chengdu daheng mao industrial co ltd sichuan china and corn cobs

cooling the previous experiment confirmed the optimal proportion of pcl to cs was 3 5 sodium alginate corn cobs sa cc microspheres sa was heated and dissolved in deionized water at 80 c then crushed

washed with distilled water by 3 times and stored at 4 c the previous experiment confirmed the optimal proportion of sa to cc was 2 7 2 2 pcsc microspheres preparation pcl and cs were placed in a reactor in a ratio of 3 5 heated and stirred at 125 c and mixed well then crushed into pcl cs microspheres after cooling 2 g sa was heated and dissolved in distilled water at 80 c then 7 g crushed cc with a particle size of about 0 5 mm was added and stirred well pcl cs microspheres were added to the sa cc solution and it was cured in a 2 cacl2 mass percent crosslinker at 4 c for 24 h to prepare polycaprolactone cornstarch sodium alginate corn cobs pcsc microspheres with a bilayer structure finally the pcsc was washed with deionized water by 3 times and stored at 4 c 2 3 release characteristics 10 g pcl cs sa cc and pcsc solid carbon sources 4 6 mesh were added to 500 ml deionized water and the release characteristics were performed at 30 c respectively the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand codcr total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp were measured and the solution was placed with fresh deionized water every 24 h the carbon release mechanism of three solid carbon sources was explored by fitting the ritger peppas equation using eq 1 1 c t c k t n where the ct c is the release rate of accumulated cod k is the constant of release kinetic t is the release time and n is the diffusion index and it can directly reflect the mechanism of carbon release when n 0 45 the mechanism of carbon release is the fick diffusion when 0 45 n 0 89 it is the fick diffusion and skeleton dissolution when n 0 89 it is the skeleton dissolution 2 4 denitrification performance real secondary effluent was taken from an integrated a2o anaerobic anoxic oxic facility for domestic sewage treatment and the concentrations of nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn and chemical oxygen demand codcr were 10 17 mg l 11 18 mg l and 14 29 mg l respectively there were four denitrification biological filters in this experiment 1 reactor i a control group no carbon source added 2 reactor ii sa cc microspheres were added 3 reactor iii pcl cs microspheres were added 4 reactor iv pcsc microspheres were added the parameters of the denitrification biological filters reactors are plexiglass cylinders with an inner diameter of 70 mm an outer diameter of 80 mm a height of 600 mm and an effective volume of 2 l to prevent excessive biofilm growth and blocking the water entrance the bottom layer of the reactors is filled with volcanic stone with particle sizes of 10 15 mm and the filling height is 150 mm the upper layer of the reactors is filled with composite solid carbon source and volcanic stone with a particle size of 3 5 mm with a filling height of 300 mm and a composite carbon source addition of 10 g l the schematic diagram of the denitrification biological filter was shown in fig 1 the operational conditions of the denitrification biological filters the activated sludge and secondary effluent were mixed in a 1 3 ratio and added from the upper part of the device and it was completely discharged after standing for 24 h the real secondary effluent is pumped into the reactor with a peristaltic pump for continuous operation to an 8 h hydraulic residence time the start up phase is deemed to be complete when the system s denitrification efficiency fluctuates by no 5 for three straight days at which point the system moves into the stable operating stage 34 water samples were taken every 24 h to measure ph do orp tn codcr no 2 n no 3 n and nh 4 n the surface structure of the solid carbon source was characterized on days 0 2 and 6 denitrification functional gene abundance and microbial diversity in the system were assessed on days 2 4 and 6 2 5

results and discussions 3 1 characteristics of solid carbon blends the appearance and mechanical strength of the three composite carbon sources are visible in fig 2 sa cc microspheres are brown round spheres made from a mixture of sodium alginate and corn cob pcl cs microspheres are white round spheres formed by combining polycaprolactone and corn starch pcsc microspheres exhibit a distinct bilayer structure with the inner layer composed of white polycaprolactone and corn starch and the outer layer composed of brown sodium alginate and corn cob showing that the bilayer microspheres were successfully prepared sa cc microspheres have a crushing stress of 8 n while pcl cs and pcsc microspheres have crushing stress 100 n the results demonstrated that sodium alginate had a lower mechanical strength than slow release carbon source microspheres with polycaprolactone as the primary ingredient 3 2 carbon release performance and kinetics fig 3a depicts the cumulative cod release curves and carbon release kinetic equations for the three carbon sources the three composite solid carbon sources static carbon release is separated into two stages fast carbon release and stable carbon release 19 the rapid carbon release period is 0 24 h and the cumulative carbon release amounts for sa cc pcl cs and pcsc are 37 26 mg l 23 21 mg l and 47 92 mg l respectively the stable carbon release period is 24 168 h and the daily carbon release amounts for sa cc pcl cs and pcsc are 8 17 mg l 8 13 mg l and 17 26 mg l respectively natural lignin makes up the corn cob in the composite carbon source and the surface of the corn cob includes many soluble tiny molecules of organic matter 38 39 and amylopectin the primary component of maize starch is readily soluble in water 40 as a result when the composite carbon sources come into contact with water the corn cob and corn starch on the surface are partially dissolved resulting in a significant carbon release amount during the rapid carbon release period 0 24 h furthermore pcl cs microspheres have a lower carbon release than sa cc microspheres one explanation is that pcl has a lesser solubility than sodium alginate and another is that pcl cs microspheres are polymerized under high temperature and high pressure circumstances which changes the structure of some corn starch resulting in a lower carbon release 41 in the absence of microbial breakdown pcl has a low capacity for static carbon release 42 shen et al compared the release characteristics of pcl and starch pcl and the results showed that the amount of organic matter released by pcl within 0 24 h under the same conditions was 75 80 lower than that of starch pcl and the amount of organic matter released by pcl in 24 240 h was always lower than that of starch pcl 43 the simultaneous hydrolysis of starch improves the carbon release capability of the starch pcl mixture over pcl the carbon release of sa and cc was reported in our previous study the amount of carbon released from sa is too low which is difficult to provide sufficient carbon sources for biological denitrification the amount of carbon released from cc is too high which can easily lead to excessive cod in the effluent 44 since cs is readily soluble in water it is frequently employed as a liquid carbon source for biological denitrification 45 the carbon release kinetics of three carbon sources fit the ritger peppas equation with n values of 0 61 0 79 and 0 83 respectively this suggests that the carbon release mechanism of composite carbon sources is a synergistic impact of diffusion and skeleton dissolution in other words simultaneous hydrolysis of the polycaprolactone backbone and sodium alginate as well as diffusion of corn starch and corn cob occur throughout the carbon release process at 0 72 h pcsc microspheres with bilayer structures had carbon release rates and amount comparable to sa cc microspheres however after 72 h the cumulative carbon release of pcsc microspheres dramatically increased indicating that the inner carbon source had started to become exposed in general a solid carbon source with a double layer structure releases more carbon than a single layer solid carbon source and it can release carbon quickly in the early stage 0 24 h and steadily in the later stage 24 168 h furthermore the release law of nitrogen and phosphorus from the composite carbon source in the process of static carbon release was analyzed to determine if the composite carbon source will release pollutants and cause secondary contamination of the water to be treated according to fig 3b and c the characteristics of the nitrogen and phosphorus released by the three composite carbon sources were comparable 1 3 mg l of nitrogen was emitted daily in total and 0 05 mg l of phosphorus was emitted daily in total it was thought that the source of the nitrogen and phosphorus was corn cob and some impurities of materials overall the composite carbon source does not introduce additional pollutants and is biodegradable 3 3 denitrification performances in the biofilters fig 4a depicts the removal of no 3 n from the secondary effluent of residential sewage using the biological filter reactor with composite carbon sources and without a composite carbon source according to the no 3 n removal rate reactors i and ii were not successfully started the start up time for reactors iii and iv was 5 days and 7 days respectively the no 3 n removal rate of reactor i control group is incredibly low ranging from 3 to 19 since the c n ratio of the influent water is 1 2 and typically the c n ratio below 4 67 cannot support the biological denitrification 46 reactor ii with sa cc microspheres as a composite solid carbon source got going right away and on the third day the removal rate of no 3 n reached 77 71 this is because the surface of corn cobs is rough and has a large specific surface area which encourages quick attachment and growth of microorganisms to generate biofilms and shortens the time it takes for the system to start up 47 however starting on the fourth day no 3 n removal rate in reactor ii rapidly drops and by the tenth day it is 20 the findings indicate that sa cc microspheres shouldn t be employed as a composite solid carbon source for denitrification because of their high biodegradability and poor nitrogen removal persistence reactor iii using pcl cs as a composite solid carbon source achieved the highest no 3 n removal rate of 78 74 on the seventh day sem research by 11 revealed that the smooth surface structure of pcl cs microspheres makes it difficult for microorganisms to adhere to and form biofilms which lengthens the start up cycle of the denitrification biofilter system following that reactor iii entered a stable period of nitrogen removal with the no 3 n removal rate maintained at around 75 because of the stability of the polymer pcl structure carbon can be released steadily for a long period and nitrogen can be removed for a long time 48 reactor iv using pcsc microspheres as a composite solid carbon source started promptly and had high nitrogen removal efficiency with the nitrate removal rate reaching 82 11 on the third day which was 76 24 4 4 and 17 59 greater than reactors i ii and iii respectively following that the no 3 n removal rate in reactor iv remained constant at around 85 and the concentration of no 3 n in the effluent was 3 mg l as of this point the outer layer of the double layer composite carbon source pcsc is gradually consumed and the inner layer of substances is gradually exposed thus the nitrogen removal rate in reactor iv is larger than that of reactors ii and iii because the denitrifying bacteria can use both the inner and outer material as a carbon source simultaneously generally speaking reactor iv uses pcsc microspheres with a bilayer structure as a composite solid carbon source combining the fast start up and persistent nitrogen removal of two single layer carbon sources sa cc and pcl cs and further improving the nitrogen removal effect noteworthy is the fact that following 27 days the nitrate removal rate of the pcsc reactor was found to be lower than that of the pcl cs reactor and was maintained thereafter by looking at the structure of pcsc this behavior can be explained since the sa cc on the outer layer of pcsc is highly biodegradable pcsc can rapidly release carbon sources in the early stage to complete the start up of the denitrification system and demonstrate a higher nitrate removal rate when the sa cc on the outer layer of pcsc is depleted the carbon source is primarily released by the pcl cs in the inner layer of pcsc because pcsc contained less pcl cs than the same volume of pcs cs microspheres the nitrogen removal rate of pcsc was lower than that of pcl cs after 27 days according to revious research the carbon release performance of pcl cs is steady and the nitrogen removal rate of the denitrification system can be sustained for 100 days 18 34 it can be inferred that the denitrification performance of pcsc and pcl cs is long term and steady nevertheless in contrast to some of the reported composite solid carbon sources pcsc exhibits superior denitrification ability for real wastewater with low c n the dosage of the starch pcl created by shen et al to treat synthetic wastewater was 72 9 g l while the influent and effluent nitrate concentrations were 50 mg l and 5 mg l respectively 18 the dosage of the 3p created by peng et al to treat synthetic wastewater was 6 25 g l while the influent and effluent nitrate concentrations were 20 mg l and 6 33 mg l respectively 20 the dosage of the cpsp created by li et al to treat synthetic wastewater was 10 g l while the influent and effluent nitrate concentrations were 20 mg l and 11 4 mg l respectively 49 in this study the dosage of the pcsc treat real wastewater was 10 g l while the influent and effluent nitrate concentrations were 20 mg l and 2 1 mg l respectively additionally the use of pcsc for biological denitrification is also more cost effective than using the current composite solid carbon source particularly in the following three areas 1 corn starch and corn cob which are both inexpensive natural carbon sources make up a large amount of pcsc making use of it inexpensive 2 when pcsc demonstrated good denitrification performance its dosage was just 10 g l which was lower than the reported starch pcl blends 72 9 g l 18 pcl peanut shell blends 5 40 g l 29 and pla starch blends 20 g l 50 3 pcsc allows for the speedy start up of denitrification systems lowering operational costs for water treatment engineering to establish if biological denitrification had fully occurred the concentrations of nh 4 n no 2 n and cod in the influent and effluent of each biofilter reactor were also measured as can be seen in fig 4b c and d there was no nitrite accumulation and no dissimilated nitrate reduction reaction in the denitrification filter the no 2 n content of all reactor effluents did not surpass 0 7 mg l and the concentration of nh 4 n did not exceed 0 9 mg l fig 4b displays the cod content in the influent and effluent water the concentration of cod in influent water was 14 27 mg l the cod content of effluent in reactor i control group varied with the cod concentration of the influent water and was 8 23 mg l the effluent of the biological filter system for denitrification using sa cc pcl cs and pcsc carbon sources had a cod concentration of 30 mg l which was compliant with the class iv standard gb 3838 2002 for surface water 51 these findings demonstrate that the carbon produced by the solid composite carbon source can be digested by denitrifying bacteria over time and will not significantly increase the organic content of the effluent and create pollution 3 4 start up characteristics of biological denitrification filters 3 4 1 changes in do ph and orp important influencing elements for denitrification and denitrification systems include do ph and orp table 2 displays variations in do ph and orp during the start up period in the denitrification biofilter reactors the concentration of do in reactors ii iii and iv was markedly smaller than that of the control group studies have shown that high dissolved oxygen will inhibit the activity of denitrifying bacteria and thereby inhibit the biological denitrification process and to some extent a low do value is conducive to denitrification 52 53 the ph of the experimental group added to the solid carbon source was lower than that of the control group because the acid hydrolysate produced when the solid carbon source was hydrolyzed by microorganisms caused a fall in the ph of the water 11 it is believed that the reactor iv had the lowest ph value where pcsc microspheres were added as a composite solid carbon source and were hydrolyzed the most by microorganisms which was more conducive to the increasing prevalence of denitrifying bacteria additionally previous research has demonstrated that denitrification is advantageous when orp is lower than 50 mv 54 55 the experimental group s orp was lower than the control group s and the orp declined fastest in reactor iv with the double layer composite carbon source pcsc which was more favorable to denitrification in general the variations in do ph and orp of water in the biological filter reactor were consistent with the rate of nitrate removal the do and orp in reactor iv with pcsc microspheres as the carbon source decreased faster allowing for faster propagation of denitrifying microorganisms and a shorter system start up phase 3 4 2 surface structure of solid carbon microspheres the surface structure alterations and the traits of the biofilm of three carbon source microspheres during the start up period of the biofilters were observed using sem fig 5 depicts the rough surface of the sa cc microspheres on day 0 with visible corn cob particles on day 2 a dense biofilm had grown on the surface of the sa cc microspheres and some of the corn cob particles had been broken down by utilization by day 6 the sa cc microsphere surface particles had been completely absorbed the carbon source structure had broken down and the biofilm had essentially shed the nitrogen removal rate of reactor ii might have decreased as a direct result of this in contrast the surface of the pcl cs microspheres was smooth on day 0 on day 2 only a few bacteria were adhering to the surface and no biofilm formed on day 6 microorganisms degrade the surface of pcl cs microspheres forming homogeneous cavities to which a high number of microorganisms were attached furthermore the pcsc microspheres had an obvious double layer structure on day 2 the outer corn cob particles were decomposed on day 6 there were numerous dense biofilms on the surface of pcsc microspheres and the surface layer was eroded into a cavity like the pcl cs microspheres however it was more uniform and abundant than the surface of the pcl cs microspheres these results demonstrated the rapid enrichment of microorganisms by the monolayer sa cc composite solid carbon source however the biofilm was easily detached due to structural instability the surface structure of the composite solid carbon source pcl cs is smooth and microbial enrichment is gradual not only can bilayer solid carbon source pcsc swiftly enrich bacteria but it can also create dense biofilms that remain for a very long time 3 4 3 abundance of nirk and nirs gene nitrite reductase is one of the essential enzymes that catalyze denitrification processes and its coding genes nirs and nirk are commonly employed as marker genes for denitrifying bacteria 37 56 throughout the experiment the number of nirs gene copies in the three experimental groups with composite carbon sources was greater than those in the control group fig 6a demonstrating that the inclusion of composite carbon sources aided in the rapid proliferation of denitrifying bacteria on day two reactor iv had the most copies of the nirs gene while reactor iii had fewer copies than reactor ii the variance in the number of the nirs gene copies across several systems matched the tn removal rates observed in the start up phase in each reactor it has been demonstrated again that sa cc and pcsc speed up the growth and reproduction of denitrifying bacteria allowing the denitrification system to get going quickly on day four the number of nirs gene copies grew the most on day six the number of nirs gene copies drastically decreased according to the morphology of scanning electron microscopy and the carbon release kinetics of sa cc and the absence of a carbon source it is thought that the growth of denitrifying bacteria was inhibited due to the disintegration of sa cc and the lack of carbon source fig 6b displays changes in the nirk gene copies number which codes for the cu type nitrite reductase in every system there were fewer copies of the nirk gene than the nirs gene similar to the change in the nirs gene there was a larger copies number of the nirk gene in the experimental group with the carbon source than in the control group the abundance of the nirk gene was highest in reactor iv with the pcsc furthermore the nirk gene was more sensitive to changes in carbon sources because the number of the nirk gene copies in reactors i and ii was significantly reduced on day 4 3 4 4 microbial community composition fig 7a depicts the changes in microbial community structure at the phylum level during the start up phase in all reactors the dominant microorganisms are proteobacteria and bacteroidetes according to previous reports under various aquatic ecological conditions proteobacteria are the most prevalent microorganisms for denitrification 57 58 most microorganisms in the phylum bacteroidetes are ubiquitous organic trophic bacteria in aquatic environments capable of degrading macromolecular organics 59 in reactor i control group the lack of an organic carbon source prevented the growth of heterotrophic bacteria and there were few proteobacteria and bacteroidetes whose relative abundance was low and whose tendency to gradually decline over time increased in the reactor ii sa cc the relative abundance of proteobacteria was 35 96 b1 2 on day 2 which was more than the relative abundance of ck 2 showing that the addition of sa cc carbon source enhanced the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria dominant flora in the biological filter on day 6 the relative abundance of proteobacteria reduced to 28 76 b1 6 due to the quick consumption of sa cc in reactor iii pcl cs proteobacteria had a relative abundance of 41 8 b2 2 on day 2 which was 11 greater than that of ck 2 the relative abundance of proteobacteria continued to rise from 2 to 6 days reaching 50 on the sixth day because pcl cs microspheres continued to release carbon in reactor iv pcsc the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased by 44 37 on day 2 d 2 then it reached its highest relative abundance of 48 79 on day 4 d 4 but it dropped on day 6 which may be related to the composition of the pcsc before using composite solid carbon sources for biological denitrification and denitrification microorganisms must hydrolyze them into small molecules of organic carbon 60 bacteroidetes contribute to the denitrification process by providing more carbon sources and assisting in the decomposition of macromolecular organic waste which is why reactor iv has a larger relative abundance of this microbial species than reactors ii and iii fig 7b depicts the changes in microbial community structure at the order level during the start up phase in all reactors comamonadaceae chitinophagaceae rhodanobacteraceae norank o saccharimonadales saprospiraceae and xanthomonadaceae have been determined to be the major denitrifying bacteria in earlier investigations 61 63 blastocatellaceae and norank o saccharimonadales were dominant in reactor 2 with sa cc b1 2 with relative abundances of 8 06 and 6 43 respectively the majority of blastocatellaceae microbes can tolerate a wide range of ph and temperature values can break down structurally complicated macromolecular organic substances and can adapt to nutrient poor settings 64 comamonadaceae was dominant in the reactor 3 with pcl cs b2 2 with a relative abundance of 8 41 takahashi et al discovered that denitrifying bacteria using polylactic acid as a carbon source is mostly from the comamonadaceae which can degrade biodegradable polyesters 61 the predominant denitrifying bacteria in reactor 4 with pcsc fluctuate over time the dominant bacteria in d 2 was chitinophagaceae with a relative abundance of 9 21 the dominant bacteria in d 4 was comamonadacea with a relative abundance of 11 99 the dominant bacteria in d 6 was blastocatellaceae with a relative abundance of 10 48 it was speculated that the inner and outer layers of a pcsc with a double layer structure have distinct carbon source materials as a result different organic molecules are released at different periods changing the dominant denitrifying microorganisms 4 conclusions in this work we successfully created a solid carbon source pcsc with a bilayer structure by incorporating a combination of sodium alginate and corn cob sa cc in the outer layer of polycaprolactone and corn starch pcl cs sem observations and nitrogen removal test revealed that sa cc had the characteristics of rapid microorganism enrichment while pcl cs had the characteristics of a long lasting slow release carbon source and a stable structure whereas pcsc had both advantages and improved the system s denitrification performance moreover biological denitrification filters with various composite carbon sources had average no3 n rates of 25 sa cc 75 pcl cs and 85 pcsc compared with pcl cs the start up time of the pcsc denitrification system is reduced by 2 days pcsc does not introduce secondary pollution during the denitrification process and the cod concentration of the effluent consistently meets the surface water class iv standard furthermore the start up characteristics of denitrifying biological filters were also investigated during the start up phase in denitrifying biological filters with pcsc the do and orp of water reduced rapidly which aided in the rapid growth and reproduction of denitrifying bacteria the denitrification functional genes nirs and nirk are more abundant the dominant denitrifying bacteria on days 2 4 and 6 were chitinophagaceae 9 21 comamonadaceae 11 99 and blastocatellaceae 10 48 credit authorship contribution statement dan zhang software visualization writing original draft writing review editing huilan

12400,the low c n ratio poses a constraint on the tertiary nitrogen removal process in domestic sewage composite solid carbon sources have recently gained attention in recent years for improving nitrogen removal efficacy however little research has focused on the lengthy start up of denitrification systems caused by composite solid carbon sources in this study we employed a biodegradable

cob microspheres pcsc the early rapid carbon release and late stable carbon release properties of pcsc allow it to rapidly enrich denitrifying bacteria and form biofilms on its surface it only takes 5 days to start denitrification biological filters utilizing pcsc as a carbon source with an average nitrogen removal rate of 85 which is 60 and 10 higher than sa cc and pcl cs respectively the 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing revealed that the primary denitrifying bacteria on the surface of pcsc were chitinophagaceae comamonadaceae and blastocatellaceae overall pcsc can make the denitrification system start up fast steadily and efficiently and it has tremendous application prospects in tertiary nitrogen removal of wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords solid carbon source biological denitrification start up biofilm data availability all data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction nitrogen pollution has been a global environmental problem excessive nitrogen in water can cause eutrophication deteriorate water quality and affect the growth and reproduction of aquatic organisms in rivers and lakes 1 2 one of the sources of nitrogen in water is domestic sewage and the secondary effluent discharged by wastewater treatment plants wwtps often still contains excess nitrogen 3 in china the concentration of total nitrogen in wastewater that reaches class a standard is 15 mg l according to the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plants gb 18918 2002 4 which is 18 75 times that of the nitrogen threshold 0 8 mg l of eutrophication 5 7 therefore tertiary nitrogen removal of secondary effluent is an important way to reduce and alleviate nitrogen pollution in water at the source the key constraint factor of tertiary nitrogen removal is low carbon nitrogen c n especially the c n of secondary effluent is usually lower than 4 which cannot meet the energy required for denitrification 8 one way to accelerate denitrification is to supply extra carbon sources and there has been extensive research regarding the performance of various carbon sources 9 in contrast to liquid carbon sources like methanol and sodium acetate solid carbon sources offer the benefit of a long lasting steady release and effluent should not exceed the standard 10 commonly used polymer solid carbon sources like polycaprolactone pcl polyhydroxy butyrate phb polylactic acid pla and polybutylene succinate pbs are more stable and capable of long term carbon release 11 15 while natural solid carbon sources like corn cob cc wheat straw ws and corn starch cs are less expensive 16 17 in addition liang et al comprehensively compared the denitrification performance of six natural solid carbon sources on low carbon nitrogen ratio wastewater and discovered that corncob cc has the best denitrification performance when compared to rice straw rs wheat straw ws corn stalk cs soybean stalk ss and soybean hull sh but the start up time of the cc denitrification system is 11 d 17 to increase nitrogen removal efficiency and lower costs researchers typically combine the two to create a composite solid carbon source 18 22 composite carbon sources made of polymers often release carbon slowly and over time feeding microorganisms continuously and enabling stable denitrification of the system 21 however the biological denitrification system with polymer as the carbon source typically has a long period of start up in the tertiary nitrogen removal process of actual wastewater according to previous reports pcl was utilized as a carbon source for the tertiary denitrification of wastewater in wwtps the system took 53 to 58 days to start up 23 24 the system started up in 21 days when pbs alone was used as a denitrification carbon source 25 composite solid carbon sources are more biodegradable when pcl starch blends pla starch blends and pbs bamboo powder blends were utilized as carbon sources the start up period of the denitrification system was 20 days 8 19 days and 15 days respectively 11 26 27 the composite carbon source dominated by polymers has a low amount of carbon release and a smooth surface structure in the early stage 28 29 which may be the main reason for the slow formation of biofilms in the majority of current research little emphasis is given to the impact of composite carbon sources on the start up of denitrification systems which focuses primarily on using them to enhance the denitrification performance of systems although a denitrification system s robust and effective startup is crucial for enhancing nitrogen removal efficacy and reducing running expenses 30 31 therefore keeping the benefits of continuous carbon release of composite solid carbon make it capable of fast forming biofilms thereby minimizing the start up time of the denitrification system which is a critical issue that needs to be resolved polymer hydrogel sodium alginate sa has a high biodegradability and can greatly speed up starch biodegradation 32 nevertheless because sa has little mechanical strength and is readily degraded by the fast breakdown of microorganisms in sewage it is seldom employed alone as a solid carbon source but is frequently used to embed or encapsulate natural carbon sources to increase biodegradability 33 consequently to improve the denitrification and start up performance of the denitrification system we intend to embed the polymer carbon source with sodium alginate hydrogel to synthesize a bilayer composite solid carbon source with strong biodegradability and long lasting carbon release in this study we intend to create a new bilayer carbon source polycaprolactone pcl corn starch cs sodium alginate sa corn cob cc microspheres pcsc with the inner layer consisting of pcl cs and the outer layer consisting of sa cc the objectives of the study are 1 compare and analyze the characteristics of carbon release and nitrogen removal performance of pcsc pcl cs and sa cc 2 concentrate on the variations in start up performance of three denitrifying biological filters using pcsc pcl cs and sa cc as carbon sources and 3 investigate the microbiological mechanism of pcsc to speed up the start up of denitrification system according to the biofilm formation the abundance of denitrification functional genes and 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing 2 materials and methods 2 1 pcl cs and sa cc microspheres preparation sodium alginate sa and polycaprolactone pcl were purchased from shanghai maclin biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china cornstarch cs was obtained from chengdu daheng mao industrial co ltd sichuan china and corn cobs

cooling the previous experiment confirmed the optimal proportion of pcl to cs was 3 5 sodium alginate corn cobs sa cc microspheres sa was heated and dissolved in deionized water at 80 c then crushed

washed with distilled water by 3 times and stored at 4 c the previous experiment confirmed the optimal proportion of sa to cc was 2 7 2 2 pcsc microspheres preparation pcl and cs were placed in a reactor in a ratio of 3 5 heated and stirred at 125 c and mixed well then crushed into pcl cs microspheres after cooling 2 g sa was heated and dissolved in distilled water at 80 c then 7 g crushed cc with a particle size of about 0 5 mm was added and stirred well pcl cs microspheres were added to the sa cc solution and it was cured in a 2 cacl2 mass percent crosslinker at 4 c for 24 h to prepare polycaprolactone cornstarch sodium alginate corn cobs pcsc microspheres with a bilayer structure finally the pcsc was washed with deionized water by 3 times and stored at 4 c 2 3 release characteristics 10 g pcl cs sa cc and pcsc solid carbon sources 4 6 mesh were added to 500 ml deionized water and the release characteristics were performed at 30 c respectively the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand codcr total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp were measured and the solution was placed with fresh deionized water every 24 h the carbon release mechanism of three solid carbon sources was explored by fitting the ritger peppas equation using eq 1 1 c t c k t n where the ct c is the release rate of accumulated cod k is the constant of release kinetic t is the release time and n is the diffusion index and it can directly reflect the mechanism of carbon release when n 0 45 the mechanism of carbon release is the fick diffusion when 0 45 n 0 89 it is the fick diffusion and skeleton dissolution when n 0 89 it is the skeleton dissolution 2 4 denitrification performance real secondary effluent was taken from an integrated a2o anaerobic anoxic oxic facility for domestic sewage treatment and the concentrations of nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn and chemical oxygen demand codcr were 10 17 mg l 11 18 mg l and 14 29 mg l respectively there were four denitrification biological filters in this experiment 1 reactor i a control group no carbon source added 2 reactor ii sa cc microspheres were added 3 reactor iii pcl cs microspheres were added 4 reactor iv pcsc microspheres were added the parameters of the denitrification biological filters reactors are plexiglass cylinders with an inner diameter of 70 mm an outer diameter of 80 mm a height of 600 mm and an effective volume of 2 l to prevent excessive biofilm growth and blocking the water entrance the bottom layer of the reactors is filled with volcanic stone with particle sizes of 10 15 mm and the filling height is 150 mm the upper layer of the reactors is filled with composite solid carbon source and volcanic stone with a particle size of 3 5 mm with a filling height of 300 mm and a composite carbon source addition of 10 g l the schematic diagram of the denitrification biological filter was shown in fig 1 the operational conditions of the denitrification biological filters the activated sludge and secondary effluent were mixed in a 1 3 ratio and added from the upper part of the device and it was completely discharged after standing for 24 h the real secondary effluent is pumped into the reactor with a peristaltic pump for continuous operation to an 8 h hydraulic residence time the start up phase is deemed to be complete when the system s denitrification efficiency fluctuates by no 5 for three straight days at which point the system moves into the stable operating stage 34 water samples were taken every 24 h to measure ph do orp tn codcr no 2 n no 3 n and nh 4 n

results and discussions 3 1 characteristics of solid carbon blends the appearance and mechanical strength of the three composite carbon sources are visible in fig 2 sa cc microspheres are brown round spheres made from a mixture of sodium alginate and corn cob pcl cs microspheres are white round spheres formed by combining polycaprolactone and corn starch pcsc microspheres exhibit a distinct bilayer structure with the inner layer composed of white polycaprolactone and corn starch and the outer layer composed of brown sodium alginate and corn cob showing that the bilayer microspheres were successfully prepared sa cc microspheres have a crushing stress of 8 n while pcl cs and pcsc microspheres have crushing stress 100 n the results demonstrated that sodium alginate had a lower mechanical strength than slow release carbon source microspheres with polycaprolactone as the primary ingredient 3 2 carbon release performance and kinetics fig 3a depicts the cumulative cod release curves and carbon release kinetic equations for the three carbon sources the three composite solid carbon sources static carbon release is separated into two stages fast carbon release and stable carbon release 19 the rapid carbon release period is 0 24 h and the cumulative carbon release amounts for sa cc pcl cs and pcsc are 37 26 mg l 23 21 mg l and 47 92 mg l respectively the stable carbon release period is 24 168 h and the daily carbon release amounts for sa cc pcl cs and pcsc are 8 17 mg l 8 13 mg l and 17 26 mg l respectively natural lignin makes up the corn cob in the composite carbon source and the surface of the corn cob includes many soluble tiny molecules of organic matter 38 39 and amylopectin the primary component of maize starch is readily soluble in water 40 as a result when the composite carbon sources come into contact with water the corn cob and corn starch on the surface are partially dissolved resulting in a significant carbon release amount during the rapid carbon release period 0 24 h furthermore pcl cs microspheres have a lower carbon release than sa cc microspheres one explanation is that pcl has a lesser solubility than sodium alginate and another is that pcl cs microspheres are polymerized under high temperature and high pressure circumstances which changes the structure of some corn starch resulting in a lower carbon release 41 in the absence of microbial breakdown pcl has a low capacity for static carbon release 42 shen et al compared the release characteristics of pcl and starch pcl and the results showed that the amount of organic matter released by pcl within 0 24 h under the same conditions was 75 80 lower than that of starch pcl and the amount of organic matter released by pcl in 24 240 h was always lower than that of starch pcl 43 the simultaneous hydrolysis of starch improves the carbon release capability of the starch pcl mixture over pcl the carbon release of sa and cc was reported in our previous study the amount of carbon released from sa is too low which is difficult to provide sufficient carbon sources for biological denitrification the amount of carbon released from cc is too high which can easily lead to excessive cod in the effluent 44 since cs is readily soluble in water it is frequently employed as a liquid carbon source for biological denitrification 45 the carbon release kinetics of three carbon sources fit the ritger peppas equation with n values of 0 61 0 79 and 0 83 respectively this suggests that the carbon release mechanism of composite carbon sources is a synergistic impact of diffusion and skeleton dissolution in other words simultaneous hydrolysis of the polycaprolactone backbone and sodium alginate as well as diffusion of corn starch and corn cob occur throughout the carbon release process at 0 72 h pcsc microspheres with bilayer structures had carbon release rates and amount comparable to sa cc microspheres however after 72 h the cumulative carbon release of pcsc microspheres dramatically increased indicating that the inner carbon source had started to become exposed in general a solid carbon source with a double layer structure releases more carbon than a single layer solid carbon source and it can release carbon quickly in the early stage 0 24 h and steadily in the later stage 24 168 h furthermore the release law of nitrogen and phosphorus from the composite carbon source in the process of static carbon release was analyzed to determine if the composite carbon source will release pollutants and cause secondary contamination of the water to be treated according to fig 3b and c the characteristics of the nitrogen and phosphorus released by the three composite carbon sources were comparable 1 3 mg l of nitrogen was emitted daily in total and 0 05 mg l of phosphorus was emitted daily in total it was thought that the source of the nitrogen and phosphorus was corn cob and some impurities of materials overall the composite carbon source does not introduce additional pollutants and is biodegradable 3 3 denitrification performances in the biofilters fig 4a depicts the removal of no 3 n from the secondary effluent of residential sewage using the biological filter reactor with composite carbon sources and without a composite carbon source according to the no 3 n removal rate reactors i and ii were not successfully started the start up time for reactors iii and iv was 5 days and 7 days respectively the no 3 n removal rate of reactor i control group is incredibly low ranging from 3 to 19 since the c n ratio of the influent water is 1 2 and typically the c n ratio below 4 67 cannot support the biological denitrification 46 reactor ii with sa cc microspheres as a composite solid carbon source got going right away and on the third day the removal rate of no 3 n reached 77 71 this is because the surface of corn cobs is rough and has a large specific surface area which encourages quick attachment and growth of microorganisms to generate biofilms and shortens the time it takes for the system to start up 47 however starting on the fourth day no 3 n removal rate in reactor ii rapidly drops and by the tenth day it is 20 the findings indicate that sa cc microspheres shouldn t be employed as a composite solid carbon source for denitrification because of their high biodegradability and poor nitrogen removal persistence reactor iii using pcl cs as a composite solid carbon source achieved the highest no 3 n removal rate of 78 74 on the seventh day sem research by 11 revealed that the smooth surface structure of pcl cs microspheres makes it difficult for microorganisms to adhere to and form biofilms which lengthens the start up cycle of the denitrification biofilter system following that reactor iii entered a stable period of nitrogen removal with the no 3 n removal rate maintained at around 75 because of the stability of the polymer pcl structure carbon can be released steadily for a long period and nitrogen can be removed for a long time 48 reactor iv using pcsc microspheres as a composite solid carbon source started promptly and had high nitrogen removal efficiency with the nitrate removal rate reaching 82 11 on the third day which was 76 24 4 4 and 17 59 greater than reactors i ii and iii respectively following that the no 3 n removal rate in reactor iv remained constant at around 85 and the concentration of no 3 n in the effluent was 3 mg l as of this point the outer layer of the double layer composite carbon source pcsc is gradually consumed and the inner layer of substances is gradually exposed thus the nitrogen removal rate in reactor iv is larger than that of reactors ii and iii because the denitrifying bacteria can use both the inner and outer material as a carbon source simultaneously generally speaking reactor iv uses pcsc microspheres with a bilayer structure as a composite solid carbon source combining the fast start up and persistent nitrogen removal of two single layer carbon sources sa cc and pcl cs and further improving the nitrogen removal effect noteworthy is the fact that following 27 days the nitrate removal rate of the pcsc reactor was found to be lower than that of the pcl cs reactor and was maintained thereafter by looking at the structure of pcsc this behavior can be explained since the sa cc on the outer layer of pcsc is highly biodegradable pcsc can rapidly release carbon sources in the early stage to complete the start up of the denitrification system and demonstrate a higher nitrate removal rate when the sa cc on the outer layer of pcsc is depleted the carbon source is primarily released by the pcl cs in the inner layer of pcsc because pcsc contained less pcl cs than the same volume of pcs cs microspheres the nitrogen removal rate of pcsc was lower than that of pcl cs after 27 days according to revious research the carbon release performance of pcl cs is steady and the nitrogen removal rate of the denitrification system can be sustained for 100 days 18 34 it can be inferred that the denitrification performance of pcsc and pcl cs is long term and steady nevertheless in contrast to some of the reported composite solid carbon sources pcsc exhibits superior denitrification ability for real wastewater with low c n the dosage of the starch pcl created by shen et al to treat synthetic wastewater was 72 9 g l while the influent and effluent nitrate concentrations were 50 mg l and 5 mg l respectively 18 the dosage of the 3p created by peng et al to treat synthetic wastewater was 6 25 g l while the influent and effluent nitrate concentrations were 20 mg l and 6 33 mg l respectively 20 the dosage of the cpsp created by li et al to treat synthetic wastewater was 10 g l while the influent and effluent nitrate concentrations were 20 mg l and 11 4 mg l respectively 49 in this study the dosage of the pcsc treat real wastewater was 10 g l while the influent and effluent nitrate concentrations were 20 mg l and 2 1 mg l respectively additionally the use of pcsc for biological denitrification is also more cost effective than using the current composite solid carbon source particularly in the following three areas 1 corn starch and corn cob which are both inexpensive natural carbon sources make up a large amount of pcsc making use of it inexpensive 2 when pcsc demonstrated good denitrification performance its dosage was just 10 g l which was lower than the reported starch pcl blends 72 9 g l 18 pcl peanut shell blends 5 40 g l 29 and pla starch blends 20 g l 50 3 pcsc allows for the speedy start up of denitrification systems lowering operational costs for water treatment engineering to establish if biological denitrification had fully occurred the concentrations of nh 4 n no 2 n and cod in the influent and effluent of each biofilter reactor were also measured as can be seen in fig 4b c and d there was no nitrite accumulation and no dissimilated nitrate reduction reaction in the denitrification filter the no 2 n content of all reactor effluents did not surpass 0 7 mg l and the concentration of nh 4 n did not exceed 0 9 mg l fig 4b displays the cod content in the influent and effluent water the concentration of cod in influent water was 14 27 mg l the cod content of effluent in reactor i control group varied with the cod concentration of the influent water and was 8 23 mg l the effluent of the biological filter system for denitrification using sa cc pcl cs and pcsc carbon sources had a cod concentration of 30 mg l which was compliant with the class iv standard gb 3838 2002 for surface water 51 these findings demonstrate that the carbon produced by the solid composite carbon source can be digested by denitrifying bacteria over time and will not significantly increase the organic content of the effluent and create pollution 3 4 start up characteristics of biological denitrification filters 3 4 1 changes in do ph and orp important influencing elements for denitrification and denitrification systems include do ph and orp table 2 displays variations in do ph and orp during the start up period in the denitrification biofilter reactors the concentration of do in reactors ii iii and iv was markedly smaller than that of the control group studies have shown that high dissolved oxygen will inhibit the activity of denitrifying bacteria and thereby inhibit the biological denitrification process and to some extent a low do value is conducive to denitrification 52 53 the ph of the experimental group added to the solid carbon source was lower than that of the control group because the acid hydrolysate produced when the solid carbon source was hydrolyzed by microorganisms caused a fall in the ph of the water 11 it is believed that the reactor iv had the lowest ph value where pcsc microspheres were added as a composite solid carbon source and were hydrolyzed the most by microorganisms which was more conducive to the increasing prevalence of denitrifying bacteria additionally previous research has demonstrated that denitrification is advantageous when orp is lower than 50 mv 54 55 the experimental group s orp was lower than the control group s and the orp declined fastest in reactor iv with the double layer composite carbon source pcsc which was more favorable to denitrification in general the variations in do ph and orp of water in the biological filter reactor were consistent with the rate of nitrate removal the do and orp in reactor iv with pcsc microspheres as the carbon source decreased faster allowing for faster propagation of denitrifying microorganisms and a shorter system start up phase 3 4 2 surface structure of solid carbon microspheres the surface structure alterations and the traits of the biofilm of three carbon source microspheres during the start up period of the biofilters were observed using sem fig 5 depicts the rough surface of the sa cc microspheres on day 0 with visible corn cob particles on day 2 a dense biofilm had grown on the surface of the sa cc microspheres and some of the corn cob particles had been broken down by utilization by day 6 the sa cc microsphere surface particles had been completely absorbed the carbon source structure had broken down and the biofilm had essentially shed the nitrogen removal rate of reactor ii might have decreased as a direct result of this in contrast the surface of the pcl cs microspheres was smooth on day 0 on day 2 only a few bacteria were adhering to the surface and no biofilm formed on day 6 microorganisms degrade the surface of pcl cs microspheres forming homogeneous cavities to which a high number of microorganisms were attached furthermore the pcsc microspheres had an obvious double layer structure on day 2 the outer corn cob particles were decomposed on day 6 there were numerous dense biofilms on the surface of pcsc microspheres and the surface layer was eroded into a cavity like the pcl cs microspheres however it was more uniform and abundant than the surface of the pcl cs microspheres these results demonstrated the rapid enrichment of microorganisms by the monolayer sa cc composite solid carbon source however the biofilm was easily detached due to structural instability the surface structure of the composite solid carbon source pcl cs is smooth and microbial enrichment is gradual not only can bilayer solid carbon source pcsc swiftly enrich bacteria but it can also create dense biofilms that remain for a very long time 3 4 3 abundance of nirk and nirs gene nitrite reductase is one of the essential enzymes that catalyze denitrification processes and its coding genes nirs and nirk are commonly employed as marker genes for denitrifying bacteria 37 56 throughout the experiment the number of nirs gene copies in the three experimental groups with composite carbon sources was greater than those in the control group fig 6a demonstrating that the inclusion of composite carbon sources aided in the rapid proliferation of denitrifying bacteria on day two reactor iv had the most copies of the nirs gene while reactor iii had fewer copies than reactor ii the variance in the number of the nirs gene copies across several systems matched the tn removal rates observed in the start up phase in each reactor it has been demonstrated again that sa cc and pcsc speed up the growth and reproduction of denitrifying bacteria allowing the denitrification system to get going quickly on day four the number of nirs gene copies grew the most on day six the number of nirs gene copies drastically decreased according to the morphology of scanning electron microscopy and the carbon release kinetics of sa cc and the absence of a carbon source it is thought that the growth of denitrifying bacteria was inhibited due to the disintegration of sa cc and the lack of carbon source fig 6b displays changes in the nirk gene copies number which codes for the cu type nitrite reductase in every system there were fewer copies of the nirk gene than the nirs gene similar to the change in the nirs gene there was a larger copies number of the nirk gene in the experimental group with the carbon source than in the control group the abundance of the nirk gene was highest in reactor iv with the pcsc furthermore the nirk gene was more sensitive to changes in carbon sources because the number of the nirk gene copies in reactors i and ii was significantly reduced on day 4 3 4 4 microbial community composition fig 7a depicts the changes in microbial community structure at the phylum level during the start up phase in all reactors the dominant microorganisms are proteobacteria and bacteroidetes according to previous reports under various aquatic ecological conditions proteobacteria are the most prevalent microorganisms for denitrification 57 58 most microorganisms in the phylum bacteroidetes are ubiquitous organic trophic bacteria in aquatic environments capable of degrading macromolecular organics 59 in reactor i control group the lack of an organic carbon source prevented the growth of heterotrophic bacteria and there were few proteobacteria and bacteroidetes whose relative abundance was low and whose tendency to gradually decline over time increased in the reactor ii sa cc the relative abundance of proteobacteria was 35 96 b1 2 on day 2 which was more than the relative abundance of ck 2 showing that the addition of sa cc carbon source enhanced the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria dominant flora in the biological filter on day 6 the relative abundance of proteobacteria reduced to 28 76 b1 6 due to the quick consumption of sa cc in reactor iii pcl cs proteobacteria had a relative abundance of 41 8 b2 2 on day 2 which was 11 greater than that of ck 2 the relative abundance of proteobacteria continued to rise from 2 to 6 days reaching 50 on the sixth day because pcl cs microspheres continued to release carbon in reactor iv pcsc the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased by 44 37 on day 2 d 2 then it reached its highest relative abundance of 48 79 on day 4 d 4 but it dropped on day 6 which may be related to the composition of the pcsc before using composite solid carbon sources for biological denitrification and denitrification microorganisms must hydrolyze them into small molecules of organic carbon 60 bacteroidetes contribute to the denitrification process by providing more carbon sources and assisting in the decomposition of macromolecular organic waste which is why reactor iv has a larger relative abundance of this microbial species than reactors ii and iii fig 7b depicts the changes in microbial community structure at the order level during the start up phase in all reactors comamonadaceae chitinophagaceae rhodanobacteraceae norank o saccharimonadales saprospiraceae and xanthomonadaceae have been determined to be the major denitrifying bacteria in earlier investigations 61 63 blastocatellaceae and norank o saccharimonadales were dominant in reactor 2 with sa cc b1 2 with relative abundances of 8 06 and 6 43 respectively the majority of blastocatellaceae microbes can tolerate a wide range of ph and temperature values can break down structurally complicated macromolecular organic substances and can adapt to nutrient poor settings 64 comamonadaceae was dominant in the reactor 3 with pcl cs b2 2 with a relative abundance of 8 41 takahashi et al discovered that denitrifying bacteria using polylactic acid as a carbon source is mostly from the comamonadaceae which can degrade biodegradable polyesters 61 the predominant denitrifying bacteria in reactor 4 with pcsc fluctuate over time the dominant bacteria in d 2 was chitinophagaceae with a relative abundance of 9 21 the dominant bacteria in d 4 was comamonadacea with a relative abundance of 11 99 the dominant bacteria in d 6 was blastocatellaceae with a relative abundance of 10 48 it was speculated that the inner and outer layers of a pcsc with a double layer structure have distinct carbon source materials as a result different organic molecules are released at different periods changing the dominant denitrifying microorganisms 4 conclusions in this work we successfully created a solid carbon source pcsc with a bilayer structure by incorporating a combination of sodium alginate and corn cob sa cc in the outer layer of polycaprolactone and corn starch pcl cs sem observations and nitrogen removal test revealed that sa cc had the characteristics of rapid microorganism enrichment while pcl cs had the characteristics of a long lasting slow release carbon source and a stable structure whereas pcsc had both advantages and improved the system s denitrification performance moreover biological denitrification filters with various composite carbon sources had average no3 n rates of 25 sa cc 75 pcl cs and 85 pcsc compared with pcl cs the start up time of the pcsc denitrification system is reduced by 2 days pcsc does not introduce secondary pollution during the denitrification process and the cod concentration of the effluent consistently meets the surface water class iv standard furthermore the start up characteristics of denitrifying biological filters were also investigated during the start up phase in denitrifying biological filters with pcsc the do and orp of water reduced rapidly which aided in the rapid growth and reproduction of denitrifying bacteria the denitrification functional genes nirs and nirk are more abundant the dominant denitrifying bacteria on days 2 4 and 6 were chitinophagaceae 9 21 comamonadaceae 11 99 and blastocatellaceae 10 48 credit authorship contribution statement dan zhang software visualization writing original draft writing review editing huilan

five cycles of reuse compared with geg c and b the sorption selectivity in the presence of competitor ions from equimolar multicomponent solutions especially at ph 4 different sorption mechanisms may be involved depending on the ph deprotonation of reactive groups including chelation onto deprotonated amine and phosphonate groups and ion exchange protonated groups with metal cations cadmium sorption is reversed by contact with 0 3 m hcl solution the functionalization geg p strongly increases the selectivity coefficient for cd ii against major elements in mining effluent especially at ph higher than 5 these results confirm the interest of multifunctionality in the development of new sorbents based on renewable resources such as gellan gum graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords

the anthropogenic activities as well as the effects of erosion or weathering may cause strong contamination of water bodies by metal contamination with direct impact on plants and agriculture water drinking quality and in fine on the health of living beings animals and humans cadmium is part of these hazardous contaminants for example due to its long half life in human body about 10 35 years 1 it may have strong impact on health hence cadmium is recognized as a potential carcinogenic vector especially by inhalation however the kidney is the main target organ for cadmium toxicity 2 4 the world health organization set the guideline value for cadmium to 3 μg l 1 in drinking water 1 up to recently 80 of used cadmium concerned the sector of batteries nickel cadmium batteries 5 this part tends to decrease to face the hazardous impacts of battery discharge to the environment being replaced with nickel metal hydride batteries for similar reasons the use of cadmium in pigments and cathodic tubes strongly decreased however some sectors such as electroplate steel and corrosion protected metal pieces alloying uses solar cells plastic stabilizers and nuclear industry as atomic fission controller still use cadmium 6 this makes cadmium a widely used hazardous metal the removal of cadmium is thus of critical importance for minimizing environmental and health impacts both in terms of industrial discharges end of pipe and drinking water supply the target of the current study focuses on the treatment of industrial waste flows processed water leachates in the treatment of weee waste from electrical and electronic equipment and batteries metal removal from mining effluents etc rather than drinking water application for the treatment of non trace cd bearing effluents several techniques can be scanned 7 including specific precipitation sequence 8 phosphate based precipitation 9 or sulfide precipitation 10 solvent extraction is also frequently used for purifying phosphoric acid solutions or removing cadmium from concentrated complex effluents 7 11 13 however for less concentrated effluents the use of sorption processes is usually preferred a wide range of sorbents more or less sophisticated has been investigated for the last decade nano scale materials such metal oxides 14 metal oxide supported carbon nanofibers 15 carbon based sorbents 16 17 but also agriculture wastes 18 or derivatives of these agriculture resources 19 microbial biomass 20 seaweed sub products 21 or polysaccharides 22 conventional ion exchange and chelating resins have also received a great attention playing with the diversity of functional groups such as sulfonic acid groups 23 26 dual sulfonic phosphonic groups 27 and amine thiol groups 28 the selectivity performance may be enhanced by cadmium ion imprinting procedure 29 while the immobilization of extractant in porous supports combines the efficiency of solvent extraction systems and the retention capability and easy application modes of resins for improved extraction performance 30 32 tributyl phosphate has shown great affinity for cadmium recovery in solvent extraction processes 33 35 there is a strong research for substituting petro sourced supports with naturally occurring polymers for developing alternate sorbents chitosan alginate and cellulose have retained a great attention because of the presence of readily modifiable functional moieties such as amine carboxylic or hydroxyl groups in addition to their proper reactivity for metal ions through different mechanisms such as chelation or ion exchange 36 40 however alternative biopolymers recently gained increasing interest such as gums 41 among these natural gums extracted from plants microorganisms and trees gellan gum reveals very promising based on its ability to form stable blends with different types of polymers 42 43 gellan gum is an anionic polysaccharide constituted of d glucose units associated with l rhamnose and d glucuronic acid units d glc β1 4 d glca β1 4 d glc β1 4 l rha α1 3 n the presence of carboxylic groups naturally offers the possibility to bind metal ions for example the sorption capacity of gellan gum beads reach up to 0 62 mmol cd g 1 44 the biopolymer has been used for designing different composite sorbents associating for example synthetic polymers 45 48 graphene oxide 49 50 hereafter gellan gum geg is chemically modified by reaction of thiosemicarbazide through the crosslinking action of epichlorohydrin epi by ring opening polymerization 51 this functionalization geg c both improves the stability of the support cross linking and the immobilization of new reactive groups amine and thiocarbonyl groups for enhancing the binding of metal ions through different modes of interaction in a second step the geg c sorbent is functionalized with phosphate moieties through the grafting of a derivative of tributyl phosphate tbp which is obtained by reaction with phosphoric acid to form dibutylphosphate followed by the reaction with epichlorohydrin this reaction forms an activated phosphate compound dibutyl 3 chloro 2 hydroxy propyl phosphate dbchpp the final sorbent geg p is a multi functional sorbent bearing a high density of phosphate groups and completed with thiocarbonyl and amine groups the multi functionality has shown interesting properties for enhancing the sorption performances of resins by modulation of hydrophilic hydrophobic acid base conformational properties 52 or synergistic effects 53 the objective of the current work focuses on the comparison of sorption properties of geg c and geg p sorbents for the removal of cadmium from aqueous solutions is the chemical modification of increasing complexity improving significantly the sorption performances of the material in terms of sorption capacity isotherms kinetics of uptake ph range of activity stability and selectivity after characterizing the materials and their interactions with cadmium the sorption properties are first investigated in synthetic solutions mono component and multi metal solutions before applying the sorption process to industrial effluents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials

different when aic 2 2 5 application to real effluent the sorption properties of the two sorbents where tested on real mining effluents the sample was used after membrane filtration 1 2 μm pore size the actual ph of the solution was 5 83 sorption tests were performed at different ph values controlled with 0 1 1 m hcl solutions under fixed experimental conditions sd 1 5 g l 1 v 210 rpm contact time 24 h t 21 1 c after filtration and measurement of the equilibrium ph the residual concentrations were analyzed by icp aes for evaluation of sorption capacities for a series of metal ions including cadmium lead zinc copper aluminum and iron 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of sorbents 3 1 1 sem and sem edx analyses the sem observation of sorbent particles shows that the particles which were grinded are irregular with rounded edges appearing as agglomerates of particles and plate shaped objects fig s1 in the case of geg c the distribution of particle sizes shows two populations large particles 7 12 μm and small objects 1 8 μm after functionalization in geg p smaller particles are observed large majority of particles in the range 1 8 μm though some aggregates can be observed 12 25 μm the average values for geg c and geg p are close to 10 μm and 7 μm respectively 3 1 2 textural properties the adsorption and desorption isotherms of n2 for geg c and geg p sorbents are remarkably close superposed fig s2 this is confirmed by the evaluation of specific surface area indeed sbet values reach 56 8 m2 g 1 and 58 5 m2 g 1 respectively fig s2a these profiles are characterized by a long p p0 linear range with a slow slope up to p p0 0 8 at low sorbed volume i e 10 60 cm3 g 1 followed by a steep increase in the sorbed volume with a hysteresis loop this behavior can be associated with the type iv a isotherm 64 this kind of profile is usually associated with mesoporous materials having pore width relatively large wider than 4 nm and to capillary condensation mechanism in addition the hysteresis loop resembles the h1 loop described by thommes et al 64 meaning that pore size distribution is narrow it is noteworthy that high p p0 volume above 0 97 the isotherms show unexpected trend with a new sharp increase and a gap between adsorption and desorption branches the pore volume are also very close 0 94 cm3 g 1 for geg c and 1 03 cm3 g 1 for geg p sorbents the bjh analysis of pore size distribution gives pore width as large as 667 449 å values associated with the adsorption and desorption branches respectively for geg c and even higher as 725 486 å for geg p fig s2b shows the distributions of pore sizes with a narrow peak centered around 640 680 å this is consistent with the interpretation reported above i e narrow pore size distribution though thommes et al 64 reported much thinner pore size for systems characterized by h1 type hysteresis loops in the case of arginine modified bentonite incorporated in gellan gum abbasi and ikram 65 reported lower textural properties in terms of sbet values i e 14 m2 g 1 pore volume i e 0 04 cm3 g 1 and pore size i e 139 å in the case of gellan gum microspheres reinforced by carboxymethyl konjac glucomannan the sbet reached 21 5 m2 g 1 with pore size close to 44 5 å 66 3 1 3 thermogravimetric analysis fig s3 compares the profiles for the thermal degradation of the two polymers under n2 atmosphere this comparison may help in the confirmation of chemical modification of pristine sorbent but also in evaluating the strategies for thermal elimination of the sorbent at the end of its life cycle in the case of geg c sorbent two main steps are identified in terms of weight loss fig s3a a below 192 c geg c loses 16 essentially as release of adsorbed water b above 192 c up to 620 c the sorbent loses about 77 6 the weight loss in this second step is almost homogeneous with two weak shoulders that are evidenced by the dtg curve fig s3c and two main endothermic peaks at 335 8 c and 594 2 c a weaker shoulder appears at 478 4 c this may correspond to the depolymerization of the polymer the degradation of thiosemicarbazide the char formation before its degradation the final weight loss reaches up to 93 6 on the opposite hand for geg p the total weight loss does not exceed 81 fig s3a it is well known that the introduction of phosphorous based compounds in polymers contributes to reinforce their thermal stability 67 the profile of weight loss shows more marked thermal transitions indeed four steps can be identified three major endothermic peaks can be identified at 321 4 c 510 4 c and 729 6 c less marked fig s3b the change in the weight loss profile confirms the chemical modification of the pristine support geg c the phosphate groups increases the thermal stability of the functionalized sorbent as shown by both the increase in the residual mass at 800 c and the shift of the last degradation step toward higher temperatures pandey et al 45 compared the thermal degradation of gellan gum with that of gellan gum n n dimethylacrylamide copolymer after the loss of solvent water alcohol the gellan gum degraded in a single step at 237 c that begins at 102 c with a maximum rate of degradation at 256 6 c sharp endothermic peak on the opposite hand the grafted copolymer shows two steps of degradation with two maximum rates at 87 6 c and 227 6 c these critical temperatures are substantially lower than those found for both geg c and geg p sorbents meaning that the functionalization steps progressively increase sorbent stability at the end of their life cycle higher temperature will be necessary for achieving the thermal degradation of the sorbents 3 1 4 ftir spectroscopy fig 1 summarizes the ftir spectra of the two sorbents under different experimental conditions the sorbents as prepared the sorbents after being conditioned at the ph of metal sorption the sorbents after cd ii sorption and after recycling 5th cycle the sorption being operated at ph 5 meaning not drastic conditions the ftir spectrum of geg c is poorly modified and the differences potentially observed between raw sorbent and after cd ii will be directly assigned to their proper reactivity with the metal ions differences are more marked in the case of geg p in the region 4000 2000 cm 1 fig 1a b the spectra of geg c and geg p are substantially different in geg c a series of small bands in the range 3200 2800 cm 1 can be observed corresponding to νc h vibrations methoxy and methylene groups at 2856 2931 and 2985 cm 1 and νo h vibrations at 3036 and 3095 cm 1 completed by small indents at higher wavenumbers probably associated with νn h vibrations in the case of geg p the νc h vibrations are clearly identified at 2853 and 2921 cm 1 however the bands in the region above 3000 cm 1 are replaced with a broad and poorly resolved band centered around 3421 cm 1 resulting from superposition of contributions from νo h and νn h vibrations the band observed at 2520 cm 1 may be assigned to the tautomerization form of sulfone amine moiety several reasons may explain the differences in the profiles a the increase in the density of hydrocarbon groups obut b the tautomerization of po converted to p oh c the presence of oh brought by the grafted moiety and or d the hydrogen bond between po and the adjacent oh group the region 2000 400 cm 1 brings confirmation of the presence of typical reactive groups fig 1c d the glycosidic bond is detected at 1639 and 1621 cm 1 broader band in geg c and geg p respectively 68 for the two sorbents the band is broad and rounded by shoulders or small peaks this may be explained by the superposition of the contribution of amine vibrations including δn h and νc n vibrations 69 or imine vibration from thiosemicarbazide 70 the νc c vibrations here are observed at 1416 and 1419 cm 1 respectively this band is broad in the case of geg p probably due to the superposition of signals associated with the high density of propyl chains in the grafted organophosphate compound and more generally tbp characteristic band at 1464 cm 1 71 the bands at 1767 1734 and 1714 cm 1 are associated with carboxyl groups in geg 72 a series of bands are observed around 1000 cm 1 in geg c and in the range 850 700 cm 1 which may be assigned to νc o c vibrations 72 around 1000 cm 1 a very broad band is observed in the case of geg p this can be assigned to the superposition of the νp o c vibration 69 71 for both geg c and geg p the strong bands observed at 544 553 cm 1 and 565 574 cm 1 may be attributed to νn c s vibrations 70 the small band at 997 cm 1 in geg c νc s vibration is masked in the spectrum of geg p a new strong band appears at 875 cm 1 which can be assigned to c o band which is shifted due to the presence of new groups from the phosphorylating agent i e c o p and c o h after cd ii sorption strong changes are observed in the ftir spectra for both geg c and geg p sorbents hence for geg c the major changes concern the environment of carboxyl groups in the region 1800 1700 cm 1 the bands disappear the large band at 1639 cm 1 glycosidic ring and amine groups are shifted toward lower wavenumbers with thinner bands at 1572 cm 1 including a side band at 1595 cm 1 there are several significant changes in the region 1500 1350 cm 1 that are also shifted to lower wavenumbers the strong doublet at 565 544 cm 1 associated with thiocarbonyl group in thiosemicarbazide linking is drastically reduced after metal binding these different changes suggest that cd ii sorption affects the chemical environment of the different reactive groups present on the sorbent including carboxylate groups from geg amine and sulfur groups from thiosemicarbazide in the case of geg p it is noteworthy that the conditioning of the sorbent at the ph of sorption changes the environment of n bearing groups at 1621 cm 1 and also the broad and poorly resolved band at 1419 cm 1 where the superposed bands at 1570 1400 cm 1 are strongly reduced the deprotonation of these reactive groups affects more significantly the spectrum of geg p than in the case of geg c consistently with the difference in phpzc values see below however despite these significant variations due to sorbent conditioning at ph 5 the sorption of cadmium involves additional significant changes in the ftir spectrum with considerable decrease in intensity of the bands associated with carboxyl and amine groups in the region 1800 1300 cm 1 small residues appear at 1765 1742 shifted from 1793 and 1749 cm 1 and 1622 cm 1 the band at 1419 cm 1 with bands at 1386 and 1324 cm 1 better resolved with two clear bands at 1442 and 1384 cm 1 after being ph conditioned is replaced with a strong symmetric and broad band at 1383 cm 1 these changes are associated with the interaction of phosphate moieties with metal ion the broad band at 1034 cm 1 also assigned to phosphate moieties is also strongly reduced with a band centered around to 1011 cm 1 the intensities of the series of bands at 875 801 787 777 and 755 cm 1 are also considerably decreased with bands limited to 2 small peaks at 868 and 773 cm 1 and largest contribution at 829 cm 1 the 574 553 cm 1 doublet is replaced with a broad and less intense band shifted to 527 cm 1 consistently with geg c sorbent the functionalized sorbent mobilizes carboxylate and n bearing groups for cd ii binding however the phosphate reactive groups are also strongly engaged in metal sequestration the desorption of cadmium and the recycling of the sorbent for five successive cycles may affect the stability of the sorbent degradation and or protonation of reactive groups fig 1c d allows comparing the spectra of the recycled sorbent with the pristine sorbents in the case of geg c the spectrum is roughly restored although some changes can be identified especially in the region around 1639 cm 1 due to the probable protonation of n based sites and the shift of the strong peak at 1232 cm 1 to 1261 cm 1 as well as the quasi disappearance of the bands at 586 and 426 cm 1 this may be due to the protonation of groups associated with strong acidic condition in the desorption process for geg p the most significant changes are identified for a the broad band at 1419 cm 1 phosphate signal which is replaced with resolved bands at 1489 and 1412 cm 1 and b the broad band at 1161 1034 cm 1 including νp o c vibration which are replaced with two bands at 1111 and 1034 cm 1 at lower relative intensity for the second band in the case of functionalized sorbent the recycling of the sorbent clearly shows that the environment of phosphate groups are affected apparently these modifications hardly affect cd ii sorption performance see below section 3 2 5 3 1 5 elemental analysis and titration the elemental analysis of geg c and geg p sorbents is summarized in table s3 the presence of s element 0 97 w w or 0 3 mmol s g 1 confirms the reaction of thiosemicarbazide with gellan gum the global observation of the composition shows that the contents of n and h are hardly varied by the functionalization of geg c on the opposite hand the grafting of dbchpp is followed by a significant decrease in the relative contents of c from 36 88 to 31 69 mmol c g 1 and o from 28 44 to 24 35 mmol o g 1 elements despite the presence of long hydrocarbon chains i e 2 propyl groups and 3 o moieties in dbchpp obviously the clearer marker of chemical modification is given by p content phosphorus element appears in the functionalized material with a content of 12 44 w w corresponding to 4 02 mmol p g 1 in geg p it is noteworthy that chlorine appears in the sorbent at non negligible levels 0 085 and 0 181 mmol cl g 1 this may be attributed to the presence of impurities or incomplete substitution of dbchpp onto epi backbone based on the supposed structure of gellan gum equivalent molecular unit constituted of 2 β d glucose residues 1 β l rhamnose residue and 1 α d glucuronic acid residue and the analytical data it is possible calculating the approximate substitution yields a 0 054 0 066 mmole tscz per geg unit in geg c calculations made on s and n contents respectively and b about 0 72 mmol dbchpp per geg unit in geg p calculations made on p content fig s4 shows the titration of sorbents ph drift method for the determination of the ph of zero charge phpzc the thiosemicarbazide derivative of geg shows a phpzc value close to 6 26 this is strictly different than the behavior reported by fasolin et al 73 the zeta potential of gg remains negative in the ph 3 7 region consistently with their evaluation of the pka of low acyl gg close to 3 5 cassanelli et al 74 confirmed this trend with another electrophoretic mobility method the pkas values of the reactive groups on thiosemicarbazide range between 1 for the strongest acid group and 14 76 for the strongest basic group after grafting onto geg the amine groups i e 3 amine moieties on tscz contribute to partially neutralize the proper acidity of the biopolymer based on the low density of tscz in geg c this effect is relatively limited on the other hand after grafting the organophosphate substituent the phpzc shifts toward lower value 5 45 the organophosphate compounds such as mono and di butyl phosphate have acid pka values around 1 80 1 72 75 therefore the derivative of tbp grafted onto the sorbent shifts the phpzc of geg p toward slightly lower value the functionalization of geg c allows getting a sorbent negatively charged at lower ph this may have a weak impact on the electrostatic attraction of positively charged metal ions 3 2 sorption from synthetic solutions 3 2 1 ph effect the effect of the ph on cd ii sorption by geg c and geg p sorbents is presented in fig 2 at two temperatures i e t 21 1 c and t 50 1 c this figure shows that a the sorption capacity is negligible at ph0 1 and comparable for the two sorbents qeq 0 12 0 15 mmol cd g 1 b the sorption increases with the ph more steeply for geg p compared with geg c consistently with the acid base properties of the sorbents phpzc values c the sorption capacity tends to stabilize at pheq 5 d the functionalization of the geg c sorbent significantly increases sorption capacity from 0 78 mmol cd g 1 to 1 34 mmol cd g 1 72 e the increase in the temperature has opposite effects for the two sorbents cd ii sorption is exothermic for geg p while the sorption is endothermic in the case of geg c increasing the temperature minimizes the difference in sorption capacity 0 99 mmol cd g 1 for geg c and 1 23 mmol cd g 1 24 instead of 72 f further experiments will be performed at ph0 5 except for the study of selectivity issues to evaluate the possibility to increase the separation of cadmium from competitor ions on the basis of ph criterion in acidic solutions i e ph 1 the protonation of reactive groups limits the possibility to bind cadmium cations by electrostatic repulsion and competition of protons fig s5 shows the speciation diagram of cadmium under the experimental conditions of the study of ph effect cadmium cations predominant cdcl and free cd2 represent 81 5 of total cadmium the limited sorption capacity may be explained by the ion exchange of these cationic species with protons bound to reactive groups and or the chelation of neutral cdcl2 at ph 2 free cd2 begins to predominate and the sorption capacity increases especially for geg p the higher density of reactive groups due to the grafting of tbp derivative may explain this stronger increase this effect may be also reinforced by the impact of lower phpzc deprotonation of reactive groups is facilitated the increase in sorption capacity is almost linear for geg p between ph0 1 and 3 4 at both t 21 1 c and t 50 1 c at ph0 4 the sorption capacity continues to increase but moderately it is noteworthy that this ph frontier corresponds to the region where the distribution of cd ii between free cd2 and cdcl tends to stabilize around 87 and 13 respectively at ph 4 it is also noticeable that this ph region corresponds to the deprotonation of carboxylic groups and amine groups despite the favorable deprotonation conditions the sorption is not significantly enhanced the diminution in the competition of protons may help in binding cadmium cations through ion exchange with partially protonated reactive groups carboxylate and amine groups in both geg c and geg p and the chelation of the metal with phosphate moieties in the case of geg p under mild acidic conditions the tautomerization effect activates the thiocarbonyl groups with neighboring amines observed through the changes on ftir spectra which contribute to metal binding it is noteworthy that cadmium sorption is exothermic for geg p and endothermic for geg c in contrast mellah and benachour 76 reported that cadmium extraction by tbp in solvent extraction system is endothermic the inversion of the effect of temperature on the ph profile of cd ii sorption may be associated with opposite thermodynamic behavior of functional groups amine groups for geg c vs phosphate and thiocarbonyl groups for geg p in their interactions with cd ii complementary extensive study would be necessary for ascertaining this hypothesis fig s6 shows that the ph weakly varies during metal sorption at ph below 4 the equilibrium ph slightly increases reversely above ph 4 the ph tends to decrease at least for geg p less for geg c however the variations remain systematically below 0 5 ph unit contrary to other metal ion systems cadmium does not form hydrolyzed species below 0 2 on the whole investigated ph range therefore the contribution of the formation of these species with consumption of oh is negligible on the other hand the binding of protons at ph below 4 hardly changes the ph in fig s7 the log10 plot of the distribution ratio i e d l g 1 vs equilibrium ph does not show linear trends this plot is usually applied for the determination of the stoichiometric exchange ratio in ion exchange systems the non linearity supports the hypothesis of mixed mechanisms involving different modes of interactions such as chelation in addition to ion exchange 3 2 2 uptake kinetics the comparison of cd ii kinetic profiles in fig 3 confirms that the functionalization of geg c improves the sorption performance not only in terms of equilibrium lower residual concentration and consequently higher sorption capacity but also taking into account kinetic criterion indeed 30 min are sufficient for reaching the equilibrium with geg p while it is necessary extending the contact time up to 60 min for geg c the steepest initial slope of the curve for the functionalized material all other conditions being similar also demonstrates this enhanced kinetic behavior since the textural properties are very close for the two sorbents it is probable that the stronger affinity and greater density of the reactive groups for cadmium explains this faster sorption the diffusional restrictions are not playing the major role in the differentiation of the two sorbents in terms of kinetics the kinetics of sorption of may be controlled by different mechanisms of resistance to diffusion diffusion in the bulk of the solution through the film surrounding the particles or into the porous internal network 59 the kinetics may be also simulated with classical equations derived from the modeling of homogeneous chemical reactions i e pseudo first and pseudo second order rate equations table s1 the comparison of the models summarized in table 1 clearly shows that the pseudo first order rate equation pfore fits better experimental profiles for the two sorbents though the pfore gives higher statistical values for geg p sorbent in fig 3 the solid lines represent the superposition of fitted curves with experimental points while fig s8 shows the poorer fits of profiles with the psore and the ride models ride corresponds to resistance to intraparticle diffusion herein approached with the crank equation see table s1 it is noteworthy that the pfore allows closer determinations of the equilibrium sorption capacities compared with experimental values the qeq 1 overestimates the qeq exp by 6 for geg c and only 2 for geg p the faster sorption of cd ii using geg p is confirmed by the 2 45 fold increase of the apparent rate coefficient i e k1 with sorbent functionalization from 0 0381 to 0 0933 min 1 in the case of cadmium sorption onto chemically modified brown alga biomass 77 the psore gave little better modeling than the pfore the apparent rate coefficient k1 was lower 0 02 min 1 than herein in the case of electrospun peo chitosan nanofiber membranes the apparent rate coefficient was also slightly lower i e 0 028 min 1 than for geg c sorbent 78 jakόbik kolon et al 79 showed close fittings of kinetic profiles with pfore and psore while using a series of polysaccharide composites the k1 values varied between 0 013 and 0 032 min 1 these values are consistent with the value reported by maki and qasim 80 for cd ii sorption kinetics with koh activated peanut shells i e 0 024 min 1 in the case of magnetic chitosan microparticles functionalized with hydrazide hamza et al 81 reported k1 value i e 0 076 min 1 closer to the case of geg p though the ride resistance to intraparticle diffusion equation the so called crank equation does not fit kinetic profiles as well as pfore fig s8 the equation is used for approaching the effective diffusivity of cd ii into the sorbent i e de the diffusion coefficient is lower for geg p 0 45 10 13 m2 min 1 than for geg c 1 4 10 13 m2 min 1 the effective diffusivity is about 5 orders of magnitude lower than the free diffusivity of cd ii in water d0 4 31 10 8 m2 min 1 82 this gap in the diffusivity coefficients vs free diffusivity in water confirms that the resistance to intraparticle diffusion plays a significant part in the control of uptake kinetics the global kinetic is controlled by the resistance to intraparticle diffusion and the proper reaction rate of sorption 3 2 3 sorption isotherms the sorption isotherms represent the evolution of sorption capacity i e q eq with residual concentration i e c eq herein the sorption isotherms of geg c and geg p show differences in their profiles in the case of reference sorbent geg c the sorption capacity progressively and continuously increases with metal concentration apparently in the last section of the curve above ceq 3 mmol cd l 1 the sorbent is not saturated on the opposite hand the sorption isotherm for geg p shows a steep initial slope almost vertical corresponding to a quasi irreversible isotherm of the sorption capacity at residual concentration below 0 2 mmol cd l 1 followed by a progressive increase in sorption capacity that tends to a saturation plateau for ceq 2 5 mmol cd g 1 the effect of functionalization is also measured through the comparison of maximum experimental sorption capacity the sorption capacity increases by 1 74 fold after grafting tbp derivative cd ii is classified among the borderline metals 83 according to the hard and soft acid and base theory hsab 84 hard acid prefer reacting with hard bases and reciprocally soft metals with soft bases on the other side sulfhydryl sh and more generally sulfur based is part of soft bases amine groups and more generally n bearing ligands take place in the intermediary class while o bearing ligands such as carboxylate and phosphate groups are considered hard bases the increase in sorption capacities can be directly related with the enhanced density of reactive groups after functionalization the case of affinity coefficient which is proportional to the initial slope of the curve is more complex to discuss indeed the strong increase in the initial slope means that geg p has a strong affinity for cd ii however the new functional groups bearing o ligands i e hard base are supposed to show greater reactivity for hard metals than for intermediary metals such as cd ii apparently the increase in the density of reactive groups associated with p content 4 mmol p g 1 table s3 plays a major role in the enhancement of cd ii sorption rather than the proper affinity of reactive groups this conclusion can be modulated by the synergistic effect brought by the dual functionalities 53 table 2 summarizes the fits of sorption isotherms with a series of classical models which are reported in table s2 based on the profiles in fig 4 it is possible anticipating that geg c and geg p could follow different trends indeed geg p is characterized by a saturation plateau which makes the power type function of the freundlich equation inappropriate contrary to geg c characterized by an exponential trend actually the saturation is not reached in the concentration range this probably means that the distribution of experimental points forces the fit of experimental profile with the freundlich equation the freundlich equation supposes the sorption to occur in a multi layer mode with possible interactions between sorbed molecules with heterogeneous sorption energies the mechanistic langmuir equation is associated with homogeneous monolayer sorption without interactions between sorbed molecules this equation supposes an asymptotic trend which is consistent with the profile of geg p curve the langmuir equation fits better the curve than the freundlich equation the sips equation combines the langmuir and freundlich equations in the langmuir dual site equation the langmuir model is applied independently for two different sorption sites having different sorption capacities and affinity coefficients the temkin model assumes a uniform distribution of heterogeneous sorption sites and a binding energy that varies linearly with surface coverage 61 the dubinin radushkevich equation was developed for describing sorption at the surface of microporous sorbents micropore volume fitting processing through layer by layer adsorption on pore walls 62 several works alerted on the debatable appropriateness of interpreting binding mechanisms on the basis of mathematical fits of experimental profiles many of these misinterpretations are related to the wrong extension of the gas solid equation original concept to liquid solid systems hence hu et al 85 suggest using only these equations for comparative and predictive target considering both r2 and aic statistical criteria table 2 shows that the preferential fits follow different trends for the two sorbents geg c d r sips lds freundlich langmuir temkin geg p temkin langmuir sips d r lds freundlich in fig 4 the experimental profiles are fitted with the sips and the langmuir dual site equations as the closer models for combined geg c and geg p sorbents alternative fits are reported in fig s9 in order to compare cd ii sorption properties of geg c and geg p with other sorbents the parameters of the langmuir equation are used in table s4 because widely referred to in the literature the sorption performances can be compared based on different criteria the ph selected for optimum binding the required time for reaching equilibrium the maximum sorption capacity and the affinity coefficient sorption tests are performed in most cases between ph 4 and ph 7 meaning mild acidic or neutral conditions a biosorbent trichoderma atrobrunneum shows high sorption capacity 3 07 mmol cd g 1 however the interest is limited by slow kinetics requiring up to 7 days of contact for reaching the equilibrium 86 geg p shows excellent sorption characteristics for cd ii comparable to the best sorbents such as c 150 sulfonic resin 87 amberlite ir 120 sulfonic resin 88 3 d sulfonated reduced graphene oxide 89 nitrilotriacetic acid magnetic prussian blue 90 or mnfe2o4 graphene oxide 91 sorption capacities range between 2 and 2 5 mmol cd g 1 with equilibrium times below 180 min the affinity coefficient of geg p are comparable to those of these outstanding sorbents except for nitrilotriacetic acid magnetic prussian blue 90 or mnfe2o4 graphene oxide 91 that show bl coefficients about 6 fold higher than the value of geg p however taking into account the combination of the different criteria geg p can be considered a highly competitive and promising sorbent 3 2 4 sorption mechanisms the ftir analysis the sorbents exposed to cd ii solutions have confirmed the modification of the chemical environment of carboxyl amine and thiocarbonyl groups in the case of geg c at ph0 5 where cd2 predominates in addition to 12 of cdcl the interactions probably involve electrostatic attraction of cadmium cations free cd2 onto carboxylate sites free groups ion exchange mechanism between cd2 or cdcl and some protonated amine groups and chelation mechanism between amine and thiocarbonyl groups with cadmium ions in the case of geg p the ftir analysis also showed the modification of the signals associated with phosphate moieties from tbp derivative this chemical modification also shifted the phpzc of the sorbent toward lower value meaning that more amine groups are potentially deprotonated modulating the contribution of ion exchange and chelation contributions in addition to the mechanisms involved in cd ii binding onto gec c cadmium can be also chelated onto phosphate moieties as reported in the comparison of ph effect for geg c and geg p in section 3 1 5 the differences in the phpzc values lead for a given ph that the surface of the functionalized sorbent is more negatively charged than for geg c this results in a stronger binding of cadmium scheme 2 illustrates the different mechanisms involved in metal binding 3 2 5 metal desorption and sorbent recycling another important criterion in the evaluation of a new sorbent concerns a the ability to eluate bound metal and b the capacity to recycle the sorbent though some complexing agent such as 0 1 m edta solution have been tested for cd ii desorption from saturated biosorbent such as chitosan κ carrageenan composite 92 acidic solutions are most frequently used for commercial resins taha et al 93 used 1 m acid solutions with limited effect of the type of acid in the case of bio sourced sorbents simple or composite moderate acid solutions 0 1 0 5 m were preferred using either nitric acid solutions 94 95 or hydrochloric acid solutions 81 96 97 apart the literature information the strong reduction in sorption capacity observed at low ph is another incentive for using an acid solution hereafter 0 3 m hcl solution is used for the desorption of cd ii from metal loaded sorbents fig s10 compares the kinetics of desorption for cd ii loaded geg c and geg p sorbents loaded samples collected from the study of uptake kinetics the desorption kinetics are comparable for the two sorbents though cadmium tends to be released lightly faster for geg p material in any case total desorption is achieved in 30 min jakobik kolon et al 94 also reached quantitative desorption of cd ii from pectin guar gum sorbent using 0 25 m hno3 solution based on these results 0 3 m hcl solution was selected for testing the recycling of the sorbent demineralized water solutions were used between each step for rinsing the sorbent to remove both absorbed cadmium solution and hcl solution table 3 compares the sorption and desorption performances for five successive cycles of reuse metal desorption remains effective and complete for the five cycles on the other hand a weak decrease in sorption efficiency is observed at recycling in the case of geg c the loss in sorption efficiency between the first and the fifth step reaches about 4 6 this is detectable but relatively limited this is consistent with the stability observed in the ftir spectrum section 3 1 4 where the spectra are compared for raw sorbent and recycled material it is noteworthy that in the case of geg p the loss at the fifth cycle does not exceed 1 8 the functionalization of the material notably increases the stability in sorption performance in the case of nano composite magnetic attapulgite functionalized with chitosan and edta wang et al 97 reported a decrease in the sorption efficiency of about 10 from 98 9 to 88 7 at the fifth cycle the grafting of tbp derivative onto geg c allows reinforcing the stability in sorption performance during sorbent recycling combined with the other enhancement on sorption capacities and uptake kinetics this result confirms the promising perspectives opened by this material 3 2 6 selectivity sorption from multi component solutions the selectivity for specific metal ions is another key criterion in the design of new sorbents the grafting of new reactive groups with specific reactivity their steric and cooperative arrangement for accommodating chelation sphere may contribute to change the preference of the sorbent for different metal families based on softness ion size charge electronegativity and so on 98 for both geg c and geg p cadmium is preferentially sorbed against the other metal ions as shown in fig 5 where the selectivity coefficient sccd metal is plotted for different ph values in most cases the selectivity increases with the ph it is noteworthy that at the lowest ph value i e pheq 2 2 the selectivity for cd ii is lost especially for geg p where apparently the sorbent binds preferentially the other metal cations the protonation of reactive groups exhibits lower effect on their sorption than on cd ii uptake on the reverse side when the ph increases the progressive deprotonation increases the preference of geg c for cd ii this effect is sharply marked between pheq 2 14 and pheq 4 17 while above the effects tends to stabilize it is noteworthy that the sorbents have similar responses in terms of selectivity for cd ii fig 5 and pb ii fig s11 though the sorbents have marked preference for cd ii over pb ii these metal ions showed much larger differences against other competitor metals this behavior can be correlated with their hsab ranking nieboer and richardson 83 displayed the distribution of the metal ions according their position in the plot covalent index ci χ2 r where χ is the pauling electronegativity and r the radius of hydrated ion vs ionic index ii z2 r where z is the formal charge of the metal ion lead ii and cadmium ii are located in the upper part of the borderline metal ions while zinc ii and iron iii are closer from the frontier with class a metals hard acids other competitor ions i e al iii mg ii ca ii and na i are classified among the hard metal ions according hsab principle 84 hard acids react preferentially with hard bases following the ligand scale o n s for soft acids class b the preference is reversed s n o the discussion is more complex for borderline elements the interpretation is made complex by the variations induced by ph changes hence in mildly acidic conditions a borderline metal ion binds to o bearing ligand such as carboxylate moiety preferentially to amine groups while these amine groups require to be deprotonated higher ph close to neutral for actively binding the borderline metal ion 83 considering the highest sc values in the ph0 range 4 the metal ions can be ranked in terms of increasing preference for cd ii according the series 2 for geg c ph 0 5 pb ii fe iii mg ii al iii zn ii na i ca ii 3 for geg p ph 0 4 pb ii mg ii fe iii na i al iii ca ii zn ii in the case of dowex ag50w x8 sulfonate bearing resin strongly acidic cation exchange resin 99 the selectivity order followed the series 4 na i mn ii mg ii fe iii cd ii zn ii cu ii ca ii al iii the selectivity may be modulated by the ph through different mechanisms associated with metal speciation formation of hydrolyzed species and with the deprotonation of reactive groups amine phosphate carboxylic groups which in turn may vary the relative contributions of different binding mechanisms chelation vs ion exchange 100 with the deprotonation of the reactive groups the chelation mechanisms are stimulated bringing differentiated affinity for target metals based on hsab principles alexandratos and zhu 52 discussed the selectivity of a series of monophosphorylated polymer supported reagents for divalent and trivalent cations in the case of divalent cations they showed that the distribution ratios are linearly correlated with the misono softness parameter 101 meaning that the metal ions form dative π bonds with the ligand single site interaction in the current study these trends were not respected this is probably due to the interaction of vicinal reactive groups that interfere on the polarizability properties of phosphate moieties more specifically they consider that divalent cations may bind to the polarizable phosphoryl oxygen 101 while the greater charge of trivalent metal ions brings closer the solute to phosphoryl oxygen which in turn allows binding the trivalent cations with both the phosphate and oh moieties elsayed et al 102 documented the synthesis of ion imprinted sorbents based on thiosemicarbazide salicylic acid cd ii complex immobilized in resorcinol formaldehyde resin the ion imprinting drastically increased the distribution ratio for cd ii up to 612 l g 1 at ph 6 and the selectivity coefficient sccd metal was multiplied by a factor 20 22 compared to non imprinted resin against metal ions with close valence and ionic size pb ii cu ii zn ii and ni ii the imprinting strategy was also applied by murat et al 103 for enhancing by a factor 3 3 3 9 the selectivity of maleic acid co acrylonitrile sorbent for cd ii against pb ii mn ii ni ii and cu ii hu et al 104 synthesized aerogels with self assembly nanosheets made of salecan a water soluble anionic extracellular glucan and graphene oxide for the sorption of cd ii the sorbent showed preference for cd ii against a series of transition metals the distribution ratio did not exceed 0 63 l g 1 remaining greater than for 5 co ii ni ii zn ii cu ii hg ii pb ii fe iii however both the extraction and selectivity for cd ii were considerably increased after ion imprinting the selectivity ratio increased up to 6 4 l g 1 and the sccd metal value was increased by 13 fold to 84 fold fig s12 plots the log10 plot of the distribution ratio vs pheq for the two sorbents and selected metal ions as reported above the increase of the ph increases the distribution ratios up to pheq 4 2 5 before stabilizing the distinct behavior of cd ii and pb ii is clearly highlighted by this plot the gap between these two metal ions especially cd ii and other competitor elements is drastically increased with the functionalization of the sorbent phosphate moieties from tbp derivative these rankings can be visualized in fig s13 ci vs ii plot frame the size of the bubbles for the distinct elements is proportional to the distribution ratio normalized against cadmium as the most favorably sorbed metal the preference of the sorbents for cd ii and pb ii means that their reactive groups have higher affinity for borderline elements with higher ci values geg p shows much lower affinity for the hard metals such as na i ca ii and mg ii despite the presence of hard base reactive groups brought by tbp derivative this contrasts with the lower selectivity of geg c for the hard acids considering fe iii and al iii trivalent metal ions located at the interface between borderline and hard acids the trends are comparable to the observations made with hard metals the distribution ratios are also substantially decreased in the case of geg p compared with geg c the case of zn ii ranked among borderline elements close to cd ii also shows much lower relative distribution ratio in the case of geg p the trends in eq 2 and eq 3 regarding zn ii ranking clearly demonstrate that this metal ion leaves the expected projections this is consistent with the restrictions introduced by the irving willians series 105 zn ii remains out of the trend table s5 summarizes the conditions especially ph for optimizing the separation of cd ii from the specific competitor metals for the two sorbent in addition the enhancement factor in the selectivity due to the functionalization of the sorbent is reported for these optimized conditions the full plot of the enhancement factor of selectivity coefficient sccd metal is reported in fig s14 for the different ph0 values the cumulative sorption capacities are summarized in fig s15 the trends on ph edge curves are consistent with the profiles reported in fig 2 mono component cd ii solutions at ph around 5 the cumulative sorption capacities are close to 1 32 mmol g 1 and 2 02 mmol g 1 for geg c and geg p sorbents respectively 53 increase in cumulative sorption capacity after functionalization vs 74 with mono component cd ii solutions these values are systematically lower by 17 5 27 6 than the maximum experimental values obtained from sorption isotherms at ph0 5 fig 4 and table 2 1 60 and 2 79 mmol cd g 1 respectively the presence of competitor metal ions reduces the global sorption capacity of the sorbents this means that the antagonistic effect of competitor metal ions decreases the global sorption potential 3 3 application to real effluent the composition of the mining effluent is reported in table 4 cadmium and lead are present at low level around 1 mg l 1 while the concentration of other base metals i e copper zinc iron and aluminum ranges between 9 and 28 mg l 1 these levels are much lower than for calcium about 216 mg l 1 and more specifically sodium 2 g l 1 this means that competitor ions are in large excess compared to the most toxic elements cadmium and lead from about 15 fold for iron and copper 40 fold for aluminum and zinc and up to 520 fold for calcium and 8576 fold for sodium after contact with geg c under optimal ph selection i e ph0 5 83 the residual concentrations are strongly decreased for heavy metals with sorption efficiencies ranging between 27 and 32 for al and zn 46 49 for cd and pb and around 81 for cu and fe sorption of calcium and sodium remains below 17 these levels of sorption efficiency are controlled by the affinity of the sorbent for the metal ions but this effect is also strongly affected by the impact of initial concentrations the concentration factor cf l g 1 can be ranked according 6 fe cu cd pb zn al ca na the comparison of residual concentrations with maximum concentration levels for drinking water 1 shows that the experimental conditions are not appropriate for the removal of the heavy metals for copper the residual concentration is close to target values the excess levels reach values as high as 200 times for cd and 105 times for pb this test with complex solution clearly shows that geg c cannot be used at given sorbent dose i e 1 5 g l 1 for decontaminating the effluent the functionalization of the material with tbp derivative strongly changes the treatment pattern the residual concentrations are drastically reduced 8 9 μg l 1 for cd and pb 0 11 0 57 mg l 1 for fe and al and 1 2 3 mg l 1 for cu and zn this is confirmed by the sorption efficiencies that are systematically higher than 88 5 for heavy metals and up to 99 2 for lead and cadmium on the opposite hand the functionalization does not significantly affect the removal of sodium and calcium this is positive for the selective separation of target hazardous metal ions from alkaline and alkaline earth metals the concentration factors for heavy metals are systematically increased following the order 7 cd pb fe al zn cu ca na with geg p the residual concentrations are compatible with drinking water regulations in the case of copper zinc iron however for cadmium lead and aluminum the residual concentrations remain about 1 5 to 3 times higher than imposed by regulations for drinking water the treatment of the effluent with geg p under selected experimental conditions allows reaching the levels required for irrigation water as defined by fao except for copper and zinc 106 in table 4 the comparison of the cfs for geg c and geg p allows calculating the enhancement factor brought in the removal of target metals by the functionalization of the pristine sorbent the enhancement effect decreases according the order fig s16 8 al zn pb cd ca fe cu na fig s17 compares the selectivity coefficients sccd metal in function of ph for geg c and geg p sorbents applied to the treatment of mining effluent in most cases the selectivity for target metal increases with the ph due to the deprotonation of reactive groups at the surface of the sorbents the concentration levels of the metals with large excess of na and ca2 may explain that the sc values based on the relevant distribution ratio which is strongly influenced by initial metal concentration for calcium and sodium are much higher than for heavy metals it is noteworthy that the functionalized sorbent exhibits considerably high sccd metal values against calcium about 489 and sodium at 1806 at the most favorable ph i e ph0 5 89 9 for geg c na 9 6 ca 4 6 al 3 0 zn 2 0 pb cd 1 0 1 1 cu fe 0 24 0 0 10 for gegp na 1806 ca 489 cu zn 16 7 16 0 al 6 6 fe 1 6 pb 1 1 it is noteworthy that the beneficial effect of the grafting of tbp derivative cannot be directly correlated with the ranking of the metals within hard intermediary and soft classes hence the major impact appears for aluminum member of class a hard acids while the lowest effect is also observed for another member of hard acid metals i e sodium for the other heavy metal ions the ranking in the enhancement factor does not follow clear trends against hydration enthalpy g0 hydr kcal mol 1 ionic index ii covalent index ci or softness σ 82 fig s18 in the cases of the plots against the hydration enthalpy and the ionic index the metal ions can be grouped first in function of their valence within ii group the respective ranking between the different metal ions cannot be correlated with specific physico chemical criteria nor the positioning in the nieboer and richardson frame 83 fig s17 4 conclusion the reaction of gellan gum with thiosemicarbazide in the presence of epichlorohydrin allows synthesizing a sorbent geg c bearing carboxyl amine and thiocarbonyl groups which can be involved in cadmium binding sorption properties are modulated by the ph of the solution based on their deprotonation for metal chelation or through ion exchange properties with labile protons however the grafting of a derivative of tributylphosphate dbchpp allows considerably enhancing sorption properties of the functionalized material geg p metal sorption occurs fastly the sorption capacity and the affinity coefficient are both increased after chemical modification the maximum sorption capacity of geg p sorbent close to 2 79 mmol cd g 1 classifies the sorbent as one of the most efficient sorbents for this metal ion based on the study of ph effect at two temperatures the sorption of cadmium is endothermic for geg c while it becomes exothermic for functionalized sorbent although the two materials are completely desorbed using 0 3 m hcl solution the desorption kinetics is slightly faster for geg p sorbent the recycling negligibly affects the stability of sorption performances the loss in sorption properties decreases from 4 6 to 1 8 at the fifth cycle this improvement in sorption properties is also noticeable when comparing the selectivity coefficient for cd ii against other competitor ions this is observed with both equimolar multicomponent solutions and real mining effluent despite the huge excess of competitor metal ions the multifunctionality of the functionalized sorbent contributes to outstanding sorption properties for cadmium removal from aqueous solutions this study shows the promising fundamental properties of this sorbent multi functional gellan gum derivative for the recovery of cadmium from diluted effluents obviously the conditioning of the material directly issued from gellan gum powder is not appropriate for large scale application indeed the micron size of sorbent particles precludes the use of this material in fixed bed columns due to head loss pressure and blockage in stirred tank reactor the solid liquid separation would be also hindered by the micron sized particles several possibilities exist for overpassing these difficulties a aggregating these particles to reach a size facilitating solid liquid separation with probably some limitations in mass transfer end uptake kinetics or b designing gellan gum as spherical beads which would be further functionalized 107 109 declaration of competing interest the authors declare

12401,two sorbents are successfully synthesized based on the chemical modification of gellan gum gg first thiosemicarbazide is grafted onto gg to produce geg c in a second step geg c is functionalized with a derivative of tributyl phosphate dtbp giving geg p sorbent the sorption properties are compared for recovery of cd ii from aqueous solutions geg c is expected to bind cd ii through carboxylic amine and thiocarbonyl groups while phosphate groups in geg p contribute to increase metal sorption the chemical modification improves not only the uptake kinetics equilibrium time 30 min vs 45 min but also the sorption capacities 2 79 vs 1 60 mmol cd g 1 at optimum ph i e ph 5 the functionalization also improves a the sorbent stability weaker reduction of the loss in sorption efficiency after five cycles of reuse compared with geg c and b the sorption selectivity in the presence of competitor ions from equimolar multicomponent solutions especially at ph 4 different sorption mechanisms may be involved depending on the ph deprotonation of reactive groups including chelation onto deprotonated amine and phosphonate groups and ion exchange protonated groups with metal cations cadmium sorption is reversed by contact with 0 3 m hcl solution the functionalization geg p strongly increases the selectivity coefficient for cd ii against major elements in mining effluent especially at ph higher than 5 these results confirm the interest of multifunctionality in the development of new sorbents based on renewable resources such as gellan gum graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords

the anthropogenic activities as well as the effects of erosion or weathering may cause strong contamination of water bodies by metal contamination with direct impact on plants and agriculture water drinking quality and in fine on the health of living beings animals and humans cadmium is part of these hazardous contaminants for example due to its long half life in human body about 10 35 years 1 it may have strong impact on health hence cadmium is recognized as a potential carcinogenic vector especially by inhalation however the kidney is the main target organ for cadmium toxicity 2 4 the world health organization set the guideline value for cadmium to 3 μg l 1 in drinking water 1 up to recently 80 of used cadmium concerned the sector of batteries nickel cadmium batteries 5 this part tends to decrease to face the hazardous impacts of battery discharge to the environment being replaced with nickel metal hydride batteries for similar reasons the use of cadmium in pigments and cathodic tubes strongly decreased however some sectors such as electroplate steel and corrosion protected metal pieces alloying uses solar cells plastic stabilizers and nuclear industry as atomic fission controller still use cadmium 6 this makes cadmium a widely used hazardous metal the removal of cadmium is thus of critical importance for minimizing environmental and health impacts both in terms of industrial discharges end of pipe and drinking water supply the target of the current study focuses on the treatment of industrial waste flows processed water leachates in the treatment of weee waste from electrical and electronic equipment and batteries metal removal from mining effluents etc rather than drinking water application for the treatment of non trace cd bearing effluents several techniques can be scanned 7 including specific precipitation sequence 8 phosphate based precipitation 9 or sulfide precipitation 10 solvent extraction is also frequently used for purifying phosphoric acid solutions or removing cadmium from concentrated complex effluents 7 11 13 however for less concentrated effluents the use of sorption processes is usually preferred a wide range of sorbents more or less sophisticated has been investigated for the last decade nano scale materials such metal oxides 14 metal oxide supported carbon nanofibers 15 carbon based sorbents 16 17 but also agriculture wastes 18 or derivatives of these agriculture resources 19 microbial biomass 20 seaweed sub products 21 or polysaccharides 22 conventional ion exchange and chelating resins have also received a great attention playing with the diversity of functional groups such as sulfonic acid groups 23 26 dual sulfonic phosphonic groups 27 and amine thiol groups 28 the selectivity performance may be enhanced by cadmium ion imprinting procedure 29 while the immobilization of extractant in porous supports combines the efficiency of solvent extraction systems and the retention capability and easy application modes of resins for improved extraction performance 30 32 tributyl phosphate has shown great affinity for cadmium recovery in solvent extraction processes 33 35 there is a strong research for substituting petro sourced supports with naturally occurring polymers for developing alternate sorbents chitosan alginate and cellulose have retained a great attention because of the presence of readily modifiable functional moieties such as amine carboxylic or hydroxyl groups in addition to their proper reactivity for metal ions through different mechanisms such as chelation or ion exchange 36 40 however alternative biopolymers recently gained increasing interest such as gums 41 among these natural gums extracted from plants microorganisms and trees gellan gum reveals very promising based on its ability to form stable blends with different types of polymers 42 43 gellan gum is an anionic polysaccharide constituted of d glucose units associated with l rhamnose and d glucuronic acid units d glc β1 4 d glca β1 4 d glc β1 4 l rha α1 3 n the presence of carboxylic groups naturally offers the possibility to bind metal ions for example the sorption capacity of gellan gum beads reach up to 0 62 mmol cd g 1 44 the biopolymer has been used for designing different composite sorbents associating for example synthetic polymers 45 48 graphene oxide 49 50 hereafter gellan gum geg is chemically modified by reaction of thiosemicarbazide through the crosslinking action of epichlorohydrin epi by ring opening polymerization 51 this functionalization geg c both improves the stability of the support cross linking and the immobilization of new reactive groups amine and thiocarbonyl groups for enhancing the binding of metal ions through different modes of interaction in a second step the geg c sorbent is functionalized with phosphate moieties through the grafting of a derivative of tributyl phosphate tbp which is obtained by reaction with phosphoric acid to form dibutylphosphate followed by the reaction with epichlorohydrin this reaction forms an activated phosphate compound dibutyl 3 chloro 2 hydroxy propyl phosphate dbchpp the final sorbent geg p is a multi functional sorbent bearing a high density of phosphate groups and completed with thiocarbonyl and amine groups the multi functionality has shown interesting properties for enhancing the sorption performances of resins by modulation of hydrophilic hydrophobic acid base conformational properties 52 or synergistic effects 53 the objective of the current work focuses on the comparison of sorption properties of geg c and geg p sorbents for the removal of cadmium from aqueous solutions is the chemical modification of increasing complexity improving significantly the sorption performances of the material in terms of sorption capacity isotherms kinetics of uptake ph range of activity stability and selectivity after characterizing the materials and their interactions with cadmium the sorption properties are first investigated in synthetic solutions mono component and multi metal solutions before applying the sorption process to industrial effluents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials

including cadmium lead zinc copper aluminum and iron 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of sorbents 3 1 1 sem and sem edx analyses the sem observation of sorbent particles shows that the particles which were grinded are irregular with rounded edges appearing as agglomerates of particles and plate shaped objects fig s1 in the case of geg c the distribution of particle sizes shows two populations large particles 7 12 μm and small objects 1 8 μm after functionalization in geg p smaller particles are observed large majority of particles in the range 1 8 μm though some aggregates can be observed 12 25 μm the average values for geg c and geg p are close to 10 μm and 7 μm respectively 3 1 2 textural properties the adsorption and desorption isotherms of n2 for geg c and geg p sorbents are remarkably close superposed fig s2 this is confirmed by the evaluation of specific surface area indeed sbet values reach 56 8 m2 g 1 and 58 5 m2 g 1 respectively fig s2a these profiles are characterized by a long p p0 linear range with a slow slope up to p p0 0 8 at low sorbed volume i e 10 60 cm3 g 1 followed by a steep increase in the sorbed volume with a hysteresis loop this behavior can be associated with the type iv a isotherm 64 this kind of profile is usually associated with mesoporous materials having pore width relatively large wider than 4 nm and to capillary condensation mechanism in addition the hysteresis loop resembles the h1 loop described by thommes et al 64 meaning that pore size distribution is narrow it is noteworthy that high p p0 volume above 0 97 the isotherms show unexpected trend with a new sharp increase and a gap between adsorption and desorption branches the pore volume are also very close 0 94 cm3 g 1 for geg c and 1 03 cm3 g 1 for geg p sorbents the bjh analysis of pore size distribution gives pore width as large as 667 449 å values associated with the adsorption and desorption branches respectively for geg c and even higher as 725 486 å for geg p fig s2b shows the distributions of pore sizes with a narrow peak centered around 640 680 å this is consistent with the interpretation reported above i e narrow pore size distribution though thommes et al 64 reported much thinner pore size for systems characterized by h1 type hysteresis loops in the case of arginine modified bentonite incorporated in gellan gum abbasi and ikram 65 reported lower textural properties in terms of sbet values i e 14 m2 g 1 pore volume i e 0 04 cm3 g 1 and pore size i e 139 å in the case of gellan gum microspheres reinforced by carboxymethyl konjac glucomannan the sbet reached 21 5 m2 g 1 with pore size close to 44 5 å 66 3 1 3 thermogravimetric analysis fig s3 compares the profiles for the thermal degradation of the two polymers under n2 atmosphere this comparison may help in the confirmation of chemical modification of pristine sorbent but also in evaluating the strategies for thermal elimination of the sorbent at the end of its life cycle in the case of geg c sorbent two main steps are identified in terms of weight loss fig s3a a below 192 c geg c loses 16 essentially as release of adsorbed water b above 192 c up to 620 c the sorbent loses about 77 6 the weight loss in this second step is almost homogeneous with two weak shoulders that are evidenced by the dtg curve fig s3c and two main endothermic peaks at 335 8 c and 594 2 c a weaker shoulder appears at 478 4 c this may correspond to the depolymerization of the polymer the degradation of thiosemicarbazide the char formation before its degradation the final weight loss reaches up to 93 6 on the opposite hand for geg p the total weight loss does not exceed 81 fig s3a it is well known that the introduction of phosphorous based compounds in polymers contributes to reinforce their thermal stability 67 the profile of weight loss shows more marked thermal transitions indeed four steps can be identified three major endothermic peaks can be identified at 321 4 c 510 4 c and 729 6 c less marked fig s3b the change in the weight loss profile confirms the chemical modification of the pristine support geg c the phosphate groups increases the thermal stability of the functionalized sorbent as shown by both the increase in the residual mass at 800 c and the shift of the last degradation step toward higher temperatures pandey et al 45 compared the thermal degradation of gellan gum with that of gellan gum n n dimethylacrylamide copolymer after the loss of solvent water alcohol the gellan gum degraded in a single step at 237 c that begins at 102 c with a maximum rate of degradation at 256 6 c sharp endothermic peak on the opposite hand the grafted copolymer shows two steps of degradation with two maximum rates at 87 6 c and 227 6 c these critical temperatures are substantially lower than those found for both geg c and geg p sorbents meaning that the functionalization steps progressively increase sorbent stability at the end of their life cycle higher temperature will be necessary for achieving the thermal degradation of the sorbents 3 1 4 ftir spectroscopy fig 1 summarizes the ftir spectra of the two sorbents under different experimental conditions the sorbents as prepared the sorbents after being conditioned at the ph of metal sorption the sorbents after cd ii sorption and after recycling 5th cycle the sorption being operated at ph 5 meaning not drastic conditions the ftir spectrum of geg c is poorly modified and the differences potentially observed between raw sorbent and after cd ii will be directly assigned to their proper reactivity with the metal ions differences are more marked in the case of geg p in the region 4000 2000 cm 1 fig 1a b the spectra of geg c and geg p are substantially different in geg c a series of small bands in the range 3200 2800 cm 1 can be observed corresponding to νc h vibrations methoxy and methylene groups at 2856 2931 and 2985 cm 1 and νo h vibrations at 3036 and 3095 cm 1 completed by small indents at higher wavenumbers probably associated with νn h vibrations in the case of geg p the νc h vibrations are clearly identified at 2853 and 2921 cm 1 however the bands in the region above 3000 cm 1 are replaced with a broad and poorly resolved band centered around 3421 cm 1 resulting from superposition of contributions from νo h and νn h vibrations the band observed at 2520 cm 1 may be assigned to the tautomerization form of sulfone amine moiety several reasons may explain the differences in the profiles a the increase in the density of hydrocarbon groups obut b the tautomerization of po converted to p oh c the presence of oh brought by the grafted moiety and or d the hydrogen bond between po and the adjacent oh group the region 2000 400 cm 1 brings confirmation of the presence of typical reactive groups fig 1c d the glycosidic bond is detected at 1639 and 1621 cm 1 broader band in geg c and geg p respectively 68 for the two sorbents the band is broad and rounded by shoulders or small peaks this may be explained by the superposition of the contribution of amine vibrations including δn h and νc n vibrations 69 or imine vibration from thiosemicarbazide 70 the νc c vibrations here are observed at 1416 and 1419 cm 1 respectively this band is broad in the case of geg p probably due to the superposition of signals associated with the high density of propyl chains in the grafted organophosphate compound and more generally tbp characteristic band at 1464 cm 1 71 the bands at 1767 1734 and 1714 cm 1 are associated with carboxyl groups in geg 72 a series of bands are observed around 1000 cm 1 in geg c and in the range 850 700 cm 1 which may be assigned to νc o c vibrations 72 around 1000 cm 1 a very broad band is observed in the case of geg p this can be assigned to the superposition of the νp o c vibration 69 71 for both geg c and geg p the strong bands observed at 544 553 cm 1 and 565 574 cm 1 may be attributed to νn c s vibrations 70 the small band at 997 cm 1 in geg c νc s vibration is masked in the spectrum of geg p a new strong band appears at 875 cm 1 which can be assigned to c o band which is shifted due to the presence of new groups from the phosphorylating agent i e c o p and c o h after cd ii sorption strong changes are observed in the ftir spectra for both geg c and geg p sorbents hence for geg c the major changes concern the environment of carboxyl groups in the region 1800 1700 cm 1 the bands disappear the large band at 1639 cm 1 glycosidic ring and amine groups are shifted toward lower wavenumbers with thinner bands at 1572 cm 1 including a side band at 1595 cm 1 there are several significant changes in the region 1500 1350 cm 1 that are also shifted to lower wavenumbers the strong doublet at 565 544 cm 1 associated with thiocarbonyl group in thiosemicarbazide linking is drastically reduced after metal binding these different changes suggest that cd ii sorption affects the chemical environment of the different reactive groups present on the sorbent including carboxylate groups from geg amine and sulfur groups from thiosemicarbazide in the case of geg p it is noteworthy that the conditioning of the sorbent at the ph of sorption changes the environment of n bearing groups at 1621 cm 1 and also the broad and poorly resolved band at 1419 cm 1 where the superposed bands at 1570 1400 cm 1 are strongly reduced the deprotonation of these reactive groups affects more significantly the spectrum of geg p than in the case of geg c consistently with the difference in phpzc values see below however despite these significant variations due to sorbent conditioning at ph 5 the sorption of cadmium involves additional significant changes in the ftir spectrum with considerable decrease in intensity of the bands associated with carboxyl and amine groups in the region 1800 1300 cm 1 small residues appear at 1765 1742 shifted from 1793 and 1749 cm 1 and 1622 cm 1 the band at 1419 cm 1 with bands at 1386 and 1324 cm 1 better resolved with two clear bands at 1442 and 1384 cm 1 after being ph conditioned is replaced with a strong symmetric and broad band at 1383 cm 1 these changes are associated with the interaction of phosphate moieties with metal ion the broad band at 1034 cm 1 also assigned to phosphate moieties is also strongly reduced with a band centered around to 1011 cm 1 the intensities of the series of bands at 875 801 787 777 and 755 cm 1 are also considerably decreased with bands limited to 2 small peaks at 868 and 773 cm 1 and largest contribution at 829 cm 1 the 574 553 cm 1 doublet is replaced with a broad and less intense band shifted to 527 cm 1 consistently with geg c sorbent the functionalized sorbent mobilizes carboxylate and n bearing groups for cd ii binding however the phosphate reactive groups are also strongly engaged in metal sequestration the desorption of cadmium and the recycling of the sorbent for five successive cycles may affect the stability of the sorbent degradation and or protonation of reactive groups fig 1c d allows comparing the spectra of the recycled sorbent with the pristine sorbents in the case of geg c the spectrum is roughly restored although some changes can be identified especially in the region around 1639 cm 1 due to the probable protonation of n based sites and the shift of the strong peak at 1232 cm 1 to 1261 cm 1 as well as the quasi disappearance of the bands at 586 and 426 cm 1 this may be due to the protonation of groups associated with strong acidic condition in the desorption process for geg p the most significant changes are identified for a the broad band at 1419 cm 1 phosphate signal which is replaced with resolved bands at 1489 and 1412 cm 1 and b the broad band at 1161 1034 cm 1 including νp o c vibration which are replaced with two bands at 1111 and 1034 cm 1 at lower relative intensity for the second band in the case of functionalized sorbent the recycling of the sorbent clearly shows that the environment of phosphate groups are affected apparently these modifications hardly affect cd ii sorption performance see below section 3 2 5 3 1 5 elemental analysis and titration the elemental analysis of geg c and geg p sorbents is summarized in table s3 the presence of s element 0 97 w w or 0 3 mmol s g 1 confirms the reaction of thiosemicarbazide with gellan gum the global observation of the composition shows that the contents of n and h are hardly varied by the functionalization of geg c on the opposite hand the grafting of dbchpp is followed by a significant decrease in the relative contents of c from 36 88 to 31 69 mmol c g 1 and o from 28 44 to 24 35 mmol o g 1 elements despite the presence of long hydrocarbon chains i e 2 propyl groups and 3 o moieties in dbchpp obviously the clearer marker of chemical modification is given by p content phosphorus element appears in the functionalized material with a content of 12 44 w w corresponding to 4 02 mmol p g 1 in geg p it is noteworthy that chlorine appears in the sorbent at non negligible levels 0 085 and 0 181 mmol cl g 1 this may be attributed to the presence of impurities or incomplete substitution of dbchpp onto epi backbone based on the supposed structure of gellan gum equivalent molecular unit constituted of 2 β d glucose residues 1 β l rhamnose residue and 1 α d glucuronic acid residue and the analytical data it is possible calculating the approximate substitution yields a 0 054 0 066 mmole tscz per geg unit in geg c calculations made on s and n contents respectively and b about 0 72 mmol dbchpp per geg unit in geg p calculations made on p content fig s4 shows the titration of sorbents ph drift method for the determination of the ph of zero charge phpzc the thiosemicarbazide derivative of geg shows a phpzc value close to 6 26 this is strictly different than the behavior reported by fasolin et al 73 the zeta potential of gg remains negative in the ph 3 7 region consistently with their evaluation of the pka of low acyl gg close to 3 5 cassanelli et al 74 confirmed this trend with another electrophoretic mobility method the pkas values of the reactive groups on thiosemicarbazide range between 1 for the strongest acid group and 14 76 for the strongest basic group after grafting onto geg the amine groups i e 3 amine moieties on tscz contribute to partially neutralize the proper acidity of the biopolymer based on the low density of tscz in geg c this effect is relatively limited on the other hand after grafting the organophosphate substituent the phpzc shifts toward lower value 5 45 the organophosphate compounds such as mono and di butyl phosphate have acid pka values around 1 80 1 72 75 therefore the derivative of tbp grafted onto the sorbent shifts the phpzc of geg p toward slightly lower value the functionalization of geg c allows getting a sorbent negatively charged at lower ph this may have a weak impact on the electrostatic attraction of positively charged metal ions 3 2 sorption from synthetic solutions 3 2 1 ph effect the effect of the ph on cd ii sorption by geg c and geg p sorbents is presented in fig 2 at two temperatures i e t 21 1 c and t 50 1 c this figure shows that a the sorption capacity is negligible at ph0 1 and comparable for the two sorbents qeq 0 12 0 15 mmol cd g 1 b the sorption increases with the ph more steeply for geg p compared with geg c consistently with the acid base properties of the sorbents phpzc values c the sorption capacity tends to stabilize at pheq 5 d the functionalization of the geg c sorbent significantly increases sorption capacity from 0 78 mmol cd g 1 to 1 34 mmol cd g 1 72 e the increase in the temperature has opposite effects for the two sorbents cd ii sorption is exothermic for geg p while the sorption is endothermic in the case of geg c increasing the temperature minimizes the difference in sorption capacity 0 99 mmol cd g 1 for geg c and 1 23 mmol cd g 1 24 instead of 72 f further experiments will be performed at ph0 5 except for the study of selectivity issues to evaluate the possibility to increase the separation of cadmium from competitor ions on the basis of ph criterion in acidic solutions i e ph 1 the protonation of reactive groups limits the possibility to bind cadmium cations by electrostatic repulsion and competition of protons fig s5 shows the speciation diagram of cadmium under the experimental conditions of the study of ph effect cadmium cations predominant cdcl and free cd2 represent 81 5 of total cadmium the limited sorption capacity may be explained by the ion exchange of these cationic species with protons bound to reactive groups and or the chelation of neutral cdcl2 at ph 2 free cd2 begins to predominate and the sorption capacity increases especially for geg p the higher density of reactive groups due to the grafting of tbp derivative may explain this stronger increase this effect may be also reinforced by the impact of lower phpzc deprotonation of reactive groups is facilitated the increase in sorption capacity is almost linear for geg p between ph0 1 and 3 4 at both t 21 1 c and t 50 1 c at ph0 4 the sorption capacity continues to increase but moderately it is noteworthy that this ph frontier corresponds to the region where the distribution of cd ii between free cd2 and cdcl tends to stabilize around 87 and 13 respectively at ph 4 it is also noticeable that this ph region corresponds to the deprotonation of carboxylic groups and amine groups despite the favorable deprotonation conditions the sorption is not significantly enhanced the diminution in the competition of protons may help in binding cadmium cations through ion exchange with partially protonated reactive groups carboxylate and amine groups in both geg c and geg p and the chelation of the metal with phosphate moieties in the case of geg p under mild acidic conditions the tautomerization effect activates the thiocarbonyl groups with neighboring amines observed through the changes on ftir spectra which contribute to metal binding it is noteworthy that cadmium sorption is exothermic for geg p and endothermic for geg c in contrast mellah and benachour 76 reported that cadmium extraction by tbp in solvent extraction system is endothermic the inversion of the effect of temperature on the ph profile of cd ii sorption may be associated with opposite thermodynamic behavior of functional groups amine groups for geg c vs phosphate and thiocarbonyl groups for geg p in their interactions with cd ii complementary extensive study would be necessary for ascertaining this hypothesis fig s6 shows that the ph weakly varies during metal sorption at ph below 4 the equilibrium ph slightly increases reversely above ph 4 the ph tends to decrease at least for geg p less for geg c however the variations remain systematically below 0 5 ph unit contrary to other metal ion systems cadmium does not form hydrolyzed species below 0 2 on the whole investigated ph range therefore the contribution of the formation of these species with consumption of oh is negligible on the other hand the binding of protons at ph below 4 hardly changes the ph in fig s7 the log10 plot of the distribution ratio i e d l g 1 vs equilibrium ph does not show linear trends this plot is usually applied for the determination of the stoichiometric exchange ratio in ion exchange systems the non linearity supports the hypothesis of mixed mechanisms involving different modes of interactions such as chelation in addition to ion exchange 3 2 2 uptake kinetics the comparison of cd ii kinetic profiles in fig 3 confirms that the functionalization of geg c improves the sorption performance not only in terms of equilibrium lower residual concentration and consequently higher sorption capacity but also taking into account kinetic criterion indeed 30 min are sufficient for reaching the equilibrium with geg p while it is necessary extending the contact time up to 60 min for geg c the steepest initial slope of the curve for the functionalized material all other conditions being similar also demonstrates this enhanced kinetic behavior since the textural properties are very close for the two sorbents it is probable that the stronger affinity and greater density of the reactive groups for cadmium explains this faster sorption the diffusional restrictions are not playing the major role in the differentiation of the two sorbents in terms of kinetics the kinetics of sorption of may be controlled by different mechanisms of resistance to diffusion diffusion in the bulk of the solution through the film surrounding the particles or into the porous internal network 59 the kinetics may be also simulated with classical equations derived from the modeling of homogeneous chemical reactions i e pseudo first and pseudo second order rate equations table s1 the comparison of the models summarized in table 1 clearly shows that the pseudo first order rate equation pfore fits better experimental profiles for the two sorbents though the pfore gives higher statistical values for geg p sorbent in fig 3 the solid lines represent the superposition of fitted curves with experimental points while fig s8 shows the poorer fits of profiles with the psore and the ride models ride corresponds to resistance to intraparticle diffusion herein approached with the crank equation see table s1 it is noteworthy that the pfore allows closer determinations of the equilibrium sorption capacities compared with experimental values the qeq 1 overestimates the qeq exp by 6 for geg c and only 2 for geg p the faster sorption of cd ii using geg p is confirmed by the 2 45 fold increase of the apparent rate coefficient i e k1 with sorbent functionalization from 0 0381 to 0 0933 min 1 in the case of cadmium sorption onto chemically modified brown alga biomass 77 the psore gave little better modeling than the pfore the apparent rate coefficient k1 was lower 0 02 min 1 than herein in the case of electrospun peo chitosan nanofiber membranes the apparent rate coefficient was also slightly lower i e 0 028 min 1 than for geg c sorbent 78 jakόbik kolon et al 79 showed close fittings of kinetic profiles with pfore and psore while using a series of polysaccharide composites the k1 values varied between 0 013 and 0 032 min 1 these values are consistent with the value reported by maki and qasim 80 for cd ii sorption kinetics with koh activated peanut shells i e 0 024 min 1 in the case of magnetic chitosan microparticles functionalized with hydrazide hamza et al 81 reported k1 value i e 0 076 min 1 closer to the case of geg p though the ride resistance to intraparticle diffusion equation the so called crank equation does not fit kinetic profiles as well as pfore fig s8 the equation is used for approaching the effective diffusivity of cd ii into the sorbent i e de the diffusion coefficient is lower for geg p 0 45 10 13 m2 min 1 than for geg c 1 4 10 13 m2 min 1 the effective diffusivity is about 5 orders of magnitude lower than the free diffusivity of cd ii in water d0 4 31 10 8 m2 min 1 82 this gap in the diffusivity coefficients vs free diffusivity in water confirms that the resistance to intraparticle diffusion plays a significant part in the control of uptake kinetics the global kinetic is controlled by the resistance to intraparticle diffusion and the proper reaction rate of sorption 3 2 3 sorption isotherms the sorption isotherms represent the evolution of sorption capacity i e q eq with residual concentration i e c eq herein the sorption isotherms of geg c and geg p show differences in their profiles in the case of reference sorbent geg c the sorption capacity progressively and continuously increases with metal concentration apparently in the last section of the curve above ceq 3 mmol cd l 1 the sorbent is not saturated on the opposite hand the sorption isotherm for geg p shows a steep initial slope almost vertical corresponding to a quasi irreversible isotherm of the sorption capacity at residual concentration below 0 2 mmol cd l 1 followed by a progressive increase in sorption capacity that tends to a saturation plateau for ceq 2 5 mmol cd g 1 the effect of functionalization is also measured through the comparison of maximum experimental sorption capacity the sorption capacity increases by 1 74 fold after grafting tbp derivative cd ii is classified among the borderline metals 83 according to the hard and soft acid and base theory hsab 84 hard acid prefer reacting with hard bases and reciprocally soft metals with soft bases on the other side sulfhydryl sh and more generally sulfur based is part of soft bases amine groups and more generally n bearing ligands take place in the intermediary class while o bearing ligands such as carboxylate and phosphate groups are considered hard bases the increase in sorption capacities can be directly related with the enhanced density of reactive groups after functionalization the case of affinity coefficient which is proportional to the initial slope of the curve is more complex to discuss indeed the strong increase in the initial slope means that geg p has a strong affinity for cd ii however the new functional groups bearing o ligands i e hard base are supposed to show greater reactivity for hard metals than for intermediary metals such as cd ii apparently the increase in the density of reactive groups associated with p content 4 mmol p g 1 table s3 plays a major role in the enhancement of cd ii sorption rather than the proper affinity of reactive groups this conclusion can be modulated by the synergistic effect brought by the dual functionalities 53 table 2 summarizes the fits of sorption isotherms with a series of classical models which are reported in table s2 based on the profiles in fig 4 it is possible anticipating that geg c and geg p could follow different trends indeed geg p is characterized by a saturation plateau which makes the power type function of the freundlich equation inappropriate contrary to geg c characterized by an exponential trend actually the saturation is not reached in the concentration range this probably means that the distribution of experimental points forces the fit of experimental profile with the freundlich equation the freundlich equation supposes the sorption to occur in a multi layer mode with possible interactions between sorbed molecules with heterogeneous sorption energies the mechanistic langmuir equation is associated with homogeneous monolayer sorption without interactions between sorbed molecules this equation supposes an asymptotic trend which is consistent with the profile of geg p curve the langmuir equation fits better the curve than the freundlich equation the sips equation combines the langmuir and freundlich equations in the langmuir dual site equation the langmuir model is applied independently for two different sorption sites having different sorption capacities and affinity coefficients the temkin model assumes a uniform distribution of heterogeneous sorption sites and a binding energy that varies linearly with surface coverage 61 the dubinin radushkevich equation was developed for describing sorption at the surface of microporous sorbents micropore volume fitting processing through layer by layer adsorption on pore walls 62 several works alerted on the debatable appropriateness of interpreting binding mechanisms on the basis of mathematical fits of experimental profiles many of these misinterpretations are related to the wrong extension of the gas solid equation original concept to liquid solid systems hence hu et al 85 suggest using only these equations for comparative and predictive target considering both r2 and aic statistical criteria table 2 shows that the preferential fits follow different trends for the two sorbents geg c d r sips lds freundlich langmuir temkin geg p temkin langmuir sips d r lds freundlich in fig 4 the experimental profiles are fitted with the sips and the langmuir dual site equations as the closer models for combined geg c and geg p sorbents alternative fits are reported in fig s9 in order to compare cd ii sorption properties of geg c and geg p with other sorbents the parameters of the langmuir equation are used in table s4 because widely referred to in the literature the sorption performances can be compared based on different criteria the ph selected for optimum binding the required time for reaching equilibrium the maximum sorption capacity and the affinity coefficient sorption tests are performed in most cases between ph 4 and ph 7 meaning mild acidic or neutral conditions a biosorbent trichoderma atrobrunneum shows high sorption capacity 3 07 mmol cd g 1 however the interest is limited by slow kinetics requiring up to 7 days of contact for reaching the equilibrium 86 geg p shows excellent sorption characteristics for cd ii comparable to the best sorbents such as c 150 sulfonic resin 87 amberlite ir 120 sulfonic resin 88 3 d sulfonated reduced graphene oxide 89 nitrilotriacetic acid magnetic prussian blue 90 or mnfe2o4 graphene oxide 91 sorption capacities range between 2 and 2 5 mmol cd g 1 with equilibrium times below 180 min the affinity coefficient of geg p are comparable to those of these outstanding sorbents except for nitrilotriacetic acid magnetic prussian blue 90 or mnfe2o4 graphene oxide 91 that show bl coefficients about 6 fold higher than the value of geg p however taking into account the combination of the different criteria geg p can be considered a highly competitive and promising sorbent 3 2 4 sorption mechanisms the ftir analysis the sorbents exposed to cd ii solutions have confirmed the modification of the chemical environment of carboxyl amine and thiocarbonyl groups in the case of geg c at ph0 5 where cd2 predominates in addition to 12 of cdcl the interactions probably involve electrostatic attraction of cadmium cations free cd2 onto carboxylate sites free groups ion exchange mechanism between cd2 or cdcl and some protonated amine groups and chelation mechanism between amine and thiocarbonyl groups with cadmium ions in the case of geg p the ftir analysis also showed the modification of the signals associated with phosphate moieties from tbp derivative this chemical modification also shifted the phpzc of the sorbent toward lower value meaning that more amine groups are potentially deprotonated modulating the contribution of ion exchange and chelation contributions in addition to the mechanisms involved in cd ii binding onto gec c cadmium can be also chelated onto phosphate moieties as reported in the comparison of ph effect for geg c and geg p in section 3 1 5 the differences in the phpzc values lead for a given ph that the surface of the functionalized sorbent is more negatively charged than for geg c this results in a stronger binding of cadmium scheme 2 illustrates the different mechanisms involved in metal binding 3 2 5 metal desorption and sorbent recycling another important criterion in the evaluation of a new sorbent concerns a the ability to eluate bound metal and b the capacity to recycle the sorbent though some complexing agent such as 0 1 m edta solution have been tested for cd ii desorption from saturated biosorbent such as chitosan κ carrageenan composite 92 acidic solutions are most frequently used for commercial resins taha et al 93 used 1 m acid solutions with limited effect of the type of acid in the case of bio sourced sorbents simple or composite moderate acid solutions 0 1 0 5 m were preferred using either nitric acid solutions 94 95 or hydrochloric acid solutions 81 96 97 apart the literature information the strong reduction in sorption capacity observed at low ph is another incentive for using an acid solution hereafter 0 3 m hcl solution is used for the desorption of cd ii from metal loaded sorbents fig s10 compares the kinetics of desorption for cd ii loaded geg c and geg p sorbents loaded samples collected from the study of uptake kinetics the desorption kinetics are comparable for the two sorbents though cadmium tends to be released lightly faster for geg p material in any case total desorption is achieved in 30 min jakobik kolon et al 94 also reached quantitative desorption of cd ii from pectin guar gum sorbent using 0 25 m hno3 solution based on these results 0 3 m hcl solution was selected for testing the recycling of the sorbent demineralized water solutions were used between each step for rinsing the sorbent to remove both absorbed cadmium solution and hcl solution table 3 compares the sorption and desorption performances for five successive cycles of reuse metal desorption remains effective and complete for the five cycles on the other hand a weak decrease in sorption efficiency is observed at recycling in the case of geg c the loss in sorption efficiency between the first and the fifth step reaches about 4 6 this is detectable but relatively limited this is consistent with the stability observed in the ftir spectrum section 3 1 4 where the spectra are compared for raw sorbent and recycled material it is noteworthy that in the case of geg p the loss at the fifth cycle does not exceed 1 8 the functionalization of the material notably increases the stability in sorption performance in the case of nano composite magnetic attapulgite functionalized with chitosan and edta wang et al 97 reported a decrease in the sorption efficiency of about 10 from 98 9 to 88 7 at the fifth cycle the grafting of tbp derivative onto geg c allows reinforcing the stability in sorption performance during sorbent recycling combined with the other enhancement on sorption capacities and uptake kinetics this result confirms the promising perspectives opened by this material 3 2 6 selectivity sorption from multi component solutions the selectivity for specific metal ions is another key criterion in the design of new sorbents the grafting of new reactive groups with specific reactivity their steric and cooperative arrangement for accommodating chelation sphere may contribute to change the preference of the sorbent for different metal families based on softness ion size charge electronegativity and so on 98 for both geg c and geg p cadmium is preferentially sorbed against the other metal ions as shown in fig 5 where the selectivity coefficient sccd metal is plotted for different ph values in most cases the selectivity increases with the ph it is noteworthy that at the lowest ph value i e pheq 2 2 the selectivity for cd ii is lost especially for geg p where apparently the sorbent binds preferentially the other metal cations the protonation of reactive groups exhibits lower effect on their sorption than on cd ii uptake on the reverse side when the ph increases the progressive deprotonation increases the preference of geg c for cd ii this effect is sharply marked between pheq 2 14 and pheq 4 17 while above the effects tends to stabilize it is noteworthy that the sorbents have similar responses in terms of selectivity for cd ii fig 5 and pb ii fig s11 though the sorbents have marked preference for cd ii over pb ii these metal ions showed much larger differences against other competitor metals this behavior can be correlated with their hsab ranking nieboer and richardson 83 displayed the distribution of the metal ions according their position in the plot covalent index ci χ2 r where χ is the pauling electronegativity and r the radius of hydrated ion vs ionic index ii z2 r where z is the formal charge of the metal ion lead ii and cadmium ii are located in the upper part of the borderline metal ions while zinc ii and iron iii are closer from the frontier with class a metals hard acids other competitor ions i e al iii mg ii ca ii and na i are classified among the hard metal ions according hsab principle 84 hard acids react preferentially with hard bases following the ligand scale o n s for soft acids class b the preference is reversed s n o the discussion is more complex for borderline elements the interpretation is made complex by the variations induced by ph changes hence in mildly acidic conditions a borderline metal ion binds to o bearing ligand such as carboxylate moiety preferentially to amine groups while these amine groups require to be deprotonated higher ph close to neutral for actively binding the borderline metal ion 83 considering the highest sc values in the ph0 range 4 the metal ions can be ranked in terms of increasing preference for cd ii according the series 2 for geg c ph 0 5 pb ii fe iii mg ii al iii zn ii na i ca ii 3 for geg p ph 0 4 pb ii mg ii fe iii na i al iii ca ii zn ii in the case of dowex ag50w x8 sulfonate bearing resin strongly acidic cation exchange resin 99 the selectivity order followed the series 4 na i mn ii mg ii fe iii cd ii zn ii cu ii ca ii al iii the selectivity may be modulated by the ph through different mechanisms associated with metal speciation formation of hydrolyzed species and with the deprotonation of reactive groups amine phosphate carboxylic groups which in turn may vary the relative contributions of different binding mechanisms chelation vs ion exchange 100 with the deprotonation of the reactive groups the chelation mechanisms are stimulated bringing differentiated affinity for target metals based on hsab principles alexandratos and zhu 52 discussed the selectivity of a series of monophosphorylated polymer supported reagents for divalent and trivalent cations in the case of divalent cations they showed that the distribution ratios are linearly correlated with the misono softness parameter 101 meaning that the metal ions form dative π bonds with the ligand single site interaction in the current study these trends were not respected this is probably due to the interaction of vicinal reactive groups that interfere on the polarizability properties of phosphate moieties more specifically they consider that divalent cations may bind to the polarizable phosphoryl oxygen 101 while the greater charge of trivalent metal ions brings closer the solute to phosphoryl oxygen which in turn allows binding the trivalent cations with both the phosphate and oh moieties elsayed et al 102 documented the synthesis of ion imprinted sorbents based on thiosemicarbazide salicylic acid cd ii complex immobilized in resorcinol formaldehyde resin the ion imprinting drastically increased the distribution ratio for cd ii up to 612 l g 1 at ph 6 and the selectivity coefficient sccd metal was multiplied by a factor 20 22 compared to non imprinted resin against metal ions with close valence and ionic size pb ii cu ii zn ii and ni ii the imprinting strategy was also applied by murat et al 103 for enhancing by a factor 3 3 3 9 the selectivity of maleic acid co acrylonitrile sorbent for cd ii against pb ii mn ii ni ii and cu ii hu et al 104 synthesized aerogels with self assembly nanosheets made of salecan a water soluble anionic extracellular glucan and graphene oxide for the sorption of cd ii the sorbent showed preference for cd ii against a series of transition metals the distribution ratio did not exceed 0 63 l g 1 remaining greater than for 5 co ii ni ii zn ii cu ii hg ii pb ii fe iii however both the extraction and selectivity for cd ii were considerably increased after ion imprinting the selectivity ratio increased up to 6 4 l g 1 and the sccd metal value was increased by 13 fold to 84 fold fig s12 plots the log10 plot of the distribution ratio vs pheq for the two sorbents and selected metal ions as reported above the increase of the ph increases the distribution ratios up to pheq 4 2 5 before stabilizing the distinct behavior of cd ii and pb ii is clearly highlighted by this plot the gap between these two metal ions especially cd ii and other competitor elements is drastically increased with the functionalization of the sorbent phosphate moieties from tbp derivative these rankings can be visualized in fig s13 ci vs ii plot frame the size of the bubbles for the distinct elements is proportional to the distribution ratio normalized against cadmium as the most favorably sorbed metal the preference of the sorbents for cd ii and pb ii means that their reactive groups have higher affinity for borderline elements with higher ci values geg p shows much lower affinity for the hard metals such as na i ca ii and mg ii despite the presence of hard base reactive groups brought by tbp derivative this contrasts with the lower selectivity of geg c for the hard acids considering fe iii and al iii trivalent metal ions located at the interface between borderline and hard acids the trends are comparable to the observations made with hard metals the distribution ratios are also substantially decreased in the case of geg p compared with geg c the case of zn ii ranked among borderline elements close to cd ii also shows much lower relative distribution ratio in the case of geg p the trends in eq 2 and eq 3 regarding zn ii ranking clearly demonstrate that this metal ion leaves the expected projections this is consistent with the restrictions introduced by the irving willians series 105 zn ii remains out of the trend table s5 summarizes the conditions especially ph for optimizing the separation of cd ii from the specific competitor metals for the two sorbent in addition the enhancement factor in the selectivity due to the functionalization of the sorbent is reported for these optimized conditions the full plot of the enhancement factor of selectivity coefficient sccd metal is reported in fig s14 for the different ph0 values the cumulative sorption capacities are summarized in fig s15 the trends on ph edge curves are consistent with the profiles reported in fig 2 mono component cd ii solutions at ph around 5 the cumulative sorption capacities are close to 1 32 mmol g 1 and 2 02 mmol g 1 for geg c and geg p sorbents respectively 53 increase in cumulative sorption capacity after functionalization vs 74 with mono component cd ii solutions these values are systematically lower by 17 5 27 6 than the maximum experimental values obtained from sorption isotherms at ph0 5 fig 4 and table 2 1 60 and 2 79 mmol cd g 1 respectively the presence of competitor metal ions reduces the global sorption capacity of the sorbents this means that the antagonistic effect of competitor metal ions decreases the global sorption potential 3 3 application to real effluent the composition of the mining effluent is reported in table 4 cadmium and lead are present at low level around 1 mg l 1 while the concentration of other base metals i e copper zinc iron and aluminum ranges between 9 and 28 mg l 1 these levels are much lower than for calcium about 216 mg l 1 and more specifically sodium 2 g l 1 this means that competitor ions are in large excess compared to the most toxic elements cadmium and lead from about 15 fold for iron and copper 40 fold for aluminum and zinc and up to 520 fold for calcium and 8576 fold for sodium after contact with geg c under optimal ph selection i e ph0 5 83 the residual concentrations are strongly decreased for heavy metals with sorption efficiencies ranging between 27 and 32 for al and zn 46 49 for cd and pb and around 81 for cu and fe sorption of calcium and sodium remains below 17 these levels of sorption efficiency are controlled by the affinity of the sorbent for the metal ions but this effect is also strongly affected by the impact of initial concentrations the concentration factor cf l g 1 can be ranked according 6 fe cu cd pb zn al ca na the comparison of residual concentrations with maximum concentration levels for drinking water 1 shows that the experimental conditions are not appropriate for the removal of the heavy metals for copper the residual concentration is close to target values the excess levels reach values as high as 200 times for cd and 105 times for pb this test with complex solution clearly shows that geg c cannot be used at given sorbent dose i e 1 5 g l 1 for decontaminating the effluent the functionalization of the material with tbp derivative strongly changes the treatment pattern the residual concentrations are drastically reduced 8 9 μg l 1 for cd and pb 0 11 0 57 mg l 1 for fe and al and 1 2 3 mg l 1 for cu and zn this is confirmed by the sorption efficiencies that are systematically higher than 88 5 for heavy metals and up to 99 2 for lead and cadmium on the opposite hand the functionalization does not significantly affect the removal of sodium and calcium this is positive for the selective separation of target hazardous metal ions from alkaline and alkaline earth metals the concentration factors for heavy metals are systematically increased following the order 7 cd pb fe al zn cu ca na with geg p the residual concentrations are compatible with drinking water regulations in the case of copper zinc iron however for cadmium lead and aluminum the residual concentrations remain about 1 5 to 3 times higher than imposed by regulations for drinking water the treatment of the effluent with geg p under selected experimental conditions allows reaching the levels required for irrigation water as defined by fao except for copper and zinc 106 in table 4 the comparison of the cfs for geg c and geg p allows calculating the enhancement factor brought in the removal of target metals by the functionalization of the pristine sorbent the enhancement effect decreases according the order fig s16 8 al zn pb cd ca fe cu na fig s17 compares the selectivity coefficients sccd metal in function of ph for geg c and geg p sorbents applied to the treatment of mining effluent in most cases the selectivity for target metal increases with the ph due to the deprotonation of reactive groups at the surface of the sorbents the concentration levels of the metals with large excess of na and ca2 may explain that the sc values based on the relevant distribution ratio which is strongly influenced by initial metal concentration for calcium and sodium are much higher than for heavy metals it is noteworthy that the functionalized sorbent exhibits considerably high sccd metal values against calcium about 489 and sodium at 1806 at the most favorable ph i e ph0 5 89 9 for geg c na 9 6 ca 4 6 al 3 0 zn 2 0 pb cd 1 0 1 1 cu fe 0 24 0 0 10 for gegp na 1806 ca 489 cu zn 16 7 16 0 al 6 6 fe 1 6 pb 1 1 it is noteworthy that the beneficial effect of the grafting of tbp derivative cannot be directly correlated with the ranking of the metals within hard intermediary and soft classes hence the major impact appears for aluminum member of class a hard acids while the lowest effect is also observed for another member of hard acid metals i e sodium for the other heavy metal ions the ranking in the enhancement factor does not follow clear trends against hydration enthalpy g0 hydr kcal mol 1 ionic index ii covalent index ci or softness σ 82 fig s18 in the cases of the plots against the hydration enthalpy and the ionic index the metal ions can be grouped first in function of their valence within ii group the respective ranking between the different metal ions cannot be correlated with specific physico chemical criteria nor the positioning in the nieboer and richardson frame 83 fig s17 4 conclusion the reaction of gellan gum with thiosemicarbazide in the presence of epichlorohydrin allows synthesizing a sorbent geg c bearing carboxyl amine and thiocarbonyl groups which can be involved in cadmium binding sorption properties are modulated by the ph of the solution based on their deprotonation for metal chelation or through ion exchange properties with labile protons however the grafting of a derivative of tributylphosphate dbchpp allows considerably enhancing sorption properties of the functionalized material geg p metal sorption occurs fastly the sorption capacity and the affinity coefficient are both increased after chemical modification the maximum sorption capacity of geg p sorbent close to 2 79 mmol cd g 1 classifies the sorbent as one of the most efficient sorbents for this metal ion based on the study of ph effect at two temperatures the sorption of cadmium is endothermic for geg c while it becomes exothermic for functionalized sorbent although the two materials are completely desorbed using 0 3 m hcl solution the desorption kinetics is slightly faster for geg p sorbent the recycling negligibly affects the stability of sorption performances the loss in sorption properties decreases from 4 6 to 1 8 at the fifth cycle this improvement in sorption properties is also noticeable when comparing the selectivity coefficient for cd ii against other competitor ions this is observed with both equimolar multicomponent solutions and real mining effluent despite the huge excess of competitor metal ions the multifunctionality of the functionalized sorbent contributes to outstanding sorption properties for cadmium removal from aqueous solutions this study shows the promising fundamental properties of this sorbent multi functional gellan gum derivative for the recovery of cadmium from diluted effluents obviously the conditioning of the material directly issued from gellan gum powder is not appropriate for large scale application indeed the micron size of sorbent particles precludes the use of this material in fixed bed columns due to head loss pressure and blockage in stirred tank reactor the solid liquid separation would be also hindered by the micron sized particles several possibilities exist for overpassing these difficulties a aggregating these particles to reach a size facilitating solid liquid separation with probably some limitations in mass transfer end uptake kinetics or b designing gellan gum as spherical beads which would be further functionalized 107 109 declaration of competing interest the authors declare

12402,the application of nanofiltration nf membrane with positive charge on the surface in the separation of lithium magnesium is a convenient energy saving and sustainable strategy in this work polyethyleneimine pei was introduced into the composite nf membrane through two methods to investigate and make a comparation in surface morphology and properties application in the separation of membrane to li and mg2 respectively both pei and pip were involved in the preparation of membranes as aqueous monomers which can reduce the cross linking degree of active layer but reduce the electronegativity of membrane surface the rejection of mg2 reached 98 1 and the purity of li which is the mass fraction of li in cations of permeate reached 62 respectively the separation factor sli mg reached 32 6 by contrast pei with different molecular weight and concentration was grafted on the pa layer which improved the density of membrane but reduced the electronegativity of the membrane surface the rejection of mg2 reached 97 2 and the purity of li reached 63 respectively the sli mg reached 33 6 with an acceptable flux both of two modification methods had a preferable performance on separation of lithium magnesium with a higher sli mg therefore it is an efficient strategy to add pei through different methods into the preparation of nf membrane to separate lithium magnesium and extract the li from salt lake brine with high mg li mass ratio graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanofiltration mg2 li separation polyethyleneimine size sieving donnan effect data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lithium is the lightest metal element in nature with unique physical and chemical characteristics such as high specific heat high conductivity and strong chemical activity lithium and its compounds are extensively used in batteries glass and ceramics greases and desiccants air treatments medicines nuclear fusion aerospace and other fields 1 4 in the era of low carbon life and extensive application of secondary batteries the consumption of lithium in the high tech field has increased rapidly considering the difficulty and cost of developing lithium resources from ores the development and extraction of lithium resource from salt lake has become the main research direction 2 5 7 according to the survey 8 more than 80 of lithium resource in the world comes from salt brine lakes however the salt lake brine contains a large number of other ions which will affect the extraction of li in particular mg2 has a diagonal relationship with li in the periodic table of elements and the hydration radii of mg2 0 86 nm is similar to li 0 76 nm therefore the separation of magnesium lithium is the key factor for the extraction of lithium from salt lake brine at present researchers have conducted a lot of studies on the separation of li and mg2 from salt lake brine by precipitation 9 solvent extraction 10 11 adsorption 12 membrane separation and other methods nevertheless precipitation method is more suitable for lithium extraction from salt lake brine under the condition of low magnesium to lithium ratio 3 finding the appropriate extractant is required for the solvent extraction method the extractant may corrode the process equipment and especially pollute the environment some other methods also may face the matters of extensive energy consumption environmental protection and intricate process flow also nanofiltration nf as a membrane separation technology has the privilege of low driving pressure favorable permeability low energy consumption and nanoscale pore size less than 2 nm its molecular weight cut off mwco is within the limits of 150 da 2000 da 13 and its donnan effect has good rejection for divalent salt as well as a good permeability for monovalent salt in mixed solution integrated into account the effect of pore size sieving and donnan repulsion nf membrane can achieve the separation of multivalent monovalent salt ions in mixed solutions only driven by pressure without chemical reactions occurring during the whole separation process 3 14 16 therefore using nf membrane to separate mg2 and li is an outstanding strategy in recent years a part of the researches has focused on pore size regulation of the nf membrane in order to realize the efficient separation of lithium and magnesium liang et al introduced the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfonate sds to form a self assembled network at the water n hexane interface simultaneously the electrostatic attraction between the sulfonic acid group negatively charged from sds and the piperazine pip molecule with slightly positive charge promoted pip to diffuse quickly between the water n hexane interface which formed a relatively compact polyamide layer with uniform pore size this result sharped the pore size distribution and reduced the pore size of the nf membrane to improve the separation efficiency of monovalent and divalent ions 17 liu et al made the pip polyvinyl alcohol pva solved in the aqueous phase solution and the trimesoyl chloride tmc tetraethyl orthosilicate teos solved in the organic phase solution to implement the combination of interfacial polymerization and situ sol gel to obtain an active layer with a new network structure the new network structure caused the diminution of pore size and the narrow pore size distribution of nf membrane resulting in enhanced selectivity of ions 18 zhang et al pre diffused and enriched the amine monomers at the water n hexane interface before the interfacial polymerization ip reaction accelerating the formal ip reaction between amine group and acyl chloride group as a result the prepared nanofiltration membrane has a more compact active layer and more uniform pore size distribution 19 zhao et al introduced a circular macromolecule γ cyclodextrins cds into aqueous solution due to the cavity diameter around 0 75 0 83 nm the γ cds was able to restrict mg2 through membrane to achieve separation of magnesium ion and lithium ion by pore sieving affect the separation factor sli mg reached 10 8 20 the traditional nf membrane surface holds negative charge because of the carboxyl formed by hydrolysis of unreacted acid chloride in interfacial polymerization this consequence is to the disadvantage of the separation of positively charged ions and even it will make the ca2 deposited on the surface of nf membrane to decline the separation efficiency and stability of membrane during the long time nanofiltration to address the above issues coupled with the trouble of similar hydration radii of li and mg2 some researchers paid attention to prepare the nf membrane with positive charge by introducing plenty of amino groups to the polyamide pa separation layer li et al cross linked a layer of branched polyethyleneimine pei in the polyamide layer and modified pa layer with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta which had the ability to chelate divalent magnesium ions the selectivity of lithium and magnesium was improved by donnan effect and chelate effect that made the separation factor sli mg reach 9 2 21 the nf membrane with positive charge can be obtained through grafting pei on the pa layer of the tfc membrane 22 24 or using pei as the aqueous monomer to prepare pa layer by interface polymerization with tmc 25 27 from the above studies we obviously know that pei is a popular interface polymerization aqueous monomer in recent years it has abundant amine groups and the proportion of primary amine secondary amine and tertiary amine reach 1 2 1 introducing pei into nf composite membrane in different ways will enhance the selectivity performance for mono divalent salt ions by different effect mechanism including donnan repulsion and pore size sieving in this work pei was used to modify nf membranes through two methods in method i pei was mixed with pip in different proportions as aqueous phase monomer to react with tmc to prepare nf membrane through ip process based on previous studies 23 28 in method ii pei was grafted on the active layer of the original nf membrane via the secondary ip reaction between pei and the residual acyl chloride groups formed by first ip process the performance of the nf membranes prepared by two modification methods was compared with systematically by the characterizations of surface morphology amine content hydrophilic chargeability and mwco and selectivity of li mg2 2 experimental 2 1 materials trimesoyl chloride tmc was provided from tci shanghai development co ltd china piperazine pip n hexane lithium chloride licl magnesium chloride mgcl2 and triethylamine tea were supplied from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china 1s 10 camphorsulfonic acid csa polyethylene imine pei mw 600 da 99 3000 da 25 aqueous solution 10 000 da 99 and acid orange 7 were bought from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china the polysulfone psf us020 mwco 20 000 da ultrafiltration membrane was prepared by nanostone water co ltd 2 2 fabrication of nf membranes the pei modified nf membranes were developed by two methods as depicted in fig 1 in method i the pei as the amine monomer was introduced in pa layer in aqueous phase the aqueous phase was prepared under the condition that the total amount of amine monomer was fixed as 1 wt and the ratio of pip and pei was changed then the aqueous phase was dumped onto the dried psf ultrafiltration membrane after soaking for 2 min the excess solution on the psf ultrafiltration membrane was poured out and continued to natural draining next the organic phase solution 0 1 wt tmc in n hexane was tipped onto the amine monomer loaded psf membrane to react 1 min and discarded the excessive solution allowed to air dry for 1 min the membrane was put into the oven at 60 c to cure for 5 min immediately after that the cured nf membrane was put into deionized water the membrane prepared in method i was named as pipa peib where a and b presented the content of pip and pei in method ii the pei was grafted on the surface of pa layer via the secondary ip reaction as shown in fig 1 firstly the pip solved in aqueous phase solution reacted with tmc solved in the n hexane by the similar ip process with the pipa peib membrane after taking out the surplus organic solution and standing dry for 1 min the aqueous solution containing different concentrations and molecular weights of pei were poured onto the membrane soaked for a period of time and pour out allowed to dry for 1 min finally the membrane was cured for 5 min under 60 c in the oven and put it into deionized water the fabricated membranes were called as tfcx peiy membrane where x is the pip concentration of tfc membrane y is the graft molecular weight of pei where the membrane prepared without pei was named tfcx the conditions of all fabricated membranes are listed in the table s1 2 3 characterizations 2 3 1 membrane surface morphology and properties hitachi s 4800 japan scanning electron microscopy sem was serviced to observe the pa layer thickness and surface morphology of the composite nf membrane at the voltage of 10 kv and the current of 10 ma a water contact angle tester dsa 100 krüss germany was brought to measure the water contact angle and analyze the hydrophilic of the membrane surface taking the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir tenser 27 bruker to analyze the changes of functional groups on the nf membrane surface zeta potential analyzer surpass 3 anyon paar austria was offered to characterize the charge condition on the nf membrane surface 2 3 2 mwco of the composite nf membrane a certain concentration of neutral solution including the glycerol glucose and polyethylene glycol peg with different molecular weight mw 200 da 400 da 600 da 1000 da were tested by the laboratory nanofiltration cross flow device under the pressure of 6 bar the total organic carbon analyzer toc is used to test the concentration of glycerol and glucose the concentration of peg is tested by ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 5500pc respectively when the rejection of neutral solute r neutral calculated by eq 1 is 90 the molecular weight of this neutral solute is defined as the mwco of the composite nf membrane 25 1 r neutral 1 c p c f 100 where c p ppm and c f ppm represent permeate and feed concentrations of neutral solution respectively 2 3 3 determination of amine group content on membrane surface according to the principle of equal molar adsorption between acid orange 7 and the amine group on the material acid orange 7 was applied to determine the amine groups content of nf membrane surface 29 firstly to ensure complete protonation of the amino on the membrane surface 1 mmol l acid orange 7 solution was formulated and regulated to ph 3 the prepared nf membrane was completely immersed in the acid orange 7 solution for 10 h in the thermostatic oscillator at 25 c and 100 rpm the adsorption was accomplished until the concentration of acid orange 7 in solution no longer changed after that the membrane surface was cleaned by hcl aqueous solution ph 3 to remove the acid orange 7 that was not compounded with the amine groups next the cleaned membrane was immersed in naoh solution ph 12 and placed in the thermostatic oscillator at 25 c and 100 rpm to achieve desorption of acid orange 7 from membrane surface the concentration of acid orange 7 in desorption solution was detected by uv vis spectrophotometer 2 3 4 separation performance of nf membranes the separation property of the nf membranes is analyzed by a self made nf cross flow filtration device with an effective area of 9 62 cm2 in order to evaluate the selective ability of the membrane for li and mg2 the concentration of 2000 ppm feed solution was prepared by mgcl2 1856 5 ppm and licl 143 5 ppm and wherein the mass ratio of mg2 to li was 20 considering that changes in salt rejection may be related to the change in salt solution concentration in the feed when the membrane was tested by a single solution the concentration of mgcl2 and licl were also controlled to 1856 5 ppm and 143 5 ppm respectively each test membrane was preloaded for 30 min before the separation test to ensure that the permeate flux maintained a steady value and then start the formal separation test in 6 bar 25 c the permeation performance of membrane was described by both permeate flux f l m 2 h 1 and salt rejection r whose calculation formulas are as follows 2 f v a t 3 r 1 c p c f 100 where v l stands for the volume of permeated solution a m2 represents the effective membrane permeated area and t h is the collection time of permeated liquid the concentrations of permeated solution and feed solution respectively of mgcl2 and licl are signified by c p ppm and c f ppm they are detected by conductivity meter dds 307a china the separation efficiency could be tested by separation factor s li mg and the calculation by eq 4 in addition the successful separation of li mg is mainly the extraction of li from li mg mixtures two other aspects should be considered to evaluate the ability of membrane for separating lithium and magnesium from salt lake brine 30 on the one hand the purity of lithium η p which can be calculated by eq 5 is the mass fraction of li in permeate for a given mass ratio of mg li in the feed the η p can be calculated by eq 6 4 s li mg c li p c mg p c li f c mg f 5 η p c p li c p li c p mg 6 η p 1 1 mlr s li mg where c mg p c li p and c mg f c li f are defined as the concentrations of mg2 and li in the permeate and feed respectively atomic absorption spectrophotometer tas 990 china is used to measure the concentrations of salt ions mlr is the mass ratio of mg li in the feed another aspect is the lithium recovery lir which can be calculated by the following eq 7 is the mass fraction of li in the final recovered permeate 7 lir wr 1 r li where wr is water recovery and r li is the rejection of membrane to li according to the definition of purity and recovery of lithium a good nf membrane requires not only high selectivity of li mg and li purity but also good recovery of lithium the performance of nf membranes for lithium and magnesium separation cannot be well evaluated by considering either of them along 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface structures of tfcx pipa peib and tfc0 35 peiy membranes fig 2 displays the surface sem images of all prepared membranes the surface morphology of the tfc1 0 membrane and tfc0 35 membrane presented in fig 2a and g were typical morphology of pa layer developed by ip reaction of pip and tmc with a nodular structure 31 there was almost no difference between the two figures indicating that the concentration of pip had little effect on the morphology of the membrane surface as is showed in fig 2f the morphology of pip0 pei1 0 membrane surface is the discoid shape structure with smooth surface which is a typical morphology of pa layer prepared by pei and tmc 32 the above two apparently different morphologies of are attributed to molecular diffusion rate pip as a small molecule diffuses rapidly from the water phase solution to water organic interface and continuously diffuses to react with tmc to form punctate nodules however pei as a large molecular weight amine monomer has a slow molecular diffusion rate when the initial pa layer was formed the excess pei in aqueous phase cannot cross the initial active layer to react with tmc continuously because of steric hindrance causing the construction of a smooth active layer fig 2b e corresponding to the surface morphology of pip0 8 pei0 2 pip0 6 pei0 4 pip0 4 pei0 6 and pip0 2 pei0 8 membranes respectively shows that the surface morphology was changed gradually from typical surface morphology of pip membrane to pei membrane with the concentration of pei increasing moreover the size of dot nodules on the membrane surface was reduced this change was related to the incomplete ip reaction which was caused not only by the reduction of the content of pip but the slow diffusion rate of amine reaction monomer brought by the steric hindrance of pei however the difference between in pei and pip results in appearing irregular nodules during the development of active layer these nodules are different from the nodules of primary pa layer of the tfcx membrane but transitioning to the nodule shape of pip0 pei1 0 membrane 33 meanwhile the thickness of tfc1 0 and pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane are showed in fig 3a b compared to the pa layer thickness of tfc1 0 membrane which is 103 9 nm the thickness of pa layer of pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane was reduced to 76 7 nm theoretically the introduction of pei with ample amine groups can provide a large number of reaction sites for ip reaction however due to the limited diffusion rate of macromolecular monomer a large number of small molecules pip are more conducive to the formation of primary pa layer with tmc than pei in the prophase of reaction then a part of pei affected by steric hindrance would not be able to penetrate the membrane and continue to react with tmc it can be considered that the tfc1 0 membrane conducted more complete ip reaction than the pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane because of the different diffusion rate between pip and pei because of the effect of mass transfer resistance the thinner membrane contributes to facilitate the permeability of water fig 2h j shows the surface morphology of composite nf membranes fabricated by grafting pei whose molecular weight are 600 3000 and 10000 corresponding to tfc0 35 pei600 tfc0 35 pei3000 and tfc0 35 pei10000 membranes compared to the tfc0 35 membrane the characteristic nodular structure still existed after grafting pei which suggested that there was no substantial damage for polyamide layer during graft however some nodules are appeared on the surface of tfc0 35 pei600 tfc0 35 pei3000 and tfc0 35 pei10000 membranes slightly larger than the original punctate nodules on the surface of tfc0 35 this result can be interpreted that substantial amount of amine groups brought by pei would continue to react with the unreacted tmc left after the fabrication of the primary ip layer and the secondary interface polymerization between pei and tmc was happened to develop new pa layer because of the distinction in pip with pei monomers 34 the formation of the new pa layer can further be illustrated by the increased thickness of the developed nanofiltration membrane the pa layer thickness of tfc0 35 and tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane are presented in fig 3c d respectively with the grafting of pei on the pa layer and compared to the thickness of tfc0 35 membrane 70 7 nm the thickness of pa layer of tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane increased to 81 4 nm which would improve mass transfer resistance to reduce water flux by comparing the two methods of membrane modification there were both some larger nodules appearing on the pa layer different from tfc membrane nevertheless the modified method i by introducing pei to mix with pip as reactive amine monomer affects the structure of original pa layer directly while the modified method ii by grafting pei onto the membrane covered a new active layer without changing the structure of the original active layer therefore above two modification methods applied to nf membrane had opposite trends on the membrane thickness to lead the different influence on water flux 3 2 composition and compactness of tfcx pipa peib and tfc0 35 peiy membranes atr ftir is used to measure the surface chemical composition of membranes prepared with different methods and the analysis results of tfc1 0 and pipa peib membrane tfc0 35 and tfc0 35 peiy membranes are displayed in fig 4a and b respectively as could be observed all membranes had appeared amide characteristic peaks co stretching vibration near 1625 cm 1 which certified the occurrence of ip reaction by acyl chloride and amine monomers in fig 4a the peak intensity at 1625 cm 1 of pipa peib membrane was weaken with the content of pei increasing and the tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane had the strongest peak intensity at 1625 cm 1 among other membranes in fig 4b above results might be associated with the extent of ip reaction and thickness of active layer 34 according to the peak value offered from atr ftir spectra the cross linkage extent of pa layer on psf ultrafiltration membrane was able to be calculated according to the ratio between the intensity of the peak at 1625 cm 1 co amide i and the characteristic peak of carboxyl group oh at 1411 cm 1 35 the value of the peak strength ratio of the two functional groups is smaller the crosslinking extent of active layer is higher all calculation results are presented in table s2 the crosslinking extent of active layer decreased by increasing of pei content in aqueous phase this phenomenon is consisted with the explanation of the membrane thickness in fig 3a b where pip reacted more completely with tmc as a small molecule and the opposite condition between pei and tmc in a limited time the reduction of cross linkage extent could diminish the transmembrane barrier of aqueous molecular in contrast the cross linking degree of the all membranes grafted pei were significantly increased compared with the tfc0 35 membrane it speculated that the development of a new pa layer achieved an improvement in cross linking degree of composite nf membrane among the grafted membrane with different molecular weights pip0 35 pei3000 membrane has the highest degree of cross linking while the extent of crosslinking depends on the polymerization degree between the amine group from grafted pei and the unreacted acyl chloride group on original pa layer for a large molecular weight pei the grafting capacity is limited due to the considerable steric hindrance although there are more available amine groups on it 23 however when the molecular weight of pei is lower the amount of practicable amine groups is restricted therefore as a modest molecular weight as could be considered that the steric hindrance effect of pei with molecular weight of 3000 was mild than the molecular weight of 10 000 but the amount of practicable amine groups grafted onto the pa layer was more than the pei with molecular weight of 600 therefore the surface of tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane conducted secondary interfacial polymerization with a higher degree resulting in owning a preferable cross linkage the mwco can more clearly describe the crosslinking degree and the compactness of membrane in fig 5a the mwco increased from 187 da of tfc1 0 membrane to 209 da of pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane the result visually indicated that the introduction of macromolecular pei in the ip reaction would change the crosslinking content but also reduce the density of the membrane when pei was grafted on the tfc0 35 membrane the mwco showed a declining trend from 266 da of tfc0 35 membrane fig 5b to 209 da 183 da and 233 da of tfc0 35 pei600 tfc0 35 pei3000 and tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane respectively fig 5c where the tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane has a high crosslinking with a minimum mwco due to the lower steric hindrance and higher available amine content during the graft in addition by contrast the mwco of tfc1 0 187 da and tfc0 35 266 da it can be conceived that the compactness of the membrane enhances with enhancing the number of amine monomer in aqueous phase solution as a whole through the analysis consequence of atr ftir spectra and pore size pei participated in the ip reaction directly to reduce the crosslinking extent and magnify the pore size of pipa peib membrane conversely pei as a grafting monomer performed the secondary interfacial polymerization of the membrane to reduce the pore size but improved the compactness of active layer the compactness is a significant factor to influence salt ion rejection and permeability in membrane separation 3 3 characteristic of charge and hydrophilicity of tfcx pipa peib and tfc0 35 peiy membrane surface the capability of inter ion separation selectivity of membrane is not only affected by pore size sieving but the donnan effect makes a vital difference in separation selectivity of monovalent and divalent ions the amine groups produce positive electric groups due to the protonation which can mitigate the electronegativity of the membrane therefore the amino density on the membrane surface was quantified directly by calculation of the adsorption and desorption capacity of the membrane for dye molecules when pei was introduced as an aqueous monomer the amino density of tfc1 0 membrane and pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane were 184 μmol m2 and 621 μmol m2 respectively as shown in fig 6a above results revealed that the number of amine group on the membrane surface advanced with enhancing concentration of pei in aqueous monomer due to the ample amine groups from pei corresponding to the zeta potential analysis in fig 6c the potential was improved from 39 mv of tfc1 0 membrane to 5 mv of pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane in a neutral solution and the isoelectric point raise from 4 17 to 6 41 correspondingly for grafting different molecular weights of pei fig 6b tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane had the highest content of amine groups compared with the other two molecular weights grafted membrane in addition the surface zeta potential of tfc0 35 pei600 tfc0 35 pei3000 and tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane increased comparing to tfc0 35 membrane in a neutral solution fig 6d at a low ph the membrane surface took a positive charge caused by the protonation of amine groups from aqueous phase monomer on the contrary the zeta potential had a decreased trend with increasing of ph because of the deprotonation of pei and the disassociation of carboxyl group generated in hydrolysis of superfluous acyl chloride 36 while with an increasing degree of cross linking it indicates that more acyl chloride reacted with amine monomer the amount of unreacted acyl chloride decreases that resulted in less negatively charged carboxyl group produced by its hydrolysis therefore based on the previous analysis of the crosslinking degree of grafted membranes with different molecular weights in section 3 2 tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane exhibited a higher zeta potential under alkaline conditions due to the preferable cross linkage degree for the two modification methods of pei introduced in different ways the electronegativity of membrane surface was weakened to different degree separately which was beneficial to play a role for the donnan effect and to achieve the efficient selectivity separation of mg2 and li in salt lake brines the hydrophilicity of the membrane is impacted by structure and chemical groups of membrane surface the surface hydrophilicity was measured by the water contact angle in fig 7 at first the value of water contact angle was decreased around 30 with the content of pei improving from 0 to 0 6 wt in fig 7a based on the analysis of atr ftir spectra in table s2 the crosslinking degree of the pa layer decreased with the content of pei augmenting which leads to more acyl chloride not participate in ip reaction therefore both the incorporation of pei that brings generous hydrophilic groups amino and the presence of hydrophilic carboxylic acid groups generated by the hydrolysis of unreacted acyl chloride contribute to reinforce the hydrophilic of membrane surface in fig 7b with increase of pei grafting concentration the water contact angle of membranes was all diminished in different molecular weight of pei due to a mass of amine groups introduced from pei to led the hydrophilicity of the membrane intensify the surface hydrophilicity of tfc0 35 pei600 and tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane had little difference and better than that of tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane for pipa peib and tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface enhanced because the influence of hydrophilic groups and especially amine groups brought by pei although the improvement of hydrophilicity is in favor of permeability membrane thickness and the crosslinking degree of nf membrane would have an impact on the water permeability therefore the predominant effect factor of membrane flux needs considerate multiple factors 3 4 separation performance of membranes 3 4 1 separation performance of pipa peib membranes the separation performance of tfc1 0 and pipa peib membrane is exhibited in fig 8a the result manifests that the permeability of mgcl2 solution were slightly improved from 53 9 l m 2 h 1 of tfc1 0 membrane to 58 5 l m 2 h 1 of the pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane this upward trend can be attributed to the following situation first of all the hydrophilicity of pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane was enhanced which was testified by water contact angle in fig 7a to increase the permeability of water molecule through membranes 37 moreover it can be seen from fig 3a to b that the thickness of pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane decreased compared with tfc1 0 membrane the mass transfer resistance of the solution is weakened which is benefit to heighten the permeability of membrane the rejection of mgcl2 was improved from 92 7 of the tfc1 0 membrane to 96 4 of the pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane and the rejection of licl was just improved slightly this result is mainly influenced by donnan effect when pei was used for the ip reaction the pore size of membrane diminished from 187 da to 209 da of mwco in fig 5a but the electronegativity of membrane surface impaired due to the offset of the negatively charged groups on the membrane surface by the positive charge groups generated after the protonation of excess amine groups therefore donnan repulsion effect exerts a predominant role in the rejection of multivalent ion which can interpret the high rejection rate of mgcl2 with introducing a certain amount of pei nevertheless as content of pei continued to increase 0 4 wt 1 0 wt in aqueous solution the salt rejection was negatively corresponding with the crosslinking extent of pa layer which signified the pore size sieving played a major role in this situation among the all membranes in fig 8a pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane revealed the optimal rejection of mgcl2 and stable permeability which mainly attributed to integrate factor of donnan repulsion and pore size sieving in order to further test the separation and selectivity performance of membrane in salt lake brine the mixed solution of licl and mgcl2 mg2 li mass ratio is 20 will be filtered through a nanofiltration membrane as illustrated in fig 8b all pipa peib membranes especially pip0 6 pip0 4 membrane still maintained a preferable rejection of mg2 reached 98 1 while the repulsion of membrane to li decreased to below 40 which could be accounted for the donnan repulsion effect mg2 as a high valence ion is given a stronger electrostatic repulsive effect by the same charge ions than li as a low valence ion which weakened the repulsive effect of the membrane surface on li during the mixed solution penetrated the membranes 23 pei involved in ip reaction enhanced the electropositivity of membrane surface to strengthen the impact of donnan effect in the separation of mg2 and li combined with the result of zeta potential fig 6b compared with tfc1 0 membrane the separation factor sli mg of pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane improved from 8 5 to 32 6 in fig 8c and the permeability of the membrane maintained at 61 8 l m 2 h 1 in addition table 1 shows the purity and recovery of li of pipa peib membrane in permeate compared with tfc1 0 membrane although the lir has dropped slightly 31 02 decreased to 30 47 pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane s purity reached 62 which was two times of tfc1 0 membrane based on the above analysis adding an appropriate amount of pei into aqueous phase can improve the selectivity separation of mg2 and li without sacrificing the water flux or even improves it meanwhile the purity of li in permeate can be improved by sacrificing just a small amount of li recovery 3 4 2 separation performance of tfc0 35 peiy membranes in order to explore the influence of the location where pei was introduced into the membrane preparation on the membrane separation performance pei was grafted on tfc1 0 however tfc1 0 pei3000 membrane not only achieved a higher magnesium rejection but also significantly improved the lithium rejection in fig s1 because of the secondary ip reaction between pei and chloride remaining on the tfc1 0 membrane surface 38 39 therefore to reduce the density of the graft carrier membrane we decreased the concentration of pip of tfcx membrane in fig s2 by comprehensive considering of the rejection of mg2 and water flux of membranes the pa layer prepared with pip concentration of 0 35 wt tfc0 35 membrane was used as the initial pa layer for pei grafting modification to be in view of the concentration and molecular weight of pei play a different role in the valid content of grafting amine groups then we turned our attention to the selection of the suitable concentration and molecular weight of grafted pei in fig 9 as the improvement of grafting concentration of pei under the same molecular weight the rejection of mg2 was significantly increasing along with the decline of water flux the rise of mg2 rejection can be explained from two aspects on the one hand the donnan exclusion effect of nf membrane is played a role by the enhancement of the electropositivity of membrane surface because of the protonation of amino offered by pei which can be verified by the result of zeta potential fig 6d combining with the analysis result of mwco in fig 5b c the other reason could be conceived that the pore size of the tfc0 35 peiy membrane decreased by the second ip reaction between pei and acyl chloride monomers remained after formation the pa layer of tfc0 35 membrane however although the abundant amine groups will amplify the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface the decrease of pore size and the increase of pa layer thickness are the primary reasons for the lower of water flux with the increase of pei graft content continuously the rejection of mg2 almost stabilized while the water flux still had a downward trend it could be considered that the amount of excess acyl chloride left on the pa layer was limited the grafting content gradually reached saturation due to the restriction of the reaction site while due to the steric hindrance of the molecules the different molecular size of pei grafted has a role impact in separation performance under the same grafting concentration three different molecular weights of pei grafted on the membrane were compared and analyzed of salt rejection and permeability in fig 9a d at the same graft concentration of 0 15 wt the rejection of mgcl2 and licl was 87 4 and 52 1 of tfc0 35 pei600 membrane 97 0 and 60 2 of tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane 87 2 and 47 9 of tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane respectively while the margin of water flux between tfc0 35 peiy membranes grafted by three molecular weight of pei was less than 10 0 l m 2 h 1 within an admissible limit the otherness of membrane rejection to mgcl2 and licl between different molecular weights of pei grafted can be mainly ascribed to the change of pore size and this was consisting with the analysis of mwco in fig 5c the mwco of tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane is minimum when the content of remaining acyl chloride monomers on the tfc0 35 membrane was fixed the degree of secondary interface polymerization and the compactness of pa layer depended on the content of effective amine groups introduced by pei within a certain range 40 therefore integrated into account of steric hindrance and content of carried amine groups by pei the pa active layer of tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane had a high density led to the best rejection of mgcl2 the water flux of mgcl2 and licl remained above 60 l m 2 h 1 and 80 l m 2 h 1 which reached about 120 and 130 of tfc1 0 pei3000 below 50 l m 2 h 1 and 60 l m 2 h 1 correspondingly to achieve improving permeability of membrane through decreasing the cross linkage of original pa layer next the selectivity ability of grafted membranes was measured in mixed salt solution with licl and mgcl2 in fig 10a the rejection of grafted membranes with three molecular weights of pei to mg2 shows an increasing trend and the water flux shows an opposite trend and this is corresponded to the test results during through a single solution all tfc0 35 peiy membranes had a significant promotion for the selectivity ability of mg2 and li by contrast with tfc0 35 membrane sli mg 1 6 in fig 10d while at the same grafted concentration of pei 0 15 wt the rejection of mg2 fig 10a and li fig 10b reached 92 0 97 2 91 5 and 18 5 5 9 20 2 corresponding with the tfc0 35 pei600 tfc0 35 pei3000 and tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane respectively tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane had the prime rejection of mg2 it can be conceived that the strong effect of pore size sieving is dominant and integrated with the improved repulsion of the positively charged surface in fig 10b the li rejection of tfc0 35 pei600 and tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane appear negative value caused by the relatively loose pa active layer compared to the tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane which is conductive to li permeate and synergistically exerts electrostatic repulsive effect however the other two grafted membrane owned a lower rejection of mg2 in comparison with tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane resulted in decreasing the purity of li in permeate solution in fig 10d the sli mg was 14 8 33 6 14 1 corresponding with tfc0 35 pei600 tfc0 35 pei3000 tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane hence the tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane had the optimum separation efficiency of mg2 and li moreover table 2 shows the li purity and recovery of tfc0 35 and tfc0 35 peiy the ηli of tfc0 35 tfc0 35 pei600 tfc0 35 pei3000 tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane were 7 42 63 and 41 the lir of corresponding membrane were 66 53 59 26 47 03 and 60 11 respectively the tfc0 35 peiy membranes by pei grafting all achieved a high degree of li purity with the highest purity of li in the permeate after the tfc0 35 pei3000 nanofiltration operation improving the purity of li can reduce the degree of difficulty for lithium extraction in the following operation processes however the increase of li purity would sacrifice some li recovery appropriately compared the nf membranes fabricated by two methods both of them improved the separation performance and selectivity of li and mg2 greatly but there are some differences in separation mechanism between them for the pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane the ip reaction degree is weakened due to the difference in diffusion rate between large amine monomer pei and small amine monomer pip therefore the introduction of pei prepared a thinner and relatively loose pa layer than tfc1 0 membrane which improved the flux of membrane however the tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane generated a thick and compact pa layer because of the secondary ip reaction between pei and tmc than tfc0 35 membrane which cut down the flux but improved rejection to mg2 of membrane both method i and method ii impaired the electronegativity of membrane surface because the protonation of amine groups from pei therefore although pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane has a relatively loose active layer the strong electropositivity of the membrane surface enhanced the rejection of li and mg2 and improves the selectivity between them but for tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane the enhancement of positive charge density on the membrane surface cooperating with the decrease of the pore size of membrane realized the effective separation of li and mg2 noticeably by fixing the content of the reaction monomer acyl chloride tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane only needed less than half of the amine reaction monomer amount on the pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane to achieve the equivalent separation performance of lithium and magnesium 3 5 the stability performance of membrane membrane stability is also an important index to assess the performance of nf membranes to evaluate the stability of pip0 6 pei0 4 and tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane the membranes were tested by long term nanofiltration operation in the mixed solution both of two modified membrane present excellent stability in fig 11a where the rejection of pip0 6 pei0 4 and tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane to mg2 and li was maintained around 97 8 38 6 and 96 7 8 6 respectively meanwhile considering the presence of inorganic salt ions in the salt lake brine 41 including ca2 na cl and so4 2 where the ca2 and so4 2 brought a great challenge to the performance of membrane when they deposited on separation layer over the long term filtration of nanofiltration membrane for purpose of testing the anti scaling ability of prepared membranes the water flux of the membrane was measured with a certain concentration of mixture solution with nacl 21 mmol na2so4 19 mmol and cacl2 23 mmol by way of continuous nanofiltration operation for 22 h the water fluxes of tfc1 0 pip0 6 pei0 4 tfc0 35 and tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane were reached 83 9 88 0 74 9 and 84 1 of the initial water fluxes respectively which is showed in fig 11b c comparing tfc1 0 to pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane tfc0 35 to tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane respectively the water flux of both the latter membrane appeared a relatively gently decline in the initial determination and the degree of water flux reduction was small among the same operation time moreover the pip0 6 pei0 4 and tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane still maintained 95 8 and 94 8 of initial flux after regeneration separately whereas about 10 decrease of initial flux was presented to unmodified membrane table s3 the outstanding anti scaling ability of pip0 6 pei0 4 and tfc0 35 pei3000 membranes mainly attributed to the donnan effect which make a stronger divalent cation repulsion is more conducive to maintaining an outstanding separation performance and stability in practical applications in comparison with tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane had a more excellent ability of scaling resistance due the lower electronegative on the membrane by contrast with their zeta potential in fig 6c and d we summarized several reported researches in improving the selectivity separation of li and mg2 from salt lake brines to evaluate the nf performance of membranes developed by this work table 3 and fig 12 according to the table 3 the membranes prepared by two methods in this paper show not only high sli mg but acceptable water flux however it is explained in other literatures that the rejection of mg2 is highly sensitive to the sli mg 30 this means that as long as the rejection of mg2 is infinitely close to the 100 a higher sli mg will be obtained even if the rejection of li reach to 90 therefore this paper calculates the purity and recovery of li and compares it with other literatures compared with most of membranes shown in fig 12 tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane exhibits not only higher lir but also higher ηp in permeate although pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane has similar sli mg and ηp with tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane the lir is relatively poor in general both of membranes prepared by two methods have higher sli mg but tfc0 35 pei3000 is more in compliance with the actual requirements for li extraction in li mg separation 4 conclusion in this work we investigated the preparation of nanofiltration membranes by introducing pei in two methods both modifications with simple process achieved the reduction of the electronegativity of membrane surface and made a certain influence on the extent of cross linking and hydrophilicity of membrane the introduction of pei as aqueous monomer method i reduced the cross linkage and electronegativity of the membrane which slightly improved the permeability of the membrane but also improved the selectivity of mg2 and li the rejection to mg2 enhanced from 92 7 to 98 1 and the purity of li enhance twice time the separation factor sli mg increased to 32 3 meanwhile the water flux could reach 61 8 l m 2 h 1 for the membrane fabricated by grafting pei method ii the cross linkage extent and thickness of the membrane were increased by secondary interfacial polymerization along with the decrease of water flux but still reached 57 6 l m 2 h 1 remarkably the improvement of cross linkage extent of pa layer and the decrease electronegativity of membrane surface improved the rejection of mg2 from 14 6 to 97 2 in addition the purity of li reached 63 in comparison membranes with two modified methods pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane had a high rejection of mg2 while tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane with the similar sli mg with pip0 6 pei0 4 not only economized raw materials in the prepared process of membrane but also possesses excellent li recovery and purity in permeate which was better to extract more lithium resources from salt lake brines moreover the simplicity of the membranes production process and excellent ability of anti calcium of the membranes will be more powerful to achieve the factory

12402,the application of nanofiltration nf membrane with positive charge on the surface in the separation of lithium magnesium is a convenient energy saving and sustainable strategy in this work polyethyleneimine pei was introduced into the composite nf membrane through two methods to investigate and make a comparation in surface morphology and properties application in the separation of membrane to li and mg2 respectively both pei and pip were involved in the preparation of membranes as aqueous monomers which can reduce the cross linking degree of active layer but reduce the electronegativity of membrane surface the rejection of mg2 reached 98 1 and the purity of li which is the mass fraction of li in cations of permeate reached 62 respectively the separation factor sli mg reached 32 6 by contrast pei with different molecular weight and concentration was grafted on the pa layer which improved the density of membrane but reduced the electronegativity of the membrane surface the rejection of mg2 reached 97 2 and the purity of li reached 63 respectively the sli mg reached 33 6 with an acceptable flux both of two modification methods had a preferable performance on separation of lithium magnesium with a higher sli mg therefore it is an efficient strategy to add pei through different methods into the preparation of nf membrane to separate lithium magnesium and extract the li from salt lake brine with high mg li mass ratio graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanofiltration mg2 li separation polyethyleneimine size sieving donnan effect data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lithium is the lightest metal element in nature with unique physical and chemical characteristics such as high specific heat high conductivity and strong chemical activity lithium and its compounds are extensively used in batteries glass and ceramics greases and desiccants air treatments medicines nuclear fusion aerospace and other fields 1 4 in the era of low carbon life and extensive application of secondary batteries the consumption of lithium in the high tech field has increased rapidly considering the difficulty and cost of developing lithium resources from ores the development and extraction of lithium resource from salt lake has become the main research direction 2 5 7 according to the survey 8 more than 80 of lithium resource in the world comes from salt brine lakes however the salt lake brine contains a large number of other ions which will affect the extraction of li in particular mg2 has a diagonal relationship with li in the periodic table of elements and the hydration radii of mg2 0 86 nm is similar to li 0 76 nm therefore the separation of magnesium lithium is the key factor for the extraction of lithium from salt lake brine at present researchers have conducted a lot of studies on the separation of li and mg2 from salt lake brine by precipitation 9 solvent extraction 10 11 adsorption 12 membrane separation and other methods nevertheless precipitation method is more suitable for lithium extraction from salt lake brine under the condition of low magnesium to lithium ratio 3 finding the appropriate extractant is required for the solvent extraction method the extractant may corrode the process equipment and especially pollute the environment some other methods also may face the matters of extensive energy consumption environmental protection and intricate process flow also nanofiltration nf as a membrane separation technology has the privilege of low driving pressure favorable permeability low energy consumption and nanoscale pore size less than 2 nm its molecular weight cut off mwco is within the limits of 150 da 2000 da 13 and its donnan effect has good rejection for divalent salt as well as a good permeability for monovalent salt in mixed solution integrated into account the effect of pore size sieving and donnan repulsion nf membrane can achieve the separation of multivalent monovalent salt ions in mixed solutions only driven by pressure without chemical reactions occurring during the whole separation process 3 14 16 therefore using nf membrane to separate mg2 and li is an outstanding strategy in recent years a part of the researches has focused on pore size regulation of the nf membrane in order to realize the efficient separation of lithium and magnesium liang et al introduced the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfonate sds to form a self assembled network at the water n hexane interface simultaneously the electrostatic attraction between the sulfonic acid group negatively charged from sds and the piperazine pip molecule with slightly positive charge promoted pip to diffuse quickly between the water n hexane interface which formed a relatively compact polyamide layer with uniform pore size this result sharped the pore size distribution and reduced the pore size of the nf membrane to improve the separation efficiency of monovalent and divalent ions 17 liu et al made the pip polyvinyl alcohol pva solved in the aqueous phase solution and the trimesoyl chloride tmc tetraethyl orthosilicate teos solved in the organic phase solution to implement the combination of interfacial polymerization and situ sol gel to obtain an active layer with a new network structure the new network structure caused the diminution of pore size and the narrow pore size distribution of nf membrane resulting in enhanced selectivity of ions 18 zhang et al pre diffused and enriched the amine monomers at the water n hexane interface before the interfacial polymerization ip reaction accelerating the formal ip reaction between amine group and acyl chloride group as a result the prepared nanofiltration membrane has a more compact active layer and more uniform pore size distribution 19 zhao et al introduced a circular macromolecule γ cyclodextrins cds into aqueous solution due to the cavity diameter around 0 75 0 83 nm the γ cds was able to restrict mg2 through membrane to achieve separation of magnesium ion and lithium ion by pore sieving affect the separation factor sli mg reached 10 8 20 the traditional nf membrane surface holds negative charge because of the carboxyl formed by hydrolysis of unreacted acid chloride in interfacial polymerization this consequence is to the disadvantage of the separation of positively charged ions and even it will make the ca2 deposited on the surface of nf membrane to decline the separation efficiency and stability of membrane during the long time nanofiltration to address the above issues coupled with the trouble of similar hydration radii of li and mg2 some researchers paid attention to prepare the nf membrane with positive charge by introducing plenty of amino groups to the polyamide pa separation layer li et al cross linked a layer of branched polyethyleneimine pei in the polyamide layer and modified pa layer with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta which had the ability to chelate divalent magnesium ions the selectivity of lithium and magnesium was improved by donnan effect and chelate effect that made the separation factor sli mg reach 9 2 21 the nf membrane with positive charge can be obtained through grafting pei on the pa layer of the tfc membrane 22 24 or using pei as the aqueous monomer to prepare pa layer by interface polymerization with tmc 25 27 from the above studies we obviously know that pei is a popular interface polymerization aqueous monomer in recent years it has abundant amine groups and the proportion of primary amine secondary amine and tertiary amine reach 1 2 1 introducing pei into nf composite membrane in different ways will enhance the selectivity performance for mono divalent salt ions by different effect mechanism including donnan repulsion and pore size sieving in this work pei was used to modify nf membranes through two methods in method i pei was mixed with pip in different proportions as aqueous phase monomer to react with tmc to prepare nf membrane through ip process based on previous studies 23 28 in method ii pei was grafted on the active layer of the original nf membrane via the secondary ip reaction between pei and the residual acyl chloride groups formed by first ip process the performance of the nf membranes prepared by two modification methods was compared with systematically by the characterizations of surface morphology amine content hydrophilic chargeability and mwco and selectivity of li mg2 2 experimental 2 1 materials trimesoyl chloride tmc was provided from tci shanghai development co ltd china piperazine pip n hexane lithium chloride licl magnesium chloride mgcl2 and triethylamine tea were supplied from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china 1s 10 camphorsulfonic acid csa polyethylene imine pei mw 600 da 99 3000 da 25 aqueous solution 10 000 da 99 and acid orange 7 were bought from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china the polysulfone psf us020 mwco 20 000 da ultrafiltration membrane was prepared by nanostone water co ltd 2 2 fabrication of nf membranes the pei modified nf membranes were developed by two methods as depicted in fig 1 in method i the pei as the amine monomer was introduced in pa layer in aqueous phase the aqueous phase was prepared under the condition that the total amount of amine monomer was fixed as 1 wt and the ratio of pip and pei was changed then the aqueous phase was dumped onto the dried psf ultrafiltration membrane after soaking for 2 min the excess solution on the psf ultrafiltration membrane was poured out and continued to natural draining next the organic phase solution 0 1 wt tmc in n hexane was tipped onto the amine monomer loaded psf membrane to react 1 min and discarded the excessive solution allowed to air dry for 1 min the membrane was put into the oven at 60 c to cure for 5 min immediately after that the cured nf membrane was put into deionized water the membrane prepared in method i was named as pipa peib where a and b presented the content of pip and pei in method ii the pei was grafted on the surface of pa layer via the secondary ip reaction as shown in fig 1 firstly the pip solved in aqueous phase solution reacted with tmc solved in the n hexane by the similar ip process with the pipa peib membrane after taking out the surplus organic solution and standing dry for 1 min the aqueous solution containing different concentrations and molecular weights of pei were poured onto the membrane soaked for a period of time and pour out allowed to dry for 1 min finally the membrane was cured for 5 min under 60 c in the oven and put it into deionized water the fabricated membranes were called as tfcx peiy membrane where x is the pip concentration of tfc membrane y is the graft molecular weight of pei where the membrane prepared without pei was named tfcx the conditions of all fabricated membranes are listed in the table s1 2 3 characterizations 2 3 1 membrane surface morphology and properties hitachi s 4800 japan scanning electron microscopy sem was serviced to observe the pa layer thickness and surface morphology of the composite nf membrane at the voltage of 10 kv and the current of 10 ma a water contact angle tester dsa 100 krüss germany was brought to measure the water contact angle and analyze the hydrophilic of the membrane surface taking the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir tenser 27 bruker to analyze the changes of functional groups on the nf membrane surface zeta potential analyzer surpass 3 anyon paar austria was offered to characterize the charge condition on the nf membrane surface 2 3 2 mwco of the composite nf membrane a certain concentration of neutral solution including the glycerol glucose and polyethylene glycol peg with different molecular weight mw 200 da 400 da 600 da 1000 da were tested by the laboratory nanofiltration cross flow device under the pressure of 6 bar the total organic carbon analyzer toc is used to test the concentration of glycerol and glucose the concentration of peg is tested by ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv 5500pc respectively when the rejection of neutral solute r neutral calculated by eq 1 is 90 the molecular weight of this neutral solute is defined as the mwco of the composite nf membrane 25 1 r neutral 1 c p c f 100 where c p ppm and c f ppm represent permeate and feed concentrations of neutral solution respectively 2 3 3 determination of amine group content on membrane surface according to the principle of equal molar adsorption between acid orange 7 and the amine group on the material acid orange 7 was applied to determine the amine groups content of nf membrane surface 29 firstly to ensure complete protonation of the amino on the membrane surface 1 mmol l acid orange 7 solution was formulated and regulated to ph 3 the prepared nf membrane was completely immersed in the acid orange 7 solution for 10 h in the thermostatic oscillator at 25 c and 100 rpm the adsorption was accomplished until the concentration of acid orange 7 in solution no longer changed after that the membrane surface was cleaned by hcl aqueous solution ph 3 to remove the acid orange 7 that was not compounded with the amine groups next the cleaned membrane was immersed in naoh solution ph 12 and placed in the thermostatic oscillator at 25 c and 100 rpm to achieve desorption of acid orange 7 from membrane surface the concentration of acid orange 7 in desorption solution was detected by uv vis spectrophotometer 2 3 4 separation performance of nf membranes the separation property of the nf membranes is analyzed by a self made nf cross flow filtration device with an effective area of 9 62 cm2 in order to evaluate the selective ability of the membrane for li and mg2 the concentration of 2000 ppm feed solution was prepared by mgcl2 1856 5 ppm and licl 143 5 ppm and wherein the mass ratio of mg2 to li was 20 considering that changes in salt rejection may be related to the change in salt solution concentration in the feed when the membrane was tested by a single solution the concentration of mgcl2 and licl were also controlled to 1856 5 ppm and 143 5 ppm respectively each test membrane was preloaded for 30 min before the separation test to ensure that the permeate flux maintained a steady value and then start the formal separation test in 6 bar 25 c the permeation performance of membrane was described by both permeate flux f l m 2 h 1 and salt rejection r whose calculation formulas are as follows 2 f v a t 3 r 1 c p c f 100 where v l stands for the volume of permeated solution a m2 represents the effective membrane permeated area and t h is the collection time of permeated liquid the concentrations of permeated solution and feed solution respectively of mgcl2 and licl are signified by c p ppm and c f ppm they are detected by conductivity meter dds 307a china the separation efficiency could be tested by separation factor s li mg and the calculation by eq 4 in addition the successful separation of li mg is mainly the extraction of li from li mg mixtures two other aspects should be considered to evaluate the ability of membrane for separating lithium and magnesium from salt lake brine 30 on the one hand the purity of lithium η p which can be calculated by eq 5 is the mass fraction of li in permeate for a given mass ratio of mg li in the feed the η p can be calculated by eq 6 4 s li mg c li p c mg p c li f c mg f 5 η p c p li c p li c p mg 6 η p 1 1 mlr s li mg where c mg p c li p and c mg f c li f are defined as the concentrations of mg2 and li in the permeate and feed respectively atomic absorption spectrophotometer tas 990 china is used to measure the concentrations of salt ions mlr is the mass ratio of mg li in the feed another aspect is the lithium recovery lir which can be calculated by the following eq 7 is the mass fraction of li in the final recovered permeate 7 lir wr 1 r li where wr is water recovery and r li is the rejection of membrane to li according to the definition of purity and recovery of lithium a good nf membrane requires not only high selectivity of li mg and li purity but also good recovery of lithium the performance of nf membranes for lithium and magnesium separation cannot be well evaluated by considering either of them along 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface structures of tfcx pipa peib and tfc0 35 peiy membranes fig 2 displays the surface sem images of all prepared membranes the surface morphology of the tfc1 0 membrane and tfc0 35 membrane presented in fig 2a and g were typical morphology of pa layer developed by ip reaction of pip and tmc with a nodular structure 31 there was almost no difference between the two figures indicating that the concentration of pip had little effect on the morphology of the membrane surface as is showed in fig 2f the morphology of pip0 pei1 0 membrane surface is the discoid shape structure with smooth surface which is a typical morphology of pa layer prepared by pei and tmc 32 the above two apparently different morphologies of are attributed to molecular diffusion rate pip as a small molecule diffuses rapidly from the water phase solution to water organic interface and continuously diffuses to react with tmc to form punctate nodules however pei as a large molecular weight amine monomer has a slow molecular diffusion rate when the initial pa layer was formed the excess pei in aqueous phase cannot cross the initial active layer to react with tmc continuously because of steric hindrance causing the construction of a smooth active layer fig 2b e corresponding to the surface morphology of pip0 8 pei0 2 pip0 6 pei0 4 pip0 4 pei0 6 and pip0 2 pei0 8 membranes respectively shows that the surface morphology was changed gradually from typical surface morphology of pip membrane to pei membrane with the concentration of pei increasing moreover the size of dot nodules on the membrane surface was reduced this change was related to the incomplete ip reaction which was caused not only by the reduction of the content of pip but the slow diffusion rate of amine reaction monomer brought by the steric hindrance of pei however the difference between in pei and pip results in appearing irregular nodules during the development of active layer these nodules are different from the nodules of primary pa layer of the tfcx membrane but transitioning to the nodule shape of pip0 pei1 0 membrane 33 meanwhile the thickness of tfc1 0 and pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane are showed in fig 3a b compared to the pa layer thickness of tfc1 0 membrane which is 103 9 nm the thickness of pa layer of pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane was reduced to 76 7 nm theoretically the introduction of pei with ample amine groups can provide a large number of reaction sites for ip reaction however due to the limited diffusion rate of macromolecular monomer a large number of small molecules pip are more conducive to the formation of primary pa layer with tmc than pei in the prophase of reaction then a part of pei affected by steric hindrance would not be able to penetrate the membrane and continue to react with tmc it can be considered that the tfc1 0 membrane conducted more complete ip reaction than the pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane because of the different diffusion rate between pip and pei because of the effect of mass transfer resistance the thinner membrane contributes to facilitate the permeability of water fig 2h j shows the surface morphology of composite nf membranes fabricated by grafting pei whose molecular weight are 600 3000 and 10000 corresponding to tfc0 35 pei600 tfc0 35 pei3000 and tfc0 35 pei10000 membranes compared to the tfc0 35 membrane the characteristic nodular structure still existed after grafting pei which suggested that there was no substantial damage for polyamide layer during graft however some nodules are appeared on the surface of tfc0 35 pei600 tfc0 35 pei3000 and tfc0 35 pei10000 membranes slightly larger than the original punctate nodules on the surface of tfc0 35 this result can be interpreted that substantial amount of amine groups brought by pei would continue to react with the unreacted tmc left after the fabrication of the primary ip layer and the secondary interface polymerization between pei and tmc was happened to develop new pa layer because of the distinction in pip with pei monomers 34 the formation of the new pa layer can further be illustrated by the increased thickness of the developed nanofiltration membrane the pa layer thickness of tfc0 35 and tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane are presented in fig 3c d respectively with the grafting of pei on the pa layer and compared to the thickness of tfc0 35 membrane 70 7 nm the thickness of pa layer of tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane increased to 81 4 nm which would improve mass transfer resistance to reduce water flux by comparing the two methods of membrane modification there were both some larger nodules appearing on the pa layer different from tfc membrane nevertheless the modified method i by introducing pei to mix with pip as reactive amine monomer affects the structure of original pa layer directly while the modified method ii by grafting pei onto the membrane covered a new active layer without changing the structure of the original active layer therefore above two modification methods applied to nf membrane had opposite trends on the membrane thickness to lead the different influence on water flux 3 2 composition and compactness of tfcx pipa peib and tfc0 35 peiy membranes atr ftir is used to measure the surface chemical composition of membranes prepared with different methods and the analysis results of tfc1 0 and pipa peib membrane tfc0 35 and tfc0 35 peiy membranes are displayed in fig 4a and b respectively as could be observed all membranes had appeared amide characteristic peaks co stretching vibration near 1625 cm 1 which certified the occurrence of ip reaction by acyl chloride and amine monomers in fig 4a the peak intensity at 1625 cm 1 of pipa peib membrane was weaken with the content of pei increasing and the tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane had the strongest peak intensity at 1625 cm 1 among other membranes in fig 4b above results might be associated with the extent of ip reaction and thickness of active layer 34 according to the peak value offered from atr ftir spectra the cross linkage extent of pa layer on psf ultrafiltration membrane was able to be calculated according to the ratio between the intensity of the peak at 1625 cm 1 co amide i and the characteristic peak of carboxyl group oh at 1411 cm 1 35 the value of the peak strength ratio of the two functional groups is smaller the crosslinking extent of active layer is higher all calculation results are presented in table s2 the crosslinking extent of active layer decreased by increasing of pei content in aqueous phase this phenomenon is consisted with the explanation of the membrane thickness in fig 3a b where pip reacted more completely with tmc as a small molecule and the opposite condition between pei and tmc in a limited time the reduction of cross linkage extent could diminish the transmembrane barrier of aqueous molecular in contrast the cross linking degree of the all membranes grafted pei were significantly increased compared with the tfc0 35 membrane it speculated that the development of a new pa layer achieved an improvement in cross linking degree of composite nf membrane among the grafted membrane with different molecular weights pip0 35 pei3000 membrane has the highest degree of cross linking while the extent of crosslinking depends on the polymerization degree between the amine group from grafted pei and the unreacted acyl chloride group on original pa layer for a large molecular weight pei the grafting capacity is limited due to the considerable steric hindrance although there are more available amine groups on it 23 however when the molecular weight of pei is lower the amount of practicable amine groups is restricted therefore as a modest molecular weight as could be considered that the steric hindrance effect of pei with molecular weight of 3000 was mild than the molecular weight of 10 000 but the amount of practicable amine groups grafted onto the pa layer was more than the pei with molecular weight of 600 therefore the surface of tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane conducted secondary interfacial polymerization with a higher degree resulting in owning a preferable cross linkage the mwco can more clearly describe the crosslinking degree and the compactness of membrane in fig 5a the mwco increased from 187 da of tfc1 0 membrane to 209 da of pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane the result visually indicated that the introduction of macromolecular pei in the ip reaction would change the crosslinking content but also reduce the density of the membrane when pei was grafted on the tfc0 35 membrane the mwco showed a declining trend from 266 da of tfc0 35 membrane fig 5b to 209 da 183 da and 233 da of tfc0 35 pei600 tfc0 35 pei3000 and tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane respectively fig 5c where the tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane has a high crosslinking with a minimum mwco due to the lower steric hindrance and higher available amine content during the graft in addition by contrast the mwco of tfc1 0 187 da and tfc0 35 266 da it can be conceived that the compactness of the membrane enhances with enhancing the number of amine monomer in aqueous phase solution as a whole through the analysis consequence of atr ftir spectra and pore size pei participated in the ip reaction directly to reduce the crosslinking extent and magnify the pore size of pipa peib membrane conversely pei as a grafting monomer performed the secondary interfacial polymerization of the membrane to reduce the pore size but improved the compactness of active layer the compactness is a significant factor to influence salt ion rejection and permeability in membrane separation 3 3 characteristic of charge and hydrophilicity of tfcx pipa peib and tfc0 35 peiy membrane surface the capability of inter ion separation selectivity of membrane is not only affected by pore size sieving but the donnan effect makes a vital difference in separation selectivity of monovalent and divalent ions the amine groups produce positive electric groups due to the protonation which can mitigate the electronegativity of the membrane therefore the amino density on the membrane surface was quantified directly by calculation of the adsorption and desorption capacity of the membrane for dye molecules when pei was introduced as an aqueous monomer the amino density of tfc1 0 membrane and pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane were 184 μmol m2 and 621 μmol m2 respectively as shown in fig 6a above results revealed that the number of amine group on the membrane surface advanced with enhancing concentration of pei in aqueous monomer due to the ample amine groups from pei corresponding to the zeta potential analysis in fig 6c the potential was improved from 39 mv of tfc1 0 membrane to 5 mv of pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane in a neutral solution and the isoelectric point raise from 4 17 to 6 41 correspondingly for grafting different molecular weights of pei fig 6b tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane had the highest content of amine groups compared with the other two molecular weights grafted membrane in addition the surface zeta potential of tfc0 35 pei600 tfc0 35 pei3000 and tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane increased comparing to tfc0 35 membrane in a neutral solution fig 6d at a low ph the membrane surface took a positive charge caused by the protonation of amine groups from aqueous phase monomer on the contrary the zeta potential had a decreased trend with increasing of ph because of the deprotonation of pei and the disassociation of carboxyl group generated in hydrolysis of superfluous acyl chloride 36 while with an increasing degree of cross linking it indicates that more acyl chloride reacted with amine monomer the amount of unreacted acyl chloride decreases that resulted in less negatively charged carboxyl group produced by its hydrolysis therefore based on the previous analysis of the crosslinking degree of grafted membranes with different molecular weights in section 3 2 tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane exhibited a higher zeta potential under alkaline conditions due to the preferable cross linkage degree for the two modification methods of pei introduced in different ways the electronegativity of membrane surface was weakened to different degree separately which was beneficial to play a role for the donnan effect and to achieve the efficient selectivity separation of mg2 and li in salt lake brines the hydrophilicity of the membrane is impacted by structure and chemical groups of membrane surface the surface hydrophilicity was measured by the water contact angle in fig 7 at first the value of water contact angle was decreased around 30 with the content of pei improving from 0 to 0 6 wt in fig 7a based on the analysis of atr ftir spectra in table s2 the crosslinking degree of the pa layer decreased with the content of pei augmenting which leads to more acyl chloride not participate in ip reaction therefore both the incorporation of pei that brings generous hydrophilic groups amino and the presence of hydrophilic carboxylic acid groups generated by the hydrolysis of unreacted acyl chloride contribute to reinforce the hydrophilic of membrane surface in fig 7b with increase of pei grafting concentration the water contact angle of membranes was all diminished in different molecular weight of pei due to a mass of amine groups introduced from pei to led the hydrophilicity of the membrane intensify the surface hydrophilicity of tfc0 35 pei600 and tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane had little difference and better than that of tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane for pipa peib and tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface enhanced because the influence of hydrophilic groups and especially amine groups brought by pei although the improvement of hydrophilicity is in favor of permeability membrane thickness and the crosslinking degree of nf membrane would have an impact on the water permeability therefore the predominant effect factor of membrane flux needs considerate multiple factors 3 4 separation performance of membranes 3 4 1 separation performance of pipa peib membranes the separation performance of tfc1 0 and pipa peib membrane is exhibited in fig 8a the result manifests that the permeability of mgcl2 solution were slightly improved from 53 9 l m 2 h 1 of tfc1 0 membrane to 58 5 l m 2 h 1 of the pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane this upward trend can be attributed to the following situation first of all the hydrophilicity of pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane was enhanced which was testified by water contact angle in fig 7a to increase the permeability of water molecule through membranes 37 moreover it can be seen from fig 3a to b that the thickness of pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane decreased compared with tfc1 0 membrane the mass transfer resistance of the solution is weakened which is benefit to heighten the permeability of membrane the rejection of mgcl2 was improved from 92 7 of the tfc1 0 membrane to 96 4 of the pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane and the rejection of licl was just improved slightly this result is mainly influenced by donnan effect when pei was used for the ip reaction the pore size of membrane diminished from 187 da to 209 da of mwco in fig 5a but the electronegativity of membrane surface impaired due to the offset of the negatively charged groups on the membrane surface by the positive charge groups generated after the protonation of excess amine groups therefore donnan repulsion effect exerts a predominant role in the rejection of multivalent ion which can interpret the high rejection rate of mgcl2 with introducing a certain amount of pei nevertheless as content of pei continued to increase 0 4 wt 1 0 wt in aqueous solution the salt rejection was negatively corresponding with the crosslinking extent of pa layer which signified the pore size sieving played a major role in this situation among the all membranes in fig 8a pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane revealed the optimal rejection of mgcl2 and stable permeability which mainly attributed to integrate factor of donnan repulsion and pore size sieving in order to further test the separation and selectivity performance of membrane in salt lake brine the mixed solution of licl and mgcl2 mg2 li mass ratio is 20 will be filtered through a nanofiltration membrane as illustrated in fig 8b all pipa peib membranes especially pip0 6 pip0 4 membrane still maintained a preferable rejection of mg2 reached 98 1 while the repulsion of membrane to li decreased to below 40 which could be accounted for the donnan repulsion effect mg2 as a high valence ion is given a stronger electrostatic repulsive effect by the same charge ions than li as a low valence ion which weakened the repulsive effect of the membrane surface on li during the mixed solution penetrated the membranes 23 pei involved in ip reaction enhanced the electropositivity of membrane surface to strengthen the impact of donnan effect in the separation of mg2 and li combined with the result of zeta potential fig 6b compared with tfc1 0 membrane the separation factor sli mg of pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane improved from 8 5 to 32 6 in fig 8c and the permeability of the membrane maintained at 61 8 l m 2 h 1 in addition table 1 shows the purity and recovery of li of pipa peib membrane in permeate compared with tfc1 0 membrane although the lir has dropped slightly 31 02 decreased to 30 47 pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane s purity reached 62 which was two times of tfc1 0 membrane based on the above analysis adding an appropriate amount of pei into aqueous phase can improve the selectivity separation of mg2 and li without sacrificing the water flux or even improves it meanwhile the purity of li in permeate can be improved by sacrificing just a small amount of li recovery 3 4 2 separation performance of tfc0 35 peiy membranes in order to explore the influence of the location where pei was introduced into the membrane preparation on the membrane separation performance pei was grafted on tfc1 0 however tfc1 0 pei3000 membrane not only achieved a higher magnesium rejection but also significantly improved the lithium rejection in fig s1 because of the secondary ip reaction between pei and chloride remaining on the tfc1 0 membrane surface 38 39 therefore to reduce the density of the graft carrier membrane we decreased the concentration of pip of tfcx membrane in fig s2 by comprehensive considering of the rejection of mg2 and water flux of membranes the pa layer prepared with pip concentration of 0 35 wt tfc0 35 membrane was used as the initial pa layer for pei grafting modification to be in view of the concentration and molecular weight of pei play a different role in the valid content of grafting amine groups then we turned our attention to the selection of the suitable concentration and molecular weight of grafted pei in fig 9 as the improvement of grafting concentration of pei under the same molecular weight the rejection of mg2 was significantly increasing along with the decline of water flux the rise of mg2 rejection can be explained from two aspects on the one hand the donnan exclusion effect of nf membrane is played a role by the enhancement of the electropositivity of membrane surface because of the protonation of amino offered by pei which can be verified by the result of zeta potential fig 6d combining with the analysis result of mwco in fig 5b c the other reason could be conceived that the pore size of the tfc0 35 peiy membrane decreased by the second ip reaction between pei and acyl chloride monomers remained after formation the pa layer of tfc0 35 membrane however although the abundant amine groups will amplify the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface the decrease of pore size and the increase of pa layer thickness are the primary reasons for the lower of water flux with the increase of pei graft content continuously the rejection of mg2 almost stabilized while the water flux still had a downward trend it could be considered that the amount of excess acyl chloride left on the pa layer was limited the grafting content gradually reached saturation due to the restriction of the reaction site while due to the steric hindrance of the molecules the different molecular size of pei grafted has a role impact in separation performance under the same grafting concentration three different molecular weights of pei grafted on the membrane were compared and analyzed of salt rejection and permeability in fig 9a d at the same graft concentration of 0 15 wt the rejection of mgcl2 and licl was 87 4 and 52 1 of tfc0 35 pei600 membrane 97 0 and 60 2 of tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane 87 2 and 47 9 of tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane respectively while the margin of water flux between tfc0 35 peiy membranes grafted by three molecular weight of pei was less than 10 0 l m 2 h 1 within an admissible limit the otherness of membrane rejection to mgcl2 and licl between different molecular weights of pei grafted can be mainly ascribed to the change of pore size and this was consisting with the analysis of mwco in fig 5c the mwco of tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane is minimum when the content of remaining acyl chloride monomers on the tfc0 35 membrane was fixed the degree of secondary interface polymerization and the compactness of pa layer depended on the content of effective amine groups introduced by pei within a certain range 40 therefore integrated into account of steric hindrance and content of carried amine groups by pei the pa active layer of tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane had a high density led to the best rejection of mgcl2 the water flux of mgcl2 and licl remained above 60 l m 2 h 1 and 80 l m 2 h 1 which reached about 120 and 130 of tfc1 0 pei3000 below 50 l m 2 h 1 and 60 l m 2 h 1 correspondingly to achieve improving permeability of membrane through decreasing the cross linkage of original pa layer next the selectivity ability of grafted membranes was measured in mixed salt solution with licl and mgcl2 in fig 10a the rejection of grafted membranes with three molecular weights of pei to mg2 shows an increasing trend and the water flux shows an opposite trend and this is corresponded to the test results during through a single solution all tfc0 35 peiy membranes had a significant promotion for the selectivity ability of mg2 and li by contrast with tfc0 35 membrane sli mg 1 6 in fig 10d while at the same grafted concentration of pei 0 15 wt the rejection of mg2 fig 10a and li fig 10b reached 92 0 97 2 91 5 and 18 5 5 9 20 2 corresponding with the tfc0 35 pei600 tfc0 35 pei3000 and tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane respectively tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane had the prime rejection of mg2 it can be conceived that the strong effect of pore size sieving is dominant and integrated with the improved repulsion of the positively charged surface in fig 10b the li rejection of tfc0 35 pei600 and tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane appear negative value caused by the relatively loose pa active layer compared to the tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane which is conductive to li permeate and synergistically exerts electrostatic repulsive effect however the other two grafted membrane owned a lower rejection of mg2 in comparison with tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane resulted in decreasing the purity of li in permeate solution in fig 10d the sli mg was 14 8 33 6 14 1 corresponding with tfc0 35 pei600 tfc0 35 pei3000 tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane hence the tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane had the optimum separation efficiency of mg2 and li moreover table 2 shows the li purity and recovery of tfc0 35 and tfc0 35 peiy the ηli of tfc0 35 tfc0 35 pei600 tfc0 35 pei3000 tfc0 35 pei10000 membrane were 7 42 63 and 41 the lir of corresponding membrane were 66 53 59 26 47 03 and 60 11 respectively the tfc0 35 peiy membranes by pei grafting all achieved a high degree of li purity with the highest purity of li in the permeate after the tfc0 35 pei3000 nanofiltration operation improving the purity of li can reduce the degree of difficulty for lithium extraction in the following operation processes however the increase of li purity would sacrifice some li recovery appropriately compared the nf membranes fabricated by two methods both of them improved the separation performance and selectivity of li and mg2 greatly but there are some differences in separation mechanism between them for the pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane the ip reaction degree is weakened due to the difference in diffusion rate between large amine monomer pei and small amine monomer pip therefore the introduction of pei prepared a thinner and relatively loose pa layer than tfc1 0 membrane which improved the flux of membrane however the tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane generated a thick and compact pa layer because of the secondary ip reaction between pei and tmc than tfc0 35 membrane which cut down the flux but improved rejection to mg2 of membrane both method i and method ii impaired the electronegativity of membrane surface because the protonation of amine groups from pei therefore although pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane has a relatively loose active layer the strong electropositivity of the membrane surface enhanced the rejection of li and mg2 and improves the selectivity between them but for tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane the enhancement of positive charge density on the membrane surface cooperating with the decrease of the pore size of membrane realized the effective separation of li and mg2 noticeably by fixing the content of the reaction monomer acyl chloride tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane only needed less than half of the amine reaction monomer amount on the pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane to achieve the equivalent separation performance of lithium and magnesium 3 5 the stability performance of membrane membrane stability is also an important index to assess the performance of nf membranes to evaluate the stability of pip0 6 pei0 4 and tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane the membranes were tested by long term nanofiltration operation in the mixed solution both of two modified membrane present excellent stability in fig 11a where the rejection of pip0 6 pei0 4 and tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane to mg2 and li was maintained around 97 8 38 6 and 96 7 8 6 respectively meanwhile considering the presence of inorganic salt ions in the salt lake brine 41 including ca2 na cl and so4 2 where the ca2 and so4 2 brought a great challenge to the performance of membrane when they deposited on separation layer over the long term filtration of nanofiltration membrane for purpose of testing the anti scaling ability of prepared membranes the water flux of the membrane was measured with a certain concentration of mixture solution with nacl 21 mmol na2so4 19 mmol and cacl2 23 mmol by way of continuous nanofiltration operation for 22 h the water fluxes of tfc1 0 pip0 6 pei0 4 tfc0 35 and tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane were reached 83 9 88 0 74 9 and 84 1 of the initial water fluxes respectively which is showed in fig 11b c comparing tfc1 0 to pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane tfc0 35 to tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane respectively the water flux of both the latter membrane appeared a relatively gently decline in the initial determination and the degree of water flux reduction was small among the same operation time moreover the pip0 6 pei0 4 and tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane still maintained 95 8 and 94 8 of initial flux after regeneration separately whereas about 10 decrease of initial flux was presented to unmodified membrane table s3 the outstanding anti scaling ability of pip0 6 pei0 4 and tfc0 35 pei3000 membranes mainly attributed to the donnan effect which make a stronger divalent cation repulsion is more conducive to maintaining an outstanding separation performance and stability in practical applications in comparison with tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane had a more excellent ability of scaling resistance due the lower electronegative on the membrane by contrast with their zeta potential in fig 6c and d we summarized several reported researches in improving the selectivity separation of li and mg2 from salt lake brines to evaluate the nf performance of membranes developed by this work table 3 and fig 12 according to the table 3 the membranes prepared by two methods in this paper show not only high sli mg but acceptable water flux however it is explained in other literatures that the rejection of mg2 is highly sensitive to the sli mg 30 this means that as long as the rejection of mg2 is infinitely close to the 100 a higher sli mg will be obtained even if the rejection of li reach to 90 therefore this paper calculates the purity and recovery of li and compares it with other literatures compared with most of membranes shown in fig 12 tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane exhibits not only higher lir but also higher ηp in permeate although pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane has similar sli mg and ηp with tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane the lir is relatively poor in general both of membranes prepared by two methods have higher sli mg but tfc0 35 pei3000 is more in compliance with the actual requirements for li extraction in li mg separation 4 conclusion in this work we investigated the preparation of nanofiltration membranes by introducing pei in two methods both modifications with simple process achieved the reduction of the electronegativity of membrane surface and made a certain influence on the extent of cross linking and hydrophilicity of membrane the introduction of pei as aqueous monomer method i reduced the cross linkage and electronegativity of the membrane which slightly improved the permeability of the membrane but also improved the selectivity of mg2 and li the rejection to mg2 enhanced from 92 7 to 98 1 and the purity of li enhance twice time the separation factor sli mg increased to 32 3 meanwhile the water flux could reach 61 8 l m 2 h 1 for the membrane fabricated by grafting pei method ii the cross linkage extent and thickness of the membrane were increased by secondary interfacial polymerization along with the decrease of water flux but still reached 57 6 l m 2 h 1 remarkably the improvement of cross linkage extent of pa layer and the decrease electronegativity of membrane surface improved the rejection of mg2 from 14 6 to 97 2 in addition the purity of li reached 63 in comparison membranes with two modified methods pip0 6 pei0 4 membrane had a high rejection of mg2 while tfc0 35 pei3000 membrane with the similar sli mg with pip0 6 pei0 4 not only economized raw materials in the prepared process of membrane but also possesses excellent li recovery and purity in permeate which was better to extract more lithium resources from salt lake brines moreover the simplicity of the membranes production process and excellent ability of anti calcium of the membranes will be more powerful to achieve the factory

12403,in this study we evaluate the performance of the newly developed periodic transmembrane pressure technique ptmp in relation to two conventional physical antifouling techniques namely backwashing and backpulsing in the context of the filtration of oily water systems using ceramic membranes the results demonstrate that the novel ptmp established higher performance than the other two techniques values of the overall permeate volume steady state permeate flux residual flux and fouling reversibility using the ptmp were shown to be higher than those of the other two techniques in addition visual inspection of the internal surface of membrane channels post filtration shows that the ptmp achieved a clean as new surface compared to the other two techniques resistances in series model analysis was employed to inspect and analyze the development of fouling upon using the three techniques ptmp presented a negligible internal resistance and a small cake layer resistance compared to backwashing pulsatile flow and regular crossflow filtration the ptmp is therefore a promising physical antifouling method that can be implemented in an existing crossflow filtration system with basic modification in addition to the ease of use and energy efficiency keywords ceramic membranes oily wastewater fouling pulsatile flow backflushing backpulsing periodic transmembrane pressure data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction membrane separation has grown in applications and uses over the past decades membrane fouling is generally a fundamental obstacle to improving the operational performance of membranes 1 5 deposition and accumulation of foulants at the surface and within the pores of the membrane reduce permeation flux compromise its selectivity feature and significantly shorten its lifetime 6 an associated phenomenon with the filtration processes is concentration polarization which arises due to the aggregation of dispersals and pollutants near and at the surface of the membrane in this case the concentration of dispersals in the vicinity of the membrane becomes larger than it is in the bulk and a diffusion flux is generated toward the bulk fluid concentration polarization can be minimized by adopting a crossflow filtration methodology 7 fouling can develop internally in the membrane at its surface or both while internal fouling is characterized by the deposition and adsorption of dispersals within the pores of the membrane external fouling can lead to the formation of a cake layer at the membrane surface 8 it has been proposed that there is a permeate flux below which fouling is not promptly observed 9 10 this concept has been used to define what is called critical flux therefore when the permeate flux is very low such that permeation drag is not enough to drag suspended dispersals toward the membrane surface no fouling would occur and the hydraulic conductivity will essentially be the one associated with the seepage of a clean fluid in this case the random molecular motion of the fluid is thought to be enough to support resistance to permeation drag when crossflow filtration methodology is adapted an increase in the critical flux value may be anticipated and in this case the turbulence intensity caused by the crossflow field would be the dominant resistance to permeation drag 11 in pressure driven filtrations the seepage of the continuous phase through the membrane pores induces hydrodynamic forces that drag dispersals toward the membrane other forces such as interfacial tension buoyancy and gravity may also influence the stability of dispersals at the surface of the membrane in crossflow filtration on the other hand another two force comes into play the first of which is the hydrodynamic drag along the membrane surface which must be accounted for when studying the fate of pinned dispersals 12 and the second is the lift force which arises due to the asymmetric flow field around pinned droplets 13 this second force is relatively small compared with the first 13 in the filtration of oily water systems the balance of forces torques acting on pinned droplets over the pores of a membrane may be used to determine the fate of these droplets 14 15 understanding the interactions between pinned droplets the continuous fluid and the membrane can provide mechanistic insight into membrane fouling 16 contrasted to solid foulants oil droplets behave in a completely different manner at the surface of the membrane they can deform cluster coalesce breakup penetrate and occlude membrane pores 17 20 as a result controlling membrane fouling by optimizing the operating conditions e g transmembrane pressure crossflow velocity is critical 21 22 in fact the selectivity feature of membranes used in the filtration of oily water systems is not determined by the sizes of the dispersed oil droplets in relation to the pores size of the membrane rather it is determined by the interfacial tension and affinity properties of the droplet surface pair 23 when a droplet pins over a pore opening four fates have been identified namely pinning permeation breakup or rejection 24 these fates are determined via conducting force and torque balance over pinned droplets in crossflow filtration 25 a fate map may be constructed where it is possible to identify the behavior of pinned droplets by comparing the operating and critical conditions 26 through fouling development two stages may be identified namely reversible and irreversible fouling while reversible fouling occurs at the early stage of the filtration process irreversible fouling occurs at a later stage 27 in reversible fouling foulants are loosely attached to the membrane surface and thus can effectively be removed via physical cleaning in irreversible fouling on the other hand foulants are tightly bound to the membrane surface and can only be removed in most cases via chemical cleaning 28 although crossflow filtration methodology is effective in reducing reversible fouling development under optimized operating conditions it is not as effective in handling irreversible fouling this results in membrane pores blocking the formation of a cake layer and a decline in the overall permeate flux therefore it is important to note that most physical antifouling technologies work by dividing the lifetime of the membrane into small periods over which only reversible fouling occurs the most prevalent physical antifouling treatment methods are essentially hydrodynamic based they include forward and reverse flushing 29 backflushing 30 backpulsing 31 and surface shearing 32 backflush 33 39 and pulsatile flow 40 42 have become largely standard procedures associated with crossflow filtration system for oily wastewater o w separation in backflushing the forward flow from the feed to the permeate is reversed by pumping the permeate backwards toward the feed while deactivating the crossflow this allows the relatively clean permeate to penetrate via membrane pores toward the feed side carrying with it ganglia of the oil residing inside the pores and also pushing pinned droplets at the surface toward the main stream of the feed the duration of the backwashing in relation to filtration may be optimized 43 44 since permeate production is usually costly one of the major disadvantages of backwashing is the usage of the permeate to clean off the membrane furthermore the need to pause the filtration process during backwashing adds another drawback the major concern however with respect to backwashing is the possible destruction of the active layer of the membrane due to the backflow in pulsatile flow on the other hand the permeate channel is closed and a chain of pulses is generated in the feed channel at regular intervals to destabilize pinned droplets and enhance the cleaning of the membrane surface while the crossflow is in operation the duration of the pulse is generally small compared to the filtration period the drawback of backpulses is the need to close the permeate channel during this process and also its localized effect due to the dissipation of the pulse energy as it moves away from the source recently a new technique has been introduced that belongs to the physical methods for fouling control 11 31 this is called the periodic transmembrane pressure technique ptmp in this technique the transmembrane pressure tmp drops to zero in a periodic manner when the tmp equals the operating one filtration occurs and when it drops to zero cleaning occurs in other words when the tmp is set to zero i e no permeation the permeation drag becomes zero and no more droplets find their way toward the membrane in addition pinned and permeating droplets lose an important force that contributes to their attachment to the surface in this case the interfacial tension force becomes the only force holding the droplets over the surface for which the crossflow drag becomes enough to dislodge them this technique can be implemented very easily without major modification of existing units in this case only the valve at the permeate exit has to be designed to open and close according to the desired ptmp pattern the authors therefore find it legitimate that a comparison study be conducted on these physical cleaning techniques to gain more insight into their performance in the present study the backwash and pulsatile flow methodologies are compared to the performance of the newly developed ptmp 45 46 three optimized cycles pertinent to these methods will be the basis of the comparisons the experimental work was conducted on a labbrain cfu022 crossflow ceramic membrane filtration unit manufactured by liqtech international 47 while the system provides automation over the backwash and pulsatile flow cleaning methods it is not equipped with such automation for the ptmp technique therefore this last method will be conducted manually as will be explained later furthermore the experiments for the backflushing and pulsatile flow techniques abide to the limitations recommended by the manufacturer of the system 2 physical antifouling overview physical antifouling techniques pat strive to alleviate membrane fouling by avoiding the aggregation of oil droplets at the membrane surface and within its pores during continuous crossflow filtration a physical antifouling occurrence is performed before the membrane is intensely covered with adherent droplets hydraulic cleaning is no longer effective after irreversible fouling has occurred as a result the best strategy to prevent fouling is to untie the embedded droplets before they coalesce and cluster forming a gel cake layer by shortening their residence time on the membrane pores in backflushing the crossflow system in the feed channel is switched off and a small volume of the permeate is pumped back toward the feed in doing so the permeate carries with it slugs of the droplets residing inside the pores and also ejects pinned droplets from the surface 48 to acquire this process an additional system needs to be added to the filtration unit to provide the required back pressure to reverse the flow within the backwashing period in doing so caution must be watched not to destroy the active layer of the membrane the backwash is affected by interval time cycle cleaning duration and backwash strength 49 fig 1a shows a schematic of an idealized pressure pattern in the feed and permeate during the cycle pulsatile flow on the other hand is a standard in situ physical antifouling technique integrated into a crossflow filtration system for ceramic membrane fouling mitigation and control during the pulsatile flow short pulses are generated periodically in the feed channel for a specific time interval or when the applied pressure gradient achieves a critical level under constant permeate flux filtration 50 crossflow pulses are introduced by a hammer valve actuated by a compressed air system at frequencies of about 0 1 to 2 hz typically for less than a second during this process the permeate channel is closed 31 two main pulsatile flow parameters can be adjusted namely frequency and duration 51 53 fig 1b shows an idealized pressure pattern in the feed channel with a pressure pulse during the cleaning time the periodic transmembrane pressure approach recognizes the impact of permeation drag in bringing dispersals toward the membrane surface if it is possible to intervene with this hydrodynamic force it would then be easier to reduce the concentration of dispersals in the vicinity of the membrane and deprive pinned droplets of a force that helps them adhere to the surface the idea of the ptmp is to divide the operational times into small periods in each period the tmp alternate between the operating value and zero therefore when the tmp is high filtration occurs and when it is zero cleaning occurs 45 fig 1c shows a schematic of an idealized pressure pattern during the ptmp 3 the experimental setup and operation the experiments on the three physical antifouling techniques have been conducted on a labbrain cfu022 crossflow ceramic membrane filtration unit manufactured by liqtech international hobro denmark supplementary material fig s1 both the pulsatile flow and backflushing antifouling techniques are built and automated in the system however the ptmp technique is not and would have therefore to be conducted manually fig 2 shows a picture of the display and control panel the holder of the membrane is shown in fig 3 and a schematic of the filtration unit is shown in fig 4 as shown the unit is equipped with a circulation pump a set of valves to direct the flow two tanks one for the feed and another for the permeate and two flow meters a compressed air system is also included to provide the required backwash pressure as well as the pressure pulses a computerized panel is used to control the operation of the unit during the different regimes normal filtration operation involves running the pump with valves v1 v3 v4 and v6 open as shown in fig 4 during backflushing regime the feed pump is turned off leading the pressure on the feed side to drop to zero the backflushing system which is located on the permeate side is then set to operation and the pressure in the permeate increases to reverse the flow once the backwash period is finished the system returns automatically back to normal operation during the back pulsing mode the permeate side is closed hence no flow through the membrane and the back pulse system is activated to generate pulses at small regular intervals in the feed channel to dislodge pinned droplets the duration of these pulses is quite small typically a fraction of a second in the ptmp technique on the other hand the system runs in normal operational mode with the valve in the permeate side v4 opens and closes at a predetermined pattern since the filtration unit does not support this mode it has been conducted manually table 1 shows the sequence followed during these operational modes the membrane housing cell fig 3 has an outer diameter of 25 1 mm and a length of 305 1 mm the filtration unit is equipped with a feed pump grundfos crn 3 6 with a capacity of 5 m3 h at 2 5 bars two on off valves are from bürkert three solenoid valves from festo one loop

synthesized produced water is prepared supplementary material figs s2 3 characterized table 2 3 and fed to the unit to run the experiments all the crossflow experiments were performed in batch mode in order to maintain the feed concentration constant the retentate was immediately returned to the oily wastewater container where the permeate was measured before being directed back to the feed stream prior to starting the crossflow experiment the filtration unit settings were adjusted the speed of the pump and the percentage opening of the retentate valve were adjusted progressively to the right level to run the experiment for tmp and cfv values for pulsatile flow backwashing the unit touchpad setting panel automatically sets up the interval time and duration inputs supplementary material figs s4 5 when the pressure inside the filtration unit has stabilized the datalog is enabled and all data including tmp cfv temperature valve opening percentages feed flow rate permeate flow fate and retentate flow rate are automatically logged every 3 s it is important to note that the data logging time is sometimes longer than some events e g the time period of pressure pulses and in this case they were not recorded both the backwash and pulsatile flow techniques utilize a compressed air pneumatic system to provide the required pressure to reverse the permeate in backwashing and generate the pulses in pulsatile flow the membrane oil rejection performance table 2 3 was calculated using equation 1 1 rejection 1 c p c f x 100 where cf and c p are the oil content of the feed and permeate

water oil droplet in contact with the membrane surface in the air giving values of 35 and 135 respectively figs s11 12 supplementary material illustrated the sequence of the droplets adsorption at the membrane surface all measurements were done in triplicate 5 design of the filtration experiments as indicated earlier this study investigates the operational efficiency of a ceramic membrane unit upon its use in the filtration of oily wastewater systems in the presence of three different physical antifouling techniques the operating conditions of the pulsatile flow backwashing and periodic transmembrane pressure techniques were optimized for a feed oil content of 200 ppm for each of the physical cleaning processes the degree of fouling and fouling extenuation was examined using a resistance model to inspect the accumulation of oil droplets at the membrane surface in addition at the end of the operational period the ceramic membrane was visually inspected to determine the level of membrane fouling supplementary material figs s13 14 finally the efficiency residual flux reversibility and permeate volume were measured and compared to investigate the membrane s overall performance under each physical antifouling process the ptmp bf and bp parameterization were based on the optimized operating parameters collected from our previous work reported in table 7 the experimental procedure for the ptmp has been reported in detail in our previous work 45 the applied ptmp has been set up by an on off valve v3 angle seat valve manufactured by bürkert that controls the permeate flow the operation can be controlled and operated with a small integrated operating cabinet consisting of a touch screen all the set actual features and values are displayed and can be operated from the pad touch screen in reference 45 three scenarios have been tested namely ptmp 1 1 ptmp 1 2 and ptmp 2 2 where the transmembrane pressure fluctuated by an on off valve when the valve is on normal filtration is in process and when it is off cleaning takes place this process and its physics were extensively explained in reference 45 for example ptmp 1 2 pattern means that the filtration is on for one minute i e valve v3 is on and the crossflow cleaning takes two minutes i e v3 is closed the 1 2 tmp pattern cycle is repeated for the entire experiment time of 120 min 6 results and discussion to investigate the impact of the three physical antifouling techniques on the performance of ceramic membranes during the crossflow filtration of oily water systems a number of performance parameters have been identified and compared these include the efficiency of the filtration process fouling reversibility residual flux steady state permeate flux and total permeate volume they were examined for each scenario to show how they differ among the three antifouling techniques in addition a resistance in series model analysis and post filtration visual inspection were used to determine the fouling mitigation capacity of the studied methods in this study the membrane permeate flux for the ceramic membrane was measured for the experimental time of 2 h at a tmp of 1 5 bar and a cfv of 1 m s with no antifouling technique implemented as shown in fig 5 the normalized permeate flux declines with time with significant reduction manifested in the first 10 min of the filtration time reaching 25 of the initial flux 57 which is in fact typical behavior of filtration systems undergoing uncontrolled fouling in this work the permeate flux is normalized by the maximum flux which is the flux at the start of operation of a new or regenerated membrane the normalized flux continues to decline albeit at a relatively slower rate for another 20 30 min reaching approximately 15 of its initial value after 30 min the membrane flux nearly stabilizes to asymptotically achieve a steady state stage in which case the detachment of pinning droplets due to hydrodynamic drag of the crossflow field nearly balances the incoming flux of new droplets 58 59 while this may be the case over a longer filtration time in our experimental work the flux slightly continues to decline at a slower rate reaching 9 of the initial flux at the end of the 2 h experiments to assess the extent of the fouling development on the ceramic membrane surface fig s13 supplementary material illustrated the severity of fouling accretion on the internal membrane channel surface after 2 h of the experiment fig s13 also depicted the shear cleaning potential during the normal crossflow filtration system is limited in mitigating fouling formation 60 furthermore the ceramic membrane surface water post cleaning also could not remove the deposited oil from the membrane surface and restore it to its original state apparently the two operating conditions i e the crossflow velocity and the transmembrane pressure have a significant impact on fouling development the larger the cfv and the lower the tmp the better the quality of the permeate and the less the development of fouling 13 however the increase in the cfv is restricted by the scouring and damage of the active layer of the membrane 61 therefore the margin in controlling the cfv seems not large and we are left with the other parameter namely the tmp the tmp is mainly responsible for the filtration capacity and the quality of the permeate it can also be controlled over a wider range compared with the cfv hence it is anticipated that controlling this parameter may contribute to the control of fouling development when tmp is large a larger volume of the permeate is collected however the quality is lower and vice versa interrupting the tmp periodically interrupts permeation flux which drags oil droplets toward the membrane and also makes the cfv effective in dislodging pinned droplets 62 likewise reducing the residence time of pinned droplets requires that the frequency of changing the tmp is large 45 figs 6 and s15 a supplementary material display the normalized flux pattern during the 1 2 ptmp application for the whole 2 h experiment and 10 min of early stage filtration respectively the 1 2 ptmp refers to a 1 min permeation cycle and a 2 min cleaning cycle the flux behavior during the 1 2 ptmp shown in fig 6a is distinct from the non ptmp normal filtration mode shown in fig 5 during each ptmp cycle the flux starts at the highest normalized value i e 1 0 or closer to 1 0 as indicated by the yellow circles and then decreases due to the pinning of droplets at pore openings and the declining in tmp at a later stage fig 6b depicts the state of the membrane at the start of the permeation cycle which indicates that the membrane starts the filtration in a very clean state the fact that the flux recovers to almost its initial value proves the effectiveness of the ptmp technique it is interesting to note that during the cleaning cycle the tmp does not drop abruptly to zero rather it takes a little time to drop as depicted in fig s16 supplementary material during which permeation continues to drop to zero as indicated by the red circles 45 as the permeation slows down with the drop in the applied tmp this allows crossflow drag to take control and initiate the cleaning process when the tmp becomes zero permeation flux likewise becomes zero as marked with the red circles in fig 6a the data in fig 6a can be divided into three sections the yellow circle data which represent permeation flux at the start of the filtration process the blue circles data representing permeation during both filtration and cleaning cycles and the red data demonstrate the flux when the tmp has dropped to zero after membrane regeneration the filtration unit has been set to pulsatile flow mode 31 fig 7a depicts the permeate flux profile when the pulsatile flow is utilized it is clear that the higher frequency of the pulses effectively combats fouling while maintaining the permeate flux to the highest values figs 7a and s15 b supplementary material show the permeate flux profile for the 2 h experiment and 10 min in the early stage of pulsatile flow respectively overall it is evident that the backpulsing antifouling technique is effective in combatting fouling the permeate flux is comparably high to the flux based on normal filtration at the end of the experiment the permeate flux reached 74 of the initial value however the flux right after each pulse cycle yellow circles does not seem to start from a near clean membrane indicating the accumulation of droplets and the development of fouling albeit at a slower rate as shown in fig 7b this may be attributed to the fact that the generated backpulse has a local effect in other words the effect of the pulse is strong where it is generated and as it dissipates away its effect diminishes this makes the cleaning process effective locally rather than along the whole membrane in the backwashing antifouling technique the filtration process is paused for a few seconds 3 s and the accumulated permeate is backwardly circulated to the feed through the membrane the flow of the permeate back to the feed sweeps off oil slugs from the membrane and also pushes pinned droplets toward the main feed stream when normal operation is pursued the surface of the membrane is presumably clean however since the duration of the filtration process is much longer than that of the backwashing the accumulation of the droplets at the surface intensifies making the backwashing technique of local effect in the area around pore openings 63 in other words for the backflushing to be effective it is believed that its frequency should be relatively large however enlarging the frequency of backwashing may affect the stability of the membrane destroy its active layer and consume considerable power to activate the system on the other hand increasing the duration of the backflush can also influence permeation flux therefore it is an optimization exercise to select the appropriate conditions fig s17 supplementary material illustrates the effect of the backwashing interval time period on the membrane final steady state flux for different filtration periods the best backwashing configuration applied to the crossflow filtration is found to be 5 min intervals and 3 s of backwashing cleaning for 2 h fig 8a shows the normalized flux pattern for the 2 h overall filtration time the yellow circles represent the normalized flux at the start of each permeation cycle then the flux sharply drops to zero when the backwashing starts for 3 s the drop in the permeate flux to zero is faster than the response time of the flow meter and hence was not recorded fig 8b shows the flux at the start of the permeation cycle i e after the backwashing from which it is clear that the membrane starts each cycle in an almost clean state there seems however to exist a tendency of declining the flux in the long run fig s15 c supplementary material illustrates the backwashing profile during the first 10 min of filtration where the permeate flux profile starts from the highest value before quickly declining and then sharply drops to zero although was not captured it is very hard to establish point wise comparisons between the normalized flux profiles for the three studied scenarios because of the complex pattern of each one and the lack of a common base of comparison however macroscopic parameters may shed light on which technique shows better results one such parameter is the total permeate volume collected 6 1 resistance model a good measure of the state of the membrane at the end of the filtration process is to compare the resistances of the membrane the intrinsic resistance of a membrane is that of a fresh clean membrane it is a resistance to the flow that is attributed to the internal structure of the membrane during the operation oil droplets pin to the surface of the membrane and at pore openings as well as to the walls of the internal pores hence more resistances build up as pinned droplets cluster and coalesce with other incoming droplets films are formed and the accumulation of which forms a cake layer that significantly increases the total resistance the resistance is therefore the sum of the intrinsic membrane resistance the resistance due to internal blocking and the resistance due to the cake layer formation it is possible to measure the contribution of these resistances along with the total one and they would provide information about the effectiveness of these methods the intrinsic resistance of a fresh membrane is measured by performing simple filtration experiments with ro water in which different tmps and the corresponding permeate fluxes are measured from which the permeability is determined by fitting a linear relationship 64 65 likewise the total resistance at the end of the different filtration experiments of oily water systems is measured by repeating the filtration with pure water experiments of the uncleaned membrane the resistance due to internal blocking on the other hand is measured at the end of the filtration experiments by cleaning the surface and conducting the permeation experiments with pure water 5 66 67 therefore if the overall resistance of the membrane at the end of the experiments is r t the intrinsic membrane resistance of fresh membrane is r m the resistance caused by the formation of the cake layer is r c and the internal resistance caused by the adsorption is r i then the following eq 2 applies 68 2 r t r m r c r i as explained the values of the resistances were determined using experimental data fig s18 supplementary material and applying the following eq 3 3 j tmp μ r t where j is the membrane steady state permeate flux tmp is transmembrane pressure μ is the permeate viscosity and r t is the total hydraulic resistance fig 9 shows the four components of the resistances for the normal crossflow filtration case along with the three filtration methods in the presence of one of the antifouling techniques it is clear that all resistance components except for the intrinsic one are higher than the other cases this asserts that the antifouling techniques are effective in combatting fouling compared with the normal filtration system with no antifouling measure existing it also shows that the differences between the three antifouling techniques are insignificant however there are some interesting features worth mentioning the first one is related to the resistance due to internal pore blocking and the second one is related to the cake layer resistance it may be noticed that the ptmp technique shows almost clean internal membrane pores and negligible resistance if at all in contrast to the backwashing technique which shows the development of internal resistance even though the ptmp technique only affects pined droplets at the membrane surface no buildup of oil ganglia inside the pores of the membrane is noticed in contrast in backwashing the permeate is forced to move back toward the feed dragging with it oil ganglia back to the feed this may be explained in light of the filtration time vs the cleaning time in the studied cases the 1 2 ptmp provides a more frequent and longer cleaning pattern in other words not enough time for the droplets to permeate is offered however in the backwashing technique the longer filtration time and the shorter backwashing allow pinned droplets to permeate and populate inside the membrane furthermore the developed cake layer along the membrane surface is smaller than it is in the other two antifouling techniques these observations indicate that the ptmp methodology is more effective than the other two antifouling techniques it is possible to establish another parameter that can be used to compare the efficacy of the different antifouling techniques in relation to the normal filtration methodology without the antifouling mechanism implemented such a parameter defines the efficiency of each physical antifouling based on the resistance analysis 69 71 therefore if r at is the total resistance with an antifouling mechanism implemented and r t is the total resistance for the crossflow filtration without an antifouling cleaning one can define the efficiency as 4 η 1 r at r t apparently if r at r t i e the total resistance with and without an antifouling technique is the same this implies that the implemented antifouling technique is ineffective and the efficiency is zero as shown in fig 10 the ptmp shows the largest efficiency compared with the other two techniques it depicts that the ptmp presents a higher physical antifouling efficiency of 88 followed by a pulsatile flow of 86 and backwashing flow of 78 compared to the regular crossflow filtration considered as a reference 6 2 residual flux gain and the overall permeate volume residual flux reversibility and the overall collected permeate volume are additional parameters that were investigated to measure the performance of the ceramic membrane during the filtration of oily water systems in crossflow filtration with and without an antifouling methodology the measurement of the steady state flux of pure water after the physical cleaning of the membrane indicates the severity of fouling and the efficacy of the implemented antifouling methodology flux recovery is the ratio of the permeate flux of pure water of used and clean membranes therefore if j u is the permeate flux of pure water through a used membrane i e after it has been used in a filtration exercise and j 0 is the permeate flux of pure water of a clean membrane residual flux rf is given by eq 5 5 rf j u j 0 fig 11 illustrates that the ptmp pulsatile flow backwashing and crossflow modes recover 80 73 46 and 10 of the initial flux of the ro water respectively one may define the difference between the fluxes of pure water for membranes after being used in filtration experiments of oily water systems with and without an antifouling methodology implemented therefore if j u is the permeate flux of a used membrane at the end of the experiment with an antifouling technique implemented and j f is the permeate flux for a membrane with no antifouling implemented then the difference between them defines the gain obtained by implementing an antifouling methodology likewise the difference between the flux of pure water over a fresh new membrane j 0 and that for a membrane used with no antifouling methodology implemented j f defines the maximum flux that could be achieved the ratio between them defines the gain obtained by implementing a particular antifouling technology in other words one may define the following equation 6 g j u j f j 0 j f fig 12 describes the gain or recovery of all physical antifouling techniques compared to crossflow filtration mode with no antifouling implemented at the end of the experiment the results show that the recovery by implementing ptmp pulsatile flow and backwashing are 78 70 and 40 respectively on the other hand given that both the ptmp and the backwashing have a cleaning period during which no permeation occurs and in the backflushing part of the permeate is even pumped back to the feed it is anticipated that such a process would affect the overall permeate volume collected at the end of the experiments as discussed earlier there is an agreement about the shortcoming of the backflushing on the membrane permeate volume using the permeate for cleaning may cause a loss of production level 41 therefore it would be interesting to know how would the cleaning time in addition to the reduction in permeate flux due to fouling affect the collected volume of permeate at the end of the experiments fig 13 illustrates that the ptmp demonstrated the largest ceramic membrane permeation volume ptmp pulsatile flow backwashing and regular crossflow total permeate volume was 9 85 8 48 7 31 and 6 85 l respectively the drop in the permeate volume of the backwashing in addition to fouling may be attributed to the frequent use of the permeate for the membrane surface washing during the 2 h experiment ptmp utilized the crossflow feed to mitigate concentration polarization and surface fouling development an overview of the net filtration times and total permeate volume for every filtration mode is presented fig 14 the net filtration time of ptmp pulsatile flow backwashing and normal filtration were 40 120 118 8 and 120 min respectively for which the total permeate volumes are 9 85 8 48 7 34 and 6 85 l respectively the ptmp has a higher performance of 9 85 l over a short filtration time of 40 min due to the association of a cleaning half cycle of 2 min for every one minute half cycle filtration the implementation of ptmp in crossflow filtration mitigates fouling while maintaining higher membrane performance furthermore a visual inspection of the walls of the internal channels of the ceramic membrane was also performed the severity of fouling development during each physical antifouling technique was investigated figs s11 12 supplementary material demonstrated that the ptmp presents a clear and surface free oil at the end of the experiment compared to the other physical cleaning techniques pulsatile flow and backwashing that reveal the presence of oil adsorption at the membrane surface in the absence of the applied antifouling techniques the regular crossflow filtration process illustrated an important fouling development at the membrane surface even after the ro water post washing the periodic transmembrane pressure ptmp technique implemented in crossflow filtration has demonstrated the highest ceramic membrane performance in total permeate volume flux recovery and gain compared to the two other antifouling physical techniques namely pulsatile flow and backwashing ptmp is a new and efficient method of preventing ceramic membrane fouling this technique can be applied to any filtration unit without the need for modification or increased energy use 72 and does not require additional expenses 7 conclusion this study investigated physical antifouling strategies ptmp backwashing and pulsatile flow for their impact on membrane performance and fouling mitigation the physical antifouling performances were compared to select the best configuration to combat fouling while maintaining a high steady state permeate flux and overall permeate volume it was necessary to compare the newly developed ptmp with conventional cleaning methods such as backwashing and pulsatile flow to establish ceramic membranes physical cleaning capacity and productivity in this study the novel ptmp technique demonstrated higher oily wastewater filtration efficiency characterized by a total permeate volume flux recovery and fouling reversibility of 9 85 l 80 and 78 respectively visual inspection of the ceramic membrane internal channel walls undergoing each antifouling physical cleaning technique demonstrated that the ptmp post filtration membrane presented a clean new surface further analysis by the resistance in series model elucidated the fouling development in each physical process the results highlighted a major reversible cake layer resistance over the irreversible fouling ptmp exhibited a minor resistance profile cake layer internal resistance compared to those experienced in backwashing pulsatile flow and regular crossflow filtration modes in conclusion ptmp is a state of the art eco friendly technique that can easily be implemented into existing filtration systems with minimal modification ptmp offers cost efficiency and low energy consumption providing optimal membrane performance and antifouling results declaration

12403,in this study we evaluate the performance of the newly developed periodic transmembrane pressure technique ptmp in relation to two conventional physical antifouling techniques namely backwashing and backpulsing in the context of the filtration of oily water systems using ceramic membranes the results demonstrate that the novel ptmp established higher performance than the other two techniques values of the overall permeate volume steady state permeate flux residual flux and fouling reversibility using the ptmp were shown to be higher than those of the other two techniques in addition visual inspection of the internal surface of membrane channels post filtration shows that the ptmp achieved a clean as new surface compared to the other two techniques resistances in series model analysis was employed to inspect and analyze the development of fouling upon using the three techniques ptmp presented a negligible internal resistance and a small cake layer resistance compared to backwashing pulsatile flow and regular crossflow filtration the ptmp is therefore a promising physical antifouling method that can be implemented in an existing crossflow filtration system with basic modification in addition to the ease of use and energy efficiency keywords ceramic membranes oily wastewater fouling pulsatile flow backflushing backpulsing periodic transmembrane pressure data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction membrane separation has grown in applications and uses over the past decades membrane fouling is generally a fundamental obstacle to improving the operational performance of membranes 1 5 deposition and accumulation of foulants at the surface and within the pores of the membrane reduce permeation flux compromise its selectivity feature and significantly shorten its lifetime 6 an associated phenomenon with the filtration processes is concentration polarization which arises due to the aggregation of dispersals and pollutants near and at the surface of the membrane in this case the concentration of dispersals in the vicinity of the membrane becomes larger than it is in the bulk and a diffusion flux is generated toward the bulk fluid concentration polarization can be minimized by adopting a crossflow filtration methodology 7 fouling can develop internally in the membrane at its surface or both while internal fouling is characterized by the deposition and adsorption of dispersals within the pores of the membrane external fouling can lead to the formation of a cake layer at the membrane surface 8 it has been proposed that there is a permeate flux below which fouling is not promptly observed 9 10 this concept has been used to define what is called critical flux therefore when the permeate flux is very low such that permeation drag is not enough to drag suspended dispersals toward the membrane surface no fouling would occur and the hydraulic conductivity will essentially be the one associated with the seepage of a clean fluid in this case the random molecular motion of the fluid is thought to be enough to support resistance to permeation drag when crossflow filtration methodology is adapted an increase in the critical flux value may be anticipated and in this case the turbulence intensity caused by the crossflow field would be the dominant resistance to permeation drag 11 in pressure driven filtrations the seepage of the continuous phase through the membrane pores induces hydrodynamic forces that drag dispersals toward the membrane other forces such as interfacial tension buoyancy and gravity may also influence the stability of dispersals at the surface of the membrane in crossflow filtration on the other hand another two force comes into play the first of which is the hydrodynamic drag along the membrane surface which must be accounted for when studying the fate of pinned dispersals 12 and the second is the lift force which arises due to the asymmetric flow field around pinned droplets 13 this second force is relatively small compared with the first 13 in the filtration of oily water systems the balance of forces torques acting on pinned droplets over the pores of a membrane may be used to determine the fate of these droplets 14 15 understanding the interactions between pinned droplets the continuous fluid and the membrane can provide mechanistic insight into membrane fouling 16 contrasted to solid foulants oil droplets behave in a completely different manner at the surface of the membrane they can deform cluster coalesce breakup penetrate and occlude membrane pores 17 20 as a result controlling membrane fouling by optimizing the operating conditions e g transmembrane pressure crossflow velocity is critical 21 22 in fact the selectivity feature of membranes used in the filtration of oily water systems is not determined by the sizes of the dispersed oil droplets in relation to the pores size of the membrane rather it is determined by the interfacial tension and affinity properties of the droplet surface pair 23 when a droplet pins over a pore opening four fates have been identified namely pinning permeation breakup or rejection 24 these fates are determined via conducting force and torque balance over pinned droplets in crossflow filtration 25 a fate map may be constructed where it is possible to identify the behavior of pinned droplets by comparing the operating and critical conditions 26 through fouling development two stages may be identified namely reversible and irreversible fouling while reversible fouling occurs at the early stage of the filtration process irreversible fouling occurs at a later stage 27 in reversible fouling foulants are loosely attached to the membrane surface and thus can effectively be removed via physical cleaning in irreversible fouling on the other hand foulants are tightly bound to the membrane surface and can only be removed in most cases via chemical cleaning 28 although crossflow filtration methodology is effective in reducing reversible fouling development under optimized operating conditions it is not as effective in handling irreversible fouling this results in membrane pores blocking the formation of a cake layer and a decline in the overall permeate flux therefore it is important to note that most physical antifouling technologies work by dividing the lifetime of the membrane into small periods over which only reversible fouling occurs the most prevalent physical antifouling treatment methods are essentially hydrodynamic based they include forward and reverse flushing 29 backflushing 30 backpulsing 31 and surface shearing 32 backflush 33 39 and pulsatile flow 40 42 have become largely standard procedures associated with crossflow filtration system for oily wastewater o w separation in backflushing the forward flow from the feed to the permeate is reversed by pumping the permeate backwards toward the feed while deactivating the crossflow this allows the relatively clean permeate to penetrate via membrane pores toward the feed side carrying with it ganglia of the oil residing inside the pores and also pushing pinned droplets at the surface toward the main stream of the feed the duration of the backwashing in relation to filtration may be optimized 43 44 since permeate production is usually costly one of the major disadvantages of backwashing is the usage of the permeate to clean off the membrane furthermore the need to pause the filtration process during backwashing adds another drawback the major concern however with respect to backwashing is the possible destruction of the active layer of the membrane due to the backflow in pulsatile flow on the other hand the permeate channel is closed and a chain of pulses is generated in the feed channel at regular intervals to destabilize pinned droplets and enhance the cleaning of the membrane surface while the crossflow is in operation the duration of the pulse is generally small compared to the filtration period the drawback of backpulses is the need to close the permeate channel during this process and also its localized effect due to the dissipation of the pulse energy as it moves away from the source recently a new technique has been introduced that belongs to the physical methods for fouling control 11 31 this is called the periodic transmembrane pressure technique ptmp in this technique the transmembrane pressure tmp drops to zero in a periodic manner when the tmp equals the operating one filtration occurs and when it drops to zero cleaning occurs in other words when the tmp is set to zero i e no permeation the permeation drag becomes zero and no more droplets find their way toward the membrane in addition pinned and permeating droplets lose an important force that contributes to their attachment to the surface in this case the interfacial tension force becomes the only force holding the droplets over the surface for which the crossflow drag becomes enough to dislodge them this technique can be implemented very easily without major modification of existing units in this case only the valve at the permeate exit has to be designed to open and close according to the desired ptmp pattern the authors therefore find it legitimate that a comparison study be conducted on these physical cleaning techniques to gain more insight into their performance in the present study the backwash and pulsatile flow methodologies are compared to the performance of the newly developed ptmp 45 46 three optimized cycles pertinent to these methods will be the basis of the comparisons the experimental work was conducted on a labbrain cfu022 crossflow ceramic membrane filtration unit manufactured by liqtech international 47 while the system provides automation over the backwash and pulsatile flow cleaning methods it is not equipped with such automation for the ptmp technique therefore this last method will be conducted manually as will be explained later furthermore the experiments for the backflushing and pulsatile flow techniques abide to the limitations recommended by the manufacturer of the system 2 physical antifouling overview physical antifouling techniques pat strive to alleviate membrane fouling by avoiding the aggregation of oil droplets at the membrane surface and within its pores during continuous crossflow filtration a physical antifouling occurrence is performed before the membrane is intensely covered with adherent droplets hydraulic cleaning is no longer effective after irreversible fouling has occurred as a result the best strategy to prevent fouling is to untie the embedded droplets before they coalesce and cluster forming a gel cake layer by shortening their residence time on the membrane pores in backflushing the crossflow system in the feed channel is switched off and a small volume of the permeate is pumped back toward the feed in doing so the permeate carries with it slugs of the droplets residing inside the pores and also ejects pinned droplets from the surface 48 to acquire this process an additional system needs to be added to the filtration unit to provide the required back pressure to reverse the flow within the backwashing period in doing so caution must be watched not to destroy the active layer of the membrane the backwash is affected by interval time cycle cleaning duration and backwash strength 49 fig 1a shows a schematic of an idealized pressure pattern in the feed and permeate during the cycle pulsatile flow on the other hand is a standard in situ physical antifouling technique integrated into a crossflow filtration system for ceramic membrane fouling mitigation and control during the pulsatile flow short pulses are generated periodically in the feed channel for a specific time interval or when the applied pressure gradient achieves a critical level under constant permeate flux filtration 50 crossflow pulses are introduced by a hammer valve actuated by a compressed air system at frequencies of about 0 1 to 2 hz typically for less than a second during this process the permeate channel is closed 31 two main pulsatile flow parameters can be adjusted namely frequency and duration 51 53 fig 1b shows an idealized pressure pattern in the feed channel with a pressure pulse during the cleaning time the periodic transmembrane pressure approach recognizes the impact of permeation drag in bringing dispersals toward the membrane surface if it is possible to intervene with this hydrodynamic force it would then be easier to reduce the concentration of dispersals in the vicinity of the membrane and deprive pinned droplets of a force that helps them adhere to the surface the idea of the ptmp is to divide the operational times into small periods in each period the tmp alternate between the operating value and zero therefore when the tmp is high filtration occurs and when it is zero cleaning occurs 45 fig 1c shows a schematic of an idealized pressure pattern during the ptmp 3 the experimental setup and operation the experiments on the three physical antifouling techniques have been conducted on a labbrain cfu022 crossflow ceramic membrane filtration unit manufactured by liqtech international hobro denmark supplementary material fig s1 both the pulsatile flow and backflushing antifouling techniques are built and automated in the system however the ptmp technique is not and would have therefore to be conducted manually fig 2 shows a picture of the display and control panel the holder of the membrane is shown in fig 3 and a schematic of the filtration unit is shown in fig 4 as shown the unit is equipped with a circulation pump a set of valves to direct the flow two tanks one for the feed and another for the permeate and two flow meters a compressed air system is also included to provide the required backwash pressure as well as the pressure pulses a computerized panel is used to control the operation of the unit during the different regimes normal filtration operation involves running the pump with valves v1 v3 v4 and v6 open as shown in fig 4 during backflushing regime the feed pump is turned off leading the pressure on the feed side to drop to zero the backflushing system which is located on the permeate side is then set to operation and the pressure in the permeate increases to reverse the flow once the backwash period is finished the system returns automatically back to normal operation during the back pulsing mode the permeate side is closed hence no flow through the membrane and the back pulse system is activated to generate pulses at small regular intervals in the feed channel to dislodge pinned droplets the duration of these pulses is quite small typically a fraction of a second in the ptmp technique on the other hand the system runs in normal operational mode with the valve in the permeate side v4 opens and closes at a predetermined pattern since the filtration unit does not support this mode it has been conducted manually table 1 shows the sequence followed during these operational modes the membrane housing cell fig 3 has an outer diameter of 25 1 mm and a

order to maintain the feed concentration constant the retentate was immediately returned to the oily wastewater container where the permeate was measured before being directed back to the feed stream

figs s4 5 when the pressure inside the filtration unit has stabilized the datalog is enabled and all data including tmp cfv temperature valve opening percentages feed flow rate permeate flow fate and retentate flow rate are automatically logged every 3 s it is important to note that the data logging time is sometimes longer than some events e g the time period of pressure pulses and in this case they were not recorded both the backwash and pulsatile flow techniques utilize a compressed air pneumatic system to provide the required pressure to reverse the permeate in backwashing and generate the pulses in pulsatile flow the membrane oil rejection performance table 2 3 was calculated using equation 1 1 rejection 1 c p c f x 100 where cf and c p are the oil content of the feed and permeate

membrane surface all measurements were done in triplicate 5 design of the filtration experiments as indicated earlier this study investigates the operational efficiency of a ceramic membrane unit upon its use in the filtration of oily wastewater systems in the presence of three different physical antifouling techniques the operating conditions of the pulsatile flow backwashing and periodic transmembrane pressure techniques were optimized for a feed oil content of 200 ppm for each of the physical cleaning processes the degree of fouling and fouling extenuation was examined using a resistance model to inspect the accumulation of oil droplets at the membrane surface in addition at the end of the operational period the ceramic membrane was visually inspected to determine the level of membrane fouling supplementary material figs s13 14 finally the efficiency residual flux reversibility and permeate volume were measured and compared to investigate the membrane s overall performance under each physical antifouling process the ptmp bf and bp parameterization were based on the optimized operating parameters collected from our previous work reported in table 7 the experimental procedure for the ptmp has been reported in detail in our previous work 45 the applied ptmp has been set up by an on off valve v3 angle seat valve manufactured by bürkert that controls the permeate flow the operation can be controlled and operated with a small integrated operating cabinet consisting of a touch screen all the set actual features and values are displayed and can be operated from the pad touch screen in reference 45 three scenarios have been tested namely ptmp 1 1 ptmp 1 2 and ptmp 2 2 where the transmembrane pressure fluctuated by an on off valve when the valve is on normal filtration is in process and when it is off cleaning takes place this process and its physics were extensively explained in reference 45 for example ptmp 1 2 pattern means that the filtration is on for one minute i e valve v3 is on and the crossflow cleaning takes two minutes i e v3 is closed the 1 2 tmp pattern cycle is repeated for the entire experiment time of 120 min 6 results and discussion to investigate the impact of the three physical antifouling techniques on the performance of ceramic membranes during the crossflow filtration of oily water systems a number of performance parameters have been identified and compared these include the efficiency of the filtration process fouling reversibility residual flux steady state permeate flux and total permeate volume they were examined for each scenario to show how they differ among the three antifouling techniques in addition a resistance in series model analysis and post filtration visual inspection were used to determine the fouling mitigation capacity of the studied methods in this study the membrane permeate flux for the ceramic membrane was measured for the experimental time of 2 h at a tmp of 1 5 bar and a cfv of 1 m s with no antifouling technique implemented as shown in fig 5 the normalized permeate flux declines with time with significant reduction manifested in the first 10 min of the filtration time reaching 25 of the initial flux 57 which is in fact typical behavior of filtration systems undergoing uncontrolled fouling in this work the permeate flux is normalized by the maximum flux which is the flux at the start of operation of a new or regenerated membrane the normalized flux continues to decline albeit at a relatively slower rate for another 20 30 min reaching approximately 15 of its initial value after 30 min the membrane flux nearly stabilizes to asymptotically achieve a steady state stage in which case the detachment of pinning droplets due to hydrodynamic drag of the crossflow field nearly balances the incoming flux of new droplets 58 59 while this may be the case over a longer filtration time in our experimental work the flux slightly continues to decline at a slower rate reaching 9 of the initial flux at the end of the 2 h experiments to assess the extent of the fouling development on the ceramic membrane surface fig s13 supplementary material illustrated the severity of fouling accretion on the internal membrane channel surface after 2 h of the experiment fig s13 also depicted the shear cleaning potential during the normal crossflow filtration system is limited in mitigating fouling formation 60 furthermore the ceramic membrane surface water post cleaning also could not remove the deposited oil from the membrane surface and restore it to its original state apparently the two operating conditions i e the crossflow velocity and the transmembrane pressure have a significant impact on fouling development the larger the cfv and the lower the tmp the better the quality of the permeate and the less the development of fouling 13 however the increase in the cfv is restricted by the scouring and damage of the active layer of the membrane 61 therefore the margin in controlling the cfv seems not large and we are left with the other parameter namely the tmp the tmp is mainly responsible for the filtration capacity and the quality of the permeate it can also be controlled over a wider range compared with the cfv hence it is anticipated that controlling this parameter may contribute to the control of fouling development when tmp is large a larger volume of the permeate is collected however the quality is lower and vice versa interrupting the tmp periodically interrupts permeation flux which drags oil droplets toward the membrane and also makes the cfv effective in dislodging pinned droplets 62 likewise reducing the residence time of pinned droplets requires that the frequency of changing the tmp is large 45 figs 6 and s15 a supplementary material display the normalized flux pattern during the 1 2 ptmp application for the whole 2 h experiment and 10 min of early stage filtration respectively the 1 2 ptmp refers to a 1 min permeation cycle and a 2 min cleaning cycle the flux behavior during the 1 2 ptmp shown in fig 6a is distinct from the non ptmp normal filtration mode shown in fig 5 during each ptmp cycle the flux starts at the highest normalized value i e 1 0 or closer to 1 0 as indicated by the yellow circles and then decreases due to the pinning of droplets at pore openings and the declining in tmp at a later stage fig 6b depicts the state of the membrane at the start of the permeation cycle which indicates that the membrane starts the filtration in a very clean state the fact that the flux recovers to almost its initial value proves the effectiveness of the ptmp technique it is interesting to note that during the cleaning cycle the tmp does not drop abruptly to zero rather it takes a little time to drop as depicted in fig s16 supplementary material during which permeation continues to drop to zero as indicated by the red circles 45 as the permeation slows down with the drop in the applied tmp this allows crossflow drag to take control and initiate the cleaning process when the tmp becomes zero permeation flux likewise becomes zero as marked with the red circles in fig 6a the data in fig 6a can be divided into three sections the yellow circle data which represent permeation flux at the start of the filtration process the blue circles data representing permeation during both filtration and cleaning cycles and the red data demonstrate the flux when the tmp has dropped to zero after membrane regeneration the filtration unit has been set to pulsatile flow mode 31 fig 7a depicts the permeate flux profile when the pulsatile flow is utilized it is clear that the higher frequency of the pulses effectively combats fouling while maintaining the permeate flux to the highest values figs 7a and s15 b supplementary material show the permeate flux profile for the 2 h experiment and 10 min in the early stage of pulsatile flow respectively overall it is evident that the backpulsing antifouling technique is effective in combatting fouling the permeate flux is comparably high to the flux based on normal filtration at the end of the experiment the permeate flux reached 74 of the initial value however the flux right after each pulse cycle yellow circles does not seem to start from a near clean membrane indicating the accumulation of droplets and the development of fouling albeit at a slower rate as shown in fig 7b this may be attributed to the fact that the generated backpulse has a local effect in other words the effect of the pulse is strong where it is generated and as it dissipates away its effect diminishes this makes the cleaning process effective locally rather than along the whole membrane in the backwashing antifouling technique the filtration process is paused for a few seconds 3 s and the accumulated permeate is backwardly circulated to the feed through the membrane the flow of the permeate back to the feed sweeps off oil slugs from the membrane and also pushes pinned droplets toward the main feed stream when normal operation is pursued the surface of the membrane is presumably clean however since the duration of the filtration process is much longer than that of the backwashing the accumulation of the droplets at the surface intensifies making the backwashing technique of local effect in the area around pore openings 63 in other words for the backflushing to be effective it is believed that its frequency should be relatively large however enlarging the frequency of backwashing may affect the stability of the membrane destroy its active layer and consume considerable power to activate the system on the other hand increasing the duration of the backflush can also influence permeation flux therefore it is an optimization exercise to select the appropriate conditions fig s17 supplementary material illustrates the effect of the backwashing interval time period on the membrane final steady state flux for different filtration periods the best backwashing configuration applied to the crossflow filtration is found to be 5 min intervals and 3 s of backwashing cleaning for 2 h fig 8a shows the normalized flux pattern for the 2 h overall filtration time the yellow circles represent the normalized flux at the start of each permeation cycle then the flux sharply drops to zero when the backwashing starts for 3 s the drop in the permeate flux to zero is faster than the response time of the flow meter and hence was not recorded fig 8b shows the flux at the start of the permeation cycle i e after the backwashing from which it is clear that the membrane starts each cycle in an almost clean state there seems however to exist a tendency of declining the flux in the long run fig s15 c supplementary material illustrates the backwashing profile during the first 10 min of filtration where the permeate flux profile starts from the highest value before quickly declining and then sharply drops to zero although was not captured it is very hard to establish point wise comparisons between the normalized flux profiles for the three studied scenarios because of the complex pattern of each one and the lack of a common base of comparison however macroscopic parameters may shed light on which technique shows better results one such parameter is the total permeate volume collected 6 1 resistance model a good measure of the state of the membrane at the end of the filtration process is to compare the resistances of the membrane the intrinsic resistance of a membrane is that of a fresh clean membrane it is a resistance to the flow that is attributed to the internal structure of the membrane during the operation oil droplets pin to the surface of the membrane and at pore openings as well as to the walls of the internal pores hence more resistances build up as pinned droplets cluster and coalesce with other incoming droplets films are formed and the accumulation of which forms a cake layer that significantly increases the total resistance the resistance is therefore the sum of the intrinsic membrane resistance the resistance due to internal blocking and the resistance due to the cake layer formation it is possible to measure the contribution of these resistances along with the total one and they would provide information about the effectiveness of these methods the intrinsic resistance of a fresh membrane is measured by performing simple filtration experiments with ro water in which different tmps and the corresponding permeate fluxes are measured from which the permeability is determined by fitting a linear relationship 64 65 likewise the total resistance at the end of the different filtration experiments of oily water systems is measured by repeating the filtration with pure water experiments of the uncleaned membrane the resistance due to internal blocking on the other hand is measured at the end of the filtration experiments by cleaning the surface and conducting the permeation experiments with pure water 5 66 67 therefore if the overall resistance of the membrane at the end of the experiments is r t the intrinsic membrane resistance of fresh membrane is r m the resistance caused by the formation of the cake layer is r c and the internal resistance caused by the adsorption is r i then the following eq 2 applies 68 2 r t r m r c r i as explained the values of the resistances were determined using experimental data fig s18 supplementary material and applying the following eq 3 3 j tmp μ r t where j is the membrane steady state permeate flux tmp is transmembrane pressure μ is the permeate viscosity and r t is the total hydraulic resistance fig 9 shows the four components of the resistances for the normal crossflow filtration case along with the three filtration methods in the presence of one of the antifouling techniques it is clear that all resistance components except for the intrinsic one are higher than the other cases this asserts that the antifouling techniques are effective in combatting fouling compared with the normal filtration system with no antifouling measure existing it also shows that the differences between the three antifouling techniques are insignificant however there are some interesting features worth mentioning the first one is related to the resistance due to internal pore blocking and the second one is related to the cake layer resistance it may be noticed that the ptmp technique shows almost clean internal membrane pores and negligible resistance if at all in contrast to the backwashing technique which shows the development of internal resistance even though the ptmp technique only affects pined droplets at the membrane surface no buildup of oil ganglia inside the pores of the membrane is noticed in contrast in backwashing the permeate is forced to move back toward the feed dragging with it oil ganglia back to the feed this may be explained in light of the filtration time vs the cleaning time in the studied cases the 1 2 ptmp provides a more frequent and longer cleaning pattern in other words not enough time for the droplets to permeate is offered however in the backwashing technique the longer filtration time and the shorter backwashing allow pinned droplets to permeate and populate inside the membrane furthermore the developed cake layer along the membrane surface is smaller than it is in the other two antifouling techniques these observations indicate that the ptmp methodology is more effective than the other two antifouling techniques it is possible to establish another parameter that can be used to compare the efficacy of the different antifouling techniques in relation to the normal filtration methodology without the antifouling mechanism implemented such a parameter defines the efficiency of each physical antifouling based on the resistance analysis 69 71 therefore if r at is the total resistance with an antifouling mechanism implemented and r t is the total resistance for the crossflow filtration without an antifouling cleaning one can define the efficiency as 4 η 1 r at r t apparently if r at r t i e the total resistance with and without an antifouling technique is the same this implies that the implemented antifouling technique is ineffective and the efficiency is zero as shown in fig 10 the ptmp shows the largest efficiency compared with the other two techniques it depicts that the ptmp presents a higher physical antifouling efficiency of 88 followed by a pulsatile flow of 86 and backwashing flow of 78 compared to the regular crossflow filtration considered as a reference 6 2 residual flux gain and the overall permeate volume residual flux reversibility and the overall collected permeate volume are additional parameters that were investigated to measure the performance of the ceramic membrane during the filtration of oily water systems in crossflow filtration with and without an antifouling methodology the measurement of the steady state flux of pure water after the physical cleaning of the membrane indicates the severity of fouling and the efficacy of the implemented antifouling methodology flux recovery is the ratio of the permeate flux of pure water of used and clean membranes therefore if j u is the permeate flux of pure water through a used membrane i e after it has been used in a filtration exercise and j 0 is the permeate flux of pure water of a clean membrane residual flux rf is given by eq 5 5 rf j u j 0 fig 11 illustrates that the ptmp pulsatile flow backwashing and crossflow modes recover 80 73 46 and 10 of the initial flux of the ro water respectively one may define the difference between the fluxes of pure water for membranes after being used in filtration experiments of oily water systems with and without an antifouling methodology implemented therefore if j u is the permeate flux of a used membrane at the end of the experiment with an antifouling technique implemented and j f is the permeate flux for a membrane with no antifouling implemented then the difference between them defines the gain obtained by implementing an antifouling methodology likewise the difference between the flux of pure water over a fresh new membrane j 0 and that for a membrane used with no antifouling methodology implemented j f defines the maximum flux that could be achieved the ratio between them defines the gain obtained by implementing a particular antifouling technology in other words one may define the following equation 6 g j u j f j 0 j f fig 12 describes the gain or recovery of all physical antifouling techniques compared to crossflow filtration mode with no antifouling implemented at the end of the experiment the results show that the recovery by implementing ptmp pulsatile flow and backwashing are 78 70 and 40 respectively on the other hand given that both the ptmp and the backwashing have a cleaning period during which no permeation occurs and in the backflushing part of the permeate is even pumped back to the feed it is anticipated that such a process would affect the overall permeate volume collected at the end of the experiments as discussed earlier there is an agreement about the shortcoming of the backflushing on the membrane permeate volume using the permeate for cleaning may cause a loss of production level 41 therefore it would be interesting to know how would the cleaning time in addition to the reduction in permeate flux due to fouling affect the collected volume of permeate at the end of the experiments fig 13 illustrates that the ptmp demonstrated the largest ceramic membrane permeation volume ptmp pulsatile flow backwashing and regular crossflow total permeate volume was 9 85 8 48 7 31 and 6 85 l respectively the drop in the permeate volume of the backwashing in addition to fouling may be attributed to the frequent use of the permeate for the membrane surface washing during the 2 h experiment ptmp utilized the crossflow feed to mitigate concentration polarization and surface fouling development an overview of the net filtration times and total permeate volume for every filtration mode is presented fig 14 the net filtration time of ptmp pulsatile flow backwashing and normal filtration were 40 120 118 8 and 120 min respectively for which the total permeate volumes are 9 85 8 48 7 34 and 6 85 l respectively the ptmp has a higher performance of 9 85 l over a short filtration time of 40 min due to the association of a cleaning half cycle of 2 min for every one minute half cycle filtration the implementation of ptmp in crossflow filtration mitigates fouling while maintaining higher membrane performance furthermore a visual inspection of the walls of the internal channels of the ceramic membrane was also performed the severity of fouling development during each physical antifouling technique was investigated figs s11 12 supplementary material demonstrated that the ptmp presents a clear and surface free oil at the end of the experiment compared to the other physical cleaning techniques pulsatile flow and backwashing that reveal the presence of oil adsorption at the membrane surface in the absence of the applied antifouling techniques the regular crossflow filtration process illustrated an important fouling development at the membrane surface even after the ro water post washing the periodic transmembrane pressure ptmp technique implemented in crossflow filtration has demonstrated the highest ceramic membrane performance in total permeate volume flux recovery and gain compared to the two other antifouling physical techniques namely pulsatile flow and backwashing ptmp is a new and efficient method of preventing ceramic membrane fouling this technique can be applied to any filtration unit without the need for modification or increased energy use 72 and does not require additional expenses 7 conclusion this study investigated physical antifouling strategies ptmp backwashing and pulsatile flow for their impact on membrane performance and fouling mitigation the physical antifouling performances were compared to select the best configuration to combat fouling while maintaining a high steady state permeate flux and overall permeate volume it was necessary to compare the newly developed ptmp with conventional cleaning methods such as backwashing and pulsatile flow to establish ceramic membranes physical cleaning capacity and productivity in this study the novel ptmp technique demonstrated higher oily wastewater filtration efficiency characterized by a total permeate volume flux recovery and fouling reversibility of 9 85 l 80 and 78 respectively visual inspection of the ceramic membrane internal channel walls undergoing each antifouling physical cleaning technique demonstrated that the ptmp post filtration membrane presented a clean new surface further analysis by the resistance in series model elucidated the fouling development in each physical process the results highlighted a major reversible cake layer resistance over the irreversible fouling ptmp exhibited a minor resistance profile cake layer internal resistance compared to those experienced in backwashing pulsatile flow and regular crossflow filtration modes in conclusion ptmp is a state of the art eco friendly technique that can easily be implemented into existing filtration systems with minimal modification ptmp offers cost efficiency and low energy consumption providing optimal membrane performance and antifouling results declaration

12404,herein 3d aerogel pan c 3 n 4 was prepared by hydrothermal method using polyacrylonitrile pan and c3n4 as raw materials and then a layer of ni mof was grown on its surface and 3d aerogel composites lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s co doped with nitrogen and sulfur were prepared by vulcanization reaction the adsorbent lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s can be applied to mercury ii and elemental mercury adsorption with maximum adsorption capacities of to 1320 13 and 894 mg g respectively exceeding all sulfur functionalized adsorbent materials reported so far more importantly lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s showed excellent adsorption capacity in dynamic adsorption experiments on industrial wastewater to rapidly reduce the concentration of mercury ii from 10 0 mg l to 0 8 μg l which is far below the acceptable limit for drinking water 2 μg l meanwhile lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s can also be used as a sensor after adsorption of mercury ii tmb and h2o2 were added and the amount of mercury ii in the solution was detected in only 5 s with a detection line of 1 ppb the adsorbent can also be used as a photocatalyst to avoid secondary contamination lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs was able to completely degrade 100 ml of a solution with a concentration of 10 mg l rhb in 15 min showing good degradation ability graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mercury adsorption sensor mofs photocatalyst data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water pollution caused by toxic heavy metals such as mercury ii lead ii and chromium ii is becoming an increasingly important issue in separation science and environmental remediation because they are harmful to humans and other species 1 6 currently there are a variety of treatment methods to remove heavy metal ions mercury ii lead ii and chromium ii from water including precipitation ion exchange membrane separation redox reaction and enrichment 7 among them the adsorption method has been widely used to treat heavy metals especially mercury contaminated water because of its advantages including a low cost a short time and simple operation 8 and during coal combustion inherent mercury is released into the flue gas among which elemental mercury is the most difficult to remove due to its high volatility as well as insolubility 9 again the use of adsorption for mercury vapor capture is considered a feasible and effective way to reduce mercury emissions 10 polyacrylonitrile pan is an easily synthesized and low cost homopolymer which in addition has a good sunlight resistance and tolerance to most organic solvents inorganic acids and oxidizing agents 11 12 in terms of practical applications pan has been extensively studied as a support material or template for loading various adsorbent materials through which the contact between the adsorbents and the reactants can increase meanwhile its adsorption performance can be improved while making it better recyclable due to the smallest loss during its recycling and secondary use 13 17 metal free graphite carbon nitride c3n4 has attracted extensive attention due to its easy availability remarkable chemical and thermal stability as well as non toxic properties 18 20 c3n4 is an infinite extension of triazine and tri s triazine or s heptazine as a basic structural unit to form a reticular structure respectively the preparation of c3n4 is based on forming simple nitrogen rich organic precursors such as thiourea urea melamine dicyandiamide and ammonium thiocyanate by direct pyrolysis 21 24 2d c3n4 not only has an extremely high porosity after treatment but also contains abundant functional groups nh2 and oh on its surface through practical applications the flake c3n4 containing a large number of functional groups is used as the main carrier of adsorption materials and the industrially produced pan is used as a bridge between c3n4 and the three dimensional structure of pan c 3 n 4 formed by the combination of linear pan and two dimensional c3n4 can be transformed into different shapes which can be used for adsorption and detection experiments under different conditions the unreacted nh2 oh and cooh on the pan c 3 n 4 surface also have a good synergistic effect on the adsorption of mercury ions moreover carbon containing materials such as c3n4 have a particular affinity for elemental mercury 25 metal organic frameworks mofs are novel materials composed of organic molecules linked by metal ions that have been shown better chemical stability compared to other materials 26 27 metal sulfides could be formed with sublimated sulfur through mof materials via a solid state reaction 28 in recent years metal sulfides have been widely used to construct colorimetric sensors due to their low cost high efficiency and good stability meanwhile metal sulfides are now widely used in many fields such as adsorptive lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors further studies have shown sulfides are more basic than nitrides and oxides according to lewis acid base theory sulfur containing materials are often considered the best trapping materials for mercury ii ions therefore sulfides have a more robust adsorption capacity for mercury ii ions 29 34 and there are many mercury ii ion detection methods including atomic absorption spectrometry inductively coupled plasma spectrometry and atomic fluorescence spectrometry etc 35 36 although these detection techniques have a high selectivity and sensitivity they require a long time which cannot be tested in a certain field and expensive equipment needs to be used the colorimetric method we used does not require expensive equipment through which results can be produced by color change within 5 s so it is widely used to rapidly detect mercury ii ions 37 39 in recent years the disposal and reuse of used sorbents is an urgent issue to be addressed while the use of visible light driven photocatalysis for the treatment of the growing organic pollution problem is equally important hgs formed by adsorption of mercury ii ions through polysulfide polymers is widely used in solid state solar cells photochemical materials and photoconductors 40 however there are few reports on the photocatalytic applications of hgs while carbon nanofibers such as graphitic carbon nitride graphene sheets and lp play a key role in the development of high performance photocatalytic materials 41 among them graphitic carbon nitride is a promising photocatalytic material due to its good electrical conductivity specific surface area high photoresponse current and excellent stability 42 in addition lp formed after calcination of pan is used as one of the photoresponsive materials due to its large surface area low production cost and high electrical conductivity therefore lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs was used as a photocatalyst to investigate its ability to degrade organic dyes in view of the above considerations in this work we first combined pan with c3n4 to form a three dimensional monolithic structure pan c 3 n 4 the 3d structure formed by pan c 3 n 4 lp c 3 n 4 can increase the specific surface area of the material thus improving the material s ability to enrich and detect mercury ii ions and the adsorption of elemental mercury vapor and the generation of large amounts of hgs during adsorption can improve the degradation of organic dyes then mof ni mof 74 materials were loaded on pan c 3 n 4 and finally ni mof 74 were vulcanized using sublimated sulfur lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s pan was dehydrated through intra chain cyclization during vulcanization to form a step polymer lp lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s has a good adsorption enrichment and detection ability for mercury ii ions and the performance of the material in terms of its rapid absorption easy separation as well as the enrichment of ultra trace mercury ii was verified through dynamic adsorption devices as well as good adsorption ability for elemental mercury vapor and could be used as a mercury ii ion sensor for the analysis of environmental samples to avoid secondary pollution we used lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs as a photocatalytic material which showed excellent degradation performance for rhb this work presents the first three dimensional multifunctional material for the adsorption enrichment and detection of mercury ii while the material can be reused as a photocatalytic material after adsorption 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and instruments the materials and instruments are given in support information 2 2

the ftir spectra of pan c3n4 pan c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s are shown in fig 2 a there was a stretching vibration of nh at 3150 cm 1 in the nh group of c3n4 nanosheets and there was a stretching vibration of oh as well as c o at 2917 cm 1 and 1695 cm 1 respectively in the cooh group of pan 43 44 after the combination of pan with c3n4 to form a three dimensional monolith the nh density decreased significantly and c o underwent a blue shift indicating that the dehydration reaction was successful pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 showed c n stretching vibration of pan at 2240 cm 1 and c h stretching vibration at 2910 cm 1 and the diffusion front of pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 at 3150 cm 1 to 3490 cm 1 was a hydrogen bonding front which belonged to the oh in the structure and at the peak 1580 cm 1 belonged to the cc stretching vibration of the benzene ring 45 lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s presented characteristic peaks at 1160 cm 1 1590 cm 1 which could be considered as cn and cn stretching vibrations the one at 3430 cm 1 was a primary amine characteristic peak 46 47 in summary it was proved that the mof materials had been well loaded onto pan c 3 n 4 meanwhile pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 had been well vulcanized 3 1 2 xrd analysis the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of pan c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 lp c 3 n 4 400 c and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s at a 2θ range of 5 90 are shown in fig 2 b it can be seen that the peaks of pan c 3 n 4 at 16 38 and 28 50 are the prominent diffraction peaks of pan and c3n4 nanosheets respectively 48 49 the peaks of pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 at 6 79 and 11 73 are the prominent diffraction peaks of ni mof 74 50 the peak of lp c 3 n 4 400 c at 27 42 is the diffraction peak of pan after carbonization and the diffraction peak of pan after carbonization overlaps with that of c3n4 nanosheets the peaks of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s at 29 26 31 93 35 77 39 29 45 38 53 89 56 41 59 14 and 61 62 belong to the prominent diffraction peaks of pure nis2 phase jcpds 01 080 0377 51 3 1 3 bet analysis fig 2 c and d shows the nitrogen adsorption isotherms of pan c 3 n 4 lp c 3 n 4 lp c 3 n 4 s pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s respectively all data are shown in table 2 bet tests showed that the specific surface area of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s has a lower specific surface area than pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 because sulfur sublimates into the pores during the sulfidation process which reduces the specific surface area of the material moreover the specific surface areas of pan c 3 n 4 lp c 3 n 4 and lp c 3 n 4 s were shown to be comparable to those of lp c 3 n 4 but much higher than those of lp c 3 n 4 s indicating that the decrease in specific surface area during sulfidation was mainly caused by sulfur 3 1 4 sem and tem analysis fig 3 a d shows the sem images of pan c 3 n 4 lp c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s the above sem images could show that the mof material was successfully grown on pan c 3 n 4 and that there was some collapse in the vulcanized lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s material relative to the unvulcanized pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 structure indicating that the surface mofs had been successfully vulcanized fig 3 e shows the tem image of pan c 3 n 4 which indicates that an excellent three dimensional structure has been formed by pan and c3n4 through an amidation reaction in summary it showed that lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s had been successfully prepared meanwhile the elemental mapping images fig 3 f j showed that the overall distribution of nis2 on pan c 3 n 4 was homogeneous which had a strong enrichment capacity for mercury ii fig 3 k l shows the lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s in the form of columns blocks and rods prepared by different molds lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s can be prepared in different morphologies depending on the application environment and the amount used showing that lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s has excellent potential for industrial applications in treating mercury in the environment 3 2 comparison of adsorption amount of c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 lp c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s 0 02 g of c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 lp c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s were added to 50 ml of 25 mg l mercury ii solution for 90 s at ph 4 t 298 k table 3 in this work the adsorption properties of lp c 3 n 4 and lp c 3 n 4 were significantly different because the pan surface contained a large amount of cooh and the c 3 n 4 surface contained many amino groups which were heavily destroyed after calcination on the other hand the overall adsorption performance of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s after vulcanization was higher than that of pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 because the mof material tends to decompose under acidic conditions while the vulcanized material is more stable 3 3 effect of ph value on adsorption changes in ph affect the adsorption performance of the adsorbent and the degree of ionization of the metal surface from fig 4 a it can be seen that at ph 4 lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s shows the best enrichment effect on mercury ii ions this is because at lower ph mercury ii competes with the high concentration of h in solution for the binding sites generating electrostatic repulsion which affects the mercury ii coordination complex as the ph increases from 2 to 4 the zeta potential of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s gradually decreases and the electrostatic repulsive force of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s functional groups decreases leading to a rapid increase in enrichment capacity when the ph was 4 mercury ii was prone to hydrolysis reactions to produce hg oh and hg oh 2 pksp hg oh 2 25 51 mercury ii cations can precipitate as hydroxides at ph 5 3 forming mercury containing precipitates that block the pore structure and reduce the mercury ii in solution affecting the detection effect and adsorption capacity therefore the ph value for the optimal adsorption conditions for lp c3n4 ni mof 74 s was 4 3 4 effect of initial mercury ii concentration and adsorption isotherm 3 4 1 effect of initial mercury ii concentration on adsorption fig 4 b shows the adsorption of the adsorbent lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s at 298 k 318 k in solutions with mercury ii c0 25 550 mg l of different concentrations the adsorption capacity of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s increases rapidly when c0 changes from 25 mg l to 500 mg l the amount of mercury ii ions adsorbed by lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s stabilized when the mercury ii concentration reached 500 mg l when c0 changed from 500 mg l to 550 mg l the mercury ii ions adsorbed increased slowly this result can be explained as follows at lower concentrations the high active site of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was more significant than the initial mercury ii ion concentration which would increase the collision probability between lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s and mercury ii therefore the adsorption capacity of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s increases rapidly as the concentration of mercury ii 25 500 mg l in the solution increases however at higher concentrations 500 550 mg l although the initial concentration of metal ions between the mercury ii solution and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was relatively large the ratio of the number of active sites of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s to the initial concentration of mercury ii was small thus limiting the adsorption effect when the concentration of mercury ii exceeded 550 mg l the active sites of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s reached saturation and the final adsorption amount of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s stabilized 3 4 2 adsorption isotherm the isothermal model curves fitted to the above isotherms are shown in fig 4 c f and the obtained isothermal parameters of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s are shown in table 4 the values of r2 for the l model according to the parameters in table 4 were higher than those of r2 for the other models the theoretical qm of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s calculated according to the langmuir model agreed with the experimental value in the actual experiment moreover because rl 1 it indicates the feasibility of adsorption of mercury ii in solution by lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s according to the relevant results the removal process of mercury ii ions through lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s followed langmuir model and the adsorption process was a unimolecular layer adsorption process which was independent of space and energy 52 53 all equations of the adsorption isotherm model are given in the supporting information the adsorption capacity of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was much higher than that of the other adsorbents reported in table s1 3 5 effect of contact time on adsorption kinetics 3 5 1 effect of contact time to investigate the effect of contact time on the enrichment behavior of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s on mercury ii the contact time of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was varied from 0 to 120 s and the test temperature was 298 318 k fig 4 g shows the effect of contact time on the enrichment behavior of mercury ii in the initial phase 90 s of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s the enrichment capacity for mercury ii increases rapidly when the adsorption time exceeded 90 s the adsorption rate of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s decreased and finally reached dynamic equilibrium the enrichment behavior of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s for mercury ii was explained as follows first abundant polysulfide polymers appeared on the surface of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s and the ion exchange enrichment of polysulfide polymers with mercury ii resulted in a rapid increase from 0 to 90 s with time secondly as time increases and the adsorbent was exposed to mercury ii 90 s the remaining reactive groups were difficult to be occupied due to the significant charge repulsion of the enriched mercury ii ions on the lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s surface from the mercury ii ions in solution finally the concentration of mercury ii gradually decreased and the remaining reactive groups were difficult to be captured the adsorption of mercury ii by lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s reached equilibrium adsorption within 90 s 298 k with a removal rate of 99 4 and an adsorption amount of 62 1 mg g 3 5 2 kinetic studies fig 4 h l shows the fitted adsorption experimental data on the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models of the lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s adsorption process with the corresponding parameters shown in table 4 the coefficient of determination r2 by the pseudo second order kinetic model is better than the other models and the qe cal of the lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s adsorption process obtained through the pseudo second order kinetic model is close to the actual value in summary the pseudo second order model is more consistent with the enrichment process of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s which is a chemical adsorption process with electron sharing and chelation enrichment 54 55 furthermore the adsorption process of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was also analyzed using an intraparticle diffusion model and the related fitted parameters as well as results are shown in fig 4 j l and table 5 it could be directly seen that the enrichment process of mercury ii ions through lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s contained a two step process the first step of membrane diffusion was the determinant of the mercury ii adsorption process and the removal of mercury ii was mainly caused by the surface adsorption phenomenon the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic and intraparticle diffusion model adapted to the analysis of the experimental data are presented in the supporting information 3 6 effect of the temperature and adsorption thermodynamics the enthalpy change δho and gibbs free energy δgo of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s could be seen in fig s1 and table s2 in which the values of δho and δgo for lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s are below zero at 298 k 318 k for all of them indicating that the adsorption process of mercury ii in solution through lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was spontaneous and exothermic 3 7 effect of co existing ions industrial wastewater may contain large amounts of other ions thus affecting the ability of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s to remove mercury ii according to fig 5 a it can be found that the enrichment capacity of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s for mercury ii was almost unchanged in the presence of different cationic ions indicating that the presence of different cations had no significant effect on the enrichment capacity of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s 3 8 regeneration of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s the regeneration performance of an absorber after adsorption is one of the critical factors affecting its application 0 02 g of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs was used with 50 ml of 0 1 mol l hno3 and 0 1 mol l thiourea as eluent whose results are shown in fig 5 b after five cycles of adsorption and the adsorption as well as removal rate of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s for mercury ii was 56 70 mg g and 92 05 respectively the ft ir spectra and xrd patterns of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s after five cycles fig s2 a b showed that lp c3n ni mof 74 s did not change significantly after five cycles 3 9 adsorption mercury ii via lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s filled dynamic adsorption device and mercury ii detection study fig 5 c d shows that mercury ii in aqueous and industrial wastewater can be reduced from 10 mg l to 0 3 μg l and 0 8 μg l respectively in 7 s using a dynamic adsorption device which can meet drinking water standards exceeding the performance of all sulfur based materials reported so far it provides a technical basis for subsequent industrial production the adsorption principle of the dynamic adsorption device and the content of various ions in the industrial wastewater are shown in the supporting information table s3 fig 6 d illustrates the colorimetric response of the sensing system upon the addition of mercury ii of different concentrations to lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s as a sensor fig 6 a shows the changes in sample color and absorbance with mercury ii ions of different concentrations which decrease with added ions of an increasing concentration these results indicate that the sensing assay developed has a dynamic detection range of 1 50 ppb furthermore the selectivity of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s as a sensor was also investigated fig 6 b other metal ions had little effect on the chromatic evolution of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s while a five cycle test fig 6 c illustrated that lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was reproducible as a sensor further demonstrating the possibility of its practical application as a sensor see supporting information for colorimetric reaction principles 3 10 mechanism of mercury ii adsorption onto lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s the mercury ii enrichment process with the adsorbent lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s could be divided into two parts physical adsorption and chemisorption the relatively rough surfaces of pan and c3n4 could absorb a certain amount of mercury ii through physical adsorption the chemisorption process between the reactive groups of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s and mercury ii was analyzed using ft ir and xrd patterns as well as xps spectra as is shown in fig s3 a b and fig 7 respectively the results of ftir and xps analysis of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs are shown in the supporting information the following reaction process explains the enrichment of mercury ii through lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s see fig 8 1 hg ii ni s n ni s n 1 hgs 2 hg ii ni s n 1 ni s n 2 hgs 3 hg ii ni s 2 nis hgs the xps results of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs are shown in the supporting data the xps illustrated that s2 2 and sn 2 in the lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s polysulfide played a major role in the enrichment of mercury ii 3 11 elemental mercury vapor adsorption fig 9 shows a diagram of the elemental mercury vapor adsorption device of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s the excellent efficiency of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s for the removal of mercury ii prompted us to further investigate its effect on the removal of mercury vapor for the removal of elemental mercury generated during coal combustion elemental mercury adsorption is challenging for many adsorbent materials at high temperatures because high temperatures reduce the capture capacity of the adsorbent material and make it susceptible to interference from other fumes and chemicals therefore we chose to immerse the vials containing elemental mercury and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s in a sand bath at 140 c for 3 days and the equilibrium adsorption capacity of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was determined to be 894 mg g which ranked among the highest compared to other adsorbents listed in table s4 highlighting its great potential for application in treating elemental mercury vapor from coal flue gas 3 12 photodegradation study in order to avoid secondary pollution we use the waste adsorbent after the adsorption of mercury ii as a photocatalyst to degrade rhb 5 15 mg l rhb solution can be completely degraded in 10 20 min and there is still a good photodegradation effect after five cycles moreover lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs was found to have a better photodegradation rate constant higher photoresponse current and lower resistance to rhb than lp c 3 n 4 and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s in the final exploration of the active site o2 and oh was found to play a more critical role than h in the photocatalytic process degradation of rhb at different concentrations by lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs performance testing of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs lp c 3 n 4 and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s and the investigation of the active site is shown in supporting information fig 10 4 conclusions the results showed that lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s had an excellent adsorption capacity 61 52 mg g and an extremely high mercury ii removal rate 98 43 within 90 s at 298 k which exhibited a good recovery 92 05 in the fifth cycle as well as good adsorption of elemental mercury vapor 894 mg g lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s also had a good detection capacity for mercury ii the enrichment of trace amounts of mercury ii followed by the addition of tmb and h2o2 was able to be used to detect mercury ii in only 5 s with a minimum detection line of 1 ppb portable dynamic adsorption devices could reduce the concentration of mercury ii in industrial wastewater from 10 0 mg l to 0 8 μg l in 7 s meeting the drinking water standard the study on adsorption also showed that the adsorption process of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was consistent with the langmuir model whose maximum adsorption amount 1283 70 mg g could be calculated meanwhile the adsorption behavior of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s is consistent with the pseudo second order equation isotherm which proves that the adsorption process of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s is an electron sharing and chelation enrichment chemisorption process moreover the values of δgo and δho of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s were less than zero at 298 k 318 k which proved that the adsorption process of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was a feasible and spontaneous exothermic process the xps spectra indicated that the lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s polysulfide in which s2 2 and sn 2 played a significant role enriched mercury ii in addition the application value of the adsorbent as a photoresponsive material after adsorption of mercury ii was further investigated in order to avoid secondary pollution lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs could completely degrade a 10 mg l rhb solution within 15 min and the photocatalytic performance of the material was dramatically improved after the addition of mercury ii overall this research work developed a new three dimensional multifunctional material with good enrichment ability for mercury ii which can also be used as a sensor and the waste adsorbent can be used as a photocatalytic material after

12404,herein 3d aerogel pan c 3 n 4 was prepared by hydrothermal method using polyacrylonitrile pan and c3n4 as raw materials and then a layer of ni mof was grown on its surface and 3d aerogel composites lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s co doped with nitrogen and sulfur were prepared by vulcanization reaction the adsorbent lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s can be applied to mercury ii and elemental mercury adsorption with maximum adsorption capacities of to 1320 13 and 894 mg g respectively exceeding all sulfur functionalized adsorbent materials reported so far more importantly lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s showed excellent adsorption capacity in dynamic adsorption experiments on industrial wastewater to rapidly reduce the concentration of mercury ii from 10 0 mg l to 0 8 μg l which is far below the acceptable limit for drinking water 2 μg l meanwhile lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s can also be used as a sensor after adsorption of mercury ii tmb and h2o2 were added and the amount of mercury ii in the solution was detected in only 5 s with a detection line of 1 ppb the adsorbent can also be used as a photocatalyst to avoid secondary contamination lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs was able to completely degrade 100 ml of a solution with a concentration of 10 mg l rhb in 15 min showing good degradation ability graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mercury adsorption sensor mofs photocatalyst data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water pollution caused by toxic heavy metals such as mercury ii lead ii and chromium ii is becoming an increasingly important issue in separation science and environmental remediation because they are harmful to humans and other species 1 6 currently there are a variety of treatment methods to remove heavy metal ions mercury ii lead ii and chromium ii from water including precipitation ion exchange membrane separation redox reaction and enrichment 7 among them the adsorption method has been widely used to treat heavy metals especially mercury contaminated water because of its advantages including a low cost a short time and simple operation 8 and during coal combustion inherent mercury is released into the flue gas among which elemental mercury is the most difficult to remove due to its high volatility as well as insolubility 9 again the use of adsorption for mercury vapor capture is considered a feasible and effective way to reduce mercury emissions 10 polyacrylonitrile pan is an easily synthesized and low cost homopolymer which in addition has a good sunlight resistance and tolerance to most organic solvents inorganic acids and oxidizing agents 11 12 in terms of practical applications pan has been extensively studied as a support material or template for loading various adsorbent materials through which the contact between the adsorbents and the reactants can increase meanwhile its adsorption performance can be improved while making it better recyclable due to the smallest loss during its recycling and secondary use 13 17 metal free graphite carbon nitride c3n4 has attracted extensive attention due to its easy availability remarkable chemical and thermal stability as well as non toxic properties 18 20 c3n4 is an infinite extension of triazine and tri s triazine or s heptazine as a basic structural unit to form a reticular structure respectively the preparation of c3n4 is based on forming simple nitrogen rich organic precursors such as thiourea urea melamine dicyandiamide and ammonium thiocyanate by direct pyrolysis 21 24 2d c3n4 not only has an extremely high porosity after treatment but also contains abundant functional groups nh2 and oh on its surface through practical applications the flake c3n4 containing a large number of functional groups is used as the main carrier of adsorption materials and the industrially produced pan is used as a bridge between c3n4 and the three dimensional structure of pan c 3 n 4 formed by the combination of linear pan and two dimensional c3n4 can be transformed into different shapes which can be used for adsorption and detection experiments under different conditions the unreacted nh2 oh and cooh on the pan c 3 n 4 surface also have a good synergistic effect on the adsorption of mercury ions moreover carbon containing materials such as c3n4 have a particular affinity for elemental mercury 25 metal organic frameworks mofs are novel materials composed of organic molecules linked by metal ions that have been shown better chemical stability compared to other materials 26 27 metal sulfides could be formed with sublimated sulfur through mof materials via a solid state reaction 28 in recent years metal sulfides have been widely used to construct colorimetric sensors due to their low cost high efficiency and good stability meanwhile metal sulfides are now widely used in many fields such as adsorptive lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors further studies have shown sulfides are more basic than nitrides and oxides according to lewis acid base theory sulfur containing materials are often considered the best trapping materials for mercury ii ions therefore sulfides have a more robust adsorption capacity for mercury ii ions 29 34 and there are many mercury ii ion detection methods including atomic absorption spectrometry inductively coupled plasma spectrometry and atomic fluorescence spectrometry etc 35 36 although these detection techniques have a high selectivity and sensitivity they require a long time which cannot be tested in a certain field and expensive equipment needs to be used the colorimetric method we used does not require expensive equipment through which results can be produced by color change within 5 s so it is widely used to rapidly detect mercury ii ions 37 39 in recent years the disposal and reuse of used sorbents is an urgent issue to be addressed while the use of visible light driven photocatalysis for the treatment of the growing organic pollution problem is equally important hgs formed by adsorption of mercury ii ions through polysulfide polymers is widely used in solid state solar cells photochemical materials and photoconductors 40 however there are few reports on the photocatalytic applications of hgs while carbon nanofibers such as graphitic carbon nitride graphene sheets and lp play a key role in the development of high performance photocatalytic materials 41 among them graphitic carbon nitride is a promising photocatalytic material due to its good electrical conductivity specific surface area high photoresponse current and excellent stability 42 in addition lp formed after calcination of pan is used as one of the photoresponsive materials due to its large surface area low production cost and high electrical conductivity therefore lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs was used as a photocatalyst to investigate its ability to degrade organic dyes in view of the above considerations in this work we first combined pan with c3n4 to form a three dimensional monolithic structure pan c 3 n 4 the 3d structure formed by pan c 3 n 4 lp c 3 n 4 can increase the specific surface area of the material thus improving the material s ability to enrich and detect mercury ii ions and the adsorption of elemental mercury vapor and the generation of large amounts of hgs during adsorption can improve the degradation of organic dyes then mof ni mof 74 materials were loaded on pan c 3 n 4 and finally ni mof 74 were vulcanized using sublimated sulfur lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s pan was dehydrated through intra chain cyclization during vulcanization to form a step polymer lp lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s has a good adsorption enrichment and detection ability for mercury ii ions and the performance of the material in terms of its rapid absorption easy separation as well as the enrichment of ultra trace mercury ii was verified through dynamic adsorption devices as well as good adsorption ability for elemental mercury vapor and could be used as a mercury ii ion sensor for the analysis of environmental samples to avoid secondary pollution we used lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs as a photocatalytic material which showed excellent degradation performance for rhb this work presents the first three dimensional multifunctional material for the adsorption enrichment and detection of mercury ii while the material can be reused as a photocatalytic material after adsorption 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and instruments the materials and instruments are given in support information 2 2 preparation of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s see supporting information for the preparation and characterization of pan c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s materials fig 1 2 3 experimental section the details of adsorption and desorption experiments colorimetric mercury ii detection mercury vapor capture experiments mercury vapor uptake capacity tests and photodegradation experiment are given in support information the characteristics of all samples in the experiment are in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of lp c 3 n 4 mofs s 3 1 1 ftir analysis the ftir spectra of pan c3n4 pan c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s are shown in fig 2 a there was a stretching vibration of nh at 3150 cm 1 in the nh group of c3n4 nanosheets and there was a stretching vibration of oh as well as c o at 2917 cm 1 and 1695 cm 1 respectively in the cooh group of pan 43 44 after the combination of pan with c3n4 to form a three dimensional monolith the nh density decreased significantly and c o underwent a blue shift indicating that the dehydration reaction was successful pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 showed c n stretching vibration of pan at 2240 cm 1 and c h stretching vibration at 2910 cm 1 and the diffusion front of pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 at 3150 cm 1 to 3490 cm 1 was a hydrogen bonding front which belonged to the oh in the structure and at the peak 1580 cm 1 belonged to the cc stretching vibration of the benzene ring 45 lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s presented characteristic peaks at 1160 cm 1 1590 cm 1 which could be considered as cn and cn stretching vibrations the one at 3430 cm 1 was a primary amine characteristic peak 46 47 in summary it was proved that the mof materials had been well loaded onto pan c 3 n 4 meanwhile pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 had been well vulcanized 3 1 2 xrd analysis the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of pan c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 lp c 3 n 4 400 c and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s at a 2θ range of 5 90 are shown in fig 2 b it can be seen that the peaks of pan c 3 n 4 at 16 38 and 28 50 are the prominent diffraction peaks of pan and c3n4 nanosheets respectively 48 49 the peaks of pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 at 6 79 and 11 73 are the prominent diffraction peaks of ni mof 74 50 the peak of lp c 3 n 4 400 c at 27 42 is the diffraction peak of pan after carbonization and the diffraction peak of pan after carbonization overlaps with that of c3n4 nanosheets the peaks of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s at 29 26 31 93 35 77 39 29 45 38 53 89 56 41 59 14 and 61 62 belong to the prominent diffraction peaks of pure nis2 phase jcpds 01 080 0377 51 3 1 3 bet analysis fig 2 c and d shows the nitrogen adsorption isotherms of pan c 3 n 4 lp c 3 n 4 lp c 3 n 4 s pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s respectively all data are shown in table 2 bet tests showed that the specific surface area of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s has a lower specific surface area than pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 because sulfur sublimates into the pores during the sulfidation process which reduces the specific surface area of the material moreover the specific surface areas of pan c 3 n 4 lp c 3 n 4 and lp c 3 n 4 s were shown to be comparable to those of lp c 3 n 4 but much higher than those of lp c 3 n 4 s indicating that the decrease in specific surface area during sulfidation was mainly caused by sulfur 3 1 4 sem and tem analysis fig 3 a d shows the sem images of pan c 3 n 4 lp c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s the above sem images could show that the mof material was successfully grown on pan c 3 n 4 and that there was some collapse in the vulcanized lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s material relative to the unvulcanized pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 structure indicating that the surface mofs had been successfully vulcanized fig 3 e shows the tem image of pan c 3 n 4 which indicates that an excellent three dimensional structure has been formed by pan and c3n4 through an amidation reaction in summary it showed that lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s had been successfully prepared meanwhile the elemental mapping images fig 3 f j showed that the overall distribution of nis2 on pan c 3 n 4 was homogeneous which had a strong enrichment capacity for mercury ii fig 3 k l shows the lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s in the form of columns blocks and rods prepared by different molds lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s can be prepared in different morphologies depending on the application environment and the amount used showing that lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s has excellent potential for industrial applications in treating mercury in the environment 3 2 comparison of adsorption amount of c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 lp c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s 0 02 g of c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 lp c 3 n 4 pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s were added to 50 ml of 25 mg l mercury ii solution for 90 s at ph 4 t 298 k table 3 in this work the adsorption properties of lp c 3 n 4 and lp c 3 n 4 were significantly different because the pan surface contained a large amount of cooh and the c 3 n 4 surface contained many amino groups which were heavily destroyed after calcination on the other hand the overall adsorption performance of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s after vulcanization was higher than that of pan c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 because the mof material tends to decompose under acidic conditions while the vulcanized material is more stable 3 3 effect of ph value on adsorption changes in ph affect the adsorption performance of the adsorbent and the degree of ionization of the metal surface from fig 4 a it can be seen that at ph 4 lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s shows the best enrichment effect on mercury ii ions this is because at lower ph mercury ii competes with the high concentration of h in solution for the binding sites generating electrostatic repulsion which affects the mercury ii coordination complex as the ph increases from 2 to 4 the zeta potential of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s gradually decreases and the electrostatic repulsive force of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s functional groups decreases leading to a rapid increase in enrichment capacity when the ph was 4 mercury ii was prone to hydrolysis reactions to produce hg oh and hg oh 2 pksp hg oh 2 25 51 mercury ii cations can precipitate as hydroxides at ph 5 3 forming mercury containing precipitates that block the pore structure and reduce the mercury ii in solution affecting the detection effect and adsorption capacity therefore the ph value for the optimal adsorption conditions for lp c3n4 ni mof 74 s was 4 3 4 effect of initial mercury ii concentration and adsorption isotherm 3 4 1 effect of initial mercury ii concentration on adsorption fig 4 b shows the adsorption of the adsorbent lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s at 298 k 318 k in solutions with mercury ii c0 25 550 mg l of different concentrations the adsorption capacity of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s increases rapidly when c0 changes from 25 mg l to 500 mg l the amount of mercury ii ions adsorbed by lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s stabilized when the mercury ii concentration reached 500 mg l when c0 changed from 500 mg l to 550 mg l the mercury ii ions adsorbed increased slowly this result can be explained as follows at lower concentrations the high active site of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was more significant than the initial mercury ii ion concentration which would increase the collision probability between lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s and mercury ii therefore the adsorption capacity of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s increases rapidly as the concentration of mercury ii 25 500 mg l in the solution increases however at higher concentrations 500 550 mg l although the initial concentration of metal ions between the mercury ii solution and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was relatively large the ratio of the number of active sites of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s to the initial concentration of mercury ii was small thus limiting the adsorption effect when the concentration of mercury ii exceeded 550 mg l the active sites of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s reached saturation and the final adsorption amount of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s stabilized 3 4 2 adsorption isotherm the isothermal model curves fitted to the above isotherms are shown in fig 4 c f and the obtained isothermal parameters of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s are shown in table 4 the values of r2 for the l model according to the parameters in table 4 were higher than those of r2 for the other models the theoretical qm of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s calculated according to the langmuir model agreed with the experimental value in the actual experiment moreover because rl 1 it indicates the feasibility of adsorption of mercury ii in solution by lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s according to the relevant results the removal process of mercury ii ions through lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s followed langmuir model and the adsorption process was a unimolecular layer adsorption process which was independent of space and energy 52 53 all equations of the adsorption isotherm model are given in the supporting information the adsorption capacity of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was much higher than that of the other adsorbents reported in table s1 3 5 effect of contact time on adsorption kinetics 3 5 1 effect of contact time to investigate the effect of contact time on the enrichment behavior of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s on mercury ii the contact time of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was varied from 0 to 120 s and the test temperature was 298 318 k fig 4 g shows the effect of contact time on the enrichment behavior of mercury ii in the initial phase 90 s of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s the enrichment capacity for mercury ii increases rapidly when the adsorption time exceeded 90 s the adsorption rate of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s decreased and finally reached dynamic equilibrium the enrichment behavior of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s for mercury ii was explained as follows first abundant polysulfide polymers appeared on the surface of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s and the ion exchange enrichment of polysulfide polymers with mercury ii resulted in a rapid increase from 0 to 90 s with time secondly as time increases and the adsorbent was exposed to mercury ii 90 s the remaining reactive groups were difficult to be occupied due to the significant charge repulsion of the enriched mercury ii ions on the lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s surface from the mercury ii ions in solution finally the concentration of mercury ii gradually decreased and the remaining reactive groups were difficult to be captured the adsorption of mercury ii by lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s reached equilibrium adsorption within 90 s 298 k with a removal rate of 99 4 and an adsorption amount of 62 1 mg g 3 5 2 kinetic studies fig 4 h l shows the fitted adsorption experimental data on the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models of the lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s adsorption process with the corresponding parameters shown in table 4 the coefficient of determination r2 by the pseudo second order kinetic model is better than the other models and the qe cal of the lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s adsorption process obtained through the pseudo second order kinetic model is close to the actual value in summary the pseudo second order model is more consistent with the enrichment process of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s which is a chemical adsorption process with electron sharing and chelation enrichment 54 55 furthermore the adsorption process of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was also analyzed using an intraparticle diffusion model and the related fitted parameters as well as results are shown in fig 4 j l and table 5 it could be directly seen that the enrichment process of mercury ii ions through lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s contained a two step process the first step of membrane diffusion was the determinant of the mercury ii adsorption process and the removal of mercury ii was mainly caused by the surface adsorption phenomenon the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic and intraparticle diffusion model adapted to the analysis of the experimental data are presented in the supporting information 3 6 effect of the temperature and adsorption thermodynamics the enthalpy change δho and gibbs free energy δgo of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s could be seen in fig s1 and table s2 in which the values of δho and δgo for lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s are below zero at 298 k 318 k for all of them indicating that the adsorption process of mercury ii in solution through lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was spontaneous and exothermic 3 7 effect of co existing ions industrial wastewater may contain large amounts of other ions thus affecting the ability of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s to remove mercury ii according to fig 5 a it can be found that the enrichment capacity of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s for mercury ii was almost unchanged in the presence of different cationic ions indicating that the presence of different cations had no significant effect on the enrichment capacity of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s 3 8 regeneration of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s the regeneration performance of an absorber after adsorption is one of the critical factors affecting its application 0 02 g of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs was used with 50 ml of 0 1 mol l hno3 and 0 1 mol l thiourea as eluent whose results are shown in fig 5 b after five cycles of adsorption and the adsorption as well as removal rate of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s for mercury ii was 56 70 mg g and 92 05 respectively the ft ir spectra and xrd patterns of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s after five cycles fig s2 a b showed that lp c3n ni mof 74 s did not change significantly after five cycles 3 9 adsorption mercury ii via lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s filled dynamic adsorption device and mercury ii detection study fig 5 c d shows that mercury ii in aqueous and industrial wastewater can be reduced from 10 mg l to 0 3 μg l and 0 8 μg l respectively in 7 s using a dynamic adsorption device which can meet drinking water standards exceeding the performance of all sulfur based materials reported so far it provides a technical basis for subsequent industrial production the adsorption principle of the dynamic adsorption device and the content of various ions in the industrial wastewater are shown in the supporting information table s3 fig 6 d illustrates the colorimetric response of the sensing system upon the addition of mercury ii of different concentrations to lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s as a sensor fig 6 a shows the changes in sample color and absorbance with mercury ii ions of different concentrations which decrease with added ions of an increasing concentration these results indicate that the sensing assay developed has a dynamic detection range of 1 50 ppb furthermore the selectivity of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s as a sensor was also investigated fig 6 b other metal ions had little effect on the chromatic evolution of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s while a five cycle test fig 6 c illustrated that lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was reproducible as a sensor further demonstrating the possibility of its practical application as a sensor see supporting information for colorimetric reaction principles 3 10 mechanism of mercury ii adsorption onto lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s the mercury ii enrichment process with the adsorbent lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s could be divided into two parts physical adsorption and chemisorption the relatively rough surfaces of pan and c3n4 could absorb a certain amount of mercury ii through physical adsorption the chemisorption process between the reactive groups of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s and mercury ii was analyzed using ft ir and xrd patterns as well as xps spectra as is shown in fig s3 a b and fig 7 respectively the results of ftir and xps analysis of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs are shown in the supporting information the following reaction process explains the enrichment of mercury ii through lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s see fig 8 1 hg ii ni s n ni s n 1 hgs 2 hg ii ni s n 1 ni s n 2 hgs 3 hg ii ni s 2 nis hgs the xps results of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs are shown in the supporting data the xps illustrated that s2 2 and sn 2 in the lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s polysulfide played a major role in the enrichment of mercury ii 3 11 elemental mercury vapor adsorption fig 9 shows a diagram of the elemental mercury vapor adsorption device of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s the excellent efficiency of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s for the removal of mercury ii prompted us to further investigate its effect on the removal of mercury vapor for the removal of elemental mercury generated during coal combustion elemental mercury adsorption is challenging for many adsorbent materials at high temperatures because high temperatures reduce the capture capacity of the adsorbent material and make it susceptible to interference from other fumes and chemicals therefore we chose to immerse the vials containing elemental mercury and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s in a sand bath at 140 c for 3 days and the equilibrium adsorption capacity of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was determined to be 894 mg g which ranked among the highest compared to other adsorbents listed in table s4 highlighting its great potential for application in treating elemental mercury vapor from coal flue gas 3 12 photodegradation study in order to avoid secondary pollution we use the waste adsorbent after the adsorption of mercury ii as a photocatalyst to degrade rhb 5 15 mg l rhb solution can be completely degraded in 10 20 min and there is still a good photodegradation effect after five cycles moreover lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs was found to have a better photodegradation rate constant higher photoresponse current and lower resistance to rhb than lp c 3 n 4 and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s in the final exploration of the active site o2 and oh was found to play a more critical role than h in the photocatalytic process degradation of rhb at different concentrations by lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs performance testing of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs lp c 3 n 4 and lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s and the investigation of the active site is shown in supporting information fig 10 4 conclusions the results showed that lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s had an excellent adsorption capacity 61 52 mg g and an extremely high mercury ii removal rate 98 43 within 90 s at 298 k which exhibited a good recovery 92 05 in the fifth cycle as well as good adsorption of elemental mercury vapor 894 mg g lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s also had a good detection capacity for mercury ii the enrichment of trace amounts of mercury ii followed by the addition of tmb and h2o2 was able to be used to detect mercury ii in only 5 s with a minimum detection line of 1 ppb portable dynamic adsorption devices could reduce the concentration of mercury ii in industrial wastewater from 10 0 mg l to 0 8 μg l in 7 s meeting the drinking water standard the study on adsorption also showed that the adsorption process of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was consistent with the langmuir model whose maximum adsorption amount 1283 70 mg g could be calculated meanwhile the adsorption behavior of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s is consistent with the pseudo second order equation isotherm which proves that the adsorption process of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s is an electron sharing and chelation enrichment chemisorption process moreover the values of δgo and δho of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s were less than zero at 298 k 318 k which proved that the adsorption process of lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s was a feasible and spontaneous exothermic process the xps spectra indicated that the lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 s polysulfide in which s2 2 and sn 2 played a significant role enriched mercury ii in addition the application value of the adsorbent as a photoresponsive material after adsorption of mercury ii was further investigated in order to avoid secondary pollution lp c 3 n 4 ni mof 74 hgs could completely degrade a 10 mg l rhb solution within 15 min and the photocatalytic performance of the material was dramatically improved after the addition of mercury ii overall this research work developed a new three dimensional multifunctional material with good enrichment ability for mercury ii which can also be used as a sensor and the waste adsorbent can be used as a photocatalytic material after
