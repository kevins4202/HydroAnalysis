19365,biofiltration systems are highly valued in urban landscapes as they remove pollutants from stormwater runoff whilst contributing to a reduction in runoff volumes integrating trees in biofilters may improve their runoff retention performance as trees have greater transpiration than commonly used sedge or herb species high transpiration rates will rapidly deplete retained water creating storage capacity prior to the next runoff event however a tree with high transpiration rates in a biofilter system will likely be frequently exposed to drought stress selecting appropriate tree species therefore requires an understanding of how different trees use water and how they respond to substrate drying we selected 20 tree species and quantified evapotranspiration et and drought stress leaf water potential ψ in relation to substrate water content to compare species we developed metrics which describe i maximum rates of et under well watered conditions ii the sensitivity of et and iii the response of ψ to declining substrate water content using these three metrics we classified species into three groups risky balanced or conservative risky and balanced species showed high maximum et whereas conservative species always had low et as substrates dried the balanced species down regulated et to delay the onset of drought stress whereas risky species did not therefore balanced species with high et are more likely to improve the retention performance of biofiltration systems without introducing significant drought risk this classification of tree water use strategies can be easily integrated into water balance models and improve tree species selection for biofiltration systems keywords bioretention stormwater control measures evapotranspiration plant water use strategies 1 introduction cities generate large volumes of polluted stormwater runoff that often flows untreated from impervious surfaces into natural waterways via hydraulically efficient engineered drainage networks urban streams that receive this runoff degrade rapidly as a result bernhardt and palmer 2007 walsh et al 2005b in response a suite of stormwater control measures scms have been developed to reduce the volume and velocity of surface runoff entering waterways melbourne water 2005 ncdeq 2017 current thinking suggests that intercepting runoff from impervious surfaces can restore natural hydrological processes and improve the health of urban waterway ecosystems burns et al 2012 walsh et al 2005a biofilters also referred to as rain gardens or bioretention cells are scms which are highly efficient at reducing peak flow rates achieved through appropriate sizing extended detention zones and internal water storages brown and hunt 2011b davis 2008 hatt et al 2009 hunt et al 2008 the substrates used in biofilters intercept heavy metals davis et al 2001 and plants play a vital role in removing some soluble nutrient pollutants bratières et al 2008 consequently plant selection for biofiltration systems has focussed on nutrient uptake ability bratières et al 2008 hunt et al 2015 read et al 2008 in contrast relatively little attention has been given to selecting plants to improve runoff retention performance payne et al 2018 despite evapotranspiration et representing the major pre urbanisation loss of infiltrated rainfall plants are generally considered to play a minor role in the water balance of biofilters et 5 of runoff generated brown and hunt 2011b however several authors have recently suggested that et losses can represent a larger proportion of the water balance in biofilters hess et al 2017 li et al 2009 wadzuk et al 2015 few studies have directly quantified et in biofilters denich and bradford 2010 hess et al 2017 wadzuk et al 2015 as it is difficult to measure in situ hamel et al 2014 as such et is typically estimated i by quantifying other measured system losses li et al 2009 ii the use of standard equations brown and hunt 2011a 2011b or iii scaling up from leaf level measures of stomatal conductance scharenbroch et al 2016 coupled with the perception that et represents a minor component of the water balance the difficulties in quantifying et from biofilters may explain the relative lack of research focus to increase et as a means of improving retention performance we propose that runoff retention performance of biofiltration systems can be improved by selecting trees with high et trees or in fact any plants with high et capacity have the potential to rapidly deplete intercepted stormwater and therefore increase storage capacity before the next runoff event wadzuk et al 2015 yuan et al 2017 estimations of et from crop factors k c and reference et et o are particularly useful for comparing different vegetation types allen et al 1998 plant species commonly used in biofilters e g carex appressa have a high crop factor k c 1 65 hamel et al 2012 but a small total leaf area which reduces overall transpiration in comparison trees can support a far greater leaf area which can extend beyond the area of the biofilter facilitating transpiration of large volumes of water litvak et al 2012 mccarthy et al 2011 pataki et al 2011 from a small footprint at ground level berland et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 trees are also likely strong candidates for biofiltration systems as many possess traits which have been linked with improved runoff retention and nutrient pollutant removal including extensive root systems high biomass and rapid growth rates payne et al 2018 selecting tree species with a high k c and high canopy leaf area should therefore increase runoff retention and complement rather than jeopardise pollutant removal performance denman et al 2006 mangangka et al 2015 nocco et al 2016 payne et al 2018 one significant risk of selecting trees with high et is that they will rapidly deplete stored moisture which while beneficial for retention performance will likely expose them to drought stress grossiord et al 2017 this not only puts the vegetation at risk of failure but is also likely to decrease treatment performance payne et al 2018 this risk may be mitigated by designing systems with more water storage e g with a deeper substrate or an internal water storage created via a raised outlet glaister et al 2017 wadzuk et al 2015 xiao and mcpherson 2011 however once trees are established they can use substantial volumes of water and are likely to encounter soil moisture deficits even though we expect that tree roots in unlined system will eventually extend in to the surrounding in situ soil these soils will similarly experience periods of high and low water availability therefore as well as having high et rates when runoff water is available trees also need a high sensitivity to drought i e the ability to rapidly down regulate et as the biofilter substrates dry out rapid declines in et as substrates dry will delay the onset of drought stress allowing biofilter trees to survive for longer periods when substrate water is not available martin stpaul et al 2017 high sensitivity of et to decreasing substrate water availability is achieved in the short term via stomatal closure however the level of drought stress at which trees begin closing stomata plus how quickly and effectively they close is highly variable among tree species klein 2014 litvak et al 2012 oren et al 1999 therefore while it is relatively easy to select for high et using traits such as a high leaf area or fast growth rates it is difficult to select for high stomatal sensitivity either in relation to declining moisture in the substrate or atmospheric demand litvak et al 2012 there are several ways of quantifying et in relation to atmospheric demand as well as stomatal sensitivity to drying substrates for selecting trees with the most appropriate water use strategies for biofiltration systems we suggest the best way to integrate these strategies is to represent trees in the water balance e g daly et al 2012 stormwater management decisions at the catchment scale are underpinned by water balance models that estimate both treatment and runoff retention performance of different scms modelling an individual system or a treatment train of systems therefore requires accurate estimations of water inflows outflows fluxes and storages depending on the scm type different components receive more attention than others eger et al 2017 for example green roof water balance models focus heavily on accurate estimations of et as it is the major flux driving retention performance poë et al 2015 in contrast et is generally considered less important in biofiltration systems as it typically represents a minor component of the water balance brown and hunt 2011b improving estimates of et under well watered conditions by using species specific crop factors combined with functions which represent reductions in et as substrates dry will likely improve et estimations in water balance models szota et al 2017 water balance models should not only quantify fluxes such as et but also provide additional outputs on vegetation status such as drought stress e g laio et al 2001 porporato et al 2001 vico et al 2014 integration of a drought stress metric will aid the design process such that retention performance can be weighed against drought risk for alternative species stovin et al 2013 szota et al 2017 vico et al 2014 the aim of this study was to identify plant water use strategies likely to improve the retention performance of biofiltration systems specifically we were trying to identify species with a combination of i high evapotranspiration rates under well watered conditions to maximise retention performance ii high sensitivity to developing soil moisture deficits to minimise drought stress our approach was to develop functions to describe these behaviours such that they can be easily integrated into existing water balance models used to simulate performance of biofiltration systems e g daly et al 2012 2 materials and methods 2 1 species and substrate selection to identify tree species with suitable water use strategies we applied a habitat template approach lundholm 2006 to select species which have evolved in habitats with variable access to water but which also experience high atmospheric demand including ephemeral wetlands coastal and inland riparian zones and savannas we selected twenty tree species across these habitats species were selected to cover three different leaf morphologies broadleaf 12 cladode 4 and needle 4 occurrence data were sourced from the atlas of living australia http www ala org au to summarise the climatic distribution of each species table 1 representing the realised niche of each species on the australian continent i e in nature as well as in cultivation in spring 2015 15 one year old seedlings of each species were sourced from nurseries across australia and potted in black plastic pots diameter 230 mm height 210 mm the pots were filled by weight to achieve approximate depths of from bottom to top 2 cm of 14 mm drainage gravel a layer of geotextile to prevent loss of substrate 16 cm of substrate filter media and 2 cm of 7 mm gravel mulch to minimise evaporation the filter media was created by mixing a sandy loam soil with composted pine bark at a ratio of 3 1 by volume the sandy loam fraction was well graded with a particle size distribution by volume of 0 5 silt and clay 0 05 mm 7 very find sand 0 05 0 15 mm 18 fine sand 0 15 0 25 mm 37 medium sand 0 25 0 5 mm 28 coarse sand 0 5 1 mm 9 very coarse sand 1 2 mm and 0 5 fine gravel 2 mm unplanted or bare pots were also included as a means of quantifying evaporation pots were placed outside irrigated twice per day and watered with 1 g l 1 liquid npk fertiliser 20 20 20 every two weeks for 3 months while fertilisation is avoided in the field it was required in this glasshouse study to increase growth rates to ensure that plant roots fully explored the pot volumes prior to the start of the experiment after 3 months one species capparis mitchellii was considered too small and was removed from the experiment leaving 19 species for the experiment plus the bare pots after 3 months of growing outside 15 plants of each species including bare pots were moved into a glasshouse and watered every 1 3 days to acclimate them to glasshouse conditions for 3 weeks after 3 weeks of this regime all pots were well watered i e watered to exceed capacity of the pot every day for 1 week 2 2 experimental design the 15 plants per species including bare pots were then allocated to one of three groups i initial harvest ii well watered treatment or iii drought treatment with 5 replicates per group all pots were arranged in a randomised complete block design the experiment started on 17 02 2016 day 1 and ran until 30 04 2016 day 74 well watered plants were watered to exceed pot capacity at dusk each evening whereas the drought treatment plants were watered for the last time on the 16 02 2016 day 0 2 3 reference evapotranspiration we calculated reference evapotranspiration et o in mm d 1 using the penman monteith equation according to allen et al 1998 using data collected from a weather station installed in the glasshouse the weather station measured air temperature and relative humidity hmp 60 campbell scientific inc north logan ut usa wind speed 03101 l wind sentry 3 cup anemometer r m young company traverse city mi usa and solar radiation sp 110 silicon pyranometer apogee santa monica ca usa data were recorded with a campbell cr1000 data logger every second and stored with data averaged to 5 min resolution cr1000 campbell scientific inc north logan ut usa during the experiment the mean daytime temperature 0600 1800h in the glasshouse was 23 9 0 2 c range 14 5 30 2 c and mean daytime relative humidity was 61 5 1 1 range 38 6 83 2 mean et o was 1 15 0 04 mm d 1 ranging from 0 58 to 2 73 mm d 1 2 4 biomass plants in the initial harvest group were removed from the glasshouse on day 1 and destructively harvested to determine initial total biomass for each species leaves were stripped and leaf area determined using a li 3000 li cor biosciences lincoln ne usa stems were cut at the substrate surface substrate was washed from roots which were then patted dry fresh weights were determined separately for leaves stems and roots before drying in a 70 c oven for one week to determine dry weight the same procedure was followed for the final harvest all well watered plants were harvested on day 74 whereas droughted plants were removed from the glasshouse and harvested once leaves were desiccated 2 5 evapotranspiration daily evapotranspiration et was determined from pot weights using a scale mettler toledo melbourne australia 1g resolution pot weights were measured three times per day at pre dawn 0400 0600 h midday 1200 1400 h and dusk 1800 2000 h well watered pots were re watered every day following the dusk measurement and no post watering weight was captured after drainage had finished we therefore were not able to quantify night time evapotranspiration to quantify et we first calculated the weight of water evapotranspired from the change in pot weight from pre dawn to dusk each day due to differences in biomass among replicates within a species we standardised the weight of water evapotranspired each day such that daily evapotranspiration et g d 1 was calculated as e t w p r e w d u s k w b i o m a s s 1 5 w f i n a l b i o m a s s where w pre and w dusk represent pot weights at pre dawn and dusk in g w biomass 1 5 represents the total dry biomass of replicates 1 to 5 on the same day in g and w final biomass represents the mean total dry biomass for all 5 replicates as determined at the final harvest in g to relate et to et o we converted the weight of water evapotranspired g d 1 to volume ml d 1 then to depth mm d 1 by dividing the volume by the surface area of the pot 415 5 cm2 we estimated the total dry biomass of each replicate w biomass 1 5 for each day of the experiment using a linear interpolation between the initial and final harvests a linear assumption is reasonable for the relatively short timeframe of this experiment and agreed with the observed linear increase in pre dawn pot weights in the well watered treatment over time data not shown 2 6 substrate volumetric water content substrate volumetric water content was determined from pot weights at predawn midday and dusk each day of the experiment to determine water content at any given point the dry weight of non substrate components pot drainage gravel mulch gravel and the geotextile and the total fresh plant weight were subtracted from the pot weight the dry weight of each non substrate component was determined for all bare pots droughted and well watered n 10 at the end of the experiment after drying at 105 c for 1 week total fresh plant weight on each day of the experiment was estimated from linear interpolation of the change in biomass between the initial and final harvests substrate volumetric water content s in was then calculated as 2 s w w e t w d r y w d r y b d where wwet and wdry are the wet and dry weights of the substrate in g and bd is the bulk density of the substrate in g cm 3 the bulk density of the substrate was determined from all bare pots droughted and well watered n 10 by dividing the dry weight of the substrate by the volume it occupied in the pots 2 7 plant drought stress to determine plant drought stress leaf water potential ψ samples were taken at predawn and midday every 1 5 days samples were collected from both well watered and droughted plants with the sampling frequency designed to cover the full range of s at each sampling a leaf or terminal shoot was cut sealed in a zip lock plastic bag and stored in an insulated box on ice until it was measured leaf water potential was measured using a scholander type pressure chamber soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa a wet sponge was placed in the chamber to minimise leaf dehydration during measurements 2 8 data and statistical analyses three metrics were derived to describe the water use strategy of each tree species i maximum et under well watered conditions i e their crop factor k c ii sensitivity of et to declining s s et and iii sensitivity of ψ to declining s s ψ to determine k c for each species linear regression was used to relate et and et o for well watered plants where the slope of the relationship is equivalent to k c these models were forced through the origin and as such contain bias therefore adjusted r2 and p values were derived from a regression of fitted and observed values of et to describe sensitivity of et to declining s multi adaptive regression splines mars or broken stick models were fitted to the relationship between daily et as a proportion of et o et et o and s for the droughted plants only we used et et o to exclude the influence of evaporative demand and focus on et sensitivity to declining s to describe the sensitivity of leaf water potential to declining s broken stick models were also fitted to the relationship between ψ predawn and midday and s for both well watered and droughted plants by using broken stick models we could identify the critical value of s at which both et et o and ψ began to decline from their maximum values in response to drying of the soil substrate we refer to the critical et et o value as s et and the critical ψ as s ψ as broken stick models were non linear adjusted r2 and p values were derived from linear models of fitted and observed values of both et et o and ψ broken stick models were fitted with r version 3 4 1 r core team 2017 using the earth package milborrow 2015 which is based on the work of friedman 1991 we also used one way anova and tukey s post hoc tests to identify any significant differences among leaf types for each metric to determine the influence of plant size we used linear regression to relate final total biomass dry weight at the end of the experiment to each of the three metrics k c s et and s ψ for all these analyses residuals for each model were inspected for heteroscedasticity data were checked for normality shapiro wilk test and log transformed where necessary to categorise species based on these three metrics k c s et and s ψ we used a combination of principal components analysis pca and k means cluster analysis each metric was centred and standardised mean 0 standard deviation 1 and initial analysis of the pca biplot indicated three groups of species using the cluster package maechler et al 2017 in r r core team 2017 we used the k means algorithm of hartigan and wong 1979 to formally classify species into one of three groups i e k 3 based on our metrics the initial random cluster assignment of each observation can affect how the k means algorithm assigns species to groups james et al 2013 therefore we ran this analysis with 1000 random starting points i e nstart 1000 3 results 3 1 maximum rates of evapotranspiration crop factors k c of well watered plants represented by the slope of the relationship between et and et o indicate how efficiently each species can deplete substrate water values of k c varied from 0 66 to 1 87 fig 1 with a flexuosa e camaldulensis and m quinquenervia showing very high water use k c 1 5 the bare unplanted treatment showed a k c of 0 48 which indicates the contribution of evaporation to et the strength of the relationships between et o and et under well watered conditions were weak r2 0 16 0 54 but all models were highly significant p 0 001 there were no significant differences in k c among leaf types p 0 516 3 2 sensitivity of evapotranspiration to declining substrate water content the sensitivity of et adjusted for et o i e et et o to declining substrate water content s indicates the value of s at which different species started reducing et s et we suggest that a species with high sensitivity will show reductions in et et o at higher values of s species showed decreases in et et o at values of s between 11 3 and 19 7 fig 2 c gracilis g parviflora and c ficifolia were the most sensitive species showing reduced et et o at substrate water contents 19 broken stick models described the variability in et et o in relation to s with r2 between 0 34 and 0 87 fig 2 there were no significant differences in s et among leaf types p 0 619 3 3 sensitivity of plant drought stress to declining substrate water content the sensitivity of drought stress leaf water potential ψ to declining s indicates the value of s where different species started to show signs of drought stress s ψ we suggest that a less sensitive species shows increased drought stress i e a lower value of ψ at a lower value of s several species including p angustifolium a verticillata and c rhomboidea showed the onset of drought stress at very low values of s s ψ 9 fig 3 leaf water potential was strongly related to s r2 0 39 0 88 in all species except brachichyton populneus r2 0 08 however all models were highly significant p 0 001 there were no significant differences in s ψ among leaf types p 0 167 3 4 categorising species according to their water use and sensitivity to declining substrate water content the first two pca axes explained 81 9 of the variation fig 4 the first axis pc1 explained 50 2 of the variation and summarised variation between maximum rates of et i e the k c and sensitivity of drought stress to declining substrate water content s ψ that is species with a high k c that showed the onset of drought stress at relatively high values of s showed positive pc1 values whereas species with a low k c that showed increasing drought stress at low values of s showed negative pc1 values the second axis pc2 was strongly correlated with sensitivity of et s et to declining values of s and pc2 explained 31 7 of the variation species with more positive pc2 values had higher values of s et indicating species that reduced et at higher values of s i e they showed higher sensitivity to declining s using k means cluster analysis we classified species into three groups 1 risky 2 balanced and 3 conservative to describe their overall water use strategy table 2 risky species showed high k c and only reduced et after showing an increase in drought stress e g melaleuca quinquenervia balanced species also showed high k c but they reduced et prior to the onset of drought stress e g eucalyptus sideroxylon the conservative species were low water users low k c and only showed reduced water use and drought stress at very low substrate water contents e g casuarina pauper 3 5 relationships between plant biomass and maximum rates of water use and sensitivity to declining substrate water content the final total dry biomass of well watered plants was strongly and positively related to maximum rates of et i e species k c fig 5 a there were no relationships between final dry biomass and s et or s ψ at α 0 05 however final dry biomass was related to s ψ at α 0 10 fig 5b and c 4 discussion 4 1 integrating high water users into biofiltration systems three species showed very high et k c 1 5 under well watered conditions which when planted in a biofilter should facilitate rapid depletion of substrate water compared with low water users k c 1 rapid depletion of the substrate via et will increase storage capacity between inflow events and likely improve runoff retention performance hess et al 2017 mangangka et al 2015 nocco et al 2016 yuan et al 2017 the high k c values in our study were similar to those used for sedges k c 1 65 in previous biofiltration studies hamel et al 2012 this suggests limited advantage in the use of trees as compared with commonly used species e g carex appressa which have also demonstrated high nitrogen removal efficiency bratières et al 2008 however we studied tree seedlings in a glasshouse and although our k c values were appropriately scaled to the pot surface area mature trees will likely have higher k c values allen et al 1998 tree canopy areas in the field will exceed the area of a typical biofilter as the tree is maturing resulting in higher et per unit treatment area the area used to adjust et from volume to depth is central to this assumption and for comparing vegetation cover types for instance urban trees can utilise large volumes of water up to 260 kg d 1 pataki et al 2011 when this volume is converted to depth at the plot scale with an assumed tree density e g 100 trees ha 1 the depth of water transpired is similar to or significantly lower than other vegetation surfaces including grass litvak et al 2014 2017a however if volumetric transpiration is expressed relative to the surface area of a biofilter it is likely that trees with a high k c 1 5 will use more water than an equivalent surface area planted with sedges or rushes this hypothesis reveals the major limitation of our study in that it was performed with seedlings in a glasshouse rather than trees in the field field studies describing et relative to inflow events soil moisture regimes and a wide range of et o are required to support this hypothesis the extent to which selecting trees with a high k c will improve runoff retention will be influenced by the biofiltration system design it has been suggested that evapotranspiration can account for a significant proportion of generated runoff 19 even when sized at 4 5 of their impervious catchment area li et al 2009 this system catchment area ratio is generally considered adequate to decrease runoff volumes peak flows and achieve regional pollutant removal targets ncdeq 2017 payne et al 2015 however at this size the volume of inflow is likely to overwhelm any gains in runoff retention achieved by selecting species with higher et increasing system surface area to facilitate et is unlikely to be practicable therefore solutions which increase storage volume without increasing system area are required increasing storage by increasing depth of the filter media from current recommendations of 900 mm e g ncdeq 2017 payne et al 2015 would be highly suitable for deep rooted tree species and would return to the original design guidelines of clar and green 1993 which recommended 1 2 m of substrate for adequate root development of trees and shrubs brown and hunt 2011b storage volume can also be increased by integrating an internal water storage via a raised outflow brown and hunt 2011a glaister et al 2017 ncdeq 2017 winston et al 2016 utilising sub surface structures or engineered soils bartens et al 2009 page et al 2015 and or outlet control structures scharenbroch et al 2016 which will provide a greater opportunity for trees to utilise captured runoff between inflow events hess et al 2017 scharenbroch et al 2016 wadzuk et al 2015 xiao and mcpherson 2011 deeper substrates and more complicated sub surface structures will likely increase the cost of installation however we suggest that integrating trees into biofiltration systems without increasing storage volume may limit the gains achieved by selecting tree species with a high k c as per other stormwater control measures climate will be a major determinant of the extent by which selecting species with a high k c will improve retention performance hunt et al 2006 stovin et al 2013 in the short term et o in the days following rainfall will be a major driver of et and therefore retention of subsequent events which is why the antecedent dry weather period is often strongly related to retention performance mangangka et al 2015 yuan et al 2017 in very cold climates with year round low et o selecting high water users will likely have a minimal impact on retention performance even in warmer climates where most rainfall occurs during winter when et o is low species with a high k c may take a long time to dry out the substrate between events which will limit their potential benefits in temperate cities such as melbourne australia which has an even rainfall distribution 54 0 1 6 mm per month long term 128 year average for melbourne regional office station 86071 sourced from silo jeffrey et al 2001 species with a high k c will likely have significant opportunity to deplete stored water between events in all but the coldest winter months wadzuk et al 2015 we therefore suggest that species with a high k c should only be prioritised in climates with an even distribution of rainfall or higher rainfall in the summer months 4 2 selecting trees with high water use and sensitivity to drying substrates selecting for a high k c alone is likely to result in drought stress and potentially tree death however this will depend on the regularity of inflows system storage and tree water use for example even in melbourne where rainfall is relatively evenly distributed over the year the 20 annual exceedance probability aep antecedent dry weather period adwp is 31 days and 50 days for the 1 aep melbourne regional office station 86071 sourced from silo jeffrey et al 2001 a biofilter sized to 2 of a 100 m2 impervious catchment with a depth of 1 m could store 700 l of water with an assumed field capacity of 35 established trees have the potential to utilise 70 260 l d 1 litvak et al 2012 therefore 700 l of storage could be rapidly depleted and an extended adwp period will likely expose trees to drought stress therefore our distinction between risky and balanced species is important as it describes how species responded to substrate drying species identified as risky showed increased drought stress before they down regulated et putting them at greater risk of experiencing severe drought stress down regulation of et is related to stomatal sensitivity to decreasing leaf water status i e ψ which during drought is primarily governed by substrate water content klein 2014 martin stpaul et al 2017 porporato et al 2001 as leaves dehydrate they lose turgor which results in stomatal closure and a decrease in transpiration species differ in the level of drought stress at which they begin to regulate water loss klein 2014 oren et al 1999 our risky species dried out more before closing stomata this strategy is most likely to improve retention performance as risky species will effectively continue to transpire until water in the substrate is depleted however this strategy comes with significant risk as once soil moisture is depleted risky species have already dehydrated and therefore have less water stored internally to facilitate recovery once drought stress is alleviated blackman et al 2016 in contrast balanced species reduced et at higher substrate water contents effectively delaying the onset of drought stress and reducing the risk of severe drought stress developing selecting balanced species represents a trade off as they were not among the highest water users however they all showed values of k c 1 we therefore suggest that balanced species with high k c and the ability to reduce water use as substrates dry will improve runoff retention performance while minimising the risk of drought stress as we would expect k c was strongly related to plant biomass where larger plants used more water lundholm et al 2010 nagase and dunnett 2012 payne et al 2018 yuan et al 2017 however plant biomass was not related to the substrate water content at which plants down regulated s et and poorly related to the s where plants showed increasing drought stress s ψ therefore while selecting tree species based on size leaf area or growth rates may inform selection for maximum rates of et it will likely not describe drought response and therefore risk of drought stress and possible death we evaluated these responses in the glasshouse but ideally they should be tested also in the field e g by instrumenting trees with sapflow sensors and stem or leaf psychrometers to monitor diel patterns of transpiration and water potential these measures should be combined with substrate moisture content including water level sensors where subsurface reservoirs are installed and meteorological measures to calculate as well as adjust et o and vapour pressure deficit d for site specific factors litvak et al 2017b to develop functions which describe drought response ideally these functions should be related to physiological e g hydraulic vulnerability brodribb et al 2010 morphological or anatomical traits e g wood anatomy litvak et al 2012 such that drought response can be estimated in the absence of glasshouse or field data when selecting new species several of the species we evaluated had a low k c and only down regulated et and became drought stressed at very low substrate moisture contents we classified these as conservative species and suggest that although they are more likely to survive extreme drought in biofiltration systems the low et would decrease runoff retention compared with balanced or risky species these conservative species would be highly suitable in urban plantings not irrigated with stormwater or in stormwater control measures in arid climates with strongly seasonal rainfall there is currently significant focus on selecting drought tolerant urban tolerant trees for hotter warmer future climates steenberg et al 2017 integration of tree plantings with stormwater control measures may reduce the vulnerability of currently used tree species e g may et al 2013 nitschke et al 2017 however this will depend on whether tree species vulnerability is driven by soil moisture deficit atmospheric demand or heat stress grossiord et al 2017 4 3 implementing tree water use strategies in water balance models the three classifications we derived can be easily incorporated into existing water balance models for biofilters e g daly et al 2012 this will allow for comparisons of retention performance among potential tree species in relation to both climate and system design to briefly describe one approach we follow the assumptions of daly et al 2012 where et is primarily responsible for depletion of water and will occur at a maximum rate k c or e max in daly et al 2012 until the critical substrate water content is reached s et or s in daly et al 2012 in contrast to daly et al 2012 our results suggest that below s et et will decline linearly towards a species specific threshold substrate water content rather than toward the permanent wilting point of the substrate s w in daly et al 2012 we attribute this to differences in the ability of species to adjust leaf water potentials to facilitate transpiration at values of s below the permanent wilting point of the substrate sanders and arndt 2012 we suggest that our methods of deriving k c and s et can be applied to any species and integrated into water balance models with relatively minor adjustments allowing us to compare differences in et and therefore runoff retention among alternative species when employing water balance models for biofilter design and species selection it is relatively simple to include an estimate of drought stress as an output to weigh against retention performance szota et al 2017 vico et al 2014 in the absence of functions to describe plant water status in relation to substrate moisture incidence of drought stress can be inferred from the substrate water content e g number of days below permanent wilting point stovin et al 2013 however using a species specific value of s indicating the onset of drought stress s ψ or the substrate permanent wilting point only provides a relative indication of drought risk rather than an estimate of tree mortality e g lethal water potential brodribb et al 2010 it has been suggested that once substrate moisture has been depleted the volume of water stored within various plant tissues capacitance may predict how long the plant will survive that is retain the ability to recover once stress is alleviated blackman et al 2016 however we suggest that biofiltration systems should be designed such that vegetation does not experience levels of drought stress which could lead to damage the hydraulic systems of the plant and result in slow recovery of transpiration therefore quantifying drought risk using either the substrate permanent wilting point or metrics derived from species specific functions e g s et or s ψ remain useful indicators overall we suggest that integrating an estimate of drought stress into water balance models will facilitate species selection and allow retention performance to be weighed against drought risk szota et al 2017 5 conclusions we described tree water use strategies to determine their potential to increase et and therefore retention performance of biofiltration systems we suggest that species with a high k c and high stomatal sensitivity high s et will improve retention performance while minimising the risk of drought stress the benefits of this approach are more likely to be realised if the volumetric storage capacity of biofiltration systems is increased by increased substrate depth integration of an internal water storage and use of outlet control structures we have described the tree water use strategies identified such that they can be integrated into water balance models as part of the design process we suggest that the strategies identified should now be compared in the field to determine how they will perform in response to realistic inflow regimes soil moisture and evaporative demand acknowledgements this work was funded by an australian research council linkage grant

19365,biofiltration systems are highly valued in urban landscapes as they remove pollutants from stormwater runoff whilst contributing to a reduction in runoff volumes integrating trees in biofilters may improve their runoff retention performance as trees have greater transpiration than commonly used sedge or herb species high transpiration rates will rapidly deplete retained water creating storage capacity prior to the next runoff event however a tree with high transpiration rates in a biofilter system will likely be frequently exposed to drought stress selecting appropriate tree species therefore requires an understanding of how different trees use water and how they respond to substrate drying we selected 20 tree species and quantified evapotranspiration et and drought stress leaf water potential ψ in relation to substrate water content to compare species we developed metrics which describe i maximum rates of et under well watered conditions ii the sensitivity of et and iii the response of ψ to declining substrate water content using these three metrics we classified species into three groups risky balanced or conservative risky and balanced species showed high maximum et whereas conservative species always had low et as substrates dried the balanced species down regulated et to delay the onset of drought stress whereas risky species did not therefore balanced species with high et are more likely to improve the retention performance of biofiltration systems without introducing significant drought risk this classification of tree water use strategies can be easily integrated into water balance models and improve tree species selection for biofiltration systems keywords bioretention stormwater control measures evapotranspiration plant water use strategies 1 introduction cities generate large volumes of polluted stormwater runoff that often flows untreated from impervious surfaces into natural waterways via hydraulically efficient engineered drainage networks urban streams that receive this runoff degrade rapidly as a result bernhardt and palmer 2007 walsh et al 2005b in response a suite of stormwater control measures scms have been developed to reduce the volume and velocity of surface runoff entering waterways melbourne water 2005 ncdeq 2017 current thinking suggests that intercepting runoff from impervious surfaces can restore natural hydrological processes and improve the health of urban waterway ecosystems burns et al 2012 walsh et al 2005a biofilters also referred to as rain gardens or bioretention cells are scms which are highly efficient at reducing peak flow rates achieved through appropriate sizing extended detention zones and internal water storages brown and hunt 2011b davis 2008 hatt et al 2009 hunt et al 2008 the substrates used in biofilters intercept heavy metals davis et al 2001 and plants play a vital role in removing some soluble nutrient pollutants bratières et al 2008 consequently plant selection for biofiltration systems has focussed on nutrient uptake ability bratières et al 2008 hunt et al 2015 read et al 2008 in contrast relatively little attention has been given to selecting plants to improve runoff retention performance payne et al 2018 despite evapotranspiration et representing the major pre urbanisation loss of infiltrated rainfall plants are generally considered to play a minor role in the water balance of biofilters et 5 of runoff generated brown and hunt 2011b however several authors have recently suggested that et losses can represent a larger proportion of the water balance in biofilters hess et al 2017 li et al 2009 wadzuk et al 2015 few studies have directly quantified et in biofilters denich and bradford 2010 hess et al 2017 wadzuk et al 2015 as it is difficult to measure in situ hamel et al 2014 as such et is typically estimated i by quantifying other measured system losses li et al 2009 ii the use of standard equations brown and hunt 2011a 2011b or iii scaling up from leaf level measures of stomatal conductance scharenbroch et al 2016 coupled with the perception that et represents a minor component of the water balance the difficulties in quantifying et from biofilters may explain the relative lack of research focus to increase et as a means of improving retention performance we propose that runoff retention performance of biofiltration systems can be improved by selecting trees with high et trees or in fact any plants with high et capacity have the potential to rapidly deplete intercepted stormwater and therefore increase storage capacity before the next runoff event wadzuk et al 2015 yuan et al 2017 estimations of et from crop factors k c and reference et et o are particularly useful for comparing different vegetation types allen et al 1998 plant species commonly used in biofilters e g carex appressa have a high crop factor k c 1 65 hamel et al 2012 but a small total leaf area which reduces overall transpiration in comparison trees can support a far greater leaf area which can extend beyond the area of the biofilter facilitating transpiration of large volumes of water litvak et al 2012 mccarthy et al 2011 pataki et al 2011 from a small footprint at ground level berland et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 trees are also likely strong candidates for biofiltration systems as many possess traits which have been linked with improved runoff retention and nutrient pollutant removal including extensive root systems high biomass and rapid growth rates payne et al 2018 selecting tree species with a high k c and high canopy leaf area should therefore increase runoff retention and complement rather than jeopardise pollutant removal performance denman et al 2006 mangangka et al 2015 nocco et al 2016 payne et al 2018 one significant risk of selecting trees with high et is that they will rapidly deplete stored moisture which while beneficial for retention performance will likely expose them to drought stress grossiord et al 2017 this not only puts the vegetation at risk of failure but is also likely to decrease treatment performance payne et al 2018 this risk may be mitigated by designing systems with more water storage e g with a deeper substrate or an internal water storage created via a raised outlet glaister et al 2017 wadzuk et al 2015 xiao and mcpherson 2011 however once trees are established they can use substantial volumes of water and are likely to encounter soil moisture deficits even though we expect that tree roots in unlined system will eventually extend in to the surrounding in situ soil these soils will similarly experience periods of high and low water availability therefore as well as having high et rates when runoff water is available trees also need a high sensitivity to drought i e the ability to rapidly down regulate et as the biofilter substrates dry out rapid declines in et as substrates dry will delay the onset of drought stress allowing biofilter trees to survive for longer periods when substrate water is not available martin stpaul et al 2017 high sensitivity of et to decreasing substrate water availability is achieved in the short term via stomatal closure however the level of drought stress at which trees begin closing stomata plus how quickly and effectively they close is highly variable among tree species klein 2014 litvak et al 2012 oren et al 1999 therefore while it is relatively easy to select for high et using traits such as a high leaf area or fast growth rates it is difficult to select for high stomatal sensitivity either in relation to declining moisture in the substrate or atmospheric demand litvak et al 2012 there are several ways of quantifying et in relation to atmospheric demand as well as stomatal sensitivity to drying substrates for selecting trees with the most appropriate water use strategies for biofiltration systems we suggest the best way to integrate these strategies is to represent trees in the water balance e g daly et al 2012 stormwater management decisions at the catchment scale are underpinned by water balance models that estimate both treatment and runoff retention performance of different scms modelling an individual system or a treatment train of systems therefore requires accurate estimations of water inflows outflows fluxes and storages depending on the scm type different components receive more attention than others eger et al 2017 for example green roof water balance models focus heavily on accurate estimations of et as it is the major flux driving retention performance poë et al 2015 in contrast et is generally considered less important in biofiltration systems as it typically represents a minor component of the water balance brown and hunt 2011b improving estimates of et under well watered conditions by using species specific crop factors combined with functions which represent reductions in et as substrates dry will likely improve et estimations in water balance models szota et al 2017 water balance models should not only quantify fluxes such as et but also provide additional outputs on vegetation status such as drought stress e g laio et al 2001 porporato et al 2001 vico et al 2014 integration of a drought stress metric will aid the design process such that retention performance can be weighed against drought risk for alternative species stovin et al 2013 szota et al 2017 vico et al 2014 the aim of this study was to identify plant water use strategies likely to improve the retention performance of biofiltration systems specifically we were trying to identify species with a combination of i high evapotranspiration rates under well watered conditions to maximise retention performance ii high sensitivity to developing soil moisture deficits to minimise drought stress our approach was to develop functions to describe these behaviours such that they can be easily integrated into existing water balance models used to simulate performance of biofiltration systems e g daly et al 2012 2 materials and methods 2 1 species and substrate selection to identify tree species with suitable water use strategies we applied a habitat template approach lundholm 2006 to select species which have evolved in habitats with variable access to water but which also experience high atmospheric demand including ephemeral wetlands coastal and inland riparian zones and savannas we selected twenty tree species across these habitats species were selected to cover three different leaf morphologies broadleaf 12 cladode 4 and needle 4 occurrence data were sourced from the atlas of living australia http www ala org au to summarise the climatic distribution of each species table 1 representing the realised niche of each species on the australian continent i e in nature as well as in cultivation in spring 2015 15 one year old seedlings of each species were sourced from nurseries across australia and potted in black plastic pots diameter 230 mm height 210 mm the pots were filled by weight to achieve approximate depths of from bottom to top 2 cm of 14 mm drainage gravel a layer of geotextile to prevent loss of substrate 16 cm of substrate filter media and 2 cm of 7 mm gravel mulch to minimise evaporation the filter media was created by mixing a sandy loam soil with composted pine bark at a ratio of 3 1 by volume the sandy loam fraction was well graded with a particle size distribution by volume of 0 5 silt and clay 0 05 mm 7 very find sand 0 05 0 15 mm 18 fine sand 0 15 0 25 mm 37 medium sand 0 25 0 5 mm 28 coarse sand 0 5 1 mm 9 very coarse sand 1 2 mm and 0 5 fine gravel 2 mm unplanted or bare pots were also included as a means of quantifying evaporation pots were placed outside irrigated twice per day and watered with 1 g l 1 liquid npk fertiliser 20 20 20 every two weeks for 3 months while fertilisation is avoided in the field it was required in this glasshouse study to increase growth rates to ensure that plant roots fully explored the pot volumes prior to the start of the experiment after 3 months one species capparis mitchellii was considered too small and was removed from the experiment leaving 19 species for the experiment plus the bare pots after 3 months of growing outside 15 plants of each species including bare pots were moved into a glasshouse and watered every 1 3 days to acclimate them to glasshouse conditions for 3 weeks after 3 weeks of this regime all pots were well watered i e watered to exceed capacity of the pot every day for 1 week 2 2 experimental design the 15 plants per species including bare pots were then allocated to one of three groups i initial harvest ii well watered treatment or iii drought treatment with 5 replicates per group all pots were arranged in a randomised complete block design the experiment started on 17 02 2016 day 1 and ran until 30 04 2016 day 74 well watered plants were watered to exceed pot capacity at dusk each evening whereas the drought treatment plants were watered for the last time on the 16 02 2016 day 0 2 3 reference evapotranspiration we calculated reference evapotranspiration et o in mm d 1 using the penman monteith equation according to allen et al 1998 using data collected from a weather station installed in the glasshouse the weather station measured

110 silicon pyranometer apogee santa monica ca usa data were recorded with a campbell cr1000 data logger every second and stored with data averaged to 5 min resolution cr1000 campbell scientific inc north logan ut usa during the experiment the mean daytime temperature 0600 1800h in the glasshouse was 23 9 0 2 c range 14 5 30 2 c and mean daytime relative humidity was 61 5 1 1 range 38 6 83 2 mean et o was 1 15 0 04 mm d 1 ranging from 0 58 to 2 73 mm d 1 2 4 biomass plants in the initial harvest group were removed from the glasshouse on day 1 and destructively harvested to determine initial total biomass for each species leaves were stripped and leaf area determined using a li 3000 li cor biosciences lincoln ne usa stems were cut at the substrate surface substrate was washed from roots which were then patted dry fresh weights were determined separately for leaves stems and roots before drying in a 70 c oven for one week to determine dry weight the same procedure was followed for the final harvest all well watered plants were harvested on day 74 whereas droughted plants were removed from the glasshouse and harvested once leaves were desiccated 2 5 evapotranspiration daily evapotranspiration et was determined from pot weights using a scale mettler toledo melbourne australia 1g resolution pot weights were measured three times per day at pre dawn 0400 0600 h midday 1200 1400 h and dusk 1800 2000 h well watered pots were re watered every day following the dusk measurement and no post watering weight was captured after drainage had finished we therefore were not able to quantify night time evapotranspiration to quantify et we first calculated the weight of water evapotranspired from the change in pot weight from pre dawn to dusk each day due to differences in biomass among replicates within a species we standardised the weight of water evapotranspired each day such that daily evapotranspiration et g d 1 was calculated as e t w p r e w d u s k w b i o m a s s 1 5 w f i n a l b i o m a s s where w pre and w dusk represent pot weights at pre dawn and dusk in g w biomass 1 5 represents the total dry biomass of replicates 1 to 5 on the same day in g and w final biomass represents the mean total dry biomass for all 5 replicates as determined at the final harvest in g to relate et to et o we converted the weight of water evapotranspired g d 1 to volume ml d 1 then to depth mm d 1 by dividing the volume by the surface area of the pot 415 5 cm2 we estimated the total dry biomass of each replicate w biomass 1 5 for each day of the experiment using a linear interpolation between the initial and final harvests a linear assumption is reasonable for the relatively short timeframe of this experiment and agreed with the observed linear increase in pre dawn pot weights in the well watered treatment over time data not shown 2 6 substrate volumetric water content substrate volumetric water content was determined from pot weights at predawn midday and dusk each day of the experiment to determine water content at any given point the dry weight of non substrate components pot drainage gravel mulch gravel and the geotextile and the total fresh plant weight were subtracted from the pot weight the dry weight of each non substrate component was determined for all bare pots droughted and well watered n 10 at the end of the experiment after drying at 105 c for 1 week total fresh plant weight on each day of the experiment was estimated from linear interpolation of the change in biomass between the initial and final harvests substrate volumetric water content s in was then calculated as 2 s w w e t w d r y w d r y b d where wwet and wdry are the wet and dry weights of the substrate in g and bd is the bulk density of the substrate in g cm 3 the bulk density of the substrate was determined from all bare pots droughted and well watered n 10 by dividing the dry weight of the substrate by the volume it occupied in the pots 2 7 plant drought stress to determine plant drought stress leaf water potential ψ samples were taken at predawn and midday every 1 5 days samples were collected from both well watered and droughted plants with the sampling frequency designed to cover the full range of s at each sampling a leaf or terminal shoot was cut sealed in a zip lock plastic bag and stored in an insulated box on ice until it was measured leaf water potential was measured using a scholander type pressure chamber soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa a wet sponge was placed in the chamber to minimise leaf dehydration during measurements 2 8 data and statistical analyses three metrics were derived to describe the water use strategy of each tree species i maximum et under well watered conditions i e their crop factor k c ii sensitivity of et to declining s s et and iii sensitivity of ψ to declining s s ψ to determine k c for each species linear regression was used to relate et and et o for well watered plants where the slope of the relationship is equivalent to k c these models were forced through the origin and as such contain bias therefore adjusted r2 and p values were derived from a regression of fitted and observed values of et to describe sensitivity of et to declining s multi adaptive regression splines mars or broken stick models were fitted to the relationship between daily et as a proportion of et o et et o and s for the droughted plants only we used et et o to exclude the influence of evaporative demand and focus on et sensitivity to declining s to describe the sensitivity of leaf water potential to declining s broken stick models were also fitted to the relationship between ψ predawn and midday and s for both well watered and droughted plants by using broken stick models we could identify the critical value of s at which both et et o and ψ began to decline from their maximum values in response to drying of the soil substrate we refer to the critical et et o value as s et and the critical ψ as s ψ as broken stick models were non linear adjusted r2 and p values were derived from linear models of fitted and observed values of both et et o and ψ broken stick models were fitted with r version 3 4 1 r core team 2017 using the earth package milborrow 2015 which is based on the work of friedman 1991 we also used one way anova and tukey s post hoc tests to identify any significant differences among leaf types for each metric to determine the influence of plant size we used linear regression to relate final total biomass dry weight at the end of the experiment to each of the three metrics k c s et and s ψ for all these analyses residuals for each model were inspected for heteroscedasticity data were checked for normality shapiro wilk test and log transformed where necessary to categorise species based on these three metrics k c s et and s ψ we used a combination of principal components analysis pca and k means cluster analysis each metric was centred and standardised mean 0 standard deviation 1 and initial analysis of the pca biplot indicated three groups of species using the cluster package maechler et al 2017 in r r core team 2017 we used the k means algorithm of hartigan and wong 1979 to formally classify species into one of three groups i e k 3 based on our metrics the initial random cluster assignment of each observation can affect how the k means algorithm assigns species to groups james et al 2013 therefore we ran this analysis with 1000 random starting points i e nstart 1000 3 results 3 1 maximum rates of evapotranspiration crop factors k c of well watered plants represented by the slope of the relationship between et and et o indicate how efficiently each species can deplete substrate water values of k c varied from 0 66 to

indicates the value of s at which different species started reducing et s et we suggest that a species with high sensitivity will show reductions in et et o at higher values of s species showed decreases in et et o at values of s between 11 3 and 19 7 fig 2 c gracilis g parviflora and c ficifolia were the most sensitive species showing reduced et et o at substrate water contents 19 broken

drought stress to declining substrate water content the sensitivity of drought stress leaf water potential ψ to declining s indicates the value of s where different species started to show signs of

positive pc1 values whereas species with a low k c that showed increasing drought stress at low values of s showed negative pc1 values the second axis pc2 was strongly correlated with sensitivity of et s et to declining values of s and pc2 explained 31 7 of the variation species with more positive pc2 values had higher values of s et indicating species that reduced et at higher values of s i e they showed higher sensitivity to declining s using k means cluster analysis we classified species into three groups 1 risky 2 balanced and 3 conservative to describe their overall water use strategy

onset of drought stress e g eucalyptus sideroxylon the conservative species were low water users low k c and only showed reduced water use and drought stress at very low substrate water contents e g casuarina pauper 3 5 relationships between plant biomass and maximum rates of water use and sensitivity to declining substrate water content the final total dry biomass of well watered plants was strongly and positively related to maximum rates of et i e species k c fig 5 a there were no relationships between final dry biomass and s et or s ψ at α 0 05 however final dry biomass was related to s ψ at α 0 10 fig 5b and c 4 discussion 4 1 integrating high water users into biofiltration systems three species showed very high et k c 1 5 under well watered conditions which when planted in a biofilter should facilitate rapid depletion of substrate water compared with low water users k c 1 rapid depletion of the substrate via et will increase storage capacity between inflow events and likely improve runoff retention performance hess et al 2017 mangangka et al 2015 nocco et al 2016 yuan et al 2017 the high k c values in our study were similar to those used for sedges k c 1 65 in previous biofiltration studies hamel et al 2012 this suggests limited advantage in the use of trees as compared with commonly used species e g carex appressa which have also demonstrated high nitrogen removal efficiency bratières et al 2008 however we studied tree seedlings in a glasshouse and although our k c values were appropriately scaled to the pot surface area mature trees will likely have higher k c values allen et al 1998 tree canopy areas in the field will exceed the area of a typical biofilter as the tree is maturing resulting in higher et per unit treatment area the area used to adjust et from volume to depth is central to this assumption and for comparing vegetation cover types for instance urban trees can utilise large volumes of water up to 260 kg d 1 pataki et al 2011 when this volume is converted to depth at the plot scale with an assumed tree density e g 100 trees ha 1 the depth of water transpired is similar to or significantly lower than other vegetation surfaces including grass litvak et al 2014 2017a however if volumetric transpiration is expressed relative to the surface area of a biofilter it is likely that trees with a high k c 1 5 will use more water than an equivalent surface area planted with sedges or rushes this hypothesis reveals the major limitation of our study in that it was performed with seedlings in a glasshouse rather than trees in the field field studies describing et relative to inflow events soil moisture regimes and a wide range of et o are required to support this hypothesis the extent to which selecting trees with a high k c will improve runoff retention will be influenced by the biofiltration system design it has been suggested that evapotranspiration can account for a significant proportion of generated runoff 19 even when sized at 4 5 of their impervious catchment area li et al 2009 this system catchment area ratio is generally considered adequate to decrease runoff volumes peak flows and achieve regional pollutant removal targets ncdeq 2017 payne et al 2015 however at this size the volume of inflow is likely to overwhelm any gains in runoff retention achieved by selecting species with higher et increasing system surface area to facilitate et is unlikely to be practicable therefore solutions which increase storage volume without increasing system area are required increasing storage by increasing depth of the filter media from current recommendations of 900 mm e g ncdeq 2017 payne et al 2015 would be highly suitable for deep rooted tree species and would return to the original design guidelines of clar and green 1993 which recommended 1 2 m of substrate for adequate root development of trees and shrubs brown and hunt 2011b storage volume can also be increased by integrating an internal water storage via a raised outflow brown and hunt 2011a glaister et al 2017 ncdeq 2017 winston et al 2016 utilising sub surface structures or engineered soils bartens et al 2009 page et al 2015 and or outlet control structures scharenbroch et al 2016 which will provide a greater opportunity for trees to utilise captured runoff between inflow events hess et al 2017 scharenbroch et al 2016 wadzuk et al 2015 xiao and mcpherson 2011 deeper substrates and more complicated sub surface structures will likely increase the cost of installation however we suggest that integrating trees into biofiltration systems without increasing storage volume may limit the gains achieved by selecting tree species with a high k c as per other stormwater control measures climate will be a major determinant of the extent by which selecting species with a high k c will improve retention performance hunt et al 2006 stovin et al 2013 in the short term et o in the days following rainfall will be a major driver of et and therefore retention of subsequent events which is why the antecedent dry weather period is often strongly related to retention performance mangangka et al 2015 yuan et al 2017 in very cold climates with year round low et o selecting high water users will likely have a minimal impact on retention performance even in warmer climates where most rainfall occurs during winter when et o is low species with a high k c may take a long time to dry out the substrate between events which will limit their potential benefits in temperate cities such as melbourne australia which has an even rainfall distribution 54 0 1 6 mm per month long term 128 year average for melbourne regional office station 86071 sourced from silo jeffrey et al 2001 species with a high k c will likely have significant opportunity to deplete stored water between events in all but the coldest winter months wadzuk et al 2015 we therefore suggest that species with a high k c should only be prioritised in climates with an even distribution of rainfall or higher rainfall in the summer months 4 2 selecting trees with high water use and sensitivity to drying substrates selecting for a high k c alone is likely to result in drought stress and potentially tree death however this will depend on the regularity of inflows system storage and tree water use for example even in melbourne where rainfall is relatively evenly distributed over the year the 20 annual exceedance probability aep antecedent dry weather period adwp is 31 days and 50 days for the 1 aep melbourne regional office station 86071 sourced from silo jeffrey et al 2001 a biofilter sized to 2 of a 100 m2 impervious catchment with a depth of 1 m could store 700 l of water with an assumed field capacity of 35 established trees have the potential to utilise 70 260 l d 1 litvak et al 2012 therefore 700 l of storage could be rapidly depleted and an extended adwp period will likely expose trees to drought stress therefore our distinction between risky and balanced species is important as it describes how species responded to substrate drying species identified as risky showed increased drought stress before they down regulated et putting them at greater risk of experiencing severe drought stress down regulation of et is related to stomatal sensitivity to decreasing leaf water status i e ψ which during drought is primarily governed by substrate water content klein 2014 martin stpaul et al 2017 porporato et al 2001 as leaves dehydrate they lose turgor which results in stomatal closure and a decrease in transpiration species differ in the level of drought stress at which they begin to regulate water loss klein 2014 oren et al 1999 our risky species dried out more before closing stomata this strategy is most likely to improve retention performance as risky species will effectively continue to transpire until water in the substrate is depleted however this strategy comes with significant risk as once soil moisture is depleted risky species have already dehydrated and therefore have less water stored internally to facilitate recovery once drought stress is alleviated blackman et al 2016 in contrast balanced species reduced et at higher substrate water contents effectively delaying the onset of drought stress and reducing the risk of severe drought stress developing selecting balanced species represents a trade off as they were not among the highest water users however they all showed values of k c 1 we therefore suggest that balanced species with high k c and the ability to reduce water use as substrates dry will improve runoff retention performance while minimising the risk of drought stress as we would expect k c was strongly related to plant biomass where larger plants used more water lundholm et al 2010 nagase and dunnett 2012 payne et al 2018 yuan et al 2017 however plant biomass was not related to the substrate water content at which plants down regulated s et and poorly related to the s where plants showed increasing drought stress s ψ therefore while selecting tree species based on size leaf area or growth rates may inform selection for maximum rates of et it will likely not describe drought response and therefore risk of drought stress and possible death we evaluated these responses in the glasshouse but ideally they should be tested also in the field e g by instrumenting trees with sapflow sensors and stem or leaf psychrometers to monitor diel patterns of transpiration and water potential these measures should be combined with substrate moisture content including water level sensors where subsurface reservoirs are installed and meteorological measures to calculate as well as adjust et o and vapour pressure deficit d for site specific factors litvak et al 2017b to develop functions which describe drought response ideally these functions should be related to physiological e g hydraulic vulnerability brodribb et al 2010 morphological or anatomical traits e g wood anatomy litvak et al 2012 such that drought response can be estimated in the absence of glasshouse or field data when selecting new species several of the species we evaluated had a low k c and only down regulated et and became drought stressed at very low substrate moisture contents we classified these as conservative species and suggest that although they are more likely to survive extreme drought in biofiltration systems the low et would decrease runoff retention compared with balanced or risky species these conservative species would be highly suitable in urban plantings not irrigated with stormwater or in stormwater control measures in arid climates with strongly seasonal rainfall there is currently significant focus on selecting drought tolerant urban tolerant trees for hotter warmer future climates steenberg et al 2017 integration of tree plantings with stormwater control measures may reduce the vulnerability of currently used tree species e g may et al 2013 nitschke et al 2017 however this will depend on whether tree species vulnerability is driven by soil moisture deficit atmospheric demand or heat stress grossiord et al 2017 4 3 implementing tree water use strategies in water balance models the three classifications we derived can be easily incorporated into existing water balance models for biofilters e g daly et al 2012 this will allow for comparisons of retention performance among potential tree species in relation to both climate and system design to briefly describe one approach we follow the assumptions of daly et al 2012 where et is primarily responsible for depletion of water and will occur at a maximum rate k c or e max in daly et al 2012 until the critical substrate water content is reached s et or s in daly et al 2012 in contrast to daly et al 2012 our results suggest that below s et et will decline linearly towards a species specific threshold substrate water content rather than toward the permanent wilting point of the substrate s w in daly et al 2012 we attribute this to differences in the ability of species to adjust leaf water potentials to facilitate transpiration at values of s below the permanent wilting point of the substrate sanders and arndt 2012 we suggest that our methods of deriving k c and s et can be applied to any species and integrated into water balance models with relatively minor adjustments allowing us to compare differences in et and therefore runoff retention among alternative species when employing water balance models for biofilter design and species selection it is relatively simple to include an estimate of drought stress as an output to weigh against retention performance szota et al 2017 vico et al 2014 in the absence of functions to describe plant water status in relation to substrate moisture incidence of drought stress can be inferred from the substrate water content e g number of days below permanent wilting point stovin et al 2013 however using a species specific value of s indicating the onset of drought stress s ψ or the substrate permanent wilting point only provides a relative indication of drought risk rather than an estimate of tree mortality e g lethal water potential brodribb et al 2010 it has been suggested that once substrate moisture has been depleted the volume of water stored within various plant tissues capacitance may predict how long the plant will survive that is retain the ability to recover once stress is alleviated blackman et al 2016 however we suggest that biofiltration systems should be designed such that vegetation does not experience levels of drought stress which could lead to damage the hydraulic systems of the plant and result in slow recovery of transpiration therefore quantifying drought risk using either the substrate permanent wilting point or metrics derived from species specific functions e g s et or s ψ remain useful indicators overall we suggest that integrating an estimate of drought stress into water balance models will facilitate species selection and allow retention performance to be weighed against drought risk szota et al 2017 5 conclusions we described tree water use strategies to determine their potential to increase et and therefore retention performance of biofiltration systems we suggest that species with a high k c and high stomatal sensitivity high s et will improve retention performance while minimising the risk of drought stress the benefits of this approach are more likely to be realised if the volumetric storage capacity of biofiltration systems is increased by increased substrate depth integration of an internal water storage and use of outlet control structures we have described the tree water use strategies identified such that they can be integrated into water balance models as part of the design process we suggest that the strategies identified should now be compared in the field to determine how they will perform in response to realistic inflow regimes soil moisture and evaporative demand acknowledgements this work was funded by an australian research council linkage grant

19366,while flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is a potential alternative to brackish and or sea water desalination there is limited understanding of both the fate of ions following migration across the ion exchange membranes and the mechanisms responsible for ion separation in this study we investigate the desalting performance of an fcdi system operated over a range of conditions results show that although ion transport as a result of electrodialysis is inevitable in fcdi and is principally responsible for ph excursion in the flow electrode the use of high carbon content ensures that a high proportion of the charge and counterions are retained in the electrical double layers of the flowing carbon particles even at high charging voltages e g 2 0 v during the deionization process estimation of the portions of sodium and chloride ions adsorbed in the flow electrode after migration through the membranes suggests that the ongoing capacitive adsorption exhibits asymmetric behavior with the anodic particles demonstrating better affinity for cl than the cathodic particles for na during electrosorption these findings provide an explanation for the change in electrode properties that are observed under imperfect adsorption scenarios and provide insight into aspects of the design and operation of flow electrode pairs that is critical to achieving effective desalination by fcdi

both rapid population growth and regional water shortages qureshi et al 2013 tilman et al 2002 for example significant declines in the irrigated area in the murray darling basin in australia have

2014 as a consequence dryland communities are finding it necessary to draw on alternative sources of water with particular interest in utilizing brackish i e moderate salt content waters provided cost effective methods of salt removal can be found anderson et al 2010 of the salt removal methods available there is particular interest in the use of flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi one of the variants of the increasingly popular method of capacitive deionization jeon et al 2013 2014 ma et al 2016 suss et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a compared to conventional technologies such as reverse osmosis ro that extracts the majority phase i e the water from the very dilute brackish water during deionization fcdi is based on the formation of electrical double layers edls in charged suspensions of electrodes enabling capacitive energy storage with the minority constituents i e ions immobilized and selectively extracted from the saline water nativ et al 2017 porada et al 2013a tang et al 2015 fcdi technology has distinctive benefits for brackish water desalination including excellent salt removal capacity continuous desalting operation with simultaneous regeneration of the electrodes and if designed appropriately harvesting of valuable products from the waste stream jeon et al 2013 linnartz et al 2017 rommerskirchen et al 2015 suss et al 2015 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b a variety of studies have been conducted recently aimed at improving the charge ion transfer rates in fcdi for example it has been reported that higher mass densities in flow electrodes can be achieved with the use of either oxidized carbon materials or fluidized beds leading to more effective electronic charge percolation doornbusch et al 2016 hatzell et al 2015 alternatively the relatively poor electrical conductivity of the flow electrodes compared to the solid electrodes can be improved through the use of redox active mediators and or high salt concentration aqueous electrolytes ma et al 2016 yang et al 2016 while it may be deduced that an increase in the rate of charge transfer in fcdi will facilitate the desalting performance the mechanisms underlying the correlation of ion migration and removal with charge transfer in flow electrodes are still unclear according to the modified donnan md theory non faradaic interaction of ions with the charged flow electrodes is expected in fcdi mediated brackish water desalination jeon et al 2013 with ion transport from macropores to micropores sufficiently fast for this process to be close to equilibrium porada et al 2013b however there is no avoiding the fact that the majority constituent of flow electrodes are the electrolytes with recent evidence indicating that a significant proportion of the ions removed in fcdi end up in the solution phase of the electrode chambers i e as a component of the electrolytes with this process of ion removal essentially identical to that of electrodialysis hand and cusick 2017 nativ et al 2017 provided that these contributions dominate ion migration in fcdi the electrode attraction and adsorption of cations and anions would be less likely to occur with the surplus charge on the electrode surface likely inducing interfacial redox reactions and the dissociation of water molecules and production of oh and h to achieve charge neutralization in the solution phase zhang et al 2018a substantial change in ph of the electrode slurries would be expected to occur as a result of these faradaic processes with change in ph recognized to potentially influence the adsorption capacity of the active materials nativ et al 2017 wang et al 2016 given the potential role of electrodialytic contributions to water desalination the voltages applied for fcdi should be typically constrained within the non faradaic window i e 1 23 v however consistent with the results from a very recent publication in which carbon black was used to facilitate charge transfer in the carbon suspensions liang et al 2017 our findings in this study show that an fcdi system with a carbon loading of 10 wt could be operated at relatively high charging voltages i e 1 6 2 0 v with the charge efficiency sustained at 90 as a result a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals underlying these contradictory observations is considered vital both to optimising the operating conditions of fcdi systems and to development of innovative flow electrode configurations and materials well suited to high concentration brine desalination in this study an fcdi system was constructed with the use of composite current collectors that were made of graphite paper and acrylic sheets influence of different carbon mass loadings and charging voltages on the desalting performance was investigated with consideration given to the fate of ions after passing through the ion exchange membranes the key questions addressed in the present work include i how does the desalting performance of the fcdi system change as a function of both the carbon content in the flow electrodes and the charging voltages ii what are the likely mechanisms accounting for ion separation in fcdi and iii what is the association between the desalting performance under different operating conditions and the ion separation mechanisms that are in play 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals were analytical reagent

current collectors placed against the ion exchange membranes were made of graphite paper and acrylic sheets the carved serpentine flow channels on the acrylic sheets were 3 mm wide and 1 5 mm deep fig 1a each channel was 125 mm long with in total 9 channels connected in one line from the inlet to the outlet resulting in an effective contact area a eff between the ion exchange membrane and the flow electrode of 34 9 cm2 all parts were held together with the use of acrylic end plates fig 1a 2 3 operating conditions the flow electrode was prepared from a dispersion of activated charcoal and commercial carbon black in a 2000 mg nacl l 1 aqueous solution the weight ratio of charcoal to carbon black was 9 1 with total solid concentrations of 1 2 5 and 10 wt the mixtures were then stirred on a magnetic stirrer for 24 h to achieve homogeneous carbon suspensions our preliminary results showed that the desalting performance of the current design was comparable with the conventional design i e graphite carved in the same manner at high carbon contents 10 wt with the similarity in performance likely a result of the frequent direct contact between particles effectively resulting in a conductive 3d network si section s1 and figs s1 and s2 indeed good interparticle connectivity has previously been shown to facilitate electron transfer in similar carbon materials presser et al 2012 the studies described here were carried out at carbon contents of 0 2 for comparison and 10 wt unless otherwise stated all fcdi experiments were conducted in batch mode with the brackish stream 25 ml of a 2000 mg l 1 nacl solution continuously cycled using a peristaltic pump through the spacer from a storage flask at a flow rate of 25 ml min 1 fig 1b the electrical conductivity of this stream was continuously monitored with the use of a conductivity meter con bta vernier connected to a data acquisition system sensordaq vernier the flow electrode slurries 50 g each were recirculated between the fcdi cell and two stirred conical flasks respectively using a dual head peristaltic pump longer pump baoding china at a constant flow rate of 50 ml min 1 fig 1a this mode is termed isolated closed cycle icc operation in one operating cycle electrosorption was carried out at a constant charging voltage 0 8 2 0 v using a dc power supply mp3094 powertech followed immediately by reversed voltage desorption rvd for electrode regeneration unless elsewhere stated note that in this study the anode is termed the electrode and or current collector that is positively charged during the charging process while the cathode is the electrode and or current collector that is negatively charged during the charging process after regeneration of the electrodes the polarity of the electrodes was reversed in order to initiate the next cycle in which anions were again adsorbed to the carbon particles adjacent to the anode with cations adsorbed to the carbon particles adjacent to the cathode preliminary results indicated that the fcdi system has a reliable cycling stability si figs s3 and s4 control experiments were carried out with the use of 2000 mg nacl l aqueous solutions no carbon as the flow electrode with other operating conditions set the same as described above 2 4 analytical methods and calculations the current i through the electrical circuit was recorded every second using a vernier current probe connected to the sensordaq the change of ph in the brackish stream and flow electrode was measured using an f 51 ph meter horiba japan to quantify the concentrations of sodium and chloride species including chloride cl hypochlorite ocl and chlorate clo3 samples from the brackish stream and flow electrode were collected at appropriate intervals with measurements conducted on an icp oes spectrometer agilent varian vista pro 710 and an ics 3000 ion chromatograph dionex u s respectively according to the protocols described elsewhere tang et al 2015 tsarev et al 2016 the average salt removal rate asrr μg cm 2 s 1 of the fcdi cell was calculated as follows eq 1 ma et al 2016 1 asrr c 0 c t v s a t where c 0 and c t are the initial nacl concentration and nacl concentration at time t g l 1 in the brackish stream respectively v s a and t represent the total volume of the salt solution 25 ml the effective contact area between the ion exchange membrane and the flow electrode 34 9 cm2 and operation time s respectively the dynamic charge efficiency λ dyn and specific energy consumption p as a function of effluent salt concentrations were evaluated using the

following electrosorption are documented in si section s2 and fig s5 one tailed and two tailed t tests sigmaplot 12 5 systat software inc were performed in order to assess the statistical differences at a confidence level of 95 3 results and discussion 3 1 desalting performance at different carbon loadings results of desalination using the fcdi unit with 2 and 10 wt carbon contents at different charging voltages are summarized in fig 2 control experiments i e no carbon particles present resulting in a process that is effectively electrodialysis were carried out with the use of 2000 mg nacl l aqueous solutions as the flow electrode as can be seen from fig 2a asrr exhibits a positive relationship with the charging voltage for instance at a carbon content of 2 wt the asrr was 0 0514 μg cm 2 s 1 at 1 2 v but increased to 0 1437 μg cm 2 s 1 at 2 0 v in accordance with the results from si fig s1b much higher asrr values were obtained at higher carbon contents up to 10 wt it has been reported that electrochemical desalination technologies should be operated under a certain voltage threshold to avoid undesirable side reactions such as water splitting he et al 2016 porada et al 2013b fig 2b shows that the dynamic charge efficiency λ dyn of the control experiments decreases significantly when the charging voltage exceeds 1 2 v one tailed p 0 05 indeed λ dyn of the electrodialysis process dropped to 57 3 at 2 0 v meanwhile results of the present work indicate that an increase in the carbon content in the flow electrode is conducive to inhibiting the charge loss during deionization at high voltages for instance when the fcdi cell was operated at 2 0 v λ dyn was sustained at around 84 9 and 94 5 at carbon mass loadings of 2 and 10 wt respectively fig 2b the carbon content in the flow electrodes also has significant impacts on the energy consumption for desalination it can be seen from fig 2c that the use of 10 wt results in a decrease in the gradient of the energy consumption plot with the charging voltage ranging from 0 8 to 2 0 v this finding is presumably associated with the higher charge transfer efficiency at higher carbon mass loadings si figs s1 and s2 3 2 ph excursion and its implications to desalting mechanisms the ph variation in the anode and cathode chambers in one operating cycle are summarized in fig 3 in the control tests fig 3a rapid ph increase was observed in the cathode chamber at a charging voltage over 1 2 v whilst acidification of the anolyte became severe when the charging voltage exceeded 1 6 v it has been reported that ph increase during electrochemical desalination can be associated with the reduction of oxygen and or hydrogen evolution dykstra et al 2017 he et al 2016 in comparison acidification in the anode chamber may be ascribed to the oxidation of the graphite and chloride and or splitting of water at high charging voltage biesheuvel et al 2015 dykstra et al 2017 he et al 2016 tang et al 2017 tedesco et al 2016 though ph excursion was also noted in the flow electrodes with 2 and 10 wt carbon contents fig 3b and c the change became less significant with the incorporation of carbon materials in the flow electrode moreover the ph of the desalted water was maintained at around 7 0 over successive operating cycles n 3 5 at voltages of 1 6 and 2 0 v si table s1 indicating that symmetric removal of anion and cation and h and oh from the brackish stream was occurring given that the flow anode and anodic current collector was positively charged during electrosorption while the flow cathode and cathodic current collector was negatively charged the h and oh generated should be released for the most part into the solution phase as such the parameters δ h asrr and δ oh asrr are introduced here to indicate the concomitant production of h and oh during the deionization step consideration has been given to the consumable h and oh incorporated into other entities such as carbonate for details see si section s3 and fig s6 it can be observed from si fig s7 that following 1800 s of reaction in the control experiments δ h asrr and δ oh asrr values of 0 003 0 017 and 0 40 3 08 mm μg cm 2 s 1 1 respectively are obtained at low voltages while the values of these parameters increase to 2 26 and 18 44 mm μg cm 2 s 1 1 on increasing the charging voltage to 2 0 v in contrast the use of porous carbon in the flow electrode largely inhibits the faradaic reactions in the flow electrode with δ h asrr and δ oh asrr values at 2 0 v of 0 013 0 026 and 0 25 0 48 mm μg cm 2 s 1 1 respectively si fig s7 a plausible explanation for these findings relates to competition for charges between the electrodialytic i e ions end up in the electrolyte and capacitive i e ions end up in the edls and pores processes that are occurring during deionization fig 4 with regard to the electrodialytic contribution counterions migrate across the membranes in the presence of an electrical field redox reactions occur at high voltages resulting in the neutralization of the charge with h oh nativ et al 2017 strathmann 2010 these processes would be expected to lead to an increase in the concentrations of h oh in the electrolyte of the flow electrodes fig 3 and si fig s7 although it has been reported that an aqueous electrolyte with a high salt concentration can result in a decrease in the ionic resistance yang et al 2016 critical concerns remain regarding the accumulation of ions at the electrolyte membrane interface i e increase in cna x t and ccl x t due to the elevated concentrations in the electrolyte which would increase the polarization resistance with the ongoing deionization likely causing back diffusion of counterions galama et al 2013 also reported that the accumulation of counterions may be expected to lead to the adsorption of co ions from the solution phase with the subsequent leakage of co ions driven by concentration difference across the membrane resulting in a decrease in the efficiency of ion migration tedesco et al 2016 meanwhile faradaic reactions such as oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution also lead to charge injection and or exchange at the electrode electrolyte interface with these processes competing with electron ion transport thereby resulting in deterioration in energy efficiency fig 4 in comparison the high conductivity of the carbon clusters is conducive to a decrease in internal resistance of the flow electrode with the capacitive mechanism of deionization sustaining the coupling of charge and ion transfer due to the formation of edls porada et al 2013b suss et al 2015 in support of these hypotheses high current density i e high voltage across the spacer channel high λ dyn but low energy consumption was observed at 2 0 v at high carbon contents fig 2 3 3 comparison of the electrodialytic and capacitive processes in fcdi estimates of the portions of na p na and cl p cl adsorbed in the edls of the carbon particles in the flow electrode chambers after migration through the membranes are provided in fig 5 our preliminary results indicated that the removal of sodium and chloride ions due to physical adsorption was negligible si figs s8 s10 it can be observed that the flow electrode used in this study has high affinity for cl during electrosorption with p cl generally over 90 for carbon contents of 2 and 10 wt with this result consistent with the finding that the anodic reactions associated with h production were significantly inhibited in the fcdi system compared to the control system i e in the absence of carbon particles fig 3 and si fig s7 of particular importance is the result that typical products of cl oxidation including ocl and clo3 were not detectable in this study with this finding indicating that i chloride oxidation at the anode is not occurring even at relatively high voltages e g 2 0 v and or ii the small amounts of oxidized chloride species that are produced are readily adsorbed by the carbon electrode in comparison the darco activated charcoal used in the flow electrode chambers has a low affinity for na with p na values between 20 and 50 fig 5 a plausible explanation for the low efficiency of na adsorption to the edls might be related to the abundance of electron acceptors e g oxygen in the cathode chamber that undergo redox reactions near the electrodes figs 3 and 4 likely resulting in i electron exchange at the electrode electrolyte interface and ii loss of adsorption capacity by the cathodic edls the portion of na retained by the carbon particles is significantly higher at 2 0 v e g one tailed p 0 05 which might account for the high λ dyn observed in the fcdi even when the charging voltage exceeds the typical threshold fig 2 as the coupling of ion and charge in the edls is capable of retarding electron loss due to cathodic reactions such as hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction fig 4 dykstra et al 2017 he et al 2016 tang et al 2017 in a typical cdi system the oxidation of the carbon anode could result in a change in the point of zero charge of the carbon surface and a relocation in the potential of zero charge of the carbon electrode avraham et al 2011 gao et al 2015 these changes in the physicochemical properties of the anode are likely to result in ongoing reduction in salt separation capacity during cdi operation porada et al 2013b fig 6 a shows that the surface zeta potential of the anode becomes more positive following successive operation cycles this is however not surprising in view of the asymmetric capacitive behavior of the system during electrosorption fig 5 i e the decoupling of na and electrons from the edls at the cathode might be envisaged to lead to a surplus of positive charge at the anode with the unbalanced charge pairs likely causing a positive shift in the short circuit potential e o the change of the surface site groups resulting in a shift in pk h to a higher value fig 6b and si section s4 and fig s11 also supports our hypothesis it has been reported that for adsorption of similar amounts of counter ions at both the anode and cathode e o should be closer to the potential of the electrode of higher adsorption rate because of the potential shift needed for thermodynamic and or kinetic equilibrium between the electrode pairs to be achieved gao et al 2014 similar consideration should be given to the non ideal scenario in which the occurrence of an e o value closer to the potential of the more efficient electrode is attributed to relocation of the redundant charge on the electrode during short circuit it should be noted that the competitive electrodialytic and capacitive processes and the resultant impacts on f cdi performance are also dependent on the properties of the carbon materials e g surface functional groups for example nativ et al 2017 used a flow electrode comprised of 5 wt of norit sx ultra activated charcoal in di water with their results showing that this kind of carbon material had a relatively higher affinity for na compared to cl following correction for the electrodialytic bias the average ion adsorption rates aiar and dynamic ion adsorption capacities iacdyn under different conditions are provided in si figs s12 and s13 with a charging voltage of 2 0 v aiar values for na and cl in the fcdi system described here are 0 133 and 0 359 μg cm 2 s 1 respectively at a carbon content of 10 wt si fig s13 indicates that iacdyn of the darco charcoal are more likely dependent on the charging voltages rather than the carbon concentrations with iacdyn of na and cl reaching 2 07 2 42 and 5 58 6 77 mg g 1 respectively following 1800 s of electrosorption at 2 0 v fcdi can be used not only as a highly efficient alternative to deionization but also an innovative method to study the fundamental mechanisms that are occurring beneath the superficial observations in cdi results of this study clearly show that brackish water desalination in f cdi should be a combined process of electrodialysis and capacitive deionization ion transport through the membranes is followed by i charge neutralization in the electrolyte and or ii ion immobilization with the counter charge in the edls to date ion adsorption k 1 in fig 4 has been recognized as a rate limiting step in f cdi with more and more studies focusing on the development of novel materials with high capacities nam and choi 2017 xu et al 2016 in comparison little consideration has been given to the concomitant electrodialysis process which could lead to the accumulation of ions in the aqueous solution and increase in back diffusion and co ion leakage as such models involving the electrodialytic contributions should be introduced to optimise the desalination process and in particular to prevent ion transport across the membranes k 2 in fig 4 becoming rate limiting prior to the electrodes reaching adsorption saturation it has been emphasized that cdi should be operated under a certain potential threshold to avoid unfavorable side reactions however our findings suggest that high λ dyn could be achieved at high voltages on condition that the coupling of charge and counter ion is sustained in the edls despite concerns remaining with regard to long term operation while the immobilization of counter ions in the edls was not enhanced with the increase of carbon content from 2 to 10 wt fcdi with high carbon loading mass demonstrated higher charge efficiency this fact might be related to good interparticle connectivity of the flow electrode at high carbon concentrations i e low electronic resistance with this interconnectivity facilitating electron percolation within the carbon materials liang et al 2017 yang et al 2016 nevertheless it is still not clear which parameters and or operating conditions are most important in the coupling and decoupling of charge and counter ion in the edls and considerably more insight into factors controlling desalination rate and charge or current efficiency is required before high voltage or high current mode could be recommended as a viable choice for f cdi this study is also of particular significance to the understanding of the asymmetric adsorption behaviors in f cdi with this understanding critical to the development and comparison of novel materials while there is great progress in the preparation of electrodes of high capacitance and ion selectivity with the use of pseudocapacitive materials capable of intercalating ions into the inorganic organic matrices via fast and reversible redox reactions at the electrode surface boota et al 2015 nam and choi 2017 more attention should be paid to the less efficient counter electrodes as they will be rate limiting in relation to ion adsorption with these inefficiencies leading to a change of electrode properties which can affect energy recovery during electrode regeneration si fig s14 4 conclusions results of this study indicate that operating conditions e g carbon content and charging voltage have significant impacts on the contributions of electrodialytic and capacitive processes to deionization in fcdi while a portion of the ions transported to the electrode chambers in fcdi will remain in solution and contribute to the electrolyte present in the electrode chambers and contribute to ph excursion in the flow electrode the use of high carbon content ensures that a high proportion of the charge and counter ions are retained in the electrical double layers of the flowing carbon particles even at high charging voltages e g 2 0 v during the deionization process estimation of the distribution of na and cl in the flow electrode after migration through the membranes suggests that the ongoing capacitive adsorption exhibits asymmetric behavior with the anodic particles demonstrating a better affinity for cl than the cathodic particles for na during electrosorption these results provide an

both rapid population growth and regional water shortages qureshi et al 2013 tilman et al 2002 for example significant declines in the irrigated area in the murray darling basin in australia have occurred over the last decade abs 2008 2013 with this change associated with climate change related diversion of winds that usually bring rain to southern australia closer to antarctica abram et al 2014 as a consequence dryland communities are finding it necessary to draw on alternative sources of water with particular interest in utilizing brackish i e moderate salt content waters provided cost effective methods of salt removal can be found anderson et al 2010 of the salt removal methods available there is particular interest in the use of flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi one of the variants of the increasingly popular method of capacitive deionization jeon et al 2013 2014 ma et al 2016 suss et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a compared to conventional technologies such as reverse osmosis ro that extracts the majority phase i e the water from the very dilute brackish water during deionization fcdi is based on the formation of electrical double layers edls in charged suspensions of electrodes enabling capacitive energy storage with the minority constituents i e ions immobilized and selectively extracted from the saline water nativ et al 2017 porada et al 2013a tang et al 2015 fcdi technology has distinctive benefits for brackish water desalination including excellent salt removal capacity continuous desalting operation with simultaneous regeneration of the electrodes and if designed appropriately harvesting of valuable products from the waste stream jeon et al 2013 linnartz et al 2017 rommerskirchen et al 2015 suss et al 2015 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b a variety of studies have been conducted recently aimed at improving the charge ion transfer rates in fcdi for example it has been reported that higher mass densities in flow electrodes can be achieved with the use of either oxidized carbon materials or fluidized beds leading to more effective electronic charge percolation doornbusch et al 2016 hatzell et al 2015 alternatively the relatively poor electrical conductivity of the flow electrodes compared to the solid electrodes can be improved through the use of redox active mediators and or high salt concentration aqueous electrolytes ma et al 2016 yang et al 2016 while it may be deduced that an increase in the rate of charge transfer in fcdi will facilitate the desalting performance the mechanisms underlying the correlation of ion migration and removal with charge transfer in flow electrodes are still unclear according to the modified donnan md theory non faradaic interaction of ions with the charged flow electrodes is expected in fcdi mediated brackish water desalination jeon et al 2013 with ion transport from macropores to micropores sufficiently fast for this process to be close to equilibrium porada et al 2013b however there is no avoiding the fact that the majority constituent of flow electrodes are the electrolytes with recent evidence indicating that a significant proportion of the ions removed in fcdi end up in the solution phase of the electrode chambers i e as a component of the electrolytes with this process of ion removal essentially identical to that of electrodialysis hand and cusick 2017 nativ et al 2017 provided that these contributions dominate ion migration in fcdi the electrode attraction and adsorption of cations and anions would be less likely to occur with the surplus charge on the electrode surface likely inducing interfacial redox reactions and the dissociation of water molecules and production of oh and h to achieve charge neutralization in the solution phase zhang et al 2018a substantial change in ph of the electrode slurries would be expected to occur as a result of these faradaic processes with change in ph recognized to potentially influence the adsorption capacity of the active materials nativ et al 2017 wang et al 2016 given the potential role of electrodialytic contributions to water desalination the voltages applied for fcdi should be typically constrained within the non faradaic window i e 1 23 v however consistent with the results from a very recent publication in which carbon black was used to facilitate charge transfer in the carbon suspensions liang et al 2017 our findings in this study show that an fcdi system with a carbon loading of 10 wt could be operated at relatively high charging voltages i e 1 6 2 0 v with the charge efficiency sustained at 90 as a result a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals underlying these contradictory observations is considered vital both to optimising the operating conditions of fcdi systems and to development of innovative flow electrode configurations and materials well suited to high concentration brine desalination in this study an fcdi system was constructed with the use of composite current collectors that were made of graphite paper and acrylic sheets influence of different carbon mass loadings and charging voltages on the desalting performance was investigated with consideration given to the fate of ions after passing through the ion exchange membranes the key questions addressed in the present work include i how does the desalting performance of the fcdi system change as a function of both the carbon content in the flow electrodes and the charging voltages ii what are the likely mechanisms accounting for ion separation in fcdi and iii what is the association between the desalting performance under different operating conditions and the ion separation mechanisms that are in play 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals were analytical reagent

average pore size and bet surface area of 1 44 nm and 917 5 m2 g 1 respectively 2 2 experimental setup fig 1 a and b depict the structure and composition of our fcdi cell that consists of a spacer chamber thickness of 500 μm made of a silicone gasket and a nylon sheet 100 mesh 160 mm 70 mm between the cation and anion exchange membranes cem type i aem type i fujifilm europe fig 1a two composite current collectors placed against the ion exchange membranes were made of graphite paper and acrylic sheets the carved serpentine flow channels on the acrylic sheets were 3 mm wide and 1 5 mm deep fig 1a each channel was 125 mm long with in total 9 channels connected in one line from the inlet to the outlet resulting in an effective contact area a eff between the ion exchange membrane and the flow electrode of 34 9 cm2 all parts were held together with the use of acrylic end plates fig 1a 2 3 operating conditions the flow electrode was prepared from a dispersion of activated charcoal and commercial carbon black in a 2000 mg nacl l 1 aqueous solution the weight ratio of charcoal to carbon black was 9 1 with total solid concentrations of 1 2 5 and 10 wt the mixtures were then stirred on a magnetic stirrer for 24 h to achieve homogeneous carbon suspensions our preliminary results showed that the desalting performance of the current design was comparable with the conventional design i e graphite carved in the same manner at high carbon contents 10 wt with the similarity in performance likely a result of the frequent direct contact between particles effectively resulting in a conductive 3d network si section s1 and figs s1 and s2 indeed good interparticle connectivity has previously been shown to facilitate electron transfer in similar carbon materials presser et al 2012 the studies described here were carried out at carbon contents of 0 2 for comparison and 10 wt unless otherwise stated all fcdi experiments were conducted in batch mode with the brackish stream 25 ml of a 2000 mg l 1 nacl solution continuously cycled using a peristaltic pump through the spacer from a storage flask at a flow rate of 25 ml min 1 fig 1b the electrical conductivity of this stream was continuously monitored with the use of a conductivity meter con bta vernier connected to a data acquisition system sensordaq vernier the flow electrode slurries 50 g each were recirculated between the fcdi cell and two stirred conical flasks respectively using a dual head peristaltic pump longer pump baoding china at a constant flow rate of 50 ml min 1 fig 1a this mode is termed isolated closed cycle icc operation in one operating cycle electrosorption was carried out at a constant charging voltage 0 8 2 0 v using a dc power supply mp3094 powertech followed immediately by reversed voltage desorption rvd for electrode regeneration unless elsewhere stated note that in this study the anode is termed the electrode and or current collector that is positively charged during the charging process while the cathode is the electrode and or current collector that is negatively charged during the charging process after regeneration of the electrodes the polarity of the electrodes was reversed in order to initiate the next cycle in which anions were again adsorbed to the carbon particles adjacent to the anode with cations adsorbed to the carbon particles adjacent to the cathode preliminary results indicated that the fcdi system has a reliable cycling stability si figs s3 and s4 control experiments were carried out with the use of 2000 mg nacl l aqueous solutions no carbon as the flow electrode with other operating conditions set the same as described above 2 4 analytical methods and calculations the current i through the electrical circuit was recorded every second using a vernier current probe connected to the sensordaq the change of ph in the brackish stream and flow electrode was measured using an f 51 ph meter horiba japan to quantify the concentrations of sodium and chloride species including chloride cl hypochlorite ocl and chlorate clo3 samples from the brackish stream and flow electrode were collected at appropriate intervals with measurements conducted on an icp oes spectrometer agilent varian vista pro 710 and an ics 3000 ion chromatograph dionex u s respectively according to the protocols described elsewhere tang et al 2015 tsarev et al 2016 the average salt removal rate asrr μg cm 2 s 1 of the fcdi cell was calculated as follows eq 1 ma et al 2016 1 asrr c 0 c t v s a t where c 0 and c t are the initial nacl concentration and nacl concentration at time t g l 1 in the brackish stream respectively v s a and t represent the total volume of the salt solution 25 ml the effective contact area between the ion exchange membrane and the flow electrode 34 9 cm2 and operation time s respectively the dynamic charge efficiency λ dyn and specific energy consumption p as a function of effluent salt concentrations were evaluated using the

following electrosorption are documented in si section s2 and fig s5 one tailed and two tailed t tests sigmaplot 12 5 systat software inc were performed in order to assess the statistical differences at a confidence level of 95 3 results and discussion 3 1 desalting performance at different carbon loadings results of desalination using the fcdi unit with 2 and 10 wt carbon contents at different charging voltages are summarized in fig 2 control experiments i e no carbon particles present resulting in a process that is effectively electrodialysis were carried out with the use of 2000 mg nacl l aqueous solutions as the flow electrode as can be seen from fig 2a asrr exhibits a positive relationship with the charging voltage for instance at a carbon content of 2 wt the asrr was 0 0514 μg cm 2 s 1 at 1 2 v but increased to 0 1437 μg cm 2 s 1 at 2 0 v in accordance with the results from si fig s1b much higher asrr values were obtained at higher carbon contents up to 10 wt it has been reported that electrochemical desalination technologies should be operated under a certain voltage threshold to avoid undesirable side reactions such as water splitting he et al 2016 porada et al 2013b fig 2b shows that the dynamic charge efficiency λ dyn of the control experiments decreases significantly when the charging voltage exceeds 1 2 v one tailed p 0 05 indeed λ dyn of the electrodialysis process dropped to 57 3 at 2 0 v meanwhile results of the present work indicate that an increase in the carbon content in the flow electrode is conducive to inhibiting the charge loss during deionization at high voltages for instance when the fcdi cell was operated at 2 0 v λ dyn was sustained at around 84 9 and 94 5 at carbon mass loadings of 2 and 10 wt respectively fig 2b the carbon content in the flow electrodes also has significant impacts on the energy consumption for desalination it can be seen from fig 2c that the use of 10 wt results in a decrease in the gradient of the energy consumption plot with the charging voltage ranging from 0 8 to 2 0 v this finding is presumably associated with the higher charge transfer efficiency at higher carbon mass loadings si figs s1 and s2 3 2 ph excursion and its implications to desalting mechanisms the ph variation in the anode and cathode chambers in one operating cycle are summarized in fig 3 in the control tests fig 3a rapid ph increase was observed in the cathode chamber at a charging voltage over 1 2 v whilst acidification of the anolyte became severe when the charging voltage exceeded 1 6 v it has been reported that ph increase during electrochemical desalination can be associated with the reduction of oxygen and or hydrogen evolution dykstra et al 2017 he et al 2016 in comparison acidification in the anode chamber may be ascribed to the oxidation of the graphite and chloride and or splitting of water at high charging voltage biesheuvel et al 2015 dykstra et al 2017 he et al 2016 tang et al 2017 tedesco et al 2016 though ph excursion was also noted in the flow electrodes with 2 and 10 wt carbon contents fig 3b and c the change became less significant with the incorporation of carbon materials in the flow electrode moreover the ph of the desalted water was maintained at around 7 0 over successive operating cycles n 3 5 at voltages of 1 6 and 2 0 v si table s1 indicating that symmetric removal of anion and cation and h and oh from the brackish stream was occurring given that the flow anode and anodic current collector was positively charged during electrosorption while the flow cathode and cathodic current collector was negatively charged the h and oh generated should be released for the most part into the solution phase as such the parameters δ h asrr and δ oh asrr are introduced here to indicate the concomitant production of h and oh during the deionization step consideration has been given to the consumable h and oh incorporated into other entities such as carbonate for details see si section s3 and fig s6 it can be observed from si fig s7 that following 1800 s of reaction in the control experiments δ h asrr and δ oh asrr values of 0 003 0 017 and 0 40 3 08 mm μg cm 2 s 1 1 respectively are obtained at low voltages while the values of these parameters increase to 2 26 and 18 44 mm μg cm 2 s 1 1 on increasing the charging voltage to 2 0 v in contrast the use of porous carbon in the flow electrode largely inhibits the faradaic reactions in the flow electrode with δ h asrr and δ oh asrr values at 2 0 v of 0 013 0 026 and 0 25 0 48 mm μg cm 2 s 1 1 respectively si fig s7 a plausible explanation for these findings relates to competition for charges between the electrodialytic i e ions end up in the electrolyte and capacitive i e ions end up in the edls and pores processes that are occurring during deionization fig 4 with regard to the electrodialytic contribution counterions migrate across the membranes in the presence of an electrical field redox reactions occur at high voltages resulting in the neutralization of the charge with h oh nativ et al 2017 strathmann 2010 these processes would be expected to lead to an increase in the concentrations of h oh in the electrolyte of the flow electrodes fig 3 and si fig s7 although it has been reported that an aqueous electrolyte with a high salt concentration can result in a decrease in the ionic resistance yang et al 2016 critical concerns remain regarding the accumulation of ions at the electrolyte membrane interface i e increase in cna x t and ccl x t due to the elevated concentrations in the electrolyte which would increase the polarization resistance with the ongoing deionization likely causing back diffusion of counterions galama et al 2013 also reported that the accumulation of counterions may be expected to lead to the adsorption of co ions from the solution phase with the subsequent leakage of co ions driven by concentration difference across the membrane resulting in a decrease in the efficiency of ion migration tedesco et al 2016 meanwhile faradaic reactions such as oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution also lead to charge injection and or exchange at the electrode electrolyte interface with these processes competing with electron ion transport thereby resulting in deterioration in energy efficiency fig 4 in comparison the high conductivity of the carbon clusters is conducive to a decrease in internal resistance of the flow electrode with the capacitive mechanism of deionization sustaining the coupling of charge and ion transfer due to the formation of edls porada et al 2013b suss et al 2015 in support of these hypotheses high current density i e high voltage across the spacer channel high λ dyn but low energy consumption was observed at 2 0 v at high carbon contents fig 2 3 3 comparison of the electrodialytic and capacitive processes in fcdi estimates of the portions of na p na and cl p cl adsorbed in the edls of the carbon particles in the flow electrode chambers after migration through the membranes are provided in fig 5 our preliminary results indicated that the removal of sodium and chloride ions due to physical adsorption was negligible si figs s8 s10 it can be observed that the flow electrode used in this study has high affinity for cl during electrosorption with p cl generally over 90 for carbon contents of 2 and 10 wt with this result consistent with the finding that the anodic reactions associated with h production were significantly inhibited in the fcdi system compared to the control system i e in the absence of carbon particles fig 3 and si fig s7 of particular importance is the result that typical products of cl oxidation including ocl and clo3 were not detectable in this study with this finding indicating that i chloride oxidation at the anode is not occurring even at relatively high voltages e g 2 0 v and or ii the small amounts of oxidized chloride species that are produced are readily adsorbed by the carbon electrode in comparison the darco activated charcoal used in the flow electrode chambers has a low affinity for na with p na values between 20 and 50 fig 5 a plausible explanation for the low efficiency of na adsorption to the edls might be related to the abundance of electron acceptors e g oxygen in the cathode chamber that undergo redox reactions near the electrodes figs 3 and 4 likely resulting in i electron exchange at the electrode electrolyte interface and ii loss of adsorption capacity by the cathodic edls the portion of na retained by the carbon particles is significantly higher at 2 0 v e g one tailed p 0 05 which might account for the high λ dyn observed in the fcdi even when the charging voltage exceeds the typical threshold fig 2 as the coupling of ion and charge in the edls is capable of retarding electron loss due to cathodic reactions such as hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction fig 4 dykstra et al 2017 he et al 2016 tang et al 2017 in a typical cdi system the oxidation of the carbon anode could result in a change in the point of zero charge of the carbon surface and a relocation in the potential of zero charge of the carbon electrode avraham et al 2011 gao et al 2015 these changes in the physicochemical properties of the anode are likely to result in ongoing reduction in salt separation capacity during cdi operation porada et al 2013b fig 6 a shows that the surface zeta potential of the anode becomes more positive following successive operation cycles this is however not surprising in view of the asymmetric capacitive behavior of the system during electrosorption fig 5 i e the decoupling of na and electrons from the edls at the cathode might be envisaged to lead to a surplus of positive charge at the anode with the unbalanced charge pairs likely causing a positive shift in the short circuit potential e o the change of the surface site groups resulting in a shift in pk h to a higher value fig 6b and si section s4 and fig s11 also supports our hypothesis it has been reported that for adsorption of similar amounts of counter ions at both the anode and cathode e o should be closer to the potential of the electrode of higher adsorption rate because of the potential shift needed for thermodynamic and or kinetic equilibrium between the electrode pairs to be achieved gao et al 2014 similar consideration should be given to the non ideal scenario in which the occurrence of an e o value closer to the potential of the more efficient electrode is attributed to relocation of the redundant charge on the electrode during short circuit it should be noted that the competitive electrodialytic and capacitive processes and the resultant impacts on f cdi performance are also dependent on the properties of the carbon materials e g surface functional groups for example nativ et al 2017 used a flow electrode comprised of 5 wt of norit sx ultra activated charcoal in di water with their results showing that this kind of carbon material had a relatively higher affinity for na compared to cl following correction for the electrodialytic bias the average ion adsorption rates aiar and dynamic ion adsorption capacities iacdyn under different conditions are provided in si figs s12 and s13 with a charging voltage of 2 0 v aiar values for na and cl in the fcdi system described here are 0 133 and 0 359 μg cm 2 s 1 respectively at a carbon content of 10 wt si fig s13 indicates that iacdyn of the darco charcoal are more likely dependent on the charging voltages rather than the carbon concentrations with iacdyn of na and cl reaching 2 07 2 42 and 5 58 6 77 mg g 1 respectively following 1800 s of electrosorption at 2 0 v fcdi can be used not only as a highly efficient alternative to deionization but also an innovative method to study the fundamental mechanisms that are occurring beneath the superficial observations in cdi results of this study clearly show that brackish water desalination in f cdi should be a combined process of electrodialysis and capacitive deionization ion transport through the membranes is followed by i charge neutralization in the electrolyte and or ii ion immobilization with the counter charge in the edls to date ion adsorption k 1 in fig 4 has been recognized as a rate limiting step in f cdi with more and more studies focusing on the development of novel materials with high capacities nam and choi 2017 xu et al 2016 in comparison little consideration has been given to the concomitant electrodialysis process which could lead to the accumulation of ions in the aqueous solution and increase in back diffusion and co ion leakage as such models involving the electrodialytic contributions should be introduced to optimise the desalination process and in particular to prevent ion transport across the membranes k 2 in fig 4 becoming rate limiting prior to the electrodes reaching adsorption saturation it has been emphasized that cdi should be operated under a certain potential threshold to avoid unfavorable side reactions however our findings suggest that high λ dyn could be achieved at high voltages on condition that the coupling of charge and counter ion is sustained in the edls despite concerns remaining with regard to long term operation while the immobilization of counter ions in the edls was not enhanced with the increase of carbon content from 2 to 10 wt fcdi with high carbon loading mass demonstrated higher charge efficiency this fact might be related to good interparticle connectivity of the flow electrode at high carbon concentrations i e low electronic resistance with this interconnectivity facilitating electron percolation within the carbon materials liang et al 2017 yang et al 2016 nevertheless it is still not clear which parameters and or operating conditions are most important in the coupling and decoupling of charge and counter ion in the edls and considerably more insight into factors controlling desalination rate and charge or current efficiency is required before high voltage or high current mode could be recommended as a viable choice for f cdi this study is also of particular significance to the understanding of the asymmetric adsorption behaviors in f cdi with this understanding critical to the development and comparison of novel materials while there is great progress in the preparation of electrodes of high capacitance and ion selectivity with the use of pseudocapacitive materials capable of intercalating ions into the inorganic organic matrices via fast and reversible redox reactions at the electrode surface boota et al 2015 nam and choi 2017 more attention should be paid to the less efficient counter electrodes as they will be rate limiting in relation to ion adsorption with these inefficiencies leading to a change of electrode properties which can affect energy recovery during electrode regeneration si fig s14 4 conclusions results of this study indicate that operating conditions e g carbon content and charging voltage have significant impacts on the contributions of electrodialytic and capacitive processes to deionization in fcdi while a portion of the ions transported to the electrode chambers in fcdi will remain in solution and contribute to the electrolyte present in the electrode chambers and contribute to ph excursion in the flow electrode the use of high carbon content ensures that a high proportion of the charge and counter ions are retained in the electrical double layers of the flowing carbon particles even at high charging voltages e g 2 0 v during the deionization process estimation of the distribution of na and cl in the flow electrode after migration through the membranes suggests that the ongoing capacitive adsorption exhibits asymmetric behavior with the anodic particles demonstrating a better affinity for cl than the cathodic particles for na during electrosorption these results provide an explanation for the change in electrode properties that are observed under imperfect adsorption scenarios and provide insight into aspects of the design and operation of flow electrode pairs that are

19367,phosphate recovery from sewage sludge is essential in a circular economy currently the main focus in centralized municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps lies on struvite recovery routes land application of sludge or on technologies that rely on sludge incineration these routes have several disadvantages our study shows that the mineral vivianite fe2 po4 3 8h2o is present in digested sludge and can be the major form of phosphate in the sludge thus we suggest vivianite can be the nucleus for alternative phosphate recovery options excess and digested sewage sludge was sampled from full scale mwtps and analysed using x ray diffraction xrd conventional scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx environmental sem edx esem edx and mössbauer spectroscopy vivianite was observed in all plants where iron was used for phosphate removal in excess sludge before the anaerobic digestion ferrous iron dominated the iron pool 50 as shown by mössbauer spectroscopy xrd and mössbauer spectroscopy showed no clear correlation between vivianite bound phosphate versus the iron content in excess sludge in digested sludge ferrous iron was the dominant iron form 85 phosphate bound in vivianite increased with the iron content of the digested sludge but levelled off at high iron levels 70 90 of all phosphate was bound in vivianite in the sludge with the highest iron content molar fe p 2 5 the quantification of vivianite was difficult and bears some uncertainty probably because of the presence of impure vivianite as indicated by sem edx esem edx indicates that the vivianite occurs as relatively small 20 100 μm but free particles we envisage very efficient phosphate recovery technologies that separate these particles based on their magnetic properties from the complex sludge matrix keywords vivianite sewage sludge phosphate recovery mössbauer spectroscopy xrd 1 introduction phosphate has to be used more sustainably in future including its recycling from secondary resources carpenter and bennett 2011 childers et al 2011 sewage sludge is such a phosphate rich secondary source van dijk et al 2016 however current phosphate recovery technologies have limitations in recovery efficiencies and applicability agricultural use of sewage sludge is a simple way to reuse the nutrients in the sludge but this route has logistic constraints macdonald et al 2011 and pollutants in the sludge are a concern clarke and smith 2011 recovery of phosphate from sewage sludge ashes has the potential for high recovery efficiencies but requires the realization of dedicated sewage sludge incinerators that are expensive to build phosphate recovery via struvite is frequently suggested as a promising route but the recovery efficiency is relatively low only between 10 and 50 of all influent phosphate can be recovered egle et al 2015 ewert et al 2014 additionally struvite recovery is only possible in municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps with enhanced biological p removal ebpr wilfert et al 2015 more often just iron salts are used for chemical phosphate removal cpr or ebpr supported by cpr is used for phosphate removal to meet stringent effluent phosphate regulations wilfert et al 2015 iron or aluminium are present in sewage sludge as they are used for cpr but also for other reasons such as iron rich groundwater infiltration into the sewer system iron dosing to mitigate sulfide emissions the natural presence of iron in human excreta and because both elements are used as coagulants these metals can lower the recovery efficiency for struvite further korving et al 2018 thus there is still a need for economic phosphate recovery technologies from sewage sludge without sludge incineration and for sludge from cpr plants that use iron the ferrous iron phosphate mineral vivianite fe2 po4 3 8h2o is formed in anaerobic systems with relatively low sulphide concentrations if iron and phosphate are present rothe et al 2016 such conditions occur in mwtps especially during anaerobic sludge digestion accordingly several authors found indications for vivianite in mwtps frossard et al 1997 roussel and carliell marquet 2016 singer 1972 wilfert et al 2016 or in systems were wastewater was kept under anaerobic conditions azam and finneran 2014 cheng et al 2015 zhang 2012 or in experiments where ferrous iron fe ii was added to oxygen free wastewater ghassemi and recht 1971 however only in two of these studies the vivianite was quantified frossard et al 1997 wilfert et al 2016 in a recent publication wilfert et al 2016 we hypothesised that the amount of phosphate that is bound in vivianite is positively correlated with the molar fe p ratio in digested sludge under conditions that occur in anaerobic digesters vivianite is likely thermodynamically the most stable phosphate phase in the sludge nriagu and dell 1974 furthermore the formation of vivianite can be quick substantial amounts of it were formed due to iron reduction in experiments with septic wastewater within 48 h azam and finneran 2014 vivianite can also directly precipitate from solution at circumneutral ph ghassemi and recht 1971 roldan et al 2002 if these assumptions are correct this implies that under reducing conditions most phosphate is bound in a single relatively homogenous mineral phase i e vivianite its formation would then mainly be limited by the phosphate that is bound in organic structures and by the presence of sulphide that has a higher binding strength to ferrous iron than phosphate nriagu 1972 if one were able to separate the vivianite from the sewage sludge it should be possible to achieve higher phosphate recovery efficiencies compared to struvite routes struvite based recovery technologies show a relative low recovery efficiency because part of the phosphate is bound to other less soluble phases than struvite such as iron or aluminium phosphates baker et al 2006 doyle and parsons 2002 mamais et al 1994 neethling and benisch 2004 there are reports that significant quantities of vivianite can already be formed before the anaerobic digestion stage in excess sludge frossard et al 1997 wang et al 2018 wilfert et al 2016 also there are regular reports of vivianite precipitation in pipe lines at wastewater treatment sites marx et al 2001 nevertheless publications on vivianite in sewage sludge do not report size purity composition and of phosphate that is bound in vivianite before and after digestion nor do they report the mechanism of vivianite formation often samples are prepared in such a way that vivianite gets oxidized the best practice is to dry the samples at anaerobic conditions to prevent oxidation processes that can modify the mineral composition of the sample kraal et al 2009 it is possible to find vivianite when samples are dried at room temperature even in the presence of oxygen above 70 c in the presence of oxygen vivianite is transformed within hours into amorphous iron phosphate compounds čermáková et al 2015 poffet 2007 in this study we sampled and analysed sludge from several full scale mwtps in europe with different molar fe p ratios and plants that dose next to fe ii also fe iii salts with the purpose to reject or accept the hypotheses that i the extent of phosphate that is bound in vivianite is a function of a molar fe p ratio in digested sludge and that ii significant amounts of vivianite are already formed in the excess sludge prior to the anaerobic digestion process even when significant quantities of fe iii are dosed this information could not be obtained from earlier studies frossard et al 1997 wilfert et al 2016 in these studies either plants with little fe iii or solely fe ii dosing were studied furthermore it was not possible to determine how much phosphate could potentially be bound in vivianite in sludges as the formation of vivianite was probably limited by the presence of iron in these studies molar fe p in the samples well below 1 5 in addition to earlier research environmental scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy esem edx was used next to sem edx in the current study this method allowed us to determine whether vivianite particles occur as free particles or if they are coated e g by organic matter this knowledge is very valuable when it comes to vivianite separation from sewage sludge it should be possible to separate free paramagnetic vivianite particles from sewage sludge using conventional mining equipment like magnetic separators wills and finch 2015 the goal of this work was to determine how much phosphate can at maximum be bound in vivianite and if the vivianite is present in the sludge in forms that could offer efficient phosphate recovery via this mineral we chose a combination of mössbauer spectroscopy xrd sem edx and esem edx for analysing sludge before and after the anaerobic digestion process to determine the vivianite content and to characterize vivianite in the samples 2 material and methods sampling sample handling and sample analyses mössbauer spectroscopy xrd ts vs dissolved elemental composition and dissolved fe ii fe iii were done as previously described wilfert et al 2016 in short all samples were taken after a period of 48 h without rain or snowfall excess sludge samples were taken from settled sludge before dewatering and before it was pumped into the anaerobic digester digested samples were sampled directly after the digestion process before sludge dewatering the samples were stored in glass bottles and transported in cooling boxes on ice to minimize microbial activity until analyses started in the laboratory about 3 6 h after sampling sample drying started at most 8 h after sampling and was completed within 24 h sampling and sample processing were done under anaerobic conditions total elemental compositions of the samples were determined after a microwave assisted acid digestion hno3 69 15 min 180 c followed by icp oes perkin elmer optima 5300 dv additionally the elemental composition of the sludge solids was determined using xrf for xrf analyses the samples were pressed into powder tablets using an organic binder the measurements were performed with a panalytical axios max wd xrf spectrometer and data evaluation was done with superq5 0i omnian software total solids ts and volatile solids vs were measured according to standard methods apha awwa wef 1998 inside an anaerobic glovebox 95 n2 and 5 h2 o2 20 ppm the sludge samples were transferred into plastic centrifuge tubes and centrifuged outside the glovebox 15 min 3200 g dissolved elemental compositions icp oes dissolved anions ic metrohm ic compact 761 and dissolved fe ii fe iii viollier et al 2000 were determined after filtration of the supernatant 0 45 μm inside the glovebox solid material was derived from centrifuge pellets of the samples inside the glovebox pellets were finely spread on glass plates dried 25 c 24 h in the dark and afterwards grinded samples for xrd analyses were filled in glass capillaries and sealed first with modelling clay and then superglue right before analyses glass capillaries were sealed using a burner the measurements were done on a panalytical x pert pro diffractometer with cu ka radiation 5 80 2θ step size 0 008 the results from xrd analyses were made semi quantitative by determining the amorphous and crystalline area of the spectra origin pro 9 this allows the determination of the degree of crystallinity and thus of the total mineral share of the sample spectra for digested sludge samples using xrd were further fitted by rietveld refinement using the software gsas larson and dreele 1994 toby 2001 the samples before the anaerobic digestion showed a large amorphous fraction and rietveld refinement did not give reliable results these results were still made semi quantitative by using the output of the program package highscore version 4 6 1 2017 to compare these measurements with the results obtained from mössbauer spectroscopy vivianite was prepared roldan et al 2002 and added to digested sewage sludge in dokhaven in different quantities to test the reliability of the method the vivianite added x axis was plotted against the amount of vivianite that was determined by using xrd the intercept of the trend line hits the y axis at 182 g vivianite kg sludge this value equals the initial vivianite content in the sample uncertainty measures on the slope and intercept with least squares fit were obtained using the linest function of excel according to this analysis the standard deviation of the intercept was 11 7 all information regarding these analyses is added in the supplementary information table s1 table s2 all spectra and peak assignments are included as well for mössbauer analyses samples were filled in plastic rings sealed with kapton tape and super glue and then wrapped in parafilm transmission 57fe mössbauer spectra were collected at 4 2 and 300 k and for some samples at 100 k with conventional constant acceleration and sinusoidal velocity spectrometers using a 57co rh source velocity calibration was carried out using an α fe foil the mössbauer spectra were fitted using mosswinn 4 0 klencsár 1997 all mössbauer spectra and related hyperfine parameters are in the si figs s1 s5 and table s6 morphology and elemental compositions of sludge particles in the grinded solids was also analysed by esem edx philips xl30 esem equipped with an edam 3 eds system and sem edx jeol jsm 840a equipped with an oxford isis 300 micro analytical edx system samples for esem edx and sem edx were exposed to air during measurements samples for esem edx were vacuum dried on the sample holder inside the instrument vaccum chamber for sem edx dried and grinded sample was used for these analyses first an edx scan with low magnification was performed to identify particles with high fe p molar ratio some of these particles were randomly chosen to determine their elemental composition all sampled mwtps also had an anaerobic digestion stage the plants were mainly chosen according to the molar fe p in the digested sludge relevant plant parameters and treatment designs are summarized in table 1 tables s3 and s4 show the composition of the sludge samples note that sometimes the iron content and thus the molar fe p ratio in the solids table 1 in the digested sludge samples was significantly different to the samples before the anaerobic digestion this could be related to external sludge input in the digester e g leeuwarden wilfert et al 2016 to additional iron dosing before the digester dokhaven to the fact that iron rich secondary sludge was sampled and that this sludge was combined with primary settled sludge in the digester cologne berlin and espoo or to a combination of these factors dokhaven 3 results 3 1 xrd and mössbauer 3 1 1 fe ii content of the samples mössbauer spectra obtained at 4 2 k for several sludge samples showed fe ii as the dominant form of iron 90 in digested sewage sludge table 2 this was expected since during anaerobic digestion strongly reducing methanogenic conditions prevail here chemical and or biological iron reduction turns fe iii into fe ii the sample from leeuwarden showed some signs of oxidation because it was not protected well enough against oxidation as explained earlier wilfert et al 2016 surprisingly before digestion in the excess sludge samples fe ii was also the dominant iron phase in sludges with lower iron content fe p 1 0 fe ii made up 94 96 of all iron even when fe iii was used for phosphate elimination in plants with higher iron dosing berlin and cologne 50 60 of all iron was present in its reduced form the fe iii in these samples was present as iron oxides 3 1 2 quantification of vivianite in the samples the vivianite content in the samples in excess and digested sludge was determined by using mössbauer spectroscopy at different temperatures and by semi quantitative xrd this data was plotted against the molar fe p ratio as obtained from xrf fig 1 and fig 2 additionally data from an earlier study frossard et al 1997 was included the mössbauer measurements obtained at 300 k clearly showed that vivianite is present with parameters that are in agreement with earlier measurements on vivianite standards gonser and grant 1976 wilfert et al 2016 however at 4 2 k the spectra become less clear and very complex but still vivianite was detected in these measurements the complexity of the mössbauer spectra measured at 4 2 k is directly related to the presence of highly dispersed or impure vivianite like species characterized by broad mössbauer signals the inhomogeneity of the crystalline environment in the vivianite like structures reduces the néel temperature magnetic ordering temperature 9 k in pure vivianite resulting in significant signal broadening at the onset of long range magnetic order close to the 4 2 k measurement temperature thus because interpretation and fitting of 4 2 k data was difficult it was decided to re measure some samples at 100 k to be able to quantify vivianite more easily the latter measurements again indicate that vivianite is present in the samples due to difficulties in the spectra fitting and interpretation measurements at 4 2 k are used for discussions related to the oxidation state of iron in the samples for sake of completeness the quantification of vivianite in the sewage sludge using the data obtained at 4 2 k was plotted as well in figs 1 and 2 in most samples measured at 4 2 k a paramagnetic doublet fe ii species that might be assigned to vivianite was found in significant amounts as described before wilfert et al 2016 this phase is listed as vivianite impure in table s6 the isomer shift of this fe ii and the quadrupole splitting are close to the one of vivianite it could be that some dispersed vivianite structures or vivianite structures with impurities are still paramagnetic at 4 2 k which is close to the magnetic ordering temperature of vivianite 12 k for further discussions it was assumed that the fe ii species that could not clearly be assigned to vivianite with mössbauer spectroscopy at 4 2 k was in fact vivianite with impurities wilfert et al 2016 we prepared vivianite standards with different degrees of impurities of magnesium and calcium the presence of vivianite was confirmed with xrd unfortunately the samples partly became oxidized before mössbauer spectra were obtained thus a clear pattern of impurities vs site ratios was not visible because of the two antagonistic effects on the site ratio i e oxidation vs impurities what we could see however was that the impurities affected the oxidation of vivianite vivianite with impurities was almost completely oxidized within 48 h about 89 of all fe ii as shown by mössbauer spectroscopy data not shown this was much quicker and reached a much larger percentage compared to pure vivianite in earlier studies vivianite was prepared similarly to ours where oxidation took several weeks and only part of the vivianite got oxidized and turned into fe iii oxides miot et al 2009 roldan et al 2002 it was observed that at room temperature after about a year the fe iii concentration in synthetic vivianite remained constant at 50 when it was exposed to air rouzies and millet 1993 sludges from before the anaerobic digestion with a molar fe p ratios below 1 showed a clear increase of phosphate bound in vivianite with an increase of the iron content in the sludge fig 1 from these sludges the highest fe p ratio of about 0 95 was found in the a stage of nieuwveer here between 41 and 56 of all phosphate was bound in vivianite according to xrd and mössbauer measurements all results for these low iron sludges are in relative good agreement also the ones determined by frossard et al 1997 are in line with our measurements at higher molar fe p ratios however the vivianite quantification differed clearly between the methods and a relation between the fe p molar ratio and the vivianite content in the sludge was not obvious in excess sludge from berlin with a molar fe p ratio of about 1 7 mössbauer measurements at 300 and 100 k and the quantification using xrd agree well between 36 and 43 of all phosphate is bound in vivianite however the measurements at 4 2 k indicate that much more about 67 of all phosphate is bound in vivianite in the sludge from cologne only mössbauer quantifications from measurements at 100 and 300 k match well giving vivianite contents between 19 and 26 the data at 4 2 k again suggests a much higher vivianite content of 68 in contrast quantification using xrd gives a much lower share of phosphate bound in vivianite 7 the spectra obtained at 4 2 k were difficult to interpret as discussed below section 4 3 in the mössbauer spectra obtained at 4 2 k from sludge that was sampled before the anaerobic digestion in cologne and berlin it was assumed that the phase which could not be clearly assigned to vivianite was indeed vivianite this assumption leads to a higher vivianite content compared to the other measurement methods fig 1 by assuming that this phase that we consider as impure vivianite is in fact not vivianite would mean that in cologne about 27 and in berlin about 37 of all phosphate would be bound in vivianite only in the excess sludge from espoo molar fe p 2 5 vivianite was quantified using xrd measurements only according to these measurements about 50 of all phosphate was bound in vivianite after the anaerobic digestion all measurements show an increase of the phosphate fraction bound in vivianite in the sludge with a simultaneous increase of the iron content fig 2 the measurements from frossard and co workers frossard et al 1997 are again in line with our data all methods showed that phosphate bound in vivianite started to level off in the sludge with the highest iron content that was sampled in espoo molar fe p 2 5 the absolute values of the vivianite in the espoo sludge differed but both mössbauer measurements at 100 k and xrd suggest that almost all phosphate was bound in vivianite between 67 4 2 k 82 300 k 93 100 k and 101 7 8 xrd of all phosphate is contained in vivianite according to these measurements the data obtained at 4 2 k suggests a lower vivianite content compared to the measurements at 300 and 100 k which is in contrast to the measurements before the digestion the data obtained with mössbauer spectroscopy at 300 k gives except for the sample from espoo the lowest vivianite content in the digested sludge samples xrd data tends to give higher vivianite amounts than the mössbauer spectra 3 2 sem edx esem edx particles with a size distribution between 20 and 100 μm and elemental composition close to the one of vivianite were found by analysing the digested sludge samples using sem edx table 3 the composition of some particles with crystalline appearance and high iron and phosphate content is summarized in table 3 all particles consisted mainly of iron and phosphate but also always some impurities were present the iron and phosphate content of the particles increases with the iron content of the sewage sludge except of the espoo samples all samples showed molar fe p ratios below the one of vivianite 1 5 in the finish mwtp large quantities of iron are added to remove phosphate besides iron and phosphate also calcium magnesium and some aluminium were always present in all samples subsequently digested sewage sludge samples from berlin and dokhaven were also analysed using environmental e sem edx for this purpose the samples were rapidly vacuum dried inside the instrument a high abundance of particles with high iron and phosphate content and with diameters similar to the ones detected by sem edx were found in these samples fig 3 table s3 the particles were free i e not covered by organic coating these particles were better visible and more abundant in samples that were analysed using esem edx probably the slow drying of the samples for sem edx at room temperature can result in organic coating of the vivianite compared to the quick vacuum drying which results in more fibrous sample morphology we concluded that the vivianite particles are present as free particles in the sludge as opposed to earlier observations frossard et al 1997 wilfert et al 2016 4 discussion 4 1 introductory explanation for the discussion section in the first two sections of the discussion the results obtained from electron microscopy xrd and mössbauer spectroscopy are explained the focus lies on the vivianite content and the oxidation state of the iron in the sludge samples results from the different analytical methods are compared in the third part controversial measurement results are emphasized and critically reviewed this is accompanied by an in depth discussion of the applied methodology and other tools that could potentially be used for quantifying vivianite in sludge samples based on the knowledge that was created in this study it is further explained which directions vivianite based phosphate recovery routes could go the advantages of such technologies is outlined research gaps are highlighted in the last section 4 2 vivianite quantification before the anaerobic digestion mössbauer spectra obtained at liquid helium temperature revealed that fe ii dominates the iron pool in excess 50 and digested sewage sludge 90 although in the plants fe iii was dosed and despite the fact that the excess sludge passed also aerated sections of the mwtps in all mwtps where fe iii was dosed vivianite was present as indicated by xrd and mössbauer spectroscopy at molar fe p ratios below 1 in the excess sludge always more than 90 of all iron was present as fe ii because fe iii was dosed the dominance of fe ii in the excess sludge before anaerobic digestion indicates that chemical or biological fe iii reduction must occur in the mwtps iron could be reduced by sulphide compounds biber et al 1994 nielsen et al 2005 organics cornell et al 1989 indirectly via fermenting bacteria kappler et al 2004 or directly via iron reducing bacteria nielsen 1996 another important source for iron in the sludge is the incoming raw sewage table 1 probably this iron pool was in our mwtps dominated by fe ii because sulphidic conditions prevailed in most influents table 1 from all excess sludges the highest fe iii content was found in cologne here about 50 of all iron was present as fe iii in iron oxides probably a mixture of ferrihydrite and goethite as indicated by mössbauer spectroscopy although the mössbauer measurements were sometimes controversial for vivianite the fe iii oxide species present in the mössbauer spectra give separate signals that can be fitted independently from the signals of the ill defined vivianite like species also the fitting procedure of the mössbauer spectra of the fe iii oxides is well established allowing their identification and characterization with high accuracy the presence of ferrihydrite would be surprising because it transforms quickly into lepidocrocite and or goethite in the presence of fe ii in the mwtp cologne relatively large amounts of fe iii are added to remove phosphate obviously iron reduction is not quick enough to turn over all of this fe iii in cologne also the lowest sulphide influent load was measured whether this has an effect on the iron speciation cannot be concluded from the present data in the mwtp dokhaven quick fe iii reduction took place here fe iii is dosed in the aerated a stage where the srt is only 8 h this short retention time does not give much time for microbial fe iii reduction nielsen et al 1997 the influent sulphide load would be enough to reduce all dosed fe iii and explain the dominance of fe ii in the aerated a stage additionally the large contribution of influent iron 3 times the dosed iron probably as fe ii to the total iron pool is a reason for the dominance of fe ii in this sludge in dokhaven the orp of the incoming raw sewage was 290 mv also in berlin the influent sulphide load was relatively high which is related to high sulphate levels in the drinking water and long wastewater retention times in the sewer systems heinzmann personal communication about 60 of all iron was fe ii in berlin before the digestion and about 37 of the iron in the excess sludge was present as iron oxide most likely as goethite mössbauer quadrupole splitting of goethite was 0 25 mm s which can efficiently bind phosphate by adsorption and is probably relative insensitive to chemical and biological reduction on a time scale of mwtp operations canfield 1989 lovley 2013 earlier studies on activated sludge in münchehofe mwtp showed that most phosphate was extracted in the reductive soluble phosphate pool and only 10 of the phosphate was in the naoh fraction where vivianite would be expected röske and schönborn 1994 uhlmann et al 1990 this difference could be explained by the fact that in the earlier study activated sludge from the aeration tank was sampled in our study excess sludge was analysed excess sludge and thus settled sludge is exposed to oxygen free conditions during settling retention time in sludge blanket of several hours which could allow fe iii reduction after sampling our samples were kept on ice yet we cannot exclude that fe iii reduction in the samples was ongoing until sample drying started for berlin about 6 h after sampling nielsen 1996 rasmussen and nielsen 1996 this could result in changes of the iron pool in addition the presence of fe ii can induce recrystallization of ferric iron oxides especially for less stable forms such as ferrihydrite even in non biological systems latta et al 2012 on the other hand vivianite extraction characteristics are not fully understood as it occurs in different crystallinity particle sizes impurities and thus most sequential extraction schemes can if at all give rough estimates for the vivianite content in samples only rothe et al 2016 furthermore we believe that impurities can also affect the extraction schemes a large difference between the vivianite content as determined by xrd and by mössbauer spectroscopy was measured in cologne and berlin for the excess sludge this is probably because only mössbauer spectroscopy is able to detect not very well defined less crystalline perhaps freshly formed vivianite in these two samples and because the unknown fe ii species was assigned to impure vivianite we can however not definitely conclude that this impure vivianite is really vivianite results from measurements in leeuwarden and nieuwveer were adopted from an earlier study and were discussed in detail before wilfert et al 2016 overall no clear pattern of fe p vs phosphate bound in vivianite before digestion was visible this is likely related to the large variation in conditions in individual activated sludge processes e g dissolved oxygen set points fe ii fe iii dosing different redox zones and retention times in settler sludge blanket etc and varying significance of iron and sulphide loads from the inflowing sewage 4 3 vivianite quantification after the digestion after the anaerobic digestion vivianite was the dominating iron phase as thermodynamics predict always some iron bound in fesx was present nriagu 1972 fig 2 shows that the vivianite content in the digested sludge increases with the iron content in the samples in the pure ebpr plant asten with a low molar fe p 0 14 xrd could not detect any vivianite this suggests that at low iron levels vivianite is present in low quantities or not present at all because of a shortage of iron the iron that is present in this sludge is partly not available for vivianite formation as it reacts with sulphide to form fesx at intermediate iron content in the sludge fe p 0 5 1 1 again part of the iron is bound in fesx the residual iron which is not bound in fesx is available for vivianite formation to bind some but not all of the phosphate that would theoretically be available for vivianite formation in sludge with even higher iron content and molar fe p ratios of around 1 5 cologne and berlin it seems that vivianite formation is already starting to level off due to limited phosphate availability a fraction remains bound in the bacterial mass in cologne mössbauer indicates that between 61 and 88 and semi quantitative xrd shows that 90 of all phosphate is bound in vivianite in espoo finland it seems that almost all phosphate is bound in vivianite xrd measurements agree with the 100 k mössbauer measurements which indicate that between 93 and 100 6 4 of all phosphate is bound in vivianite it is unlikely that all phosphate is bound in vivianite as organic bound phosphate is present which should only be recoverable if organics are broken down e g during incineration or at alkaline ph the stronger binding of iron with sulphide suggests that excess iron is required for complete vivianite formation of the available phosphate molar iron to phosphate ratios slightly lower or equal to the stoichiometry of vivianite are sufficient to complete vivianite formation in the digested sewage sludge the amount of iron that gets bound to sulphides seems to more or less correspond with the amount of phosphate that is not available for vivianite formation in waste sludge digestion assuming only organic bound phosphate is limiting vivianite formation how much phosphate could then be bound in organics and thus limit the formation of vivianite it was suggested that activated sludge from berlin münchehofe contained 25 of all phosphate in the form of organics uhlmann et al 1990 in another study between 7 and 16 of all phosphate was assigned to organic phosphates before anaerobic digestion in mwtps using iron or aluminium respectively for phosphate removal alvarenga et al 2017 in digested sludge with a molar fe p of about 1 2 carliell marquet et al 2009 reported that only about 12 of all phosphate was present as organic phosphate similarly other results show that up to 86 of all phosphate in digested sludge was inorganic phosphate frossard et al 1994 thus based on these reports of organic phosphates in digested sludge it seems feasible that roughly 90 of all phosphate could be available for vivianite formation 4 4 vivianite characterization method some controversial observations were made during the quantification of vivianite bound phosphate in the sludge as discussed above after the anaerobic digestion xrd suggests that all phosphate is bound in vivianite 100 6 4 this seems unlikely because we expect that part of the phosphate is also bound in organic matter or in other inorganic phases additionally deviations in the vivianite content of the sludges as determined by using mössbauer spectroscopy and xrd were observed and the mössbauer measurements at different temperatures also gave different vivianite contents for some sludges figs 1 and 2 why is the quantification of vivianite so difficult our edx analyses table 3 and earlier analyses roussel and carliell marquet 2016 indicate that the vivianite particles in the sludge contain impurities in general vivianite is known to contain impurities rothe et al 2016 and earlier mössbauer and xrd studies using mineral vivianite specimens also always contained a certain degree of impurities and or the vivianite was partly oxidized during handling of the samples gonser and grant 1976 rodgers and henderson 1986 pure vivianite will hardly be encountered in environmental or engineered systems like mwtps the degree and type of impurities e g magnesium manganese copper arsenic probably varies from one place to another as the impurities partly mirror the composition of the host solution were it was formed rothe et al 2016 we should refer to vivianite like structures rather than to vivianite when talking about the compounds that we found in the sewage sludge it seems logical that impurities affect the thermodynamic properties stability and solubility in chemical extraction schemes of the vivianite furthermore the impurities can hinder the identification and quantification of vivianite in samples a standard addition of synthetic pure vivianite to digested sewage sludge from dokhaven showed that our method to semi quantitatively determine vivianite in the sludge using xrd is relative reliable table s1 this methodology cannot guarantee that the initial vivianite content in this sample was determined correctly due to systematic errors in the semi quantitative xrd procedure this further suggests that xrd is not able to distinguish between vivianite with and without impurities likely part of the iron in the sludge vivianite was replaced by other cations such as copper or magnesium which could explain why the vivianite content in digested sludge as quantified by xrd is often higher than the numbers from the more specific mössbauer spectroscopy also phosphate in the vivianite structure can be replaced by other elements such as arsenic muehe et al 2016 for xrd the quantification of vivianite is further hindered by the presence of unassigned peaks in some samples and by the fact that quartz and vivianite had some overlapping peaks in our measurements see peak assignments in the si also the rietveld refinement and the determination of the amorphous fraction of the samples introduce some uncertainty although the hyperfine parameters obtained by mössbauer spectroscopy clearly show that vivianite is present in the samples some observations remain unclear iron in vivianite is present in two distinct octahedral sites the ratio for these sites is usually 2 site b site a 2 mori and ito 1950 however in our case the ratio was often lower than 2 ranging from 1 2 to 2 frossard et al 1997 used mössbauer spectroscopy at 300 k to determine the vivianite in one activated and two digested sewage sludge samples only one of the three samples surprisingly the activated sludge sample which is more subjected to oxygen exposure had a site ratio close to 2 1 9 in the other two samples much higher ratios of 4 and 6 were found the authors concluded that this deviation is caused by oxidation although this ratio is far higher than expected for oxidized vivianite in our case oxidation is probably not the reason for the lower site ratio because literature shows that the oxidation takes at least initially preferably place at site a which would rather increase the site ratios rouzies and millet 1993 also most of our samples showed no signs of oxidation e g no presence of oxidized vivianite as determined by mössbauer spectroscopy i e only limited quantities of ferric iron were present and they were not identified as oxidized vivianite literature indicates that elemental substitutions of iron can affect mössbauer spectra amthauer and rossman 1984 dyar et al 2014 in baricite the magnesium analogue of vivianite substitution takes preferably place at site b which would indeed cause a decrease in the iron site ratios yakubovich et al 2001 similarly manning et al 1991 further hypothesised that substitutions at the site b by manganese or fe iii could change the site ratios additionally they claimed that part of the iron at the a site could actually not be part of the vivianite but part of clay minerals some iron containing chlorite and clay minerals have similar hyperfine parameters as vivianite manning suggested to recalculate the real vivianite content by assuming fea feb 2 and then derive the phosphate content from it this would mean that we would currently over quantify vivianite bound phosphate in our samples by using mössbauer spectroscopy on the other hand if impurities are present and we assume that substitution takes mainly place on site b then an adaption of the site ratio to 2 would be necessary to take into account the iron from site b that was replaced by cations such as calcium or magnesium this would mean that we are underestimating the phosphate bound in vivianite by our mössbauer measurements the latter case is rather unlikely in the digested sludge sample from espoo mössbauer suggested that about 90 of all phosphate is bound in vivianite also both phenomena could occur in our samples overall despite uncertainties mössbauer spectroscopy and xrd show a clear increase of the vivianite content in the samples with an increase of the molar fe p in the digested sewage sludge additionally our data clearly show that anaerobic digesters are places of very significant vivianite formation another option for quantifying vivianite in the sludge is thermodynamic modelling which is a strong tool for estimating which phosphate compounds could possibly form in mwtps however modelling has also drawbacks in complex systems like mwtps for determining the vivianite content of the sludge due to i molar fe s ratios of iron sulphides that will probably form prior to vivianite range from one mackinawite to two pyrite peiffer et al 2015 ii kinetics of mineral formation are difficult to model certainly in presence of organic complexes iii for some minerals possibly more stable than vivianite e g anapeit nriagu and dell 1974 and for amorphous compounds thermodynamic data is missing and therefore such compounds are not included in the corresponding databases v metals in sludge can be complexed by dissolved organic compounds which are ubiquitous in wastewaters this makes modelling more difficult and vi sometimes the modelling input is biased and minerals such as vivianite have even been neglected in studies flores alsina et al 2016 besides modelling chemical extractions have been used for vivianite determination however results were also inconsistent for environmental samples rothe et al 2016 it seems that all approaches including our combination of spectroscopic methods have problems to determine the vivianite content in the samples 4 5 from vivianite quantification to phosphate recovery analogously to struvite it has been reported that vivianite can cause problems in mwtps especially during thermophilic digestion marx et al 2001 reusser 2009 our study shows that when iron is used for phosphate removal the biogeochemical conditions in mwtps that are required for successful sewage treatment drive vivianite formation without additional measures the vivianite solubility will depend on the activity of the iron it is likely that vivianite is the phosphate compound with the lowest thermodynamic stability in digested sewage sludge nriagu and dell 1974 our data suggests that significant amounts of phosphate are bound in vivianite and thus that it is time to make use of the formation of vivianite in mwtps and develop strategies to recover phosphate in the form of vivianite from sewage sludge our measurements on vivianite in sludges backed by solubility products for minerals suggest that much higher phosphate recovery efficiencies can be achieved compared to struvite recovery routes the potential of struvite recovery is limited because part of the phosphate is bound to compounds with lower solubility than struvite solubility such as aluminum or iron phosphates baker et al 2006 doyle and parsons 2002 mamais et al 1994 this would not be the case for vivianite as it has a very low solubility probably also compared to amorphous aluminum phosphates the characteristics of vivianite observed in mwtp sludges in this study show limitations related to the recovery of the mineral separation via magnetism or density separation may provide ways to recover vivianite solubility is in our opinion a reason why phosphate bound vivianite cannot efficiently be recovered via dissolution of ferric or ferrous phosphate in the sludge phosphate from vivianite could e g be released via microbial fe iii oxidation miot et al 2009 or by making use of sulphide kato et al 2006 suschka et al 2001 but the released phosphate will form precipitates with other elements in the sludge liquor or bind to other inorganic phases in the sludge solids similar observations were made for sediment systems boström and pettersson 1982 richardson 1985 roden and edmonds 1997 thus a separation technology for vivianite instead of other recovery routes seems most logical such a technology could be based on seeding kempter et al 2014 density or magnetic separation of the free vivianite particles from sewage sludge using simple effective and low cost equipment from the mining industry wills and finch 2015 the esem edx measurements in this study showed that vivianite occurs as free particles in the sludge indeed magnetic separation of vivianite was successfully evaluated in trial experiments using a magnetic separator with jones plates that were designed for separating vivianite from sewage sludge from digested sewage sludge sampled in espoo 60 of all phosphate could be recovered in the magnetic fraction wilfert et al 2017 vivianite has been directly applied as a slow release fertilizer however the fertilizer value of iron phosphates has been discussed controversially kahiluoto et al 2015 roldan et al 2002 römer 2006 samie and römer 2001 thus we recommend that once a concentrated pure vivianite stream is obtained the vivianite can easily be dissolved at alkaline ph by using koh phosphate and potassium dissolve at the same time iron and heavy metals would precipitate additionally the solution would probably be hygienized in this step which makes its further application in agriculture more attractive the potassium phosphate solution can directly be used for fertilizer production the iron could be re used for phosphate removal in the sewage treatment plant these suggestions need to be verified experimentally the current form of vivianite detected is present in very small particles for more efficient recovery methods to form larger vivianite particles need to be developed 5 conclusion this study shows that vivianite is the most important iron and phosphate phase in digested sewage sludge with high iron content between 70 and 90 of all phosphate in sewage sludge can be bound in vivianite this vivianite will contain impurities and it is therefore better to call it vivianite like structures the esem edx analyses indicate that the vivianite is present as free particles which would theoretically allow their separation from the sludge to achieve higher recovery efficiency compared to struvite recovery routes hereto more knowledge on the vivianite formation in sewage sludge is necessary density impurities size distribution of vivianite particles that are liberated in order to obtain larger crystals in the sludge which will be easier to separate this requires more knowledge about the factors that drive the formation of vivianite with different shapes sizes and degrees of impurities dosing iron for phosphate and cod removal is in line with energy producing mwtps of the future wilfert et al 2015

19367,phosphate recovery from sewage sludge is essential in a circular economy currently the main focus in centralized municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps lies on struvite recovery routes land application of sludge or on technologies that rely on sludge incineration these routes have several disadvantages our study shows that the mineral vivianite fe2 po4 3 8h2o is present in digested sludge and can be the major form of phosphate in the sludge thus we suggest vivianite can be the nucleus for alternative phosphate recovery options excess and digested sewage sludge was sampled from full scale mwtps and analysed using x ray diffraction xrd conventional scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx environmental sem edx esem edx and mössbauer spectroscopy vivianite was observed in all plants where iron was used for phosphate removal in excess sludge before the anaerobic digestion ferrous iron dominated the iron pool 50 as shown by mössbauer spectroscopy xrd and mössbauer spectroscopy showed no clear correlation between vivianite bound phosphate versus the iron content in excess sludge in digested sludge ferrous iron was the dominant iron form 85 phosphate bound in vivianite increased with the iron content of the digested sludge but levelled off at high iron levels 70 90 of all phosphate was bound in vivianite in the sludge with the highest iron content molar fe p 2 5 the quantification of vivianite was difficult and bears some uncertainty probably because of the presence of impure vivianite as indicated by sem edx esem edx indicates that the vivianite occurs as relatively small 20 100 μm but free particles we envisage very efficient phosphate recovery technologies that separate these particles based on their magnetic properties from the complex sludge matrix keywords vivianite sewage sludge phosphate recovery mössbauer spectroscopy xrd 1 introduction phosphate has to be used more sustainably in future including its recycling from secondary resources carpenter and bennett 2011 childers et al 2011 sewage sludge is such a phosphate rich secondary source van dijk et al 2016 however current phosphate recovery technologies have limitations in recovery efficiencies and applicability agricultural use of sewage sludge is a simple way to reuse the nutrients in the sludge but this route has logistic constraints macdonald et al 2011 and pollutants in the sludge are a concern clarke and smith 2011 recovery of phosphate from sewage sludge ashes has the potential for high recovery efficiencies but requires the realization of dedicated sewage sludge incinerators that are expensive to build phosphate recovery via struvite is frequently suggested as a promising route but the recovery efficiency is relatively low only between 10 and 50 of all influent phosphate can be recovered egle et al 2015 ewert et al 2014 additionally struvite recovery is only possible in municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps with enhanced biological p removal ebpr wilfert et al 2015 more often just iron salts are used for chemical phosphate removal cpr or ebpr supported by cpr is used for phosphate removal to meet stringent effluent phosphate regulations wilfert et al 2015 iron or aluminium are present in sewage sludge as they are used for cpr but also for other reasons such as iron rich groundwater infiltration into the sewer system iron dosing to mitigate sulfide emissions the natural presence of iron in human excreta and because both elements are used as coagulants these metals can lower the recovery efficiency for struvite further korving et al 2018 thus there is still a need for economic phosphate recovery technologies from sewage sludge without sludge incineration and for sludge from cpr plants that use iron the ferrous iron phosphate mineral vivianite fe2 po4 3 8h2o is formed in anaerobic systems with relatively low sulphide concentrations if iron and phosphate are present rothe et al 2016 such conditions occur in mwtps especially during anaerobic sludge digestion accordingly several authors found indications for vivianite in mwtps frossard et al 1997 roussel and carliell marquet 2016 singer 1972 wilfert et al 2016 or in systems were wastewater was kept under anaerobic conditions azam and finneran 2014 cheng et al 2015 zhang 2012 or in experiments where ferrous iron fe ii was added to oxygen free wastewater ghassemi and recht 1971 however only in two of these studies the vivianite was quantified frossard et al 1997 wilfert et al 2016 in a recent publication wilfert et al 2016 we hypothesised that the amount of phosphate that is bound in vivianite is positively correlated with the molar fe p ratio in digested sludge under conditions that occur in anaerobic digesters vivianite is likely thermodynamically the most stable phosphate phase in the sludge nriagu and dell 1974 furthermore the formation of vivianite can be quick substantial amounts of it were formed due to iron reduction in experiments with septic wastewater within 48 h azam and finneran 2014 vivianite can also directly precipitate from solution at circumneutral ph ghassemi and recht 1971 roldan et al 2002 if these assumptions are correct this implies that under reducing conditions most phosphate is bound in a single relatively homogenous mineral phase i e vivianite its formation would then mainly be limited by the phosphate that is bound in organic structures and by the presence of sulphide that has a higher binding strength to ferrous iron than phosphate nriagu 1972 if one were able to separate the vivianite from the sewage sludge it should be possible to achieve higher phosphate recovery efficiencies compared to struvite routes struvite based recovery technologies show a relative low recovery efficiency because part of the phosphate is bound to other less soluble phases than struvite such as iron or aluminium phosphates baker et al 2006 doyle and parsons 2002 mamais et al 1994 neethling and benisch 2004 there are reports that significant quantities of vivianite can already be formed before the anaerobic digestion stage in excess sludge frossard et al 1997 wang et al 2018 wilfert et al 2016 also there are regular reports of vivianite precipitation in pipe lines at wastewater treatment sites marx et al 2001 nevertheless publications on vivianite in sewage sludge do not report size purity composition and of phosphate that is bound in vivianite before and after digestion nor do they report the mechanism of vivianite formation often samples are prepared in such a way that vivianite gets oxidized the best practice is to dry the samples at anaerobic conditions to prevent oxidation processes that can modify the mineral composition of the sample kraal et al 2009 it is possible to find vivianite when samples are dried at room temperature even in the presence of oxygen above 70 c in the presence of oxygen vivianite is transformed within hours into amorphous iron phosphate compounds čermáková et al 2015 poffet 2007 in this study we sampled and analysed sludge from several full scale mwtps in europe with different molar fe p ratios and plants that dose next to fe ii also fe iii salts with the purpose to reject or accept the hypotheses that i the extent of phosphate that is bound in vivianite is a function of a molar fe p ratio in digested sludge and that ii significant amounts of vivianite are already formed in the excess sludge prior to the anaerobic digestion process even when significant quantities of fe iii are dosed this information could not be obtained from earlier studies frossard et al 1997 wilfert et al 2016 in these studies either plants with little fe iii or solely fe ii dosing were studied furthermore it was not possible to determine how much phosphate could potentially be bound in vivianite in sludges as the formation of vivianite was probably limited by the presence of iron in these studies molar fe p in the samples well below 1 5 in addition to earlier research environmental scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy esem edx was used next to sem edx in the current study this method allowed us to determine whether vivianite particles occur as free particles or if they are coated e g by organic matter this knowledge is very valuable when it comes to vivianite separation from sewage sludge it should be possible to separate free paramagnetic vivianite particles from sewage sludge using conventional mining equipment like magnetic separators wills and finch 2015 the goal of this work was to determine how much phosphate can at maximum be bound in vivianite and if the vivianite is present in the sludge in forms that could offer efficient phosphate recovery via this mineral we chose a combination of mössbauer spectroscopy xrd sem edx and esem edx for analysing sludge before and after the anaerobic digestion process to determine the vivianite content and to characterize vivianite in the samples 2 material and methods sampling sample handling and sample analyses mössbauer spectroscopy xrd ts vs dissolved elemental composition and dissolved fe ii fe iii were done as previously described wilfert et al 2016 in short all samples were taken after a period of 48 h without rain or snowfall excess sludge samples were taken from settled sludge before dewatering and before it was pumped into the anaerobic digester digested samples were sampled directly after the digestion process before sludge dewatering the samples were stored in glass bottles and transported in cooling boxes on ice to minimize microbial activity until analyses started in the laboratory about 3 6 h after sampling sample drying started at most 8 h after sampling and was completed within 24 h sampling and sample processing were done under anaerobic conditions total elemental compositions of the samples were determined after a microwave assisted acid digestion hno3 69 15 min 180 c followed by icp oes perkin elmer optima 5300 dv additionally the elemental composition of the sludge solids was determined using xrf for xrf analyses the samples were pressed into powder tablets using an organic binder the measurements were performed with a panalytical axios max wd xrf spectrometer and data evaluation was done with superq5 0i omnian software total solids ts and volatile solids vs were measured according to standard methods apha awwa wef 1998 inside an anaerobic glovebox 95 n2 and 5 h2 o2 20 ppm the sludge samples were transferred into plastic centrifuge tubes and centrifuged outside the glovebox 15 min 3200 g dissolved elemental compositions icp oes dissolved anions ic metrohm ic compact 761 and dissolved fe ii fe iii viollier et al 2000 were determined after filtration of the supernatant 0 45 μm inside the glovebox solid material was derived from centrifuge pellets of the samples inside the glovebox pellets were finely spread on glass plates dried 25 c 24 h in the dark and afterwards grinded samples for xrd analyses were filled in glass capillaries and sealed first with modelling clay and then superglue right before analyses glass capillaries were sealed using a burner the measurements were done on a panalytical x pert pro diffractometer with cu ka radiation 5 80 2θ step size 0 008 the results from xrd analyses were made semi quantitative by determining the amorphous and crystalline area of the spectra origin pro 9 this allows the determination of the degree of crystallinity and thus of the total mineral share of the sample spectra for digested sludge samples using xrd were further fitted by rietveld refinement using the software gsas larson and dreele 1994 toby 2001 the samples before the anaerobic digestion showed a large amorphous fraction and rietveld refinement did not give reliable results these results were still made semi quantitative by using the output of the program package highscore version 4 6 1 2017 to compare these measurements with the results obtained from mössbauer spectroscopy vivianite was prepared roldan et al 2002 and added to digested sewage sludge in dokhaven in different quantities to test the reliability of the method the vivianite added x axis was plotted against the amount of vivianite that was determined by using xrd the intercept of the trend line hits the y axis at 182 g vivianite kg sludge this value equals the initial vivianite content in the sample uncertainty measures on the slope and intercept with least squares fit were obtained using the linest function of excel according to this analysis the standard deviation of the intercept was 11 7 all information regarding these analyses is added in the supplementary information table s1 table s2 all spectra and peak assignments are included as well for mössbauer analyses samples were filled in plastic rings sealed with kapton tape and super glue and then wrapped in parafilm transmission 57fe mössbauer spectra were collected at 4 2 and 300 k and for some samples at 100 k with conventional constant acceleration and sinusoidal velocity spectrometers using a 57co rh source velocity calibration was carried out using an α fe foil the mössbauer spectra were fitted using mosswinn 4 0 klencsár 1997 all mössbauer spectra and related hyperfine parameters are in the si figs s1 s5 and table s6 morphology and elemental compositions of sludge particles in the grinded solids was also analysed by esem edx philips xl30 esem equipped with an edam 3 eds system and sem edx jeol jsm 840a equipped with an oxford isis 300 micro analytical edx system samples for esem edx and sem edx were exposed to air during measurements samples for esem edx were vacuum dried on the sample holder inside the instrument vaccum chamber for sem edx dried and grinded sample was used for these analyses first an edx scan with low magnification was performed to identify particles with high fe p molar ratio some of these particles were randomly chosen to determine their elemental composition all sampled mwtps also had an anaerobic digestion stage the plants were mainly chosen according to the molar fe p in the digested sludge relevant plant parameters and treatment designs are summarized in table 1 tables s3 and s4 show the composition of the sludge samples note that sometimes the iron content and thus the molar fe p ratio in the solids table 1 in the digested sludge samples was significantly different to the samples before the anaerobic digestion this could be related to external sludge input in the digester e g leeuwarden wilfert et al 2016 to additional iron dosing before the digester dokhaven to the fact that iron rich secondary sludge was sampled and that this sludge was combined with primary settled sludge in the digester cologne berlin and espoo or to a combination of these factors dokhaven 3 results 3 1 xrd and mössbauer 3 1 1 fe ii content of the samples mössbauer spectra obtained at 4 2 k for several sludge samples showed fe ii as the dominant form of iron 90 in digested sewage sludge table 2 this was expected since during anaerobic digestion strongly reducing methanogenic conditions prevail here chemical and or biological iron reduction turns fe iii into fe ii the sample from leeuwarden showed some signs of oxidation because it was not protected well enough against oxidation as explained earlier wilfert et al 2016 surprisingly before digestion in the excess sludge samples fe ii was also the dominant iron phase in sludges with lower iron content fe p 1 0 fe ii made up 94 96 of all iron even when fe iii was used for phosphate elimination in plants with higher iron dosing berlin and cologne 50 60 of all iron was present in its reduced form the fe iii in these samples was present as iron oxides 3 1 2 quantification of vivianite in the samples the vivianite content in the samples in excess and digested sludge was determined by using mössbauer spectroscopy at different temperatures and by semi quantitative xrd this data was plotted against the molar fe p ratio as obtained from xrf fig 1 and fig 2 additionally data from an earlier study frossard et al 1997 was included the mössbauer measurements obtained at 300 k clearly showed that vivianite is present with parameters that are in agreement with earlier measurements on vivianite standards gonser and grant 1976 wilfert et al 2016 however at 4 2 k the spectra become less clear and very complex but still vivianite was detected in these measurements the complexity of the mössbauer spectra measured at 4 2 k is directly related to the presence of highly dispersed or impure vivianite like species characterized by broad mössbauer signals the inhomogeneity of the crystalline environment in the vivianite like structures reduces the néel temperature magnetic ordering temperature 9 k in pure vivianite resulting in significant signal broadening at the onset of long range magnetic order close to the 4 2 k measurement temperature thus because interpretation and fitting of 4 2 k data was difficult it was decided to re measure some samples at 100 k to be able to quantify vivianite more easily the latter measurements again indicate that vivianite is present in the samples due to difficulties in the spectra fitting and interpretation measurements at 4 2 k are used for discussions related to the oxidation state of iron in the samples for sake of completeness the quantification of vivianite in the sewage sludge using the data obtained at 4 2 k was plotted as well in figs 1 and 2 in most samples measured at 4 2 k a paramagnetic doublet fe ii species that might be assigned to vivianite was found in significant amounts as described before wilfert et al 2016 this phase is listed as vivianite impure in table s6 the isomer shift of this fe ii and the quadrupole splitting are close to the one of vivianite it could be that some dispersed vivianite structures or vivianite structures with impurities are still paramagnetic at 4 2 k which is close to the magnetic ordering temperature of vivianite 12 k for further discussions it was assumed that the fe ii species that could not clearly be assigned to vivianite with mössbauer spectroscopy at 4 2 k was in fact vivianite with impurities wilfert et al 2016 we prepared vivianite standards with different degrees of impurities of magnesium and calcium the presence of vivianite was confirmed with xrd unfortunately the samples partly became oxidized before mössbauer spectra were obtained thus a clear pattern of impurities vs site ratios was not visible because of the two antagonistic effects on the site ratio i e oxidation vs impurities what we could see however was that the impurities affected the oxidation of vivianite vivianite with impurities was almost completely oxidized within 48 h about 89 of all fe ii as shown by mössbauer spectroscopy data not shown this was much quicker and reached a much larger percentage compared to pure vivianite in earlier studies vivianite was prepared similarly to ours where oxidation took several weeks and only part of the vivianite got oxidized and turned into fe iii oxides miot et al 2009 roldan et al 2002 it was observed that at room temperature after about a year the fe iii concentration in synthetic vivianite remained constant at 50 when it was exposed to air rouzies and millet 1993 sludges from before the anaerobic digestion with a molar fe p ratios below 1 showed a clear increase of phosphate bound in vivianite with an increase of the iron content in the sludge fig 1 from these sludges the highest fe p ratio of about 0 95 was found in the a stage of nieuwveer here between 41 and 56 of all phosphate was bound in vivianite according to xrd and mössbauer measurements all results for these low iron sludges are in relative good agreement also the ones determined by frossard et al 1997 are in line with our measurements at higher molar fe p ratios however the vivianite quantification differed clearly between the methods and a relation between the fe p molar ratio and the vivianite content in the sludge was not obvious in excess sludge from berlin with a molar fe p ratio of about 1 7 mössbauer measurements at 300 and 100 k and the quantification using xrd agree well between 36 and 43 of all phosphate is bound in vivianite however the measurements at 4 2 k indicate that much more about 67 of all phosphate is bound in vivianite in the sludge from cologne only mössbauer quantifications from measurements at 100 and 300 k match well giving vivianite contents between 19 and 26 the data at 4 2 k again suggests a much higher vivianite content of 68 in contrast quantification using xrd gives a much lower share of phosphate bound in vivianite 7 the spectra obtained at 4 2 k were difficult to interpret as discussed below section 4 3 in the mössbauer spectra obtained at 4 2 k from sludge that was sampled before the anaerobic digestion in cologne and berlin it was assumed that the phase which could not be clearly assigned to vivianite was indeed vivianite this assumption leads to a higher vivianite content compared to the other measurement methods fig 1 by assuming that this phase that we consider as impure vivianite is in fact not vivianite would mean that in cologne about 27 and in berlin about 37 of all phosphate would be bound in vivianite only in the excess sludge from espoo molar fe p 2 5 vivianite was quantified using xrd measurements only according to these measurements about 50 of all phosphate was bound in vivianite after the anaerobic digestion all measurements show an increase of the phosphate fraction bound in vivianite in the sludge with a simultaneous increase of the iron content fig 2 the measurements from frossard and co workers frossard et al 1997 are again in line with our data all methods showed that phosphate bound in vivianite started to level off in the sludge with the highest iron content that was sampled in espoo molar fe p 2 5 the absolute values of the vivianite in the espoo sludge differed but both mössbauer measurements at 100 k and xrd suggest that almost all phosphate was bound in vivianite between 67 4 2 k 82 300 k 93 100 k and 101 7 8 xrd of all phosphate is contained in vivianite according to these measurements the data obtained at 4 2 k suggests a lower vivianite content compared to the measurements at 300 and 100 k which is in contrast to the measurements before the digestion the data obtained with mössbauer spectroscopy at 300 k gives except for the sample from espoo the lowest vivianite content in the digested sludge samples xrd data tends to give higher vivianite amounts than the mössbauer spectra 3 2 sem edx esem edx particles with a size distribution between 20 and 100 μm and elemental composition close to the one of vivianite were found by analysing the digested sludge samples using sem edx table 3 the composition of some particles with crystalline appearance and high iron and phosphate content is summarized in table 3 all particles consisted mainly of iron and phosphate but also always some impurities were present the iron and phosphate content of the particles increases with the iron content of the sewage sludge except of the espoo samples all samples showed molar fe p ratios below the one of vivianite 1 5 in the finish mwtp large quantities of iron are added to remove phosphate besides iron and phosphate also calcium magnesium and some aluminium were always present in all samples subsequently digested sewage sludge samples from berlin and dokhaven were also analysed using environmental e sem edx for this purpose the samples were rapidly vacuum dried inside the instrument a high abundance of particles with high iron and phosphate content and with diameters similar to the ones detected by sem edx were found in these samples fig 3 table s3 the particles were free i e not covered by organic coating these particles were better visible and more abundant in samples that were analysed using esem edx probably the slow drying of the samples for sem edx at room temperature can result in organic coating of the vivianite compared to the quick vacuum drying which results in more fibrous sample morphology we concluded that the vivianite particles are present as free particles in the sludge as opposed to earlier observations frossard et al 1997 wilfert et al 2016 4 discussion 4 1 introductory explanation for the discussion section in the first two sections of the discussion the results obtained from electron microscopy xrd and mössbauer spectroscopy are explained the focus lies on the vivianite content and the oxidation state of the iron in the sludge samples results from the different analytical methods are compared in the third part controversial measurement results are emphasized and critically reviewed this is accompanied by an in depth discussion of the applied methodology and other tools that could potentially be used for quantifying vivianite in sludge samples based on the knowledge that was created in this study it is further explained which directions vivianite based phosphate recovery routes could go the advantages of such technologies is outlined research gaps are highlighted in the last section 4 2 vivianite quantification before the anaerobic digestion mössbauer spectra obtained at liquid helium temperature revealed that fe ii dominates the iron pool in excess 50 and digested sewage sludge 90 although in the plants fe iii was dosed and despite the fact that the excess sludge passed also aerated sections of the mwtps in all mwtps where fe iii was dosed vivianite was present as indicated by xrd and mössbauer spectroscopy at molar fe p ratios below 1 in the excess sludge always more than 90 of all iron was present as fe ii because fe iii was dosed the dominance of fe ii in the excess sludge before anaerobic digestion indicates that chemical or biological fe iii reduction must occur in the mwtps iron could be reduced by sulphide compounds biber et al 1994 nielsen et al 2005 organics cornell et al 1989 indirectly via fermenting bacteria kappler et al 2004 or directly via iron reducing bacteria nielsen 1996 another important source for iron in the sludge is the incoming raw sewage table 1 probably this iron pool was in our mwtps dominated by fe ii because sulphidic conditions prevailed in most influents table 1 from all excess sludges the highest fe iii content was found in cologne here about 50 of all iron was present as fe iii in iron oxides probably a mixture of ferrihydrite and goethite as indicated by mössbauer spectroscopy although the mössbauer measurements were sometimes controversial for vivianite the fe iii oxide species present in the mössbauer spectra give separate signals that can be fitted independently from the signals of the ill defined vivianite like species also the fitting procedure of the mössbauer spectra of the fe iii oxides is well established allowing their identification and characterization with high accuracy the presence of ferrihydrite would be surprising because it transforms quickly into lepidocrocite and or goethite in the presence of fe ii in the mwtp cologne relatively large amounts of fe iii are added to remove phosphate obviously iron reduction is not quick enough to turn over all of this fe iii in cologne also the lowest sulphide influent load was measured whether this has an effect on the iron speciation cannot be concluded from the present data in the mwtp dokhaven quick fe iii reduction took place here fe iii is dosed in the aerated a stage where the srt is only 8 h this short retention time does not give much time for microbial fe iii reduction nielsen et al 1997 the influent sulphide load would be enough to reduce all dosed fe iii and explain the dominance of fe ii in the aerated a stage additionally the large contribution of influent iron 3 times the dosed iron probably as fe ii to the total iron pool is a reason for the dominance of fe ii in this sludge in dokhaven the orp of the incoming raw sewage was 290 mv also in berlin the influent sulphide load was relatively high which is related to high sulphate levels in the drinking water and long wastewater retention times in the sewer systems heinzmann personal communication about 60 of all iron was fe ii in berlin before the digestion and about 37 of the iron in the excess sludge was present as iron oxide most likely as goethite mössbauer quadrupole splitting of goethite was 0 25 mm s which can efficiently bind phosphate by adsorption and is probably relative insensitive to chemical and biological reduction on a time scale of mwtp operations canfield 1989 lovley 2013 earlier studies on activated sludge in münchehofe mwtp showed that most phosphate was extracted in the reductive soluble phosphate pool and only 10 of the phosphate was in the naoh fraction where vivianite would be expected röske and schönborn 1994 uhlmann et al 1990 this difference could be explained by the fact that in the earlier study activated sludge from the aeration tank was sampled in our study excess sludge was analysed excess sludge and thus settled sludge is exposed to oxygen free conditions during settling retention time in sludge blanket of several hours which could allow fe iii reduction after sampling our samples were kept on ice yet we cannot exclude that fe iii reduction in the samples was ongoing until sample drying started for berlin about 6 h after sampling nielsen 1996 rasmussen and nielsen 1996 this could result in changes of the iron pool in addition the presence of fe ii can induce recrystallization of ferric iron oxides especially for less stable forms such as ferrihydrite even in non biological systems latta et al 2012 on the other hand vivianite extraction characteristics are not fully understood as it occurs in different crystallinity particle sizes impurities and thus most sequential extraction schemes can if at all give rough estimates for the vivianite content in samples only rothe et al 2016 furthermore we believe that impurities can also affect the extraction schemes a large difference between the vivianite content as determined by xrd and by mössbauer spectroscopy was measured in cologne and berlin for the excess sludge this is probably because only mössbauer spectroscopy is able to detect not very well defined less crystalline perhaps freshly formed vivianite in these two samples and because the unknown fe ii species was assigned to impure vivianite we can however not definitely conclude that this impure vivianite is really vivianite results from measurements in leeuwarden and nieuwveer were adopted from an earlier study and were discussed in detail before wilfert et al 2016 overall no clear pattern of fe p vs phosphate bound in vivianite before digestion was visible this is likely related to the large variation in conditions in individual activated sludge processes e g dissolved oxygen set points fe ii fe iii dosing different redox zones and retention times in settler sludge blanket etc and varying significance of iron and sulphide loads from the inflowing sewage 4 3 vivianite quantification after the digestion after the anaerobic digestion vivianite was the dominating iron phase as thermodynamics predict always some iron bound in fesx was present nriagu 1972 fig 2 shows that the vivianite content in the digested sludge increases with the iron content in the samples in the pure ebpr plant asten with a low molar fe p 0 14 xrd could not detect any vivianite this suggests that at low iron levels vivianite is present in low quantities or not present at all because of a shortage of iron the iron that is present in this sludge is partly not available for vivianite formation as it reacts with sulphide to form fesx at intermediate iron content in the sludge fe p 0 5 1 1 again part of the iron is bound in fesx the residual iron which is not bound in fesx is available for vivianite formation to bind some but not all of the phosphate that would theoretically be available for vivianite formation in sludge with even higher iron content and molar fe p ratios of around 1 5 cologne and berlin it seems that vivianite formation is already starting to level off due to limited phosphate availability a fraction remains bound in the bacterial mass in cologne mössbauer indicates that between 61 and 88 and semi quantitative xrd shows that 90 of all phosphate is bound in vivianite in espoo finland it seems that almost all phosphate is bound in vivianite xrd measurements agree with the 100 k mössbauer measurements which indicate that between 93 and 100 6 4 of all phosphate is bound in vivianite it is unlikely that all phosphate is bound in vivianite as organic bound phosphate is present which should only be recoverable if organics are broken down e g during incineration or at alkaline ph the stronger binding of iron with sulphide suggests that excess iron is required for complete vivianite formation of the available phosphate molar iron to phosphate ratios slightly lower or equal to the stoichiometry of vivianite are sufficient to complete vivianite formation in the digested sewage sludge the amount of iron that gets bound to sulphides seems to more or less correspond with the amount of phosphate that is not available for vivianite formation in waste sludge digestion assuming only organic bound phosphate is limiting vivianite formation how much phosphate could then be bound in organics and thus limit the formation of vivianite it was suggested that activated sludge from berlin münchehofe contained 25 of all phosphate in the form of organics uhlmann et al 1990 in another study between 7 and 16 of all phosphate was assigned to organic phosphates before anaerobic digestion in mwtps using iron or aluminium respectively for phosphate removal alvarenga et al 2017 in digested sludge with a molar fe p of about 1 2 carliell marquet et al 2009 reported that only about 12 of all phosphate was present as organic phosphate similarly other results show that up to 86 of all phosphate in digested sludge was inorganic phosphate frossard et al 1994 thus based on these reports of organic phosphates in digested sludge it seems feasible that roughly 90 of all phosphate could be available for vivianite formation 4 4 vivianite characterization method some controversial observations were made during the quantification of vivianite bound phosphate in the sludge as discussed above after the anaerobic digestion xrd suggests that all phosphate is bound in vivianite 100 6 4 this seems unlikely because we expect that part of the phosphate is also bound in organic matter or in other inorganic phases additionally deviations in the vivianite content of the sludges as determined by using mössbauer spectroscopy and xrd were observed and the mössbauer measurements at different temperatures also gave different vivianite contents for some sludges figs 1 and 2 why is the quantification of vivianite so difficult our edx analyses table 3 and earlier analyses roussel and carliell marquet 2016 indicate that the vivianite particles in the sludge contain impurities in general vivianite is known to contain impurities rothe et al 2016 and earlier mössbauer and xrd studies using mineral vivianite specimens also always contained a certain degree of impurities and or the vivianite was partly oxidized during handling of the samples gonser and grant 1976 rodgers and henderson 1986 pure vivianite will hardly be encountered in environmental or engineered systems like mwtps the degree and type of impurities e g magnesium manganese copper arsenic probably varies from one place to another as the impurities partly mirror the composition of the host solution were it was formed rothe et al 2016 we should refer to vivianite like structures rather than to vivianite when talking about the compounds that we found in the sewage sludge it seems logical that impurities affect the thermodynamic properties stability and solubility in chemical extraction schemes of the vivianite furthermore the impurities can hinder the identification and quantification of vivianite in samples a standard addition of synthetic pure vivianite to digested sewage sludge from dokhaven showed that our method to semi quantitatively determine vivianite in the sludge using xrd is relative reliable table s1 this methodology cannot guarantee that the initial vivianite content in this sample was determined correctly due to systematic errors in the semi quantitative xrd procedure this further suggests that xrd is not able to distinguish between vivianite with and without impurities likely part of the iron in the sludge vivianite was replaced by other cations such as copper or magnesium which could explain why the vivianite content in digested sludge as quantified by xrd is often higher than the numbers from the more specific mössbauer spectroscopy also phosphate in the vivianite structure can be replaced by other elements such as arsenic muehe et al 2016 for xrd the quantification of vivianite is further hindered by the presence of unassigned peaks in some samples and by the fact that quartz and vivianite had some overlapping peaks in our measurements see peak assignments in the si also the rietveld refinement and the determination of the amorphous fraction of the samples introduce some uncertainty although the hyperfine parameters obtained by mössbauer spectroscopy clearly show that vivianite is present in the samples some observations remain unclear iron in vivianite is present in two distinct octahedral sites the ratio for these sites is usually 2 site b site a 2 mori and ito 1950 however in our case the ratio was often lower than 2 ranging from 1 2 to 2 frossard et al 1997 used mössbauer spectroscopy at 300 k to determine the vivianite in one activated and two digested sewage sludge samples only one of the three samples surprisingly the activated sludge sample which is more subjected to oxygen exposure had a site ratio close to 2 1 9 in the other two samples much higher ratios of 4 and 6 were found the authors concluded that this deviation is caused by oxidation although this ratio is far higher than expected for oxidized vivianite in our case oxidation is probably not the reason for the lower site ratio because literature shows that the oxidation takes at least initially preferably place at site a which would rather increase the site ratios rouzies and millet 1993 also most of our samples showed no signs of oxidation e g no presence of oxidized vivianite as determined by mössbauer spectroscopy i e only limited quantities of ferric iron were present and they were not identified as oxidized vivianite literature indicates that elemental substitutions of iron can affect mössbauer spectra amthauer and rossman 1984 dyar et al 2014 in baricite the magnesium analogue of vivianite substitution takes preferably place at site b which would indeed cause a decrease in the iron site ratios yakubovich et al 2001 similarly manning et al 1991 further hypothesised that substitutions at the site b by manganese or fe iii could change the site ratios additionally they claimed that part of the iron at the a site could actually not be part of the vivianite but part of clay minerals some iron containing chlorite and clay minerals have similar hyperfine parameters as vivianite manning suggested to recalculate the real vivianite content by assuming fea feb 2 and then derive the phosphate content from it this would mean that we would currently over quantify vivianite bound phosphate in our samples by using mössbauer spectroscopy on the other hand if impurities are present and we assume that substitution takes mainly place on site b then an adaption of the site ratio to 2 would be necessary to take into account the iron from site b that was replaced by cations such as calcium or magnesium this would mean that we are underestimating the phosphate bound in vivianite by our mössbauer measurements the latter case is rather unlikely in the digested sludge sample from espoo mössbauer suggested that about 90 of all phosphate is bound in vivianite also both phenomena could occur in our samples overall despite uncertainties mössbauer spectroscopy and xrd show a clear increase of the vivianite content in the samples with an increase of the molar fe p in the digested sewage sludge additionally our data clearly show that anaerobic digesters are places of very significant vivianite formation another option for quantifying vivianite in the sludge is thermodynamic modelling which is a strong tool for estimating which phosphate compounds could possibly form in mwtps however modelling has also drawbacks in complex systems like mwtps for determining the vivianite content of the sludge due to i molar fe s ratios of iron sulphides that will probably form prior to vivianite range from one mackinawite to two pyrite peiffer et al 2015 ii kinetics of mineral formation are difficult to model certainly in presence of organic complexes iii for some minerals possibly more stable than vivianite e g anapeit nriagu and dell 1974 and for amorphous compounds thermodynamic data is missing and therefore such compounds are not included in the corresponding databases v metals in sludge can be complexed by dissolved organic compounds which are ubiquitous in wastewaters this makes modelling more difficult and vi sometimes the modelling input is biased and minerals such as vivianite have even been neglected in studies flores alsina et al 2016 besides modelling chemical extractions have been used for vivianite determination however results were also inconsistent for environmental samples rothe et al 2016 it seems that all approaches including our combination of spectroscopic methods have problems to determine the vivianite content in the samples 4 5 from vivianite quantification to phosphate recovery analogously to struvite it has been reported that vivianite can cause problems in mwtps especially during thermophilic digestion marx et al 2001 reusser 2009 our study shows that when iron is used for phosphate removal the biogeochemical conditions in mwtps that are required for successful sewage treatment drive vivianite formation without additional measures the vivianite solubility will depend on the activity of the iron it is likely that vivianite is the phosphate compound with the lowest thermodynamic stability in digested sewage sludge nriagu and dell 1974 our data suggests that significant amounts of phosphate are bound in vivianite and thus that it is time to make use of the formation of vivianite in mwtps and develop strategies to recover phosphate in the form of vivianite from sewage sludge our measurements on vivianite in sludges backed by solubility products for minerals suggest that much higher phosphate recovery efficiencies can be achieved compared to struvite recovery routes the potential of struvite recovery is limited because part of the phosphate is bound to compounds with lower solubility than struvite solubility such as aluminum or iron phosphates baker et al 2006 doyle and parsons 2002 mamais et al 1994 this would not be the case for vivianite as it has a very low solubility probably also compared to amorphous aluminum phosphates the characteristics of vivianite observed in mwtp sludges in this study show limitations related to the recovery of the mineral separation via magnetism or density separation may provide ways to recover vivianite solubility is in our opinion a reason why phosphate bound vivianite cannot efficiently be recovered via dissolution of ferric or ferrous phosphate in the sludge phosphate from vivianite could e g be released via microbial fe iii oxidation miot et al 2009 or by making use of sulphide kato et al 2006 suschka et al 2001 but the released phosphate will form precipitates with other elements in the sludge liquor or bind to other inorganic phases in the sludge solids similar observations were made for sediment systems boström and pettersson 1982 richardson 1985 roden and edmonds 1997 thus a separation technology for vivianite instead of other recovery routes seems most logical such a technology could be based on seeding kempter et al 2014 density or magnetic separation of the free vivianite particles from sewage sludge using simple effective and low cost equipment from the mining industry wills and finch 2015 the esem edx measurements in this study showed that vivianite occurs as free particles in the sludge indeed magnetic separation of vivianite was successfully evaluated in trial experiments using a magnetic separator with jones plates that were designed for separating vivianite from sewage sludge from digested sewage sludge sampled in espoo 60 of all phosphate could be recovered in the magnetic fraction wilfert et al 2017 vivianite has been directly applied as a slow release fertilizer however the fertilizer value of iron phosphates has been discussed controversially kahiluoto et al 2015 roldan et al 2002 römer 2006 samie and römer 2001 thus we recommend that once a concentrated pure vivianite stream is obtained the vivianite can easily be dissolved at alkaline ph by using koh phosphate and potassium dissolve at the same time iron and heavy metals would precipitate additionally the solution would probably be hygienized in this step which makes its further application in agriculture more attractive the potassium phosphate solution can directly be used for fertilizer production the iron could be re used for phosphate removal in the sewage treatment plant these suggestions need to be verified experimentally the current form of vivianite detected is present in very small particles for more efficient recovery methods to form larger vivianite particles need to be developed 5 conclusion this study shows that vivianite is the most important iron and phosphate phase in digested sewage sludge with high iron content between 70 and 90 of all phosphate in sewage sludge can be bound in vivianite this vivianite will contain impurities and it is therefore better to call it vivianite like structures the esem edx analyses indicate that the vivianite is present as free particles which would theoretically allow their separation from the sludge to achieve higher recovery efficiency compared to struvite recovery routes hereto more knowledge on the vivianite formation in sewage sludge is necessary density impurities size distribution of vivianite particles that are liberated in order to obtain larger crystals in the sludge which will be easier to separate this requires more knowledge about the factors that drive the formation of vivianite with different shapes sizes and degrees of impurities dosing iron for phosphate and cod removal is in line with energy producing mwtps of the future wilfert et al 2015

19368,knowledge driven management for wastewater treatment plant wwtp performance becomes increasingly important considering the globally growing production of wastewater and the rising demand of clean water supply even though the potential of microbial organisms bacteria and protists as bioindicators for wwtp performance is well known it is far from being fully exploited for routine monitoring programs therefore we here used massive sequencing of environmental e dna metabarcodes from bacterial v3 v4 region of the ssu rrna gene and eukaryote v9 region of the ssu rrna gene communities in 21 activated sludge samples obtained from full scale municipal wwtps in germany microbial community patterns were compared to standard wwtp operating parameters and two traditionally used wwtp performance indicators sludge biotic index and sludge index both indices showed low concordance and hardly correlated with chemical wwtp performance parameters nor did they correlate with microbial community structures in contrast microbial community profiles significantly correlated with wwtp performance parameters and operating conditions of the plants under study therefore edna metabarcode profiles of whole microbial communities indicate the performance of wwtp and can provide useful information for management strategies we here suggest a strategy for the development of an edna metabarcode based bioindicator system which can be implemented in future standard monitoring programs for wwtp performance and effluent quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial communities biomonitoring bioindicator environmental sequencing protistan communities waste water treatment plants 1 introduction the global annual average production of wastewater by mankind between 1995 and 2005 was ca 1400 gm3 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 purification of wastewater by wastewater treatment plants wwtps is a major prerequisite for human and environmental health globally water related diseases are responsible for the death of more than 5 million people annually malik et al 2012 regarding environmental health an estimated 44 of stream miles and 64 of lake acres in the united states are heavily polluted epa 2002 major contaminants of natural water bodies include human associated sewage templar et al 2016 heavy metals elzwayie et al 2017 persistent organic pollutants liu et al 2017 and nutrients gross and hagy 2017 consequently in recent years legislation requirements concerning the quality of wastewater discharged into the environment after purification in wwtps have become increasingly strict arévalo et al 2009 in wwtps microbial consortia in the biological reactors of activated sludge are responsible for most of the organic compound and nutrient removal from wastewater arregui et al 2012 curds 1982 cydzik kwiatkowska and zielińska 2016 foissner 2016 these microbial consortia are predominantly composed of bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes protists bacteria constitute up to ca 95 of the microbial biomass aescht and foissner 1992 jenkins et al 2003 they are the main organisms responsible for pollution reduction in activated sludge reactors including the removal of organic carbon nitrogen compounds sulfate and phosphate eikelboom 2000 leal et al 2016 filamentous bacteria play an important role for the establishment of the microbial aggregate structures flocs which is a key feature regarding sludge characteristics a shortage of filamentous bacteria may result in pinpoint floc formation or dispersed growth leading to poor sludge characteristics poor effluent quality and problems in the reactor an excess of filamentous bacteria will result in bulking or foaming causing the sludge to rise in the reactor and hindering wwtp performance fryer and gray 2012 leal et al 2016 protozoa in particular ciliates which can reach densities of more than 10 000 cells ml 1 of activated sludge accounting for 9 of suspended solids in mixed liquor signorile et al 2010 function as consumers they feed on bacteria and are the key factor for the reduction of suspended solids and turbidity in the final effluent al shahwani and horan 1991 curds 1982 furthermore ciliates reduce the number of coliform bacteria in the effluent reducing health risks after discharge of the effluent into the environment curds 1983 templar et al 2016 in addition through the secretion of substances with flocculating properties and through grazing of bacteria on floc surfaces ciliates contribute to the process of sludge flocculation güde 1979 klausen et al 2004 luxmy et al 2000 wilén et al 2008 accordingly bacteria and ciliates are the backbone for the monitoring of wwtp performance to ascertain the discharge of a clean effluent into the environment and an optimal sewage depuration castillo et al 2016 other microbial eukaryotes than ciliates are also known to have indicator qualities e g diatoms chrysophytes rhizaria adam and mahood 1981 qin et al 2016 vilmi et al 2015 wang and chappell 2001 yet they are largely ignored in biological wwtp performance surveys several studies have demonstrated the correlation of specific microbial taxa and wwtp performance parameters araújo dos santos et al 2014 curds 1982 cydzik kwiatkowska and zielińska 2016 fryer and gray 2012 castillo et al 2016 the main reason why microbial diversity is neglected in routine wwtp monitoring and standard performance indices such as the sludge biotic index sbi madoni 1994 and the sludge index si arregui et al 2012 is the difficulty of accurate microbial species identification thus due to a taxonomic impediment the potential of numerous microbes as bioindicators is far from being exploited in routine wwtp performance monitoring ettl 1997 2008 foissner 2016 to countervail this taxonomic impediment and to make the properties of microbes as bioindicators better available for routine monitoring biological identifications through dna barcodes have been introduced pawlowski et al 2012 stoeck et al 2013 dna metabarcoding uses short standardized gene regions obtained from environmental samples i e environmental e dna metabarcoding as internal species tags to provide rapid identifications taberlet et al 2012 valentini et al 2016 this technique has the potential to increase accuracy resolution and speed in environmental monitoring aylagas et al 2014 bourlat et al 2013 ji et al 2013 lallias et al 2015 pawlowski et al 2016 thomsen and willerslev 2015 valentini et al 2016 it also allows to include bacteria as bioindicators aylagas et al 2017 most of which can morphologically hardly be diagnosed in this study we tested the potential of edna metabarcoding of eukaryote and bacterial communities from 21 activated sludge samples for wwtp performance monitoring therefore we compared the molecular community profiles of bacteria and microbial eukaryotes with operating and performance parameters of the plants furthermore we related the molecular microbial community profiles to two traditionally used reference wwtp performance indices the sludge biotic index and the sludge index calculated from the same samples 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling between november 2016 and march 2017 21 samples 5 l of activated sludge from aeration tanks where microbial communities degrade wastewater contaminants and form activated sludge flocs were collected from seven different wastewater treatment plants wwtps in rhineland palatinate germany some wwtps under study had two or three aeration tanks in parallel operation and in this case we sampled all of the different aeration tanks of these plants for an overview of the plants sampled sampling dates and for sample abbreviations we refer to table s1 fig s1 depicts the process steps of the wwtp type analyzed in this study and the process step from which samples are taken at each plant is marked cooled samples were transported in sterile polyethylene canisters with hermetic lids to

operators and are presented in table s2 2 2 sludge biotic index and sludge index sbi and si as benchmark indices for comparisons with dna metabarcoding data were obtained according to madoni 1994 and arregui et al 2012 respectively sbi calculation is based on the occurrence and abundance of few functional key groups of microfauna inlcuding sessile crawling and swimming ciliates small swimming flagellates testate amoebae and the ciliate taxa opercularia spp and vorticella microstoma as bioindicators si is based on several macroscopical characters turbidity suspended flocs and decantability characterized as high medium or low and odor classified as correct or incorrect and microscopical parameters floc structure size cover and texture number of protist species and number of filamentous bacteria within and outside flocs the sbi classifies the performance of wwtps as follows sbi 10 8 refers to class i very well colonized and stable sludge excellent biological activity very good performance sbi 7 6 indicates class ii well colonized and stable sludge biological activity on decrease good performance sbi 5 4 refers to class iii insufficient biological depuration in the aeration tank mediocre performance and sbi 3 0 indicates class iv poor biological depuration in the aeration tank low performance madoni 1994 the si classifies the performance of wwtps as follows 100 90 excellent 89 80 good 79 40 mediocre 39 20 bad and 19 0 very bad arregui et al 2012 samples were analyzed for these indices within 4 h after sampling species were identified after foissner et al 1991 1992 1994 1995 and eikelboom 2000 floc characterization followed eikelboom 2000 and arregui et al 2012 flagellates were quantified after madoni 1994 using a fuchs rosenthal chamber gram staining and neisser staining for the standard diagnostic of filamentous bacteria in activated sludge followed kunst et al 2013 2 3 dna metabarcoding dna was extracted using the dneasy powermax soil kit qiagen

bacterial v3 v4 metabarcodes 2x250 bp paired end reads and on an illumina nextseq platform eukaryote v9 metabarcodes 1x150 bp reads at seq it kaiserslautern germany the sequence data were deposited at the sequence read archive of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi and are available under accession number srp131489 2 4 sequence data processing and taxonomic assignment sequences were processed as described in detail previously filker et al 2016 raw paired end 16s rdna v3 v4 and single 18s rdna v9 illumina reads were quality filtered using the split libraries py script implemented in qiime v 1 8 0 caporaso et al 2010 non chimeric reads were clustered with swarm v 2 0 5 mahé et al 2015 using d 1 swarm uses a local clustering threshold d instead of an arbitrary global clustering threshold and does not depend on the input order operational taxonomic units otus grow iteratively by comparing each generation of assigned amplicons to the remaining amplicons in the dataset an otu is closed when no new amplicon with d or fewer differences can be assigned to the otu using a custom script an otu contingency table was created based on the output files of swarm representative sequences i e the most abundant sequence from each otu were extracted and analyzed with blastn altschul et al 1990 against the pr2 reference database guillou et al 2012 for 18s rdna v9 amplicons and against genbank s nucleotide database version 216 for 16s rdna v3 v4 amplicons the taxonomic information and the otu contingency tables were merged using a custom script otus not assigned to microbial eukaryotes in case of the 18s rdna v9 otu table and otus not assigned to the domain eubacteria in case of the 16s rdna v3 v4 otu table as well as singletons in both otu tables were excluded from further analyses the latter refers to amplicons which occurred only once and exclusively in one sample bokulich et al 2013 finding a high proportion of singletons is not uncommon since the swarm algorithm uses a very stringent threshold of 1 bp local alignment difference for its single linkage clustering clare et al 2016 the two resulting otu tables were used as a basis for all downstream analyses 2 5 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted in r v 3 2 4 using the program packages vegan oksanen et al 2007 and hmisc harrell jr and dupont 2016 as well as ggplot2 wickham 2016 for graphical representations correlations between wwtp performance indices sbi and si and wastewater performance parameters were calculated with spearman s rank correlation coefficient the bray curtis bc index was used as a measure of similarity between each sampled microbial community using the otu tables as input prior to beta diversity estimation the number of sequences per sample was rarefied to the smallest sample size bc similarity values were transformed to distance matrixes for a nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis all operating and performance parameters table s2 as wells as both indices si and sbi were fitted to the ordination using the envfit function of the vegan package in r the fit r2 of each variable to the ordination and the significance of each fit was assessed with a monte carlo analysis of 1000 permutations 3 results 3 1 sbi and si the sbi ranged from 4 to 10 and the si varied between 49 and 84 fig 1 the sbi classified the performance of 15 reactors as very good 5 reactors as good and one reactor as mediocre in contrast the si classified the performance of one reactor as very good 5 reactors as good and 15 reactors as mediocre fig 1 spearman rank correlations were insignificant for both sbi and si with most standard chemical performance parameters total nitrogen removal efficiency total phosphorous removal efficiency cod and bod as well as with sludge parameters svi and mlss with the sole exception of si correlating significantly with bod mlss table s3 3 2 sequence data overview an overview of the sequence data is presented in table s4 we obtained between 60 049 and 299 464 high quality eukaryotic and between 7643 and 23 364 high quality bacterial amplicons the microbial eukaryote amplicons grouped into 1809 to 5655 otus the bacterial amplicons grouped into 1526 to 3193 otus it is noteworthy that we discarded 59 of all obtained high quality bacterial sequences because they resulted in otus which were represented only by one individual amplicon and occurred only at one individual sampling site singletons 3 3 taxonomic assignments of edna metabarcodes in the eukaryotes alveolates and stramenopiles accounted for the vast majority of the observed diversity in all samples fig 2 on average alveolates contributed 39 sd 5 1 n 21 to the overall diversity and stramenopiles to 28 sd 4 n 21 amoebae excavata and rhizaria are further groups with a noteworthy diversity their relative contributions to the eukaryotic communities were highly similar in all samples other taxon groups including fungi and metazoa were relatively little diverse in all samples among the alveolates ciliates were by far the most diverse accounting on average for 96 4 sd 1 n 21 of the diversity fig s2 ciliates could be assigned to 28 different orders the vast majority of ciliate otus belonged to the five orders cyrtophoria euplotida sessilida suctoria and pleurostomatida otus assigned to these orders accounted on average for 88 of all ciliate otus sd 2 5 n 21 among the stramenopiles chrysophytes were by far the most diverse taxon group accounting on average for 89 of the stramenopiles diversity sd 3 4 n 21 interestingly nearly all chrysophyte otus 98 7 on average sd 0 6 n 21 were assigned to one single taxon group chrysophyte clade f in the bacteria proteobacteria verrucomicrobia and bacteroidetes were by far the most abundant taxon groups in all samples accounting for ca 95 of the otu diversity in all plants under study fig 3 within proteobacteria rhodocyclales sulfuricellales and burkholderiales all belonging to the class betaproteobacteria as well as pseudomonadales gammaproteobacteria were the four dominant orders in all samples fig s3 bacteroidetes were largely dominated by flavobacteriaceae in all plants followed by saprospiraceae and unknown bacteria which were distantly related to a symbiont detected in truffles fig s4 within the verrucomicrobia the dominant family was verrucomicrobiaceae fig s5 3 4 diversity partitioning nmds analyses revealed clear differences between the activated sludge eukaryote communities since data points of distinct wwtps were spatially separated in the nmds plot stress 0 15 fig 4 thus eukaryote communities had a high resolution power to distinguish the different activated sludge samples from each other communities from the same plant i e bmb hsp kl hl were more similar to each other than to the ones of other plants this can be inferred from smaller distances between the respective data points in the plot yet temporal variations in eukaryote communities of plants which were sampled at least twice were also evident for example eukaryote communities analyzed in the three different reactors of plant kl kl r1 kl r2 kl r3 in january clustered closer to one another than to communities of the same reactors sampled in march the vectors in the plot represent those parameters for which the environmental fitting resulted in significant correlations between the parameters and the microbial communities for results of all variables see table s5 the stronger the fit of a variable the longer its respective vector vector directions indicate the ordination space towards which the environmental vectors change most rapidly and to which they have maximal correlations with the ordination oksanen et al 2007 nmds axis 1 correlated significantly with svi r 0 86 p 0 05 nmds axis 2 correlated significantly with mlss r 0 9 p 0 05 cod r 0 95 p 0 05 and total nitrogen removal efficiency r 0 91 p 0 005 neither sbi nor si correlated significantly with any of the nmds axes beta diversity patterns of bacterial communities were very similar to the observed eukaryotic pattern nmds stress 0 117 fig 5 as in the case of eukaryote edna metabarcodes communities from the same plant were more similar to each other than to the ones of other plants also as in the case of eukaryote edna metabarcodes neither sbi nor si correlated significantly with any of the nmds axes for results of all variables see table s6 nmds axis 1 correlated significantly with svi r 0 95 p 0 01 nmds axis 2 correlated significantly with mlss r 0 85 p 0 05 cod r 0 96 p 0 05 total nitrogen removal efficiency r 0 89 p 0 05 and total phosphate removal efficiency r 0 95 p 0 005 4 discussion 4 1 sbi si and wwtp performance sbi and si showed low concordance among the 21 activated sludge samples under study while the sbi testified a very good wwtp performance for 15 plants the si confirmed this result for only one of these plants plant tr while seven of the plants were characterized with a mediocre performance only more importantly none of these two indices of wwtp performance correlated significantly with standard performance parameters except for si correlating with bod mlss thus neither sbi nor si adequately informed about the waste water purification efficiency of the wwtps under study the sbi is based on functional key groups and the relative abundances of the indicator organisms belonging to these groups madoni 1994 even though some authors reported a satisfactorily correspondence between sbi and wwtp performance parameters e g leal et al 2016 pedrazzani et al 2016 zhou et al 2008 numerous studies failed to establish an association between the sbi wastewater treatment performance parameters and effluent quality arévalo et al 2009b arregui et al 2012 drzewicki and kulikowska 2011 nicolau et al 2005 papadimitriou et al 2005 samaras et al 2009 this frequent inability of the sbi to assess the effluent quality in activated sludge processes correctly may be attributed primarily to the fact that the sbi is based on large functional groups swimming ciliates attached ciliates crawling ciliates but also the categories thecate amoebae and small flagellates rather than individual species with significant indicator qualities one advantage of this idea is that the sbi is very easy to apply by plant operators on a daily basis in routine monitoring it hardly requires taxonomic expertise and with two exceptions vorticella microstoma and opercularia spp the sbi can be inferred without any species identifications however lumping together a plethora of different species with the same life style or feeding strategy into one individual indicator category is a very simplified view which does not consider the autecology of individual species therefore it is not surprising that other authors also did not succeed to significantly link such functional group categories to performance and operating parameters of a full scale municipal wwtp hu et al 2013 nearly 200 ciliate species have been illustrated in activated sludge curds et al 2008 foissner et al 1995 1994 1991 foissner and berger 2011 1992 seviour and nielsen 2010 of these a large proportion are free swimming ciliates which have distinct habitat preferences for example trimyema spp are strict anaerobes tolerating high levels of hydrogen sulfide and feeding mostly on sulphur bacteria other free swimming ciliates such as acineria uncinata and cinetochilum margaritaceum are indicators of sufficient oxygen supply in the activated sludge process and of a healthy activated sludge foissner and berger 2011 the free swimming enchelyomorpha vermicularis indicates an overloaded and oxygen deficient sludge foissner and berger 2011 moreover even different ciliate species of the same genus indicate different wwtp performance levels for example different species of the suctorian ciliate genus acineta commonly found in activated sludge indicate different saprobity levels foissner and berger 2011 and different bod conditions curds and cockburn 1970 finally different ciliate species such as acineria uncinata may indicate different wwtp performance levels depending on their associations with other members of the ciliate community arregui et al 2013 drzewicki and kulikowska 2011 these examples demonstrate that the ciliate community structures in wwtps are much too complex to categorize them into life style categories for bioindication in acknowledgement of these species specific indicator qualities the author team of a widely used identification book in wwtp monitoring practice bayerisches landesamt für wasserwirtschaft 1999 is currently working on a revision of this book with a more differentiated view of species properties m ettl co author of bayerisches landesamt für wasserwirtschaft 1999 personal communication nevertheless even though functional protistan groups are no reliable bioindicator for wwtp performance castillo et al 2016 successfully applied functional groups as a diagnostic tool to establish stable operating conditions after startup of a municipal wwtp in mexico this approach however was only successful because the authors did not rely entirely on functional protistan groups but also considered meiofauna as a bioindicator group as well as different gram type bacteria arregui et al 2012 proposed the si as a more reliable and robust alternative to the sbi in contrast to the sbi the si takes into account the total number of species as the only protist based numeric value of this index in the si the occurrence of more than seven protist species is considered as very good and of less than four species as very bad considering the different ecological indicator qualities of different species for a few examples see above this approach seems very questionable the second biological component in this index is the number of filamentous bacteria within and outside of flocs as in the case with protists this provides only very limited information because species identities are not considered this however is very critical because the diversity of filamentous bacteria is immense and so are their ecophysiological properties and their effects on plant operation reviewed by nielsen et al 2009 thus depending on the community structure of excessively growing filamentous bacteria the problems in wwtp operations and also the resulting management processes are different jenkins et al 2003 kunst et al 2013 other parameters describe the sensory qualities of the sludge and the physical floc structures our results are in line with those of previous studies showing that the microbial community composition in activated sludge may notably affect the floc structures yet without compromising the effluent quality and thus the wwtp operating performance lee and welander 1996 luxmy et al 2000 ratsak 2001 rensink and rulkens 1997 this is not unexpected because changes in operational parameters of wwtps are immediately revealed by modifications of microbial community structures cydzik kwiatkowska and zielińska 2016 martín cereceda et al 1996 salvado et al 1995 before they eventually become evident in floc structures 4 2 edna metabarcodes of activated sludge microfauna as wwtp performance indicator several authors suggested to abandon single numerical indicators such as sbi and si entirely for wwtp efficiency assessments bayerisches landesamt für wasserwirtschaft 1999 foissner 2016 instead these authors proposed a polyphasic approach which considers a combination of species identities of protists and bacteria plant type floc structure and physico chemical parameters indeed this approach would be most informative yet hardly feasible for frequent and routine standard monitoring of wwtps however the results presented in this study pave the way for the development of a wwtp performance assessment approach under consideration of these parameters the activated sludge core microbial communities bacteria and microbial eukaryotes of all plants under study were highly similar to each other on higher taxonomic levels and corroborated well with the typically reported patterns in full scale municipal wwtps arregui et al 2010 cydzik kwiatkowska and zielińska 2016 foissner 2016 isazadeh et al 2016 madoni 2011 madoni and ghetti 1981 tang et al 2016 based on a similar finding for bacterial communities of thirteen danish wwtps saunders et al 2016 proposed that the microbial diversity within sewers may be similar across the world because these diversity patterns and the known functional roles of the core taxa in wwtps are well described see e g references mentioned above we here refrain from repeating these discussions however at a higher taxonomic resolution on molecular otu level the edna metabarcode profiles of microbial communities were unique fingerprints of the 21 different sludge samples under study the mechanisms driving the assembly of the core microbial communities were not investigated as this was not the subject of this study in our statistical analyses we could show that the more similar the performance parameters of different plants the more similar the community profiles of the corresponding microbial communities because community patterns correlated significantly with a number of operating parameters we conclude that edna metabarcode profiles of whole microbial communities are more reliable and stronger indicators for wwtp performance than both si and sbi these community profiles consider unique metabarcodes of individual organisms rather than life style categories such as sessile crawling swimming as well as their abundance distributions also this approach allows the implementation of all eukaryotic taxon groups in wwtp performance assessments in the past a strong focus was primarily on ciliates as biological indicators curds 1965 1982 curds and cockburn 1970 eikelboom 2000 foissner 2016 lee and welander 1996 lee et al 2004 madoni 2011 madoni and ghetti 1981 while other potential indicator taxon groups were largely ignored the major reason is probably the comparatively solid morphotaxonomic framework for these large protists and the possibility to identify at least some ciliates with standard microscopy techniques however also many other eukaryotes are known as biological indicators including for example diatoms vilmi et al 2015 and chrysophytes adam and mahood 1981 all of which however are more difficult to identify under the microscope than some wwtp relevant ciliates the diversity of these other potential wwtp performance indicators is high in activated sludge samples see fig 2 and it is reasonable to assume that also among these taxon groups we find strong wwtp performance indicators implementation of these taxa into wwtp performance assessments is now possible using dna metabarcoding which further improves the correlations between whole microbial community structures and plant performance and operation parameters specifically the consideration of bacterial edna metabarcoding may provide new perspectives for wwtp performance assessments in addition to reliable performance assessment bacteria will also provide information about the causes of specific operating problems and corresponding management solutions cydzik kwiatkowska and zielińska 2016 eikelboom 2000 jenkins et al 2003 kunst et al 2013 leal et al 2016 mcilroy et al 2015 nielsen et al 2009 seviour and nielsen 2010 typical problems arising from malfunctioning bacterial communities include for example dispersed non settleable growth pin floc problems zoogloeal bulking and foaming polysaccharide slime bulking and foaming nitrification and denitrification problems toxicity and filamentous bulking and foaming eikelboom 2000 jenkins et al 2003 kunst et al 2013 lemmer and lind 2000 seviour and nielsen 2010 to solve such problems in a knowledge driven manner a detailed knowledge about the microbial communities in activated sludge is necessary mielczarek et al 2013 at present troubleshooting of these events is usually based on microscopic examinations of bacteria responsible for these events these include gram and neisser staining which can easily be performed by plant operators but hardly provides information on individual organisms more accurate is the identification of activated sludge bacteria using taxon specific oligonucleotide probes and epifluorescence microscopy nielsen et al 2009 however an activated sludge core microbial community may include numerous organisms that are consistently present only in low abundances these core taxa remain undetected with probes and are only accessible with modern deep sequencing strategies saunders et al 2016 furthermore fluorescence in situ hybridization with specific probes allows only the identification of a fraction of the potential indicators present in a highly diverse activated sludge bacterial community the design and availability of oligonucleotide probes depends on the availability of sequence data deposited in a bacterial taxonomic database yet only a very small fraction of bacteria present in activated sludge communities is known and deposited in public databases therefore most activated sludge bacteria of wwtps lack a taxonomic framework ma et al 2015 tang et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 2015 and also specific oligonucleotide probes in our study 4565 out of 6570 bacterial otus 69 have less than 97 sequence similarity to described and known bacteria and thus belong to species of uncertain identity and unknown function this compares well to a deep sequencing study of microbial communities in activated sludge from wwtps in asia and north america zhang et al 2012 in this study 57 of all obtained bacterial otus remained unassigned on the genus level even on family level this number was still as high as 43 ma et al 2015 failed to assign a taxonomy on genus level for up to 46 of bacterial otus from chinese wwtps even though the microbial database for activated sludge midas as an offspring of the bacterial silva database quast et al 2013 was designed to improve these assignments mcilroy et al 2015 it still contains only a small fraction of the estimated bacterial diversity in activated sludge samples environmental dna metabarcoding evades this shortcoming and allows the implementation of powerful bacterial indicators without a taxonomic framework and possibilities to identify these unknown taxa microscopically once it becomes feasible to analyze complex microbial communities with third generation sequencing technologies e g minion jain et al 2016 lu et al 2016 future strategies could also involve the use of portable devices that would allow for even more rapid on site edna metabarcoding at wwtps the implementation of edna metabarcoding of activated sludge microbiota into routine wwtp performance monitoring programs however requires further research in a first step a database will have to be established including edna metabarcodes from activated sludge microbiota plant type floc structure and physico chemical parameters as suggested previously bayerisches landesamt für wasserwirtschaft 1999 foissner 2016 this database will serve as the basis to assign wwtp performance categories to individual edna barcodes without any reference to morphotaxonomy apothéloz perret gentil et al 2017 chariton et al 2015 this suggestion differs from the basic idea of midas which considers exclusively taxa with known identities as obtained from silva one promising approach is to use supervised machine learning sml which was successfully applied to edna metabarcodes of benthic foraminifera to predict biotic indices for environmental benthic monitoring cordier et al 2017 in the sml approach the information contained in an established database will serve as a training dataset the resulting trained model can then be used to infer wwtp performance of new samples exclusively from edna metabarcodes this approach even bypasses the necessity of ascribing numerical indicator values to otus because the sml approach is able to identify non linear relationships between the abundance of otus and the variations of wwtp operating conditions and performances along with key otu association rules knights et al 2011 libbrecht and noble 2015 first data show that the sml approach is widely applicable on independent samples cordier et al 2017 knights et al 2011 libbrecht and noble 2015 since similar edna metabarcodes represent similar organisms no matter where they were sampled or what their exact taxonomic affiliation would be although sml is a largely taxonomy free approach its results can still be a starting point for more detailed analyses to reveal the identity of specific metabarcodes with high indicator qualities any sml however requires a high number of training data sets for accurate predictions therefore future efforts should focus on the collection of microbiota metabarcode datasets alongside other relevant operational and performance parameters amending the training data sets with management solutions in case of operating problems will then not only provide information on wwtp performance but also suggest management strategies for plant operators further research needs can be inferred from a previous study suggesting microbial consortia as a monitoring tool for activated sludge plant functioning castillo et al 2016 for example the inclusion of small meiofaunal organisms such as rotifers and nematodes may further strengthen the edna metabarcoding monitoring technology and the same applies to the molecular profiling of microbial communities in other compartments of the wastewater purification process such as effluent or returned sludge see fig s1 this further research will be worthwhile considering the substantial improvements wwtp performance monitoring and management can experience through the implementation of microbiota edna metabarcoding 5 conclusions environmental metabarcoding of bacterial and protistan communities is a very powerful tool for the monitoring of wwtp performance and effluent quality the rationale behind this strong correlation between microbes and wwtp efficiency is that microbes are directly linked to parameters of the incoming wastewater floc activated sludge formation and degradation of organic substances new technologies which invaded the field of microbial ecology now make these properties of microbes readily available for biomonitoring purposes furthermore the technology presented in this manuscript is cost efficient costs for sampling are excluded because they are the same for sbi si and edna monitoring costs for extraction of dna and pcr amplification of the community dna metabarcodes from one activated sludge sample run to ca 10 euro while sequencing costs per sample can be calculated with ca 50 euros calculated with 40 samples in one paired end 2x250 illumina miseq run including truseq library preparations therefore this technology is not only affordable for routine monitoring in industrial countries in addition monitoring of wwtps using microbial metabarcodes as bioindicators has the potential of a full automation which would allow an implementation of this bioindicator system in future standard monitoring programs for wwtp performance and effluent quality notes the authors declare no competing financial interests acknowledgements we greatly appreciate the support of

19368,knowledge driven management for wastewater treatment plant wwtp performance becomes increasingly important considering the globally growing production of wastewater and the rising demand of clean water supply even though the potential of microbial organisms bacteria and protists as bioindicators for wwtp performance is well known it is far from being fully exploited for routine monitoring programs therefore we here used massive sequencing of environmental e dna metabarcodes from bacterial v3 v4 region of the ssu rrna gene and eukaryote v9 region of the ssu rrna gene communities in 21 activated sludge samples obtained from full scale municipal wwtps in germany microbial community patterns were compared to standard wwtp operating parameters and two traditionally used wwtp performance indicators sludge biotic index and sludge index both indices showed low concordance and hardly correlated with chemical wwtp performance parameters nor did they correlate with microbial community structures in contrast microbial community profiles significantly correlated with wwtp performance parameters and operating conditions of the plants under study therefore edna metabarcode profiles of whole microbial communities indicate the performance of wwtp and can provide useful information for management strategies we here suggest a strategy for the development of an edna metabarcode based bioindicator system which can be implemented in future standard monitoring programs for wwtp performance and effluent quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial communities biomonitoring bioindicator environmental sequencing protistan communities waste water treatment plants 1 introduction the global annual average production of wastewater by mankind between 1995 and 2005 was ca 1400 gm3 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 purification of wastewater by wastewater treatment plants wwtps is a major prerequisite for human and environmental health globally water related diseases are responsible for the death of more than 5 million people annually malik et al 2012 regarding environmental health an estimated 44 of stream miles and 64 of lake acres in the united states are heavily polluted epa 2002 major contaminants of natural water bodies include human associated sewage templar et al 2016 heavy metals elzwayie et al 2017 persistent organic pollutants liu et al 2017 and nutrients gross and hagy 2017 consequently in recent years legislation requirements concerning the quality of wastewater discharged into the environment after purification in wwtps have become increasingly strict arévalo et al 2009 in wwtps microbial consortia in the biological reactors of activated sludge are responsible for most of the organic compound and nutrient removal from wastewater arregui et al 2012 curds 1982 cydzik kwiatkowska and zielińska 2016 foissner 2016 these microbial consortia are predominantly composed of bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes protists bacteria constitute up to ca 95 of the microbial biomass aescht and foissner 1992 jenkins et al 2003 they are the main organisms responsible for pollution reduction in activated sludge reactors including the removal of organic carbon nitrogen compounds sulfate and phosphate eikelboom 2000 leal et al 2016 filamentous bacteria play an important role for the establishment of the microbial aggregate structures flocs which is a key feature regarding sludge characteristics a shortage of filamentous bacteria may result in pinpoint floc formation or dispersed growth leading to poor sludge characteristics poor effluent quality and problems in the reactor an excess of filamentous bacteria will result in bulking or foaming causing the sludge to rise in the reactor and hindering wwtp performance fryer and gray 2012 leal et al 2016 protozoa in particular ciliates which can reach densities of more than 10 000 cells ml 1 of activated sludge accounting for 9 of suspended solids in mixed liquor signorile et al 2010 function as consumers they feed on bacteria and are the key factor for the reduction of suspended solids and turbidity in the final effluent al shahwani and horan 1991 curds 1982 furthermore ciliates reduce the number of coliform bacteria in the effluent reducing health risks after discharge of the effluent into the environment curds 1983 templar et al 2016 in addition through the secretion of substances with flocculating properties and through grazing of bacteria on floc surfaces ciliates contribute to the process of sludge flocculation güde 1979 klausen et al 2004 luxmy et al 2000 wilén et al 2008 accordingly bacteria and ciliates are the backbone for the monitoring of wwtp performance to ascertain the discharge of a clean effluent into the environment and an optimal sewage depuration castillo et al 2016 other microbial eukaryotes than ciliates are also known to have indicator qualities e g diatoms chrysophytes rhizaria adam and mahood 1981 qin et al 2016 vilmi et al 2015 wang and chappell 2001 yet they are largely ignored in biological wwtp performance surveys several studies have demonstrated the correlation of specific microbial taxa and wwtp performance parameters araújo dos santos et al 2014 curds 1982 cydzik kwiatkowska and zielińska 2016 fryer and gray 2012 castillo et al 2016 the main reason why microbial diversity is neglected in routine wwtp monitoring and standard performance indices such as the sludge biotic index sbi madoni 1994 and the sludge index si arregui et al 2012 is the difficulty of accurate microbial species identification thus due to a taxonomic impediment the potential of numerous microbes as bioindicators is far from being exploited in routine wwtp performance monitoring ettl 1997 2008 foissner 2016 to countervail this taxonomic impediment and to make the properties of microbes as bioindicators better available for routine monitoring biological identifications through dna barcodes have been introduced pawlowski et al 2012 stoeck et al 2013 dna metabarcoding uses short standardized gene regions obtained from environmental samples i e environmental e dna metabarcoding as internal species tags to provide rapid identifications taberlet et al 2012 valentini et al 2016 this technique has the potential to increase accuracy resolution and speed in environmental monitoring aylagas et al 2014 bourlat et al 2013 ji et al 2013 lallias et al 2015 pawlowski et al 2016 thomsen and willerslev 2015 valentini et al 2016 it also allows to include bacteria as bioindicators aylagas et al 2017 most of which can morphologically hardly be diagnosed in this study we tested the potential of edna metabarcoding of eukaryote and bacterial communities from 21 activated sludge samples for wwtp performance monitoring therefore we compared the molecular community profiles of bacteria and microbial eukaryotes with operating and performance parameters of the plants furthermore we related the molecular microbial community profiles to two traditionally used reference wwtp performance indices the sludge biotic index and the sludge index calculated from the same samples 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling between november 2016 and march 2017 21 samples 5 l of activated sludge from aeration tanks where microbial communities degrade wastewater contaminants and form activated sludge flocs were collected from seven different wastewater treatment plants wwtps in rhineland palatinate germany some wwtps under study had two or three aeration tanks in parallel operation and in this case we sampled all of the different aeration tanks of these plants for an overview of the plants sampled sampling dates and for sample abbreviations we refer to table s1 fig s1 depicts the process steps of the wwtp type analyzed in this study and the process step from which samples are taken at each plant is marked cooled samples were transported in sterile polyethylene canisters with hermetic lids to

operators and are presented in table s2 2 2 sludge biotic index and sludge index sbi and si as benchmark indices for comparisons with dna metabarcoding data were obtained according to madoni 1994 and arregui et al 2012 respectively sbi calculation is based on the occurrence and abundance of few functional key groups of microfauna inlcuding sessile crawling and swimming ciliates small swimming flagellates testate amoebae and the ciliate taxa opercularia spp and vorticella microstoma as bioindicators si is based on several macroscopical characters turbidity suspended flocs and decantability characterized as high medium or low and odor classified as correct or incorrect and microscopical parameters floc structure size cover and texture number of protist species and number of filamentous bacteria within and outside flocs the sbi classifies the performance of wwtps as follows sbi 10 8 refers to class i very well colonized and stable sludge excellent biological activity very good performance sbi 7 6 indicates class ii well colonized and stable sludge biological activity on decrease good performance sbi 5 4 refers to class iii insufficient biological depuration in the aeration

excellent 89 80 good 79 40 mediocre 39 20 bad and 19 0 very bad arregui et al 2012 samples were analyzed for these indices within 4 h after sampling species were identified after foissner et al 1991 1992 1994 1995 and eikelboom 2000 floc characterization followed eikelboom 2000 and arregui et al 2012 flagellates were quantified after madoni 1994 using a fuchs rosenthal chamber gram staining and neisser staining for the standard diagnostic of filamentous bacteria in activated sludge followed kunst et al 2013 2 3 dna metabarcoding dna was extracted using the dneasy powermax soil kit qiagen

bacterial v3 v4 metabarcodes 2x250 bp paired end reads and on an illumina nextseq platform eukaryote v9 metabarcodes 1x150 bp reads at seq it kaiserslautern germany the sequence data were deposited at the sequence read archive of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi and are available under accession number srp131489 2 4 sequence data processing and taxonomic assignment sequences were processed as described in detail previously filker et al 2016 raw paired end 16s rdna v3 v4 and single 18s rdna v9 illumina reads were quality filtered using the split libraries py script implemented in qiime v 1 8 0 caporaso et al 2010 non chimeric reads were clustered with swarm v 2 0 5 mahé et al 2015 using d 1 swarm uses a local clustering threshold d instead of an arbitrary global clustering threshold and does not depend on the input order operational taxonomic units otus grow iteratively by comparing each generation of assigned amplicons to the remaining amplicons in the dataset an otu is closed when no new amplicon with d or fewer differences can be assigned to the otu using a custom script an otu contingency table was created based on the output files of swarm representative sequences i e the most abundant sequence from each otu were extracted and analyzed with blastn altschul et al 1990 against the pr2 reference database guillou et al 2012 for 18s rdna v9 amplicons and against genbank s nucleotide database version 216 for 16s rdna v3 v4 amplicons the taxonomic information and the otu contingency tables were merged using a custom script otus not assigned to microbial eukaryotes in case of the 18s rdna v9 otu table and otus not assigned to the domain eubacteria in case of the 16s rdna v3 v4 otu table as well as singletons in both otu tables were excluded from further analyses the latter refers to amplicons which occurred only once and exclusively in one sample bokulich et al 2013 finding a high proportion of singletons is not uncommon since the swarm algorithm uses a very stringent threshold of 1 bp local alignment difference for its single linkage clustering clare et al 2016 the two resulting otu tables were used as a basis for all downstream analyses 2 5 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted in r v 3 2 4 using the program packages vegan oksanen et al 2007 and hmisc harrell jr and dupont 2016 as well as ggplot2 wickham 2016 for graphical representations correlations between wwtp performance indices sbi and si and wastewater performance parameters were calculated with spearman s rank correlation coefficient the bray curtis bc index was used as a measure of similarity between each sampled microbial community using the otu tables as input prior to beta diversity estimation the number of sequences per sample was rarefied to the smallest sample size bc similarity values were transformed to distance matrixes for a nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis all operating and performance parameters table s2 as wells as both indices si and sbi were fitted to the ordination using the envfit function of the vegan package in r the fit r2 of each variable to the ordination and the significance of each fit was assessed with a monte carlo analysis of 1000 permutations 3 results 3 1 sbi and si the sbi ranged from 4 to 10 and the si varied between 49 and 84 fig 1 the sbi classified the performance of 15 reactors as very good 5 reactors as good and one reactor as mediocre in contrast the si classified the performance of one reactor as very good 5 reactors as good and 15 reactors as mediocre fig 1 spearman rank correlations were insignificant for both sbi and si with most standard chemical performance parameters total nitrogen removal efficiency total phosphorous removal efficiency cod and bod as well as with sludge parameters svi and mlss with the sole exception of si correlating significantly with bod mlss table s3 3 2 sequence data overview an overview of the sequence data is presented in table s4 we obtained between 60 049 and 299 464 high quality eukaryotic and between 7643 and 23 364 high quality bacterial amplicons the microbial eukaryote amplicons grouped into 1809 to 5655 otus the bacterial amplicons grouped into 1526 to 3193 otus it is noteworthy that we discarded 59 of all obtained high quality bacterial sequences because they resulted in otus which were represented only by one individual amplicon and occurred only at one individual sampling site singletons 3 3 taxonomic assignments of edna metabarcodes in the eukaryotes alveolates and stramenopiles accounted for the vast majority of the observed diversity in all samples fig 2 on average alveolates contributed 39 sd 5 1 n 21 to the overall diversity and stramenopiles to 28 sd 4 n 21 amoebae excavata and rhizaria are further groups with a noteworthy diversity their relative contributions to the eukaryotic communities were highly similar in all samples other taxon groups including fungi and metazoa were relatively little diverse in all samples among the alveolates ciliates were by far the most diverse accounting on average for 96 4 sd 1 n 21 of the diversity fig s2 ciliates could be assigned to 28 different orders the vast majority of ciliate otus belonged to the five orders cyrtophoria euplotida sessilida suctoria and pleurostomatida otus assigned to these orders accounted on average for 88 of all ciliate otus sd 2 5 n 21 among the stramenopiles chrysophytes were by far the most diverse taxon group accounting on average for 89 of the stramenopiles diversity sd 3 4 n 21 interestingly nearly all chrysophyte otus 98 7 on average sd 0 6 n 21 were assigned to one single taxon group chrysophyte clade f in the bacteria proteobacteria verrucomicrobia and bacteroidetes were by far the most abundant taxon groups in all samples accounting for ca 95 of the otu diversity in all plants under study fig 3 within proteobacteria rhodocyclales sulfuricellales and burkholderiales all belonging to the class betaproteobacteria as well as pseudomonadales gammaproteobacteria were the four dominant orders in all samples fig s3 bacteroidetes were largely dominated by flavobacteriaceae in all plants followed by saprospiraceae and unknown bacteria which were distantly related to a symbiont detected in truffles fig s4 within the verrucomicrobia the dominant family was verrucomicrobiaceae fig s5 3 4 diversity partitioning nmds analyses revealed clear differences between the activated sludge eukaryote communities since data points of distinct wwtps were spatially separated in the nmds plot stress 0 15 fig 4 thus eukaryote communities had a high resolution power to distinguish the different activated sludge samples from each other communities from the same plant i e bmb hsp kl hl were more similar to each other than to the ones of other plants this can be inferred from smaller distances between the respective data points in the plot yet temporal variations in eukaryote communities of plants which were sampled at least twice were also evident for example eukaryote communities analyzed in the three different reactors of plant kl kl r1 kl r2 kl r3 in january clustered closer to one another than to communities of the same reactors sampled in march the vectors in the plot represent those parameters for which the environmental fitting resulted in significant correlations between the parameters and the microbial communities for results of all variables see table s5 the stronger the fit of a variable the longer its respective vector vector directions indicate the ordination space towards which the environmental vectors change most rapidly and to which they have maximal correlations with the ordination oksanen et al 2007

showed low concordance among the 21 activated sludge samples under study while the sbi testified a very good wwtp performance for 15 plants the si confirmed this result for only one of these plants plant tr while seven of the plants were characterized with a mediocre performance only more importantly none of these two indices of wwtp performance correlated significantly with standard performance parameters except for si correlating with bod mlss thus neither sbi nor si adequately informed about the waste water purification efficiency of the wwtps under study the sbi is based on functional key groups and the relative abundances of the indicator organisms belonging to these groups madoni 1994 even though some authors reported a satisfactorily correspondence between sbi and wwtp performance parameters e g leal et al 2016 pedrazzani et al 2016 zhou et al 2008 numerous studies failed to establish an association between the sbi wastewater treatment performance parameters and effluent quality arévalo et al 2009b arregui et al 2012 drzewicki and kulikowska 2011 nicolau et al 2005 papadimitriou et al 2005 samaras et al 2009 this frequent inability of the sbi to assess the effluent quality in activated sludge processes correctly may be attributed primarily to the fact that the sbi is based on large functional groups swimming ciliates attached ciliates crawling ciliates but also the categories thecate amoebae and small flagellates rather than individual species with significant indicator qualities one advantage of this idea is that the sbi is very easy to apply by plant operators on a daily basis in routine monitoring it hardly requires taxonomic expertise and with two exceptions vorticella microstoma and opercularia spp the sbi can be inferred without any species identifications however lumping together a plethora of different species with the same life style or feeding strategy into one individual indicator category is a very simplified view which does not consider the autecology of individual species therefore it is not surprising that other authors also did not succeed to significantly link such functional group categories to performance and operating parameters of a full scale municipal wwtp hu et al 2013 nearly 200 ciliate species have been illustrated in activated sludge curds et al 2008 foissner et al 1995 1994 1991 foissner and berger 2011 1992 seviour and nielsen 2010 of these a large proportion are free swimming ciliates which have distinct habitat preferences for example trimyema spp are strict anaerobes tolerating high levels of hydrogen sulfide and feeding mostly on sulphur bacteria other free swimming ciliates such as acineria uncinata and cinetochilum margaritaceum are indicators of sufficient oxygen supply in the activated sludge process and of a healthy activated sludge foissner and berger 2011 the free swimming enchelyomorpha vermicularis indicates an overloaded and oxygen deficient sludge foissner and berger 2011 moreover even different ciliate species of the same genus indicate different wwtp performance levels for example different species of the suctorian ciliate genus acineta commonly found in activated sludge indicate different saprobity levels foissner and berger 2011 and different bod conditions curds and cockburn 1970 finally different ciliate species such as acineria uncinata may indicate different wwtp performance levels depending on their associations with other members of the ciliate community arregui et al 2013 drzewicki and kulikowska 2011 these examples demonstrate that the ciliate community structures in wwtps are much too complex to categorize them into life style categories for bioindication in acknowledgement of these species specific indicator qualities the author team of a widely used identification book in wwtp monitoring practice bayerisches landesamt für wasserwirtschaft 1999 is currently working on a revision of this book with a more differentiated view of species properties m ettl co author of bayerisches landesamt für wasserwirtschaft 1999 personal communication nevertheless even though functional protistan groups are no reliable bioindicator for wwtp performance castillo et al 2016 successfully applied functional groups as a diagnostic tool to establish stable operating conditions after startup of a municipal wwtp in mexico this approach however was only successful because the authors did not rely entirely on functional protistan groups but also considered meiofauna as a bioindicator group as well as different gram type bacteria arregui et al 2012 proposed the si as a more reliable and robust alternative to the sbi in contrast to the sbi the si takes into account the total number of species as the only protist based numeric value of this index in the si the occurrence of more than seven protist species is considered as very good and of less than four species as very bad considering the different ecological indicator qualities of different species for a few examples see above this approach seems very questionable the second biological component in this index is the number of filamentous bacteria within and outside of flocs as in the case with protists this provides only very limited information because species identities are not considered this however is very critical because the diversity of filamentous bacteria is immense and so are their ecophysiological properties and their effects on plant operation reviewed by nielsen et al 2009 thus depending on the community structure of excessively growing filamentous bacteria the problems in wwtp operations and also the resulting management processes are different jenkins et al 2003 kunst et al 2013 other parameters describe the sensory qualities of the sludge and the physical floc structures our results are in line with those of previous studies showing that the microbial community composition in activated sludge may notably affect the floc structures yet without compromising the effluent quality and thus the wwtp operating performance lee and welander 1996 luxmy et al 2000 ratsak 2001 rensink and rulkens 1997 this is not unexpected because changes in operational parameters of wwtps are immediately revealed by modifications of microbial community structures cydzik kwiatkowska and zielińska 2016 martín cereceda et al 1996 salvado et al 1995 before they eventually become evident in floc structures 4 2 edna metabarcodes of activated sludge microfauna as wwtp performance indicator several authors suggested to abandon single numerical indicators such as sbi and si entirely for wwtp efficiency assessments bayerisches landesamt für wasserwirtschaft 1999 foissner 2016 instead these authors proposed a polyphasic approach which considers a combination of species identities of protists and bacteria plant type floc structure and physico chemical parameters indeed this approach would be most informative yet hardly feasible for frequent and routine standard monitoring of wwtps however the results presented in this study pave the way for the development of a wwtp performance assessment approach under consideration of these parameters the activated sludge core microbial communities bacteria and microbial eukaryotes of all plants under study were highly similar to each other on higher taxonomic levels and corroborated well with the typically reported patterns in full scale municipal wwtps arregui et al 2010 cydzik kwiatkowska and zielińska 2016 foissner 2016 isazadeh et al 2016 madoni 2011 madoni and ghetti 1981 tang et al 2016 based on a similar finding for bacterial communities of thirteen danish wwtps saunders et al 2016 proposed that the microbial diversity within sewers may be similar across the world because these diversity patterns and the known functional roles of the core taxa in wwtps are well described see e g references mentioned above we here refrain from repeating these discussions however at a higher taxonomic resolution on molecular otu level the edna metabarcode profiles of microbial communities were unique fingerprints of the 21 different sludge samples under study the mechanisms driving the assembly of the core microbial communities were not investigated as this was not the subject of this study in our statistical analyses we could show that the more similar the performance parameters of different plants the more similar the community profiles of the corresponding microbial communities because community patterns correlated significantly with a number of operating parameters we conclude that edna metabarcode profiles of whole microbial communities are more reliable and stronger indicators for wwtp performance than both si and sbi these community profiles consider unique metabarcodes of individual organisms rather than life style categories such as sessile crawling swimming as well as their abundance distributions also this approach allows the implementation of all eukaryotic taxon groups in wwtp performance assessments in the past a strong focus was primarily on ciliates as biological indicators curds 1965 1982 curds and cockburn 1970 eikelboom 2000 foissner 2016 lee and welander 1996 lee et al 2004 madoni 2011 madoni and ghetti 1981 while other potential indicator taxon groups were largely ignored the major reason is probably the comparatively solid morphotaxonomic framework for these large protists and the possibility to identify at least some ciliates with standard microscopy techniques however also many other eukaryotes are known as biological indicators including for example diatoms vilmi et al 2015 and chrysophytes adam and mahood 1981 all of which however are more difficult to identify under the microscope than some wwtp relevant ciliates the diversity of these other potential wwtp performance indicators is high in activated sludge samples see fig 2 and it is reasonable to assume that also among these taxon groups we find strong wwtp performance indicators implementation of these taxa into wwtp performance assessments is now possible using dna metabarcoding which further improves the correlations between whole microbial community structures and plant performance and operation parameters specifically the consideration of bacterial edna metabarcoding may provide new perspectives for wwtp performance assessments in addition to reliable performance assessment bacteria will also provide information about the causes of specific operating problems and corresponding management solutions cydzik kwiatkowska and zielińska 2016 eikelboom 2000 jenkins et al 2003 kunst et al 2013 leal et al 2016 mcilroy et al 2015 nielsen et al 2009 seviour and nielsen 2010 typical problems arising from malfunctioning bacterial communities include for example dispersed non settleable growth pin floc problems zoogloeal bulking and foaming polysaccharide slime bulking and foaming nitrification and denitrification problems toxicity and filamentous bulking and foaming eikelboom 2000 jenkins et al 2003 kunst et al 2013 lemmer and lind 2000 seviour and nielsen 2010 to solve such problems in a knowledge driven manner a detailed knowledge about the microbial communities in activated sludge is necessary mielczarek et al 2013 at present troubleshooting of these events is usually based on microscopic examinations of bacteria responsible for these events these include gram and neisser staining which can easily be performed by plant operators but hardly provides information on individual organisms more accurate is the identification of activated sludge bacteria using taxon specific oligonucleotide probes and epifluorescence microscopy nielsen et al 2009 however an activated sludge core microbial community may include numerous organisms that are consistently present only in low abundances these core taxa remain undetected with probes and are only accessible with modern deep sequencing strategies saunders et al 2016 furthermore fluorescence in situ hybridization with specific probes allows only the identification of a fraction of the potential indicators present in a highly diverse activated sludge bacterial community the design and availability of oligonucleotide probes depends on the availability of sequence data deposited in a bacterial taxonomic database yet only a very small fraction of bacteria present in activated sludge communities is known and deposited in public databases therefore most activated sludge bacteria of wwtps lack a taxonomic framework ma et al 2015 tang et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 2015 and also specific oligonucleotide probes in our study 4565 out of 6570 bacterial otus 69 have less than 97 sequence similarity to described and known bacteria and thus belong to species of uncertain identity and unknown function this compares well to a deep sequencing study of microbial communities in activated sludge from wwtps in asia and north america zhang et al 2012 in this study 57 of all obtained bacterial otus remained unassigned on the genus level even on family level this number was still as high as 43 ma et al 2015 failed to assign a taxonomy on genus level for up to 46 of bacterial otus from chinese wwtps even though the microbial database for activated sludge midas as an offspring of the bacterial silva database quast et al 2013 was designed to improve these assignments mcilroy et al 2015 it still contains only a small fraction of the estimated bacterial diversity in activated sludge samples environmental dna metabarcoding evades this shortcoming and allows the implementation of powerful bacterial indicators without a taxonomic framework and possibilities to identify these unknown taxa microscopically once it becomes feasible to analyze complex microbial communities with third generation sequencing technologies e g minion jain et al 2016 lu et al 2016 future strategies could also involve the use of portable devices that would allow for even more rapid on site edna metabarcoding at wwtps the implementation of edna metabarcoding of activated sludge microbiota into routine wwtp performance monitoring programs however requires further research in a first step a database will have to be established including edna metabarcodes from activated sludge microbiota plant type floc structure and physico chemical parameters as suggested previously bayerisches landesamt für wasserwirtschaft 1999 foissner 2016 this database will serve as the basis to assign wwtp performance categories to individual edna barcodes without any reference to morphotaxonomy apothéloz perret gentil et al 2017 chariton et al 2015 this suggestion differs from the basic idea of midas which considers exclusively taxa with known identities as obtained from silva one promising approach is to use supervised machine learning sml which was successfully applied to edna metabarcodes of benthic foraminifera to predict biotic indices for environmental benthic monitoring cordier et al 2017 in the sml approach the information contained in an established database will serve as a training dataset the resulting trained model can then be used to infer wwtp performance of new samples exclusively from edna metabarcodes this approach even bypasses the necessity of ascribing numerical indicator values to otus because the sml approach is able to identify non linear relationships between the abundance of otus and the variations of wwtp operating conditions and performances along with key otu association rules knights et al 2011 libbrecht and noble 2015 first data show that the sml approach is widely applicable on independent samples cordier et al 2017 knights et al 2011 libbrecht and noble 2015 since similar edna metabarcodes represent similar organisms no matter where they were sampled or what their exact taxonomic affiliation would be although sml is a largely taxonomy free approach its results can still be a starting point for more detailed analyses to reveal the identity of specific metabarcodes with high indicator qualities any sml however requires a high number of training data sets for accurate predictions therefore future efforts should focus on the collection of microbiota metabarcode datasets alongside other relevant operational and performance parameters amending the training data sets with management solutions in case of operating problems will then not only provide information on wwtp performance but also suggest management strategies for plant operators further research needs can be inferred from a previous study suggesting microbial consortia as a monitoring tool for activated sludge plant functioning castillo et al 2016 for example the inclusion of small meiofaunal organisms such as rotifers and nematodes may further strengthen the edna metabarcoding monitoring technology and the same applies to the molecular profiling of microbial communities in other compartments of the wastewater purification process such as effluent or returned sludge see fig s1 this further research will be worthwhile considering the substantial improvements wwtp performance monitoring and management can experience through the implementation of microbiota edna metabarcoding 5 conclusions environmental metabarcoding of bacterial and protistan communities is a very powerful tool for the monitoring of wwtp performance and effluent quality the rationale behind this strong correlation between microbes and wwtp efficiency is that microbes are directly linked to parameters of the incoming wastewater floc activated sludge formation and degradation of organic substances new technologies which invaded the field of microbial ecology now make these properties of microbes readily available for biomonitoring purposes furthermore the technology presented in this manuscript is cost efficient costs for sampling are excluded because they are the same for sbi si and edna monitoring costs for extraction of dna and pcr amplification of the community dna metabarcodes from one activated sludge sample run to ca 10 euro while sequencing costs per sample can be calculated with ca 50 euros calculated with 40 samples in one paired end 2x250 illumina miseq run including truseq library preparations therefore this technology is not only affordable for routine monitoring in industrial countries in addition monitoring of wwtps using microbial metabarcodes as bioindicators has the potential of a full automation which would allow an implementation of this bioindicator system in future standard monitoring programs for wwtp performance and effluent quality notes the authors declare no competing financial interests acknowledgements we greatly appreciate the support of

19369,anaerobic oxidation of methane aom is a microbial process that consumes dissolved methane ch4 in anoxic sediments and soils and mitigates ch4 release to the atmosphere the degree to which aom limits global biospheric ch4 emissions is not fully understood in marine sediments where the process was first described aom is responsible for oxidizing 90 of the ch4 produced more recently aom has been observed in soils peatlands and freshwater ecosystems in lakes where sediment anoxia organic carbon turnover and ch4 production are common aom is not well studied but could represent a significant ch4 sink and constraint on emissions here we present evidence for the occurrence of aom in the sediment of thirteen lakes that span a global climatic and trophic gradient we further quantified and modeled aom patterns and studied potential microbial controls of aom using laboratory incubations of sediment and stable isotope measurements in three of the thirteen lakes we demonstrate that aom is widespread in freshwater lake sediments and accounts for 29 34 95 confidence interval of the mean total ch4 produced in surface and near surface lake sediments graphical

approximately 13 of global atmospheric methane ch4 emissions saunois et al 2016 despite representing only 3 7 of global land cover verpoorter et al 2014 previous laboratory incubation studies have identified aom rates in lake sediments ranging from 0 01 to 100 nmol cm 3 d 1 deutzmann and schink 2011 deutzmann et al 2014 nordi et al 2013 sivan et al 2011 zehnder and brock 1980 fig 1 a or up to

al 2013 schulz et al 1997 zehnder and brock 1980 fig 1b aom in lakes might therefore represent an important constraint on global greenhouse gas emissions however the relative importance of the process among varying lake ecosystems and the specific mechanisms involved have not been determined studies using amended incubations beal et al 2009 deutzmann and schink 2011 deutzmann et al 2014 segarra et

valenzuela et al 2017 nevertheless many of these electron acceptors such as so4 2 and no2 no3 are lacking in many freshwater lake sediments or have background concentrations too low for the process to be thermodynamically favorable alperin and reeburgh 1984 smemo and yavitt 2007 we conducted a meta analysis of results from previous reports and found no significant difference in aom rates aomr

be active in anoxic zones of the water column and in sediments of lakes oswald et al 2016 martinez cruz et al 2017 challenging the dogmatic strictly aerobic view of mob chistoserdova 2015 kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 here we studied the occurrence and ubiquity of aom across a global gradient of lake types and conducted an in depth study of aom magnitude and mechanisms in sediments from three lakes two alaskan and one german aom activity and specific mechanisms were addressed using physical and chemical characterization of sediments development of a diffusion reaction model and qpcr for known methanotrophs our results indicate that aom in lake sediments is a globally widespread process that could significantly constrain atmopheric ch4 emissions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental protocol we demonstrated aom activity across a climatic trophic and physicochemical gradient of 14 tropical temperate and arctic lakes table s1 using incubations of surface sediments then a detailed ch4 cycling study was done in 25 cm deep sediment cores from three of the study lakes where aom was identified these incubation experiments included determination of dissolved ions previously

co2 concentrations and measurements of 13δc for both gases the results were then validated with a diffusion reaction mathematical model that predicts the dissolved ch4 profile along the 25 cm sediment cores based on the measured aom and ch4 production rates the experimental approach is illustrated in detail in fig s1 2 2 sample collection in each of our 14 study lakes table s1 we collected two

methanotrophic vials whereas aomrs were calculated from the linear decrease in 13ch4 concentration over time as with aom incubations the aomr was conservatively estimated and the 12c ch4 being produced by methanogenesis and then oxidized was assumed to be unimportant 2 5 diffusion reaction model the results obtained from incubations and the dissolved ch4 concentrations were used to feed a diffusion reaction mathematical model we used a previously described standard diffusion reaction model chuang et al 2016 trolle et al 2010 to illustrate biogeochemical sediment profiles eq 2 where c

fresh sediment 2 7 statistical analysis statistical analyses were carried out on the aomr nmpr and gene copy number for the vault and doughnut lake samples for all data normality was assessed by the shapiro wilk test as most of the data was non normally distributed significant differences among variables were determined using the mann whitney u mwu comparison test p 0 05 when comparing only two variables and the kruskal wallis kw multiple comparison test p 0 05 when comparing more than two variables all statistical analyses and linear regressions were conducted using the ncss 11 statistical analysis system software number cruncher statistical systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 incubation tests all 14 lakes showed either low dissolved oxygen 1 5 mg l 1 or anoxic conditions at the bottom of the water column suggesting anoxia in the surface lake sediments the aom activity from the 14 selected lakes identified by measuring labeled carbon dioxide 13co2 production was significantly higher than that for the sterile controls in all but one temperate lake 7 table s1 this provides evidence for widespread aom in lake sediments independent of lake trophic status or climate regime and suggests either a range of potential electron acceptors or a single ubiquitous electron acceptor not linked to lake productivity and nutrient dynamics our detailed investigation of aom across vertical sediment profiles of three lakes doughnut oligotrophic arctic vault dystrophic thermokarstic arctic and dagow eutrophic temperate lakes demonstrated significant aom and ch4 production in all three lakes at all sediment depths fig 2 the aomr determined from 13ch4 uptake ranged from 3 30 0 36 nmol cm 3 d 1 at the bottom 20 25 cm of the doughnut lake core to 16 30 1 38 nmol cm 3 d 1 at the top 0 2 5 cm of the vault lake core aomr for all three lakes and at all depths ranged from 0 6 to 20 9 nmol cm 3 d 1 with a median of 7 8 nmol cm 3 d 1 these values are similar to the range of aomr in lake sediments previously reported in other studies with or without electron acceptor amendments fig 1a 0 180 0 nmol cm 3 d 1 amended and 0 43 0 nmol cm 3 d 1 unamended although those studies had a lower median of 3 5 nmol cm 3 d 1 fig 1a the nmpr which corresponds to the gross ch4 production rate minus aomr ranged from 1 10 0 26 at the bottom 20 25 cm of the vault lake core to 83 18 11 85 nmol cm 3 d 1 at the top 0 2 5 cm of dagow lake core fig 2 in the sediments of dagow lake which had the highest trophic index and greater doc table s3 both nmpr and aomr were significantly higher p 0 05 than those observed in the other two lakes this supports previous studies that showed that microbial communities can efficiently use a broader range of substrates in lake sediments with higher carbon availability and trophic index torres et al 2011 thereby fueling ch4 production casper 1992 and enhancing ch4 cycling blazewicz et al 2012 however dagow lake sediments were incubated at higher temperature 8 c than alaska lake sediments 4 which is also known to enhance methanogenesis especially in eutrophic lakes sepulveda jauregui et al 2018 the percentage of gross ch4 production oxidized anaerobically ranged from 12 in the bottom of the doughnut lake core to 87 in the bottom of the vault lake core fig 2 the average oxidation percentage in the sediment cores of the three lakes was 35 26 n 18 with a 95 confidence interval of 30 41 our study was limited to three lakes and did not consider temporal variation or seasonal differences which a full budget approach would require however from the meta analysis presented in fig 1 a balance between aomr from unamended incubations and ch4 production rates previously reported gives a percentage of oxidation value that is relatively close i e ranging from 0 to 48 with a median of 18 which is within the lower range in our experiments altogether our results combined with literature data n 93 give a percent of gross methane production oxidized in surface lake sediments a reduction in potential methane emissions of 29 34 95 confidence interval which reinforce suggestions that aom in lake sediments is an important constraint on the ch4 release from lake sediments this result implies that in the littoral region of lakes or shallow lakes where ebullition is relatively more important and ch4 bubbles can evade aerobic methanotrophy natchimuthu et al 2016 aom could be the primary constraint on the ch4 release from lake sediments in our three primary study lakes the highest nmpr and aomr were observed in the top core sections whereas the percentage of ch4 oxidized by aom was the highest in the top section of doughnut lake and in the deeper sections of vault and dagow lakes therefore in vault and dagow lakes the high aomr observed in the top section of the cores was offset by high ch4 production resulting in relatively low ch4 oxidation percentages the pattern of greater nmpr in the upper sediment layer of vault and dagow lakes is similar to results reported by heslop et al 2015 where the ch4 production rate was greatest in surface sediments of vault lake doughnut lake did not show the same trend as relatively high nmpr was still observed in the deepest core section the relatively high nmpr we observed coincided with lower doc concentrations compared to those in vault and dagow lakes table s3 ch4 production in freshwater sediments is often limited by the availability of labile organic matter hoyos santillan et al 2016 sobek et al 2012 which represents only a fraction of total doc it is possible that the labile fraction of doc was significantly greater in doughnut lake than in the other lakes despite no observed differences in sediment loi across sites table s3 3 2 diffusion reaction model to assess how our observed potential rates matched prevailing sediment conditions the production oxidation rates presented in fig 2 were used as inputs in a diffusion reaction model eq 2 the model predicted dissolved ch4 concentration in the cores which could in turn be compared to experimental data the modeled dissolved ch4 concentration matched well with the field data fig 3 indicating that rates determined from laboratory incubations corresponded to those present in sediments we interpret this as further support for our findings that lake sediment aom is an important constraint on global greenhouse gas emissions best fittings were obtained with effective diffusion coefficients of 4 5 10 5 6 5 10 5 and 9 0 10 5 cm2 s 1 for vault doughnut and dagow lakes respectively these effective diffusion coefficients are about one order above previously reported values iversen and jorgensen 1993 gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 but as indicated by flury et al 2015 the presence of minor amounts of gas can increase the diffusion of gases by several orders of magnitude likewise bioturbation impacts of benthic animals may also increase gas transport within sediments significantly baranov et al 2016 3 3 isotopic signatures the isotopic signatures of ch4 and co2 along the sediment cores are shown in fig 4 the lowest δ13c ch4 values were observed at depths greater than 5 cm in the sediment cores with minimum depleted values of 66 7 61 4 and 61 3 for doughnut vault and dagow lakes respectively these values are consistent with isotopic signatures previously reported for lake sediments e g conrad et al 2009 whiticar 1999 indicating microbial ch4 production the highest δ13c ch4 values 36 9 49 8 and 59 7 for doughnut vault and dagow lakes respectively which were all measured in the first 2 5 cm of the sediment cores doughnut and vault lake isotopic signatures may indicate a13c enrichment due to ch4 oxidation in the upper sediment layers as previously reported schubert et al 2011 indeed in doughnut and vault lakes the enriched carbon 13c ch4 observed in the top section can be explained by the higher observed aomr fig 2 whereas in dagow lake the relatively small difference in the isotopic signatures 2 along the sediment core may be driven by the relatively uniform aomr profile fig 2 in doughnut lake we observed a correlation between dissolved ch4 concentration and δ13c ch4 fig s2 a relationship that has been previously reported as evidence of ch4 oxidation grant and whiticar 2002 this correlation was not observed in vault and dagow lakes which suggests different carbon cycling processes among the lake cores in vault lake ch4 bubbles released from the base of the thaw bulb 5 m below the sediment surface and those collected at the lake surface had an isotopic value of 72 7 4 3 n 4 δ13c ch4 presence of this relatively depleted ch4 suggests that ebullition of bubbles originating from greater depths in thaw bulbs are less influenced by aom than by ch4 produced in surface sediments the δ13c co2 profiles in the sediment cores of the three studied lakes exhibited a distinguishable symmetry between δ13c ch4 and δ13c co2 with relatively light co2 combined with heavy ch4 in the uppermost sediments which has been suggested as evidence for aom schubert et al 2011 segarra et al 2015 the δ13c co2 profiles agree with co2 production by acetoclastic methanogenesis or aom in the upper sections of the sediments and co2 reduction potentially by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in deeper sediment layers conrad et al 2009 the isotopic evidence together with the dissolved gases indicate very active ch4 cycling along the 25 cm of sediment cores of the three studied lakes with possibly higher aom activity in the top sediment layers the aom incubation tests and the diffusion reaction model have confirmed the latter 3 4 potential electron acceptors to identify aom electron acceptors we analyzed each subsection of the three cores for dissolved no2 no3 and so4 2 and total fe and mn concentrations the mean concentration of no3 in the lake sediment ranged from 1 4 to 10 5 μmol l 1 fig 5 whereas the concentration of no2 was 1 5 μmol l 1 these concentrations were below or at the lower range of concentrations reported in sediments where aom is coupled to denitrification deutzmann et al 2014 ettwig et al 2009 and we observed no correlation between dissolved ch4 and no3 or no2 concentration aom linked to denitrification in any part of our study is therefore unlikely total fe and mn were detected in lake sediments at concentrations ranging from 176 to 872 μmol gdw 1 and from 4 1 to 24 5 μmol l 1 respectively fig 5 although the oxidation state of neither element was quantified and we cannot evaluate their particular role in aom we also cannot exclude their role as aom electron acceptors in these lake systems dissolved so4 2 concentrations in the three lake sediments ranged from 0 3 to 36 9 μmol l 1 fig 5 with the smallest concentrations observed in dagow lake and the greatest in vault lake weber et al 2017 demonstrated aom coupled to so4 2 reduction at so4 2 levels below 100 μmol l 1 suggesting so4 2 was a potential electron acceptor in our study lakes however contrary to previous studies that have implicated so4 2 as the aom electron acceptor beal et al 2011 schubert et al 2011 we observed no negative relationship between so4 2 and dissolved ch4 concentrations for vault and doughnut lakes fig 5a and b the so4 2 concentration in dagow lake did illustrate a negative relationship fig 5c nevertheless the so4 2 concentration reached values below 1 μmol l 1 an insufficient amount of so4 2 to account for the observed aom activity overall our electron acceptor investigation was inconclusive previous studies have demonstrated complex interactions between metals and so4 2 or humic substances that might serve as electron acceptors egger et al 2015 he et al 2018 nordi et al 2013 sivan et al 2011 smemo and yavitt 2007 valenzuela et al 2017 it is possible that a combination of electron acceptors and pathways could be naturally occurring in our study lakes and explain why we found no correlation between aomr and lake trophic state or climate in our broader 14 lake study 3 5 potential aerobic methanotrophy sediment samples also were tested for potential aerobic methanotrophy in vials flushed with synthetic air and spiked with ch4 the aerobic methanotrophic potential amp ranged from 123 2 nmol cm 3 d 1 in the mid section 5 10 cm of the dagow lake core to 323 2 nmol cm 3 d 1 at the top 0 2 5 cm of the doughnut lake core fig s3 these potential rates are within the reported ranges for similar anoxic lake sediments and freshwater ecosystems chan et al 2005 deutzmann and schink 2011 he et al 2012 interestingly we found a linear relation between aomr and amp fig s4 which suggests that aerobic methanotrophs might be involved directly or indirectly in aom despite the anoxic conditions prevailing in the cores the latter agrees with previous reports which have indicated possible involvement of aerobic methanotrophs in aom biderre petit et al 2011 blees et al 2014 chistoserdova 2015 kojima et al 2012 martinez cruz et al 2017 oswald et al 2016 and there is clear evidence for candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera bacteria performing intra aerobic ch4 oxidation in anoxic environments using no2 as an electron acceptor ettwig et al 2010 therefore we evaluated potential involvement of aerobic methanotrophs in aom in our lake sediments pmoa genes of both ca m oxyfera bacteria like pmoa mb and aerobic methanotrophs pmoa am were quantified via qpcr for each section of the sediment cores from doughnut and vault lakes fig s5 the abundance of pmoa mb ranged from 3 5 104 to 1 3 105 gene copies cm 3 of fresh sediment in doughnut lake and from 3 4 104 to 1 2 105 gene copies cm 3 of fresh sediment in vault lake the abundance of pmoa am ranged from 4 2 106 to 2 5 107 and from 3 5 105 to 7 2 106 gene copies cm 3 of fresh sediment in doughnut and vault lakes respectively no correlation was found between aomr and the number of gene copies of both pmoa am and pmoa mb moreover for both groups of microorganisms no significant differences were found between most of the initial and final gene concentrations i e quantified at the beginning and the end of the incubations however a significant difference was observed between pmoa mb and pmoa am p 0 05 as pmoa am was relatively more abundant with up to three orders of magnitude more gene copies than pmoa mb had given that no3 and no2 concentrations are likely too small to support aom coupled to denitrification the low abundance of pmoa mb in comparison to pmoa am is understandable and suggests that ca m oxyfera bacteria like did not contribute substantially to ch4 oxidation in these lake sediments previous lake studies have also reported a high relative abundance of aerobic methanotrophs under anoxic bar or et al 2017 chistoserdova 2015 martinez cruz et al 2017 oswald et al 2016 or hypoxic blees et al 2014 kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 kits et al 2015 conditions furthermore the co occurrence of aerobic and anaerobic ch4 oxidizers in anoxic lake sediments and water was reported previously deutzmann et al 2014 oswald et al 2016 in anoxic environments aerobic methanotrophs are likely i dormant for extended periods of time with the ability to resume their methanotrophic activity when the environment is conducive for such roslev and king 1994 ii able to survive prolonged starvation probably by fermenting endogenous substrates roslev and king 1995 and iii able to utilize alternative electron acceptors such as fe mn or no3 ettwig et al 2010 the latter has been mainly attributed to aerobic gammaproteobacterial methane oxidizers martinez cruz et al 2017 oswald et al 2016 however the direct links between gammaproteobacterial methane oxidizers and the reduction of alternative electron acceptors remain uncertain coupling of aerobic methanotrophy to oxygen production or cryptic oxygen cycling chistoserdova and kalyuzhnaya 2018 garcia robledo et al 2017 is an additional hypothesis however that coupling has thus far been linked to an active photosynthetic community fueling aerobic methanotrophy in anoxic lake zones milucka et al 2015 which is unlikely to occur in our relatively deep lake sediments thus the relatively high abundance of pmoa am may hint at the still unknown process carried out by aerobic methanotrophs which is similar to the already known process carried out by anaerobic ch4 oxidizers we acknowledge that by targeting anme groups a more complete picture of potential aom organisms could have been obtained thus further lake sediment aom studies should focus on elucidating the relationship between aerobic methanotrophs and anme groups 4 conclusions overall our findings greatly reduce the uncertainty related to the magnitude and spatial ubiquity of aom in lake sediments identifying aom in thirteen out of fourteen lakes across latitudinal and trophic gradients together with the determination of aom rates in three sediment cores and a further cross validation of those rates with a diffusion reaction model provides rigorous support for significant microbial ch4 sinks in lake sediments combined with those in previous reports our results suggest that aom may represent a sink of one third of the total ch4 produced in lake sediments the remainder ch4 then migrates through the water column where it is subject to aerobic oxidation martinez cruz et al 2015 thus a significant fraction of the ch4 produced in lakes is recycled internally via aerobic or anaerobic oxidation whereas only a reduced portion is emitted to the atmosphere we acknowledge that our results are still fractional and that further research is needed to constrain better the global magnitude of aom but this process might be of the same order of magnitude as the global ch4 emission from lakes which is estimated at 72 tg y 1 bastviken et al 2011 in addition based on the evidence presented in this study it is not possible to attribute the aom process coupled to a specific electron acceptor or microbial group which

19369,anaerobic oxidation of methane aom is a microbial process that consumes dissolved methane ch4 in anoxic sediments and soils and mitigates ch4 release to the atmosphere the degree to which aom limits global biospheric ch4 emissions is not fully understood in marine sediments where the process was first described aom is responsible for oxidizing 90 of the ch4 produced more recently aom has been observed in soils peatlands and freshwater ecosystems in lakes where sediment anoxia organic carbon turnover and ch4 production are common aom is not well studied but could represent a significant ch4 sink and constraint on emissions here we present evidence for the occurrence of aom in the sediment of thirteen lakes that span a global climatic and trophic gradient we further quantified and modeled aom patterns and studied potential microbial controls of aom using laboratory incubations of sediment and stable isotope measurements in three of the thirteen lakes we demonstrate that aom is widespread in freshwater lake sediments and accounts for 29 34 95 confidence interval of the mean total ch4 produced in surface and near surface lake sediments graphical

al 2013 schulz et al 1997 zehnder and brock 1980 fig 1b aom in lakes might therefore represent an important constraint on global greenhouse gas emissions however the relative importance of the process among varying lake ecosystems and the specific mechanisms involved have not been determined studies using amended incubations beal et al 2009 deutzmann and schink 2011 deutzmann et al 2014 segarra et

alaskan and one german aom activity and specific mechanisms were addressed using physical and chemical characterization of sediments development of a diffusion reaction model and qpcr for known methanotrophs our results indicate that aom in lake sediments is a globally widespread process that could significantly constrain atmopheric ch4 emissions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental protocol we demonstrated aom activity across a climatic trophic and physicochemical gradient of 14 tropical temperate and arctic lakes table s1 using incubations of surface sediments then a detailed ch4 cycling study was done in 25 cm deep sediment cores from three of the study lakes where aom was identified these incubation experiments included determination of dissolved ions previously

co2 concentrations and measurements of 13δc for both gases the results were then validated with a diffusion reaction mathematical model that predicts the dissolved ch4 profile along the 25 cm sediment cores based on the measured aom and ch4 production rates the experimental approach is illustrated in detail in fig s1 2 2 sample collection in each of our 14 study lakes table s1 we collected two surface lake sediment samples at the center of each lake with a dredge ekman ams inc usa with the goal of estimating microbial activity within the most active and representative sediment layer marotta et al 2014 the ekman dredge collected the top 15 20 cm of the sediments the top 5 cm was taken from each sample immediately placed in a ziploc bag and carefully sealed under water to avoid further contact with air to estimate aom activity in vertical sediment profiles three of the fourteen lakes were further investigated doughnut lake an interior alaska oligotrophic partially drained lake vault

vault lakes are described in detail by sepulveda jauregui et al 2015 while further details for dagow lake can be found in the study by casper 1996 in each of these three lakes three 25 cm surface sediment cores were collected using 6 6 cm diameter polycarbonate tubes and a piston hammer corer aquatic research instruments usa or a gravity corer uwitec austria from the approximate center of each

and chemical analysis dissolved ch4 and co2 concentrations in each section of the doughnut vault and dagow lake cores were measured in triplicate following he et al 2012 immediately after collection 5 ml of wet sediment was gently transferred into 20 ml serum vials containing 5 ml of ch4 and co2 free water which then were sealed with rubber stoppers and frozen until headspace ch4 and co2 analysis performed within 72 h of sampling using a gas chromatograph equipped with both a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector shimadzu gc 2014 japan the 13ch4 and 13co2 isotopic

system gc c irms thermo quest usa conrad et al 2009 for dagow lake given the presence of an active thaw bulb under vault lake we also collected bubbles to determine if the released ch4 was produced

centrifugation 2 4 incubation tests the fourteen lake sediments used for preliminary screening were incubated as explained in the supplementary information section s1 2 for the detailed core studies of the three lakes methanogenic aerobic methanotrophic and aom tests were performed with triplicate sections of the sediment cores 0 2 5 2 5 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 25 cm slurries of each section containing 60 fresh sediment and 40 anoxic deionized water were prepared under a continuous flow of ultra high purity n2 99 999 airgas usa to maintain anoxic conditions then 30 ml of each slurry was transferred to a 50 ml serum bottle and flushed continuously with n2 six bottles designated for either aom and methanogenesis determination were maintained under anoxic conditions via continued flushing with n2 for five minutes whereas three bottles designated for aerobic methanotrophy determination were flushed with synthetic air 20 o2 80 n2 airgas usa for five minutes finally all bottles were sealed with blue butyl rubber stoppers bellco usa and aluminum crimp caps in aom and methanogenic replicates na2s was added to reduce the media 0 05 g l 1 moran et al 2008 all aom vials were spiked with 2 ml of 13ch4 99 atom 13c sigma aldrich whereas all vials for aerobic methanotrophy were spiked with 2 ml of ch4 99 five sterilized controls 121 c 20 min for each treatment and each core sample were also prepared these control incubations received the same treatment as their corresponding non sterilized samples and were maintained at the same incubation temperature control vials containing water and resazurin as an oxidation reduction indicator were prepared using the same method to confirm anaerobicity incubations were carried out at 4 2 c alaska and 8 3 c germany representing the annual mean sediment temperature per lake headspace concentrations of ch4 co2 and o2 were monitored as described above at 3 15 and 30 day intervals for aerobic methanotrophic potential amp rate net methanogenic production rate nmpr and aomr respectively each aom incubation sample was also monitored for isotopic 13ch4 and 13co2 as previously described the concentration of 13ch4 was determined per eq 1 1 δ 13 c c h 4 13 c h 4 s a m p l e 12 c h 4 s a m p l e 0 0112 1 1000 δ 13 c ch 4 is the isotopic signature measured at each sampling time and 12ch4 sample is defined as totalch4 sample 13ch4 sample where totalch4 sample corresponds to the ch4 concentration determined by gas chromatography the 13c 12c of pee dee belemnite is 0 0112 nmpr was determined from a linear fit of the headspace ch4 concentration total ch4 i e 12ch4 13ch4 change over time and corresponds to the total or gross ch4 production rate minus aomr as during the aom incubations the 12c ch4 produced by methanogenesis and then oxidized was not considered i e aomr was conservatively estimated amp rates were determined from the linear decrease in headspace ch4 concentrations in methanotrophic vials whereas aomrs were calculated from the linear decrease in 13ch4 concentration over time as with aom incubations the aomr was conservatively estimated and the 12c ch4 being produced by methanogenesis and then oxidized was assumed to be unimportant 2 5 diffusion reaction model the results obtained from incubations and the dissolved ch4 concentrations were used to feed a diffusion reaction mathematical model we used a previously described standard diffusion reaction model chuang et al 2016 trolle et al 2010 to illustrate biogeochemical sediment profiles eq 2 where c is the ch4 concentration d is the ch4 effective diffusion coefficient and z is the depth 2 c t d 2 c z 2 n m p r our model did not consider burial of ch4 i e we assumed ch4 was produced endogenously only we also assumed steady state conditions i e concentration and rates did not change over time and used c at the water sediment interface and at the deepest segment of the core as boundary conditions based on the experimental nmpr the model was fitted to the experimental ch4 concentration data with least square error minimization performed in r v 3 3 0 r core team 2013 r foundation for statistical computing austria using the ch4 diffusion coefficient as the sole adjustment parameter 2 6 dna extraction and qpcr analyses to confirm the presence of gammaproteobacterial mob potentially involved in aom in sediments under anoxic conditions which were previously identified in vault lake martinez cruz et al 2017 pmoa genes of bacteria like ca m oxyfera pmoa mb and pmoa genes of aerobic methanotrophs pmoa am in vault and doughnut lakes were quantified from each aom incubation subsample dna was extracted in duplicate from 0 25 0 08 g of wet sediment before and after incubation using

were below 102 copies in triplicate reactions up to one of the three data points were manually excluded from analysis if determined to be an outlier data are reported as gene copy numbers per cm3 of fresh sediment 2 7 statistical analysis statistical analyses were carried out on the aomr nmpr and gene copy number for the vault and doughnut lake samples for all data normality was assessed by the shapiro wilk test as most of the data was non normally distributed significant differences among variables were determined using the mann whitney u mwu comparison test p 0 05 when comparing only two variables and the kruskal wallis kw multiple comparison test p 0 05 when comparing more than two variables all statistical analyses and linear regressions were conducted using the ncss 11 statistical analysis system software number cruncher statistical systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 incubation tests all 14 lakes showed either low dissolved oxygen 1 5 mg l 1 or anoxic conditions at the bottom of the water column suggesting anoxia in the surface lake sediments the aom activity from the 14 selected lakes identified by measuring labeled carbon dioxide 13co2 production was significantly higher than that for the sterile controls in all but one temperate lake 7 table s1 this provides evidence for widespread aom in lake sediments independent of lake trophic status or climate regime and suggests either a range of potential electron acceptors or a single ubiquitous electron acceptor not linked to lake productivity and nutrient dynamics our detailed investigation of aom across vertical sediment profiles of three lakes doughnut oligotrophic arctic vault dystrophic thermokarstic arctic and dagow eutrophic temperate lakes demonstrated significant aom and ch4 production in all three lakes at all sediment depths fig 2 the aomr determined from 13ch4 uptake ranged from 3 30 0 36 nmol cm 3 d 1 at the bottom 20 25 cm of the doughnut lake core to 16 30 1 38 nmol cm 3 d 1 at the top 0 2 5 cm of the vault lake core aomr for all three lakes and at all depths ranged from 0 6 to 20 9 nmol cm 3 d 1 with a median of 7 8 nmol cm 3 d 1 these values are similar to the range of aomr in lake sediments previously reported in other studies with or without electron acceptor amendments fig 1a 0 180 0 nmol cm 3 d 1 amended and 0 43 0 nmol cm 3 d 1 unamended although those studies had a lower median of 3 5 nmol cm 3 d 1 fig 1a the nmpr which corresponds to the gross ch4 production rate minus aomr ranged from 1 10 0 26 at the bottom 20 25 cm of the vault lake core to 83 18 11 85 nmol cm 3 d 1 at the top 0 2 5 cm of dagow lake core fig 2 in the sediments of dagow lake which had the highest trophic index and greater doc table s3 both nmpr and aomr were significantly higher p 0 05 than those observed in the other two lakes this supports previous studies that showed that microbial communities can efficiently use a broader range of substrates in lake sediments with higher carbon availability and trophic index torres et al 2011 thereby fueling ch4 production casper 1992 and enhancing ch4 cycling blazewicz et al 2012 however dagow lake sediments were incubated at higher temperature 8 c than alaska lake sediments 4 which is also known to enhance methanogenesis especially in eutrophic lakes sepulveda jauregui et al 2018 the percentage of gross ch4 production oxidized anaerobically ranged from 12 in the bottom of the doughnut lake core to 87 in the bottom of the vault lake core fig 2 the average oxidation percentage in the sediment cores of the three lakes was 35 26 n 18 with a 95 confidence interval of 30 41 our study was limited to three lakes and did not consider temporal variation or seasonal differences which a full budget approach would require however from the meta analysis presented in fig 1 a balance between aomr from unamended incubations and ch4 production rates previously reported gives a percentage of oxidation value that is relatively close i e ranging from 0 to 48 with a median of 18 which is within the lower range in our experiments altogether our results combined with literature data n 93 give a percent of gross methane production oxidized in surface lake sediments a reduction in potential methane emissions of 29 34 95 confidence interval which reinforce suggestions that aom in lake sediments is an important constraint on the ch4 release from lake sediments this result implies that in the littoral region of lakes or shallow lakes where ebullition is relatively more important and ch4 bubbles can evade aerobic methanotrophy natchimuthu et al 2016 aom could be the primary constraint on the ch4 release from lake sediments in our three primary study lakes the highest nmpr and aomr were observed in the top core sections whereas the percentage of ch4 oxidized by aom was the highest in the top section of doughnut lake and in the deeper sections of vault and dagow lakes therefore in vault and dagow lakes the high aomr observed in the top section of the cores was offset by high ch4 production resulting in relatively low ch4 oxidation percentages the pattern of greater nmpr in the upper sediment layer of vault and dagow lakes is similar to results reported by heslop et al 2015 where the ch4 production rate was greatest in surface sediments of vault lake doughnut lake did not show the same trend as relatively high nmpr was still observed in the deepest core section the relatively high nmpr we observed coincided with lower doc concentrations compared to those in vault and dagow lakes table s3 ch4 production in freshwater sediments is often limited by the availability of labile organic matter hoyos santillan et al 2016 sobek et al 2012 which represents only a fraction of total doc it is possible that the labile fraction of doc was significantly greater in doughnut lake than in the other lakes despite no observed differences in sediment loi across sites table s3 3 2 diffusion reaction model to assess how our observed potential rates matched prevailing sediment conditions the production oxidation rates presented in fig 2 were used as inputs in a diffusion reaction model eq 2 the model predicted dissolved ch4 concentration in the cores which could in turn be compared to experimental data the modeled dissolved ch4 concentration matched well with the field data fig 3 indicating that rates determined from laboratory incubations corresponded to those present in sediments we interpret this as further support for our findings that lake sediment aom is an important constraint on global greenhouse gas emissions best fittings were obtained with effective diffusion coefficients of 4 5 10 5 6 5 10 5 and 9 0 10 5 cm2 s 1 for vault doughnut and dagow lakes respectively these effective diffusion coefficients are about one order above previously reported values iversen and jorgensen 1993 gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 but as indicated by flury et al 2015 the presence of minor amounts of gas can increase the diffusion of gases by several orders of magnitude likewise bioturbation impacts of benthic animals may also increase gas transport within sediments significantly baranov et al 2016 3 3 isotopic signatures the isotopic signatures of ch4 and co2 along the sediment cores are shown in fig 4 the lowest δ13c ch4 values were observed at depths greater than 5 cm in the sediment cores with minimum depleted values of 66 7 61 4 and 61 3 for doughnut vault and dagow lakes respectively these values are consistent with isotopic signatures previously reported for lake sediments e g conrad et al 2009 whiticar 1999 indicating microbial ch4 production the highest δ13c ch4 values 36 9 49 8 and 59 7 for doughnut vault and dagow lakes respectively which were all measured in the first 2 5 cm of the sediment cores doughnut and vault lake isotopic signatures may indicate a13c enrichment due to ch4 oxidation in the upper sediment layers as previously reported schubert et al 2011 indeed in doughnut and vault lakes the enriched carbon 13c ch4 observed in the top section can be explained by the higher observed aomr fig 2 whereas in dagow lake the relatively small difference in the isotopic signatures 2 along the sediment core may be driven by the relatively uniform aomr profile fig 2 in doughnut lake we observed a correlation between dissolved ch4 concentration and δ13c ch4 fig s2 a relationship that has been previously reported as evidence of ch4 oxidation grant and whiticar 2002 this correlation was not observed in vault and dagow lakes which suggests different carbon cycling processes among the lake cores in vault lake ch4 bubbles released from the base of the thaw bulb 5 m below the sediment surface and those collected at the lake surface had an isotopic value of 72 7 4 3 n 4 δ13c ch4 presence of this relatively depleted ch4 suggests that ebullition of bubbles originating from greater depths in thaw bulbs are less influenced by aom than by ch4 produced in surface sediments the δ13c co2 profiles in the sediment cores of the three studied lakes exhibited a distinguishable symmetry between δ13c ch4 and δ13c co2 with relatively light co2 combined with heavy ch4 in the uppermost sediments which has been suggested as evidence for aom schubert et al 2011 segarra et al 2015 the δ13c co2 profiles agree with co2 production by acetoclastic methanogenesis or aom in the upper sections of the sediments and co2 reduction potentially by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in deeper sediment layers conrad et al 2009 the isotopic evidence together with the dissolved gases indicate very active ch4 cycling along the 25 cm of sediment cores of the three studied lakes with possibly higher aom activity in the top sediment layers the aom incubation tests and the diffusion reaction model have confirmed the latter 3 4 potential electron acceptors to identify aom electron acceptors we analyzed each subsection of the three cores for dissolved no2 no3 and so4 2 and total fe and mn concentrations the mean concentration of no3 in the lake sediment ranged from 1 4 to 10 5 μmol l 1 fig 5 whereas the concentration of no2 was 1 5 μmol l 1 these concentrations were below or at the lower range of concentrations reported in sediments where aom is coupled to denitrification deutzmann et al 2014 ettwig et al 2009 and we observed no correlation between dissolved ch4 and no3 or no2 concentration aom linked to denitrification in any part of our study is therefore unlikely total fe and mn were detected in lake sediments at concentrations ranging from 176 to 872 μmol gdw 1 and from 4 1 to 24 5 μmol l 1 respectively fig 5 although the oxidation state of neither element was quantified and we cannot evaluate their particular role in aom we also cannot exclude their role as aom electron acceptors in these lake systems dissolved so4 2 concentrations in the three lake sediments ranged from 0 3 to 36 9 μmol l 1 fig 5 with the smallest concentrations observed in dagow lake and the greatest in vault lake weber et al 2017 demonstrated aom coupled to so4 2 reduction at so4 2 levels below 100 μmol l 1 suggesting so4 2 was a potential electron acceptor in our study lakes however contrary to previous studies that have implicated so4 2 as the aom electron acceptor beal et al 2011 schubert et al 2011 we observed no negative relationship between so4 2 and dissolved ch4 concentrations for vault and doughnut lakes fig 5a and b the so4 2 concentration in dagow lake did illustrate a negative relationship fig 5c nevertheless the so4 2 concentration reached values below 1 μmol l 1 an insufficient amount of so4 2 to account for the observed aom activity overall our electron acceptor investigation was inconclusive previous studies have demonstrated complex interactions between metals and so4 2 or humic substances that might serve as electron acceptors egger et al 2015 he et al 2018 nordi et al 2013 sivan et al 2011 smemo and yavitt 2007 valenzuela et al 2017 it is possible that a combination of electron acceptors and pathways could be naturally occurring in our study lakes and explain why we found no correlation between aomr and lake trophic state or climate in our broader 14 lake study 3 5 potential aerobic methanotrophy sediment samples also were tested for potential aerobic methanotrophy in vials flushed with synthetic air and spiked with ch4 the aerobic methanotrophic potential amp ranged from 123 2 nmol cm 3 d 1 in the mid section 5 10 cm of the dagow lake core to 323 2 nmol cm 3 d 1 at the top 0 2 5 cm of the doughnut lake core fig s3 these potential rates are within the reported ranges for similar anoxic lake sediments and freshwater ecosystems chan et al 2005 deutzmann and schink 2011 he et al 2012 interestingly we found a linear relation between aomr and amp fig s4 which suggests that aerobic methanotrophs might be involved directly or indirectly in aom despite the anoxic conditions prevailing in the cores the latter agrees with previous reports which have indicated possible involvement of aerobic methanotrophs in aom biderre petit et al 2011 blees et al 2014 chistoserdova 2015 kojima et al 2012 martinez cruz et al 2017 oswald et al 2016 and there is clear evidence for candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera bacteria performing intra aerobic ch4 oxidation in anoxic environments using no2 as an electron acceptor ettwig et al 2010 therefore we evaluated potential involvement of aerobic methanotrophs in aom in our lake sediments pmoa genes of both ca m oxyfera bacteria like pmoa mb and aerobic methanotrophs pmoa am were quantified via qpcr for each section of the sediment cores from doughnut and vault lakes fig s5 the abundance of pmoa mb ranged from 3 5 104 to 1 3 105 gene copies cm 3 of fresh sediment in doughnut lake and from 3 4 104 to 1 2 105 gene copies cm 3 of fresh sediment in vault lake the abundance of pmoa am ranged from 4 2 106 to 2 5 107 and from 3 5 105 to 7 2 106 gene copies cm 3 of fresh sediment in doughnut and vault lakes respectively no correlation was found between aomr and the number of gene copies of both pmoa am and pmoa mb moreover for both groups of microorganisms no significant differences were found between most of the initial and final gene concentrations i e quantified at the beginning and the end of the incubations however a significant difference was observed between pmoa mb and pmoa am p 0 05 as pmoa am was relatively more abundant with up to three orders of magnitude more gene copies than pmoa mb had given that no3 and no2 concentrations are likely too small to support aom coupled to denitrification the low abundance of pmoa mb in comparison to pmoa am is understandable and suggests that ca m oxyfera bacteria like did not contribute substantially to ch4 oxidation in these lake sediments previous lake studies have also reported a high relative abundance of aerobic methanotrophs under anoxic bar or et al 2017 chistoserdova 2015 martinez cruz et al 2017 oswald et al 2016 or hypoxic blees et al 2014 kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 kits et al 2015 conditions furthermore the co occurrence of aerobic and anaerobic ch4 oxidizers in anoxic lake sediments and water was reported previously deutzmann et al 2014 oswald et al 2016 in anoxic environments aerobic methanotrophs are likely i dormant for extended periods of time with the ability to resume their methanotrophic activity when the environment is conducive for such roslev and king 1994 ii able to survive prolonged starvation probably by fermenting endogenous substrates roslev and king 1995 and iii able to utilize alternative electron acceptors such as fe mn or no3 ettwig et al 2010 the latter has been mainly attributed to aerobic gammaproteobacterial methane oxidizers martinez cruz et al 2017 oswald et al 2016 however the direct links between gammaproteobacterial methane oxidizers and the reduction of alternative electron acceptors remain uncertain coupling of aerobic methanotrophy to oxygen production or cryptic oxygen cycling chistoserdova and kalyuzhnaya 2018 garcia robledo et al 2017 is an additional hypothesis however that coupling has thus far been linked to an active photosynthetic community fueling aerobic methanotrophy in anoxic lake zones milucka et al 2015 which is unlikely to occur in our relatively deep lake sediments thus the relatively high abundance of pmoa am may hint at the still unknown process carried out by aerobic methanotrophs which is similar to the already known process carried out by anaerobic ch4 oxidizers we acknowledge that by targeting anme groups a more complete picture of potential aom organisms could have been obtained thus further lake sediment aom studies should focus on elucidating the relationship between aerobic methanotrophs and anme groups 4 conclusions overall our findings greatly reduce the uncertainty related to the magnitude and spatial ubiquity of aom in lake sediments identifying aom in thirteen out of fourteen lakes across latitudinal and trophic gradients together with the determination of aom rates in three sediment cores and a further cross validation of those rates with a diffusion reaction model provides rigorous support for significant microbial ch4 sinks in lake sediments combined with those in previous reports our results suggest that aom may represent a sink of one third of the total ch4 produced in lake sediments the remainder ch4 then migrates through the water column where it is subject to aerobic oxidation martinez cruz et al 2015 thus a significant fraction of the ch4 produced in lakes is recycled internally via aerobic or anaerobic oxidation whereas only a reduced portion is emitted to the atmosphere we acknowledge that our results are still fractional and that further research is needed to constrain better the global magnitude of aom but this process might be of the same order of magnitude as the global ch4 emission from lakes which is estimated at 72 tg y 1 bastviken et al 2011 in addition based on the evidence presented in this study it is not possible to attribute the aom process coupled to a specific electron acceptor or microbial group which
