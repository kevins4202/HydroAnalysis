3330,the interaction between a lake and groundwater has important implications to the quantity and quality of water in both environments quantification of lake groundwater interaction lgi has been challenging in regions with limited in situ data lgi can be quantified by physically based models direct measurement of seepage measurements of conservative chemical or isotopic tracers and lake water balance despite the accuracy of the methods based on hydrochemical or isotopic measurements and analysis they require extensive field data that are costly to collect in large lakes instead the data required to quantify lgi by the lake water budget method can be obtained via typical ground measurements and satellite remote sensing however the influence on the estimated lgi imposed by the uncertainty associated with the other components of lake water budget e g precipitation evaporation and inflow outflow is still poorly understood in this study we coupled a forward uncertainty propagation framework with the lake water budget to estimate the uncertainty of lgi using latin hypercube sampling we implemented the above framework in the hypersaline lake urmia lu located in the northwestern iran over five consecutive study periods between september 2017 and may 2020 the results revealed the exchange of flow from groundwater to the lu in all studied periods ranging between 0 2 million cubic meters mcm day and 7 6 mcm day the relative contribution of lgi in the water budget varied between 3 and 37 the results of the uncertainty analysis further demonstrated that the cumulative probability of lgi 0 which indicates flow direction from the lu to groundwater was insignificant in all the study periods ranging between 0 001 and 0 35 keywords lake groundwater interaction water balance uncertainty analysis saltwater intrusion lake urmia 1 introduction during the past decades the adverse impacts of intensive human activities exacerbated by global warming have endangered many lakes worldwide e g zadereev et al 2020 wurtsbaugh et al 2017 chuai et al 2012 ostrovsky et al 2012 moss et al 2011 adrian et al 2009 to design efficient and sustainable restoration plans for the drying lakes an appropriate understanding of the water budget components is necessary to determine the relative role of each component in the overall lake water quality and quantity e g ito momii and nakagawa 2009 woldeyohannes and khalil 2017 jin et al 2010 winter 1995 due to the complexities involved in quantifying lake groundwater interaction lgi this term is either ignored or assumed to be negligible in many studies e g rosenberry et al 2015 conant et al 2019 bonell et al 2008 rudnick et al 2015 however lgi has several important implications to lakes and their adjacent aquifers for instance contaminated lakes can negatively influence the quality of interacting groundwater that is exploited as a source of irrigation or municipal water need miettinen et al 1997 perera et al 2009 wiese and n√ºtzmann 2009 on the other hand exfiltration from groundwater to a lake may jeopardize the lake biodiversity by augmenting the concentration of nutrients such as nitrate and phosphorus which triggers eutrophication hayashi and rosenberry 2002 lewandowski et al 2014 oehler et al 2009 sills et al 2009 rozemeijer and broers 2007 hill et al 2014 tavakoly et al 2019 the delivery of pesticide metabolites from agricultural lands hintze et al 2020 and the transport of acidic substances from nearby mines blowes and jambor 1990 jeffries and mills 1995 are other examples of lake degradation as a result of interaction with groundwater the approaches to quantify lgi can be categorized into three major groups physically based models direct measurements and water balance method barthel and banzhaf 2016 kalbus et al 2006 rosenberry et al 2015 although physically based models e g hydrogeosphere parflow inhm opengeosys and modflow are able to determine flow pathways and magnitude in multiple segments along a lake shoreline they are typically computationally expensive depending on the domain size and spatiotemporal resolution and require extensive field data for calibration and validation purposes e g barthel and banzhaf 2016 rosenberry et al 2015 wiebe et al 2015 konikow and bredehoeft 1992 tiedeman and gorelick 1993 despite the high accuracy and relatively easy use of direct measuring instruments such as seepage meters e g solomon et al 2020 their utilization is impractical and costly for large lakes due to the spatial variation of lgi rate wiebe et al 2015 alternatively mass balance based approaches can be employed using either combined water chemical balance arnoux et al 2017 elmarami et al 2016 fu et al 2020 isokangas et al 2015 saleem and jeelani 2017 or soil water balance apip et al 2021 rudnick et al 2015 wiebe et al 2015 woldeyohannes and khalil 2017 in addition to the simplicity of the water balance approach it can yield lgi given the reliable estimates of precipitation p evaporation storage and surface inflow outflow wiebe et al 2015 these quantities can be obtained directly from ground measurements and remote sensing data or they can be estimated using empirical relationships or physically based models nevertheless due to the remarkable spatial variation of some variables controlling water balance in large lakes significant biases in the estimated input data can propagate into the computed lgi lenters 2004 neff and killian 2003 quinn and guerra 1986 wiebe et al 2015 although several former studies could successfully quantify the contribution of lgi to the total lake water budget e g wiebe et al 2015 the lack of uncertainty analysis leaves the reliability assessment of the results unknown particularly if the studied lake area is very large or the employed field data are limited to tackle the above issue in this study we employed a coupled forward uncertainty propagation and lake water budget framework to assess the estimation uncertainty of lgi by quantifying and incorporating the uncertainty of the other lake water budget components to demonstrate the applicability of the framework we chose the hypersaline lake urmia lu located in the northwestern iran as the case study due to its drastic shrinkage between 1995 and 2014 several studies have so far explored the reasons of the lu drying and analyzed the lake restoration e g alborzi et al 2018 moreover extensive activities have been planned and executed by the urmia lake restoration program to help restore the lake to its ecologic level danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 however former studies and the current lake restoration roadmap neglected lgi in the lake water budget due to the lack of evidence on the quantity of lgi in this region as such this study takes one important step towards advancing the current understanding of the lu and groundwater interaction to facilitate lgi prediction in the lu we leveraged the most accurate data to quantify all the lake water budget components except lgi in five continuous study periods between 2017 and 2020 in particular we aimed i to explore the significance of lgi and its distinct contribution to the lu water budget ii to investigate the dynamic of exfiltration from or infiltration to the lu in the study period under contrasting groundwater storage conditions iii to determine the water budget components with the highest correlation with lgi and iv to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated lgi in the study periods we highlight that the proposed framework can be applied to any other environment of interest without the loss of generality the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the study area and give a brief overview of the lu changes over the past two decades due to the impact of climatic and anthropogenic stressors in section 3 we outline the employed methodology to estimate the water budget components including p inflow outflow evaporation and changes in the stored water volume we also present the details of the utilized uncertainty quantification framework in this section in section 4 we present the results by describing the temporal dynamics of the water budget components and determining the contribution of the estimated lgi to the lake water budget in different study periods the results of lgi uncertainty analysis and their interpretations are also presented in this section in section 5 we highlight the advantages of the employed uncertainty analysis framework in comparison to the other existing approaches for quantifying water budget uncertainty we also outline the implications of the results to the current understanding of lgi in the lu by discussing the findings of past relevant studies in the lu finally we summarize the main findings of this study in section 6 2 study area the shallow hypersaline lu located in the northwest of iran is registered as a national park 1971 a ramsar site 1975 and a unesco biosphere reserve 1976 the lu is surrounded by 17 major aquifers and is fed by 15 major rivers fig 1 the lake urmia basin lub is governed by a cold and semi arid climate with an average air temperature of 12 5 c and an average p depth of 300 mm between 1990 and 2019 p shows a large spatial variability across lub the north south oriented mountains in the western side of the region block the westerly air fronts making p vary sharply from west to east vaheddoost and aksoy 2017 as such lub can be divided into three homogenous subregions in terms of long term p depth which includes the central and south eastern regions northern and north eastern regions and western and south western regions fazel et al 2018 the northern and north eastern region receives the lowest amount of annual p and experiences short duration summer rainfalls that are attributed to the formation of local clouds in the summer due to the lu evaporation on the contrary the highest amount of annual p takes place in the western and south western region due to its mountainous terrains spring p accounts for most of the annual p in the lub followed by winter and fall p the average annual volume of water entering the lake from the feeding rivers is 2 400 million cubic meters mcm around 65 of total annual flow into the lu is supplied by the southern rivers i e zarrineh river simineh river gadar chai and mahabad chai the extent of the lu surface area in warm seasons is largely dependent on evaporation because around 60 of the lu s water body is located in the southern part of the lake which is characterized by shallow depths less than 2 m the lake is surrounded by 25 aquifers 14 of which are in the plains around the lake and are recognized by coastal aquifers these aquifers include urmia salmas miandoab naqadeh rashakan mahabad and kahriz in west azerbaijan as well as tasuj shabestar sufyan tabriz azarshahr shiramin malekan ajabshir and maragheh bonab in east azerbaijan in a twenty year period between 1995 and 2014 the lu experienced a drastic decline of 7 8 m 23 billion cubic meters bcm and 2 600 km2 in water level stored volume and surface area respectively several former studies have demonstrated the devastating role of anthropogenic activities in the lu desiccation aghakouchak et al 2015 alizade govarchin ghale et al 2018 chaudhari et al 2018 hosseini moghari et al 2018 moreover the majority of the aquifers around the lu have been depleted mainly due to excessive agricultural water consumption ashraf et al 2017 chaudhari et al 2018 to cease the lake drying and restore it back to its ecological level at 1274 1 m that is 3 m above the lu s water level in the fall 2021 the urmia lake restoration program was established in 2013 and designed a restoration roadmap despite the initial success of the roadmap i e an increase of 2 m in the lake water level from 2015 to 2019 the current planning has been criticized due to the lack of integrity in considering a set of measures that should be taken into account for predicting and evaluating the lu s restoration status appropriately danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 sima et al 2021 3 methods and data 3 1 lake water budget the lake water budget equation was used to quantify the net volumetric rate of lgi l3 t as 1 lgi Œ¥ v Œ¥ t e p s w where lgi 0 stands for the flux of water from the lake to groundwater lgi 0 stands for the flux of groundwater to the lake Œ¥v l3 is the lake water volume change e l3 t is the volumetric rate of evaporation from the lake surface p l3 t is the volumetric rate of direct precipitation on the lake sw l3 t is the volumetric rate of surface water inflow from the feeding rivers and Œ¥t t is the length of the period during which the water budge is closed a negative value of Œ¥v in a given period implies lake shrinkage in that period and vice versa we computed the lake water budget for five consecutive study periods from september 2019 to may 2020 as described in table 1 the length of these periods ranges between 64 days and 448 days these periods were defined based on the six stages at which the most recent bathymetric maps of the lu are available from the study of danesh yazdi et al 2021 3 1 1 lake water volume change Œ¥ v due to the impact of salt precipitation and dissolution in the hypersaline lu the lake bathymetry is dynamic depending on the rate of evaporation and freshwater input as such the temporal change of the lake s stored water volume can be reliably estimated if the changes in the lake bathymetry are known given the dynamic bathymetric maps the lake water volume at the beginning and end of a period was computed by integrating the three dimensional space between the lake water level and its underlying bathymetry as 2 v p b h p b x y d x d y 3 v p e h p e x y d x d y where v p b and v p e are the lake volume at the beginning and end of the period p respectively and h p b x y and h p e x y are the matrices of water depth at the beginning and the end of the period p respectively and x and y are the longitude and latitude of a specific point on the lake surface respectively for each period in table 1 Œ¥ v was computed by subtracting the lake water volume at the end and beginning of the period the bathymetric maps were computed by utilizing extensive in situ hydrography data and high resolution satellite imagery in a machine learning based model the predictive model gives the complex non linear relationship between water depth and satellite recorded surface reflectance data see danesh yazdi et al 2021 for further details 3 1 2 total direct precipitation p and surface water inflow sw volume daily p data at eight synoptic stations surrounding the lu fig 1 were received from i r of iran meteorological organization irimo regarding the spatial distribution of the synoptic stations p depth across the whole lu in a given day was assumed to be the average of p depth at the eight stations to compute the total volume of p falling directly on the lu in a given period we summed the inner product of the time series of daily p depth and the lu s surface area the time series of the lu s surface area was retrieved by the most recent level area relationship developed for the lu by danesh yazdi et al 2021 to compute the volume of sw to the lake we received monthly streamflow data at the closest stations to the lu see fig 1 from the regional water company of west and east azerbaijan provinces 3 1 3 total evaporation volume e we computed the e rate by using four energy balance based evaporation models i e bowen ratio energy balance breb priesty taylor debruin keijman and penman we chose the best e model by contrasting the computed rates against pan e data available at the golmankhaneh station between 2000 and 2015 fig 1 since the above methods are well recognized in the hydrology community we outline the details on the relating formulations in the appendix we used meteorological data recorded at the urmia station fig 1 to compute daily e rate from the above models moreover the lu s surface water temperature data were obtained from modis lst product to compare the results of the above four models with the pan e data we used sea surface temperature data for the tile in which the golmankhaneh station fig 1 is located however to compute the e rate from the whole lake surface area we used the average sea surface temperature for all the tiles covering the entire lu s extent due to the hypersalinity of the lu the computed e rate from the above models should be adjusted to account for the impact of salinity on the saturated vapor pressure oroud 1994 the relationship between the saturated vapor pressure of salty water ebrine and pure water es is given by heidari et al 2010 4 e brine Œ± w e s where Œ± w is the water activity coefficient since there are no data on Œ± w in the lu we used data at the great salt lake spencer et al 1985 as a proxy because both lakes are similar with respect to several characteristics of morphology chemistry and sedimentology wurtsbaugh 2014 to further account for the impact of water density on the e rate we used water density data collected between 2006 and 2016 by the regional water company of west and east azarbaijan provinces we also aggregated these data with the recent measurements conducted by bayati and danesh yazdi 2021 in 2019 given these data we mapped the relationship between the lu water density and volume as illustrated in fig 2 a it is seen that a significant decreasing relationship holds between water density and stored volume in the lu r2 0 65 we used the above relationship to estimate the lu water density on a daily timescale throughout the study periods fig 2b and c show the extracted time series of water density and stored volume between september 2017 and may 2020 respectively 3 2 groundwater data 3 2 1 groundwater table in the lake urmia s surrounding aquifers to compare the fluctuations of groundwater table with the lu s water level in a long period we received monthly time series of groundwater level data from the urmia lake restoration program these data were measured over 797 observation wells across 17 aquifers surrounding the lu between 2000 and 2017 fig 1 shows the geographical location of the aquifers in lub 3 2 2 groundwater storage to further explore the fluctuations in the groundwater storage we used gldas 2 2 groundwater storage product i e gws released in feb 2020 that was obtained by assimilating grace terrestrial water storage product into a catchment land surface model clsm koster et al 2000 the acceptable accuracy of these data at the regional scale has been demonstrated against in situ groundwater anomaly li et al 2019 3 3 uncertainty analysis to evaluate the uncertainty of lgi estimation in each period we employed the forward uncertainty propagation approach which gives the probability distribution function pdf of the model output from that of the model inputs to determine the pdf of an input in the water budget equation we employed the framework proposed by papalexiou 2018 by which we can generate a number of random time series with the same marginal distribution and autocorrelation structure as the input assume x t 0 t t is a stationary stochastic process e g any of the water budget components in equation 1 with the marginal distribution of f x x and autocorrelation structure of œÅx œÑ where t is time t is the length of x t and œÑ is the autocorrelation time lag also assume z t is a parent gaussian process with a standard normal pdf i e n 0 1 and autocorrelation structure of œÅz œÑ now a probability transformation equation can be defined to transform z t into a time series that have the same marginal distribution as x t this transformation equation can be written as 5 x g z q x œï z z t where q x is the quantile function of x and œï z is the probability distribution function of z t furthermore to keep the same autocorrelation structure of x t a particular autocorrelation structure should be assigned to z t to this end œÅz œÑ 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 95 is first defined as a synthetic autocorrection structure of z t then œÅx œÑ is calculated as 6 œÅ x œÑ c Œ∏ x œÅ z œÑ Œº x 2 œÉ x 2 where 7 c Œ∏ x œÅ z œÑ e x t x œÑ e q x œï z z t q x œï z z œÑ q x œï z z t q x œï z z œÑ œÜ z t z œÑ z t z œÑ d z t d z œÑ in these equations Œº x œÉ x 2 are the mean and variance of the random variable x respectively e a is the expected value of the random variable a œÜ z t z œÑ z t z œÑ is the joint pdf of the standard gaussian variates z t z œÑ that is a bivariate gaussian distribution and Œ∏ x is the parameter vector of f x x the pair of œÅ x œÅ z values are interpolated using 8 œÅ z f œÅ x b c 1 b œÅ x 1 c 1 1 b 1 c 1 b 0 c 0 where b and c are the interpolation parameters the autocorrelation structure of x t is imported into equation 8 to obtain the autocorrelation structure of z t using the above approach a desired number of realizations of x t i e y i t 1 i n with the same pdf and autocorrelation structure of x t can be generated where n is the total number of realizations given y i t s s i is defined as 9 s i 0 t y i t d t which is the sum of y i t values between t 0 and t t finally a pdf is fitted to the s i vector by using the maximum likelihood method here we note that since the uncertainty of h p estimation is already known from the machine learning algorithm used to compute the bathymetric maps danesh yazdi et al 2021 the uncertainty of Œ¥ v in equation 1 is quantified by a different approach than that explained above to this end we first decomposed v p into a constant value v p and a random variable Œµ p as 10 v p v p Œµ p where v p is the lake volume at the beginning or end of the study period p and Œµ p is the error in the measurement of v p which is defined as 11 Œµ p e p a p where a p is the lake surface area random variable at the beginning or end of the study period p to account for the uncertainty in a p we assumed a uniform pdf as a u a min a max where a min and a max are the smallest and largest estimation of the lake surface area respectively we calculated a min and a max by assuming that the lake boundary moves u meter inwards or outwards the lake respectively where u is the error in delineating the lake boundary e p can also be described as 12 e p n Œº p œÉ p where Œº p and œÉ p are the mean absolute error mae and the standard deviation of error in the h p estimation respectively given the independence of e p and a p the pdf of Œµ p was constructed by generating a number of h p a p samples through a monte carlo simulation finally given v p e Œµ p and œÉ Œµ p as the standard deviation of Œµ p the pdf of v p is derived as 13 v p n ŒΩ p e Œµ p œÉ Œµ p to implement the above framework in each of our study periods we generated a number of vp b vp e samples to obtain the pdf of Œ¥v given the pdf of vp b and vp e also in order to obtain the pdf of the volumetric p and e in each period we first generated 1 000 synthetic time series of yi t i e p depth e depth and sw time series to obtain their subsequent si then given the pdf of p depth e depth and the average lake surface area a average for each period we conducted a monte carlo simulation to generate 20 000 samples of p depth a average and e depth a average according to the study of danesh yazdi et al 2021 we considered u as 50 m also Œºi and œÉi were quantified as 0 025 cm and 7 75 cm for the first and third bathymetric maps 0 3 cm and 15 2 cm for the second and sixth bathymetric maps and 0 98 cm and 17 8 cm for the fourth and fifth bathymetric maps respectively we performed the above analysis by using the cosmos package in r papalexiou et al 2021 finally we computed the pdf of lgi for a given period by using the pdf of p e sw and Œ¥v through latin hypercube sampling mckay et al 1979 in this method a specified number of samples are first drawn independently for each variable then by using the correlation matrix of the involved variables we employed the nataf transformation der kiureghian and liu 1986 to generate correlated samples although the correlation matrix consists of all pairwise linear correlation coefficients between the variables li et al 2008 xiao 2014 the validity of the approach is not conditioned on the existence of strong correlations between them instead the transformation attempts merely to preserve the dependency of any significance between the variables to determine the minimum sample number for generating the random p t e t and sw t time series which is necessary to achieve a desirable degree of precision in characterizing the mean and standard deviation of p e and sw random variables in each study period we increased the number of trials until the observed fluctuation of the mean and standard deviation of p e and sw stabilized moreover we conducted the same experiment to determine the sufficient number of samples in simulating the lgi random variable given the pdf of p e sw and Œ¥v using the latin hypercube sampling for each period 3 4 cross correlation analysis to determine the cross correlation of lgi with the rest of the water budget components i e Œ¥v p e and sw as well as with gws in the study periods we considered extra 10 periods the start and end dates of these periods are the same as the dates corresponding to two non consecutive periods defined in table 1 for instance we considered the sixth period with 368 days between the start date of the first bathymetric map i e 09 14 2017 and the start date of the third bathymetric map i e 09 17 2018 we added these new periods to ensure that a statistically meaningful number of data were used for the cross correlation analysis 4 results 4 1 the accuracy of evaporation estimation models the root mean square error rmse between the measured e rate and that estimated from the breb priesty taylor debruin keijman and penman method is 39 1 mm month 40 0 mm month 47 6 mm month and 54 7 mm month respectively we observe that the e rate estimated by the breb model gives the best accuracy in terms of rmse we also note that the e volume has an increasing trend of 0 28 mcm yr over the study period regarding a decreasing trend in the air temperature not shown here the elevated e volume is mainly attributed to the increasing lake surface area as well as decreasing lake water salinity as a result of the increased stored volume the advantage of the breb method to estimate e rate from the lu as compared to the other empirical methods and those based on mass balance remote sensing and machine learning has also been demonstrated by other former studies for instance siadatmousavi and seyedalipour 2019 used modified penman breb and dalton methods to estimate the e depth from the lu in 2017 they found a significant bias between the results of the dalton method i e 433 mm with that obtained from the penman and breb methods i e 872 and 800 mm respectively the inconsistency of the results of dalton method with that from the other competing approaches has been proven by the other past studies in which the annual e rate from the lu was reported between 890 mm and 1360 mm e g sima and tajrishy 2015 sima et al 2013 also computed the e depth from the lu in 2009 by using the breb method enforced by the modis water surface temperature data they estimated the total e depth as 1033 mm which is in agreement with the in situ measurement of 1175 mm from the golmankhaneh pan moreover sima and tajrishy 2015 developed a salinity dependent daily evaporation sdde model based on the breb method to estimate the e rate from the lu based on their model the total e depth from april to october 2010 was 1136 mm the e depth determined by the in situ measurements at the golmankhaneh station was equal to 1041 mm in the same period indicating the high accuracy of the breb method this is expected as the energy balance based methods have been considered a benchmark to validate the estimated e rate from other methods particularly in saline lakes stauffer 1991 rosenberry et al 2007 winter et al 2003 in another attempt to estimate the e rate by a mass balance based model kokya and kokya 2008 indicated a significant improvement in the performance of the model by incorporating the impact of salinity however the accuracy of the proposed model cannot be assessed as the study period was limited to only eight days in addition several studies have modified a few remote sensing based methods e g surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal and surface energy balance system sebs to estimate e from free surface waters by employing the sebal model to estimate the e rate from the lu in 2005 mohebzadeh and fallah 2019 found a 32 bias between the estimated annual e depth against in situ measurements sima and khorsand 2018 have further illustrated the low accuracy of sebs and sebal methods in estimating the e rate and its spatiotemporal variation across the lu finally biazar et al 2020 used artificial neural network ann to simulate the e rate by training the model with data from nine water samples with the salinity concentration ranging between 0 2 g l and 500 g l the correlation coefficient and rmse between the estimated daily e rate and that measured from the water samples ranged from 0 88 to 0 98 and from 1 21 mm day to 2 62 mm day respectively despite the reported high correlation we argue that the accuracy of the proposed model cannot be evaluated because the study period was limited to the summer of 2019 indeed the efficiency of data driven methods such as machine learning can be examined reliably when sufficient long term training data are used such that the model is trained by the data that are representative of a variety of physical conditions that the system represents over the study period 4 2 temporal variation of the lake water budget components fig 3 shows the monthly volumetric time series of p on the lu e from the lake surface sw into the lake and the spatially averaged gws depth over the lu s surrounding aquifers in the five study periods between september 2017 and may 2020 fig 3a indicates that the volumetric p is 384 mcm 1 14 mm day 222 mcm 0 97 mm day 157 mcm 1 1 mm day 175 mcm 1 27 mm day and 1481 mcm 1 11 mm day in period one to five respectively since the duration of each period is different from one to another we also report p and e values in terms of the average daily rate given in parentheses we observe that on average the largest p rate took place in the first period followed by that in the fourth fifth third and second periods respectively however the same direction of change is not observed in the volumetric p between the periods indeed since the volumetric p is controlled by both the precipitation depth and the lake surface area larger p depth does not necessarily lead to larger volumetric p in those periods when e contributed to the lake shrinkage more effectively this is particularly evident in the fourth period which shows the second smallest volumetric p while the second largest p rate was received as compared to the other periods fig 3b indicates that sw is 970 mcm 483 mcm 340 mcm 600 mcm and 5 934 mcm in period one to five respectively we observe that sw volume in period five is much larger than that in the other periods which may be explained by the longer length of this period to further explore sw variation in the study periods we computed sw in the high flow months between january and may in 2018 2019 and 2020 which is equal to 1 150 mcm 4 083 mcm and 1 916 mcm respectively we observe that sw volume between january and may 2019 is 3 5 and 2 1 times larger than that in the same period in 2018 and 2020 which is due to the massive floods that occurred across the country we note that the volumetric p and sw cannot be directly contrasted to explore basin runoff coefficient because they account for the water body and the terrestrial part of the basin respectively fig 3c shows that in period one to five the volumetric e is 758 mcm 2 mm day 1 584 mcm 5 24 mm day 179 mcm 1 51 mm day 265 mcm 1 9 mm day and 5 631 mcm 3 48 mm day respectively we observe that the volumetric e has an increasing trend in the entire study period which can be explained by the changes in the major meteorological and lake water physical condition since the air temperature shows a decreasing trend not shown here it cannot explain the increasing trend in the volumetric e on the other hand we observe in fig 2b that the lake water density shows a remarkable decreasing trend particularly after november 2018 when the lake water volume increases due to the supply of freshwater from the lake feeding rivers in addition fig 2d indicates that the lake surface area increased by 302 between november 2018 and june 2019 therefore the changes in the lake water density and surface area have imposed a stronger influence on the volumetric e than the meteorological factors we note that no significant trend was found in the wind speed which could potentially influence the observed trend in the volumetric e the cross correlation analysis on the monthly time series of volumetric p and sw reveals that they have a strong correlation of 67 moreover while there is a 70 correlation between the volumetric sw and gws without a lag the volumetric p and gws have an 88 correlation with a one month lag the observed one month lag between the volumetric p and gws is consistent with the findings of javadzadeh et al 2020 who found one month lag between the water table fluctuation in each of the lu s aquifers and p confined to the extent of those aquifers moreover the volumetric e shows a 4 month lag with the volumetric p this is because the peak of p occurs at the end of winter and the beginning of spring while e reaches its peaks during summer when the air temperature is at its maximum value as well as the lake surface area is larger than that in winter 4 3 the role of lake groundwater interaction in the lake total water budget by closing the water budget in each of the study periods lgi is 74 mcm 0 33 mcm day 79 mcm 0 54 mcm day 19 mcm 0 2 mcm day 600 mcm 9 23 mcm day and 3 422 mcm 7 62 mcm day in period one to five respectively lgi is positive in all periods implying the net flux of water from groundwater towards the lake fig 4 further shows the relative share of water budget components in each period separately the results indicate that in spite of the negligible 3 contribution of lgi to the water budget in the first three periods its contribution is remarkably large in the fourth and fifth periods which is equal to 37 and 21 respectively we also find no seasonal pattern in the relative contribution of lgi to the water budget indeed while the first and fourth periods happened in winter there is a 34 difference between the lgi s contribution to the water budget in the two periods it is worth mentioning that in all periods sw s contribution to water budget is larger than that for p and lgi this indicates that sw has the largest contribution to increasing the lu water volume the only period in which the lu experienced shrinkage was the second period in the summer of 2018 when evaporation comprised a majority of the lake water budget in that period to further explore the dynamics of lgi change fig 5 a shows the correlation between gws and p depth we observe that changes in the gws depth is strongly influenced by the p depth as evidenced by the correlation coefficient of 63 on the other hand a strong correlation of 93 is observed between the volumetric lgi and gws depth fig 5b this indicates that the periods with a larger gws depth yield a larger volume of water exchange between groundwater and the lu therefore the lake water level is expected to be largely dependent on lgi or gws fluctuations this finding is further explored in fig 6 a which shows the time series of spatially averaged groundwater level and the lu water level between 2001 and 2017 a couple of points are noteworthy first there is clearly a strong positive correlation between the spatially averaged groundwater level and the lu water level which proves the mechanistic necessity of considering lgi for an appropriate study of the lu water budget fig 6b also illustrates that the monthly gws has a mild increasing trend between september 2017 and may 2020 which is in agreement with the changes in the spatially averaged groundwater level in this period second we observe that while the decreasing trend in the spatially averaged groundwater level was ceased in november 2010 the lu water level responded much later in october 2012 such a time lag is explained by the impact of basin storage capacity that is reflected in the slow pore water velocities and consequently the delayed hydrologic response of the lake to groundwater changes in contrast to the majority of former relevant studies on the lu that ignored lgi e g schulz et al 2020 alizade govarchin ghale et al 2018 the above observations highlight the indispensable role of lgi in studying the lu water budget here we note that a strong correlation of 97 is also observed between the volumetric lgi and sw not shown here this is consistent with the findings of shemshaki and karami 2019 who concluded that surface water resources such as rivers play a major role in feeding groundwater aquifers in the southeastern coastal areas of the lub 4 4 uncertainty of the lake groundwater estimation we generated 1 000 random time series for each of the p e and sw variables in all periods and conducted the latin hypercube sampling to estimate the distribution of lgi using 20 000 samples given the distribution of p e sw and Œ¥v table 2 gives the mean standard deviation and coefficient of variation cv of the input random variables p e sw and Œ¥v in all periods we observe that the uncertainty of p e and sw varies significantly from one period to another this can be explained by the statistical concept behind the method we used to assign pdf to the inputs section 3 3 in this method an original time series with a finer temporal resolution or a wider timespan results in a lower randomness in the generated synthetic time series as such p e and sw random variables indicate the lowest and highest uncertainty in the fifth and fourth periods with the length of 449 days and 65 days respectively given the above information as the input to estimate lgi uncertainty fig 7 compares the pdf of lgi estimations in the five study periods the mean standard deviation cv and the cumulative probability of negative lgi are also shown in this figure we observe that there is a significant difference between the cv of lgi in different periods i e 1 51 0 99 2 83 0 50 and 0 11 in the first to fifth periods respectively the high cv of lgi in a given period arises from the significant uncertainty of the inputs i e p e sw and Œ¥v in that period specifically those inputs that have a larger mean value for instance the larger cv of 1 13 and 1 02 for sw and Œ¥v as compared to the cv of 0 36 and 0 40 for p and e respectively have imposed a stronger influence on the uncertainty of lgi this is because of the larger mean value of sw and Œ¥v than p and e in this period on the other hand in the fifth period where lgi has the lowest uncertainty the cv of Œ¥v sw and p also shows the lowest value in all periods which is equal to 0 14 0 49 and 0 17 respectively fig 7 further demonstrates that in spite of the significant cv of the estimated lgi s the cumulative probability of lgi 0 i e flux of water from the lu to groundwater is insignificant in all periods ranging from 0 001 in the fifth period to 0 35 in the third period in addition fig 7f indicates that a lower mean value and or a larger cv makes the cumulative probability of lgi 0 larger since lgi has a very strong correlation with gws fig 5b the above observation implies that a larger gws in a given period makes the probability of outflux from the lu to groundwater smaller by increasing the mean value of lgi in that period 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of approaches for quantifying the uncertainty of lake groundwater interaction different approaches have been proposed to quantify the water balance uncertainty a traditional method relies on considering the standard deviation or confidence limits around the measured terms as the uncertainty or error of those terms moreira et al 2019 sacks et al 1998 if the residual of the water balance equation such as lgi in equation 1 is a linear function of the other measured components its uncertainty estimate is computed as the sum of the variances in the measured components lee and swancar 1997 depending on the equipment measurement errors or the method used the absolute uncertainty for each component may be a function of other uncertainties that can be quantified separately taylor 1997 the underlying assumption of this approach is that there is no correlation between the measurements of different components winter 1981 also although the standard deviation around each component can be quantified independently a common practice is to use the recommended uncertainties obtained by examining various data and methods in a wide range of case studies e g lee and swancar 1997 wiebe et al 2015 therefore such a quantification is subjective and may yield significant underestimation or overestimation of uncertainty as compared to that obtained by the statistical methods in another approach data from different sources are assimilated for each water balance variable and the uncertainty of that variable is estimated by considering the deviation from the ensemble mean of all data sources for that variable e g zhang et al 2018 these data sources include but not limited to remote sensing reanalysis land surface model in situ measurements etc to merge different products for each water balance component a weighted averaging is used where the weights are determined optimally by computing the error variance of each product against its ensemble mean luo et al 2007 sahoo et al 2011 it is seen that the implementation of this method requires various datasets obtained from independent sources that may be at different spatiotemporal resolutions as such data adjustment should be further applied to ensure consistency in the water balance information at the desired spatial resolution pan et al 2012 another widely used method in hydrology is the triple collocation technique that estimates the rmse of an unknown error using three mutually independent measurement systems stoffelen 1998 this technique does not ask for error free measurement systems and treat the error as a linear model where the errors and the target variable are mutually uncorrelated mccoll et al 2014 also introduced the extended triple collocation technique that further estimates the correlation coefficient between each measurement system and the unknown target variable a few studies have used the three cornered hat method to estimate the error variance of a water budget variable e g he et al 2020 long et al 2017 sjoberg et al 2021 the assumption behind the theory of three cornered hat premoli and tavella 1993 is that the error of observations is normally distributed although this method can estimate the variance of a variable without a priori information of its realistic value it requires at least three independent measurements for the variable which can be difficult to obtain in study areas suffering data scarcity of any types moreover this method only estimates the variable s variance which does not describe the entire distribution of uncertainty in the absence of other statistical measures in comparison to the above methods the unified parent gaussian modeling framework employed in the present study only requires one dataset for each variable in the water budget equation also instead of estimating the variable s variance solely this framework yields a pdf for each water balance variable in addition the general mathematical representation of the framework allows for simulating hydrological processes with both cross and autocorrelations regardless of the relating correlation structure or the prescribed marginal probability function although this framework assumes that a there exists a parent gaussian process for a target process it suggests a straightforward procedure to define the correlation transformation function in a simple parametric way the applicability of this framework to a wide range of hydro climatic processes with intermittency heavy tail or bounded marginals has been demonstrated by papalexiou 2018 5 2 implications to the controversial understanding of lake groundwater interaction in the lake urmia over the recent years the declining level of the lu has been accompanied by the degradation of groundwater quality in some coastal aquifers surrounding the lake this observation has raised controversial discussions about the relationship between the lake water level fluctuations and the quality of interacting aquifers some studies have reported almost no interaction between the two environments due to the existence of clay and fine sediments near the coast they argue that among the coastal plains of the west azerbaijan province the decline of groundwater quality was observed only in the kahriz and qalqachi plains also among the coastal plains of the east azerbaijan province only in the shiramin aquifer is there a possibility of hydraulic connection and saline water exchange between groundwater and the lu these studies further highlight that groundwater salinity in some plains is due to the presence of fossil waters or other sources of saline nutrients such as saline rivers and salt zones ulrp 2015 a careful examination of former research on this issue reveals that only a few studies have conducted a hydrogeochemical analysis on the measurements of isotopic tracers or conservative chemicals to evaluate the potential of the lu saltwater intrusion to groundwater based on the hydrochemical facies evoloution hfe diagram of the 141 groundwater samples collected from shallow deep and hand dug wells across the urmia aquifer during june and september 2014 amiri et al 2016 concluded that due to the existence of fine grain sediments saturated with saltwater in the coastal areas of the lu the lake saltwater cannot permeate into the adjacent groundwater they also stated that if water table in the coastal aquifers experiences a significant decrease the aquifers would be fed by the nearby recharge zones and not the lu in another study amiri et al 2017 used 100 groundwater samples of radon 222 and radium 226 isotopes collected from shallow and deep boreholes and hand dug wells of the urmia aquifer during three sampling periods in june 2014 september 2014 and may 2015 to characterize the hydrogeochemistry of this aquifer they demonstrated that the upper part of the lu bed consists of a salty low permeable layer that impedes saltwater intrusion to groundwater by digging boreholes and collecting water samples from the shabestar aquifer located in the northeast of the lu mehr et al 2019 concluded that due to the impermeable sediments in the area no hydraulic continuity exists between the lu and the aquifer they stated that the paleo entrapped saltwater is the prime cause of the observed salinity in this aquifer in addition mosaffa et al 2020 compared Œ¥ 18 o and Œ¥ 2 h isotopic contents of 130 groundwater samples collected in the azarshahr and shabestar sufyan aquifers located in northeast of the lu during two periods in september 2012 and june july 2013 with the same isotopes collected from rainwater samples to find the source of salinity in the studied aquifers they concluded that rainfall is the main source of groundwater recharge while they did not observe any evidence of the lu saltwater intrusion to groundwater instead dissolution of evaporative rocks was suggested as the main source of salinity in the aquifers by an isotopic and chemical analysis of about 40 samples of Œ¥ 18 o deuterium and tritium collected from different water resources such as rivers wells springs and qanats in both wet and dry seasons of the azarshahr basin located on the eastern coast of the lu amirhosseini et al 2015 found no evidence on saltwater intrusion from the lu into the groundwater resources of the studied area they concluded that the salinity of groundwater is mainly due to the evaporating formations of the area similar conclusion was made in a combined hydrochemistry and isotopic study of agharazi ashtiani et al 2019 for the shabestar sufian aquifers located in the northeastern part of the lu in another effort to investigate the salinization process of groundwater in the shabestar azarshar and shiramin aquifers of the east azerbaijan province balderer et al 2015 conducted chemical and isotope analysis of Œ¥ 18 o Œ¥ 2 h and tritium of 149 samples in groundwater river lake and precipitation in both dry and wet seasons in september 2012 and in june july 2013 respectively regarding the regional hydrogeological setting and the analysis of the chemical and isotope composition they concluded that overexploitation of shallow aquifers may cause the intrusion of trapped saline water and brines of the lu into freshwater aquifers in the shore areas heydarirad et al 2019 analyzed physicochemical parameters from 77 groundwater wells in the azarshahr plain using multivariate statistics and hydrogeochemical analysis they attributed the declining groundwater quality in the study area to a number of factors including fertilizer utilization due to extensive agricultural activity contamination and salinization from irrigation and saltwater up coning from pumping in contrast to the above studies a few other studies suggest that there is an active hydraulic connection between the coastal aquifers and the lu that may cause the intrusion of lake saline water to the aquifers by measuring and analyzing stable isotopes of deuterium and Œ¥ 18 o in groundwater surface water and precipitation of the southeastern coastal regions of the lub shemshaki and karami 2019 showed that significant changes were taking place in the groundwater flow direction from 2006 to 2016 where parts of the coastal area have been exposed to saltwater from the lake bed they found that in may 2006 groundwater was following the general slope of the region from the upper plains of the study area to the lu however a sharp reduction of the zarrineh river contribution to feeding the aquifer as well as a reverse in the direction of groundwater flow from the lake to the shore in the northern and central parts of the study area were observed in may 2016 in the southwest of the study area a change in the direction of groundwater flow from the lake to the miandoab plain was further observed by employing a simplified model for the lu bathymetry and the aquifer geometry sheibani et al 2020 conducted a series of numerical simulations to explore the flow pattern between the lu and groundwater they found that by assuming a low hydraulic permeability for the lu bed under the steady state condition outflux from the lu to the surrounding aquifers is negligible while the reverse seems significant to investigate the possibility of lgi in the lu vaheddoost and aksoy 2017 and javadzadeh et al 2020 also conducted a cross correlation analysis between the water level of the lu and that in the adjacent aquifers from 2001 to 2005 and from 2001 to 2018 respectively in comparison to the lu javadzadeh et al 2020 observed higher water level in 15 out of 17 adjacent aquifers concluding that those aquifers recharge the lake furthermore they found a low probability of saltwater intrusion from lu to groundwater in the studied periods which is consistent with the findings of a few studies mentioned above by synthesizing the findings of the above studies a few points are worth mentioning first the probabilistic quantification of lgi in the present study has revealed that the flow of water from the lu to groundwater is insignificant in all the studied periods which is in agreement with the findings of a majority of aforementioned studies e g amiri et al 2017 amiri et al 2016 mehr et al 2019 amirhosseini et al 2015 agharazi ashtiani et al 2019 balderer et al n d heydarirad et al 2019 in addition a few studies have demonstrated that groundwater feeds the lu continuously e g sheibani et al 2020 javadzadeh et al 2020 vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 which is in accordance with the positive average value of lgi s probability distribution estimated in this study second we clearly observe that even though hydrogeochemical analysis based on the measurements of isotopic tracers and conservative chemicals is considered as the most reliable method to explore the exchange of water between a lake and its adjacent aquifers the past relevant studies on the lu are very limited with respect to the extent of measurements and their time span this suggests that future hydrogeochemical studies in lub should consider a more extensive spatiotemporal measurement and analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of the exchange of water and solutes between the lu and its adjacent aquifers across the whole lake boundary finally although an uncertainty analysis is integral to validating the results of any data driven models the majority of former studies based on these models have not conducted probabilistic modeling due to the complexities involved in estimating the uncertainty of their inputs the uncertainty quantification framework proposed in this study can thus be effectively employed to quantify the uncertainty of the lake water budget components in a relatively simple and reliable manner 6 conclusions an appropriate understanding of the interaction between the lu and its coastal aquifers provides important information to the management of excessive withdrawals from them given information gaps and knowledge about this issue in this study we used ground measurements and remotely sensed data to estimate lgi in the lu in five consecutive study periods from september 2017 to may 2020 to this end we proposed a forward uncertainty propagation framework within the lake water budget context to quantify the estimation uncertainty of the lake water budget components particularly lgi the main findings of this study can be summarized as 1 lgi was positive in all periods ranging from 19 mcm in the third period to 3 422 mcm in the fifth period which implies the net flux of flow from groundwater towards the lu during the study period the cumulative probability of lgi 0 which implies the flow of water from the lu to groundwater was also negligible in all periods ranging from 0 001 in the fifth period to 0 35 in the third period 2 we observed that a lower mean value and or a larger coefficient of variation cv of lgi makes the cumulative probability of lgi 0 larger therefore a larger gws in a given period makes the probability of outflux from the lu to groundwater smaller by increasing the mean of lgi probability distribution due to the strong positive correlation between lgi and gws 3 despite the negligible 3 contribution of lgi to the lake water budget in the first three study periods lgi s contribution in the fourth and fifth periods was 37 and 21 respectively 4 no seasonal pattern was observed in the relative contribution of lgi to the lake water budget 5 the cv of lgi showed a significant statistical difference between different periods ranging from 2 83 in the third period to 0 11 in the fifth period depending on the uncertainty of the other lake water budget components used to estimate lgi our findings on the contribution of lgi to the lake water budget emphasize that future studies aiming at developing a hydrodynamic model of the lu and designing a roadmap to restore the lu should consider lgi and the underlying physical processes that control its rate funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial

3330,the interaction between a lake and groundwater has important implications to the quantity and quality of water in both environments quantification of lake groundwater interaction lgi has been challenging in regions with limited in situ data lgi can be quantified by physically based models direct measurement of seepage measurements of conservative chemical or isotopic tracers and lake water balance despite the accuracy of the methods based on hydrochemical or isotopic measurements and analysis they require extensive field data that are costly to collect in large lakes instead the data required to quantify lgi by the lake water budget method can be obtained via typical ground measurements and satellite remote sensing however the influence on the estimated lgi imposed by the uncertainty associated with the other components of lake water budget e g precipitation evaporation and inflow outflow is still poorly understood in this study we coupled a forward uncertainty propagation framework with the lake water budget to estimate the uncertainty of lgi using latin hypercube sampling we implemented the above framework in the hypersaline lake urmia lu located in the northwestern iran over five consecutive study periods between september 2017 and may 2020 the results revealed the exchange of flow from groundwater to the lu in all studied periods ranging between 0 2 million cubic meters mcm day and 7 6 mcm day the relative contribution of lgi in the water budget varied between 3 and 37 the results of the uncertainty analysis further demonstrated that the cumulative probability of lgi 0 which indicates flow direction from the lu to groundwater was insignificant in all the study periods ranging between 0 001 and 0 35 keywords lake groundwater

chose the hypersaline lake urmia lu located in the northwestern iran as the case study due to its drastic shrinkage between 1995 and 2014 several studies have so far explored the reasons of the lu drying and analyzed the lake restoration e g alborzi et al 2018 moreover extensive activities have been planned and executed by the urmia lake restoration program to help restore the lake to its ecologic level danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 however former studies and the current lake restoration roadmap neglected lgi in the lake water budget due to the lack of evidence on the quantity of lgi in this region as such this study takes one important step towards advancing the current understanding of the lu and groundwater interaction to facilitate lgi prediction in the lu we leveraged the most accurate data to quantify all the lake water budget components except lgi in five continuous study periods between 2017 and 2020 in particular we aimed i to explore the significance of lgi and its distinct contribution to the lu water budget ii to investigate the dynamic of exfiltration from or infiltration to the lu in the study period under contrasting groundwater storage conditions iii to determine the water budget components with the highest correlation with lgi and iv to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated lgi in the study periods we highlight that the proposed framework can be applied to any other environment of interest without the loss of generality the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the study area and give a brief overview of the lu changes over the past two decades due to the impact of climatic and anthropogenic stressors in section 3 we outline the employed methodology to estimate the water budget components including p inflow outflow evaporation and changes in the stored water volume we also present the details of the utilized uncertainty quantification framework in this section in section 4 we present the results by describing the temporal dynamics of the water budget components and determining the contribution of the estimated lgi to the lake water budget in different study periods the results of lgi uncertainty analysis and their interpretations are also presented in this section in section 5 we highlight the advantages of the employed uncertainty analysis framework in comparison to the other existing approaches for quantifying water budget uncertainty we also outline the implications of the results to the current understanding of lgi in the lu by discussing the findings of past relevant studies in the lu finally we summarize the main findings of this study in section 6 2 study area the shallow hypersaline lu located in the northwest of iran is registered as a national park 1971 a ramsar site 1975 and a unesco biosphere reserve 1976 the lu is surrounded by 17 major aquifers and is fed by 15 major rivers fig 1 the lake urmia basin lub is governed by a cold and semi arid climate with an average air temperature of 12 5 c and an average p depth of 300 mm between 1990 and 2019 p shows a large spatial variability across lub the north south oriented mountains in the western side of the region block the westerly air fronts making p vary sharply from west to east vaheddoost and aksoy 2017 as such lub can be divided into three homogenous subregions in terms of long term p depth which includes the central and south eastern regions northern and north eastern regions and western and south western regions fazel et al 2018 the northern and north eastern region receives the lowest amount of annual p and experiences short duration summer rainfalls that are attributed to the formation of local clouds in the summer due to the lu evaporation on the contrary the highest amount of annual p takes place in the western and south western region due to its mountainous terrains spring p accounts for most of the annual p in the lub followed by winter and fall p the average annual volume of water entering the lake from the feeding rivers is 2 400 million cubic meters mcm around 65 of total annual flow into the lu is supplied by the southern rivers i e zarrineh river simineh river gadar chai and mahabad chai the extent of the lu surface area in warm seasons is largely dependent on evaporation because around 60 of the lu s water body is located in the southern part of the lake which is characterized by shallow depths less than 2 m the lake is surrounded by 25 aquifers 14 of which are in the plains around the lake and are recognized by coastal aquifers these aquifers include urmia salmas miandoab naqadeh rashakan mahabad and kahriz in west azerbaijan as well as tasuj shabestar sufyan tabriz azarshahr shiramin malekan ajabshir and maragheh bonab in east azerbaijan in a twenty year period between 1995 and 2014 the lu experienced a drastic decline of 7 8 m 23 billion cubic meters bcm and 2 600 km2 in water level stored volume and surface area respectively several former studies have demonstrated the devastating role of anthropogenic activities in the lu desiccation aghakouchak et al 2015 alizade govarchin ghale et al 2018 chaudhari et al 2018 hosseini moghari et al 2018 moreover the majority of the aquifers around the lu have been depleted mainly due to excessive agricultural water consumption ashraf et al 2017 chaudhari et al 2018 to cease the lake drying and restore it back to its ecological level at 1274 1 m that is 3 m above the lu s water level in the fall 2021 the urmia lake restoration program was established in 2013 and designed a restoration roadmap despite the initial success of the roadmap i e an increase of 2 m in the lake water level from 2015 to 2019 the current planning has been criticized due to the lack of integrity in considering a set of measures that should be taken into account for predicting and evaluating the lu s restoration status appropriately danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 sima et al 2021 3 methods and data 3 1 lake water budget the lake water budget equation was used to quantify the net volumetric rate of lgi l3 t as 1 lgi Œ¥ v Œ¥ t e p s w where lgi 0 stands for the flux of water from the lake to groundwater lgi 0 stands for the flux of groundwater to the lake Œ¥v l3 is the lake water volume change e l3 t is the volumetric rate of evaporation from the lake surface p l3 t is the volumetric rate of direct precipitation on the lake sw l3 t is the volumetric rate of surface water inflow from the feeding rivers and Œ¥t t is the length of the period during which the water budge is closed a negative value of Œ¥v in a given period implies lake shrinkage in that period and vice versa we computed the lake water budget for five consecutive study periods from september 2019 to may 2020 as described in table 1 the length of these periods ranges between 64 days and 448 days these periods were defined based on the six stages at which the most recent bathymetric maps of the lu are available from the study of danesh yazdi et al 2021 3 1 1 lake water volume change Œ¥ v due to the impact of salt precipitation and dissolution in the hypersaline lu the lake bathymetry is dynamic depending on the rate of evaporation and freshwater input as such the temporal change of the lake s stored water volume can be reliably estimated if the changes in the lake bathymetry are known given the dynamic bathymetric maps the lake water volume at the beginning and end of a period was computed by integrating the three dimensional space between the lake water level and its underlying bathymetry as 2 v p b h p b x y d x d y 3 v p e h p e x y d x d y where v p b and v p e are the lake volume at the beginning and end of the period p respectively and h p b x y and h p e x y are the matrices of water depth at the beginning and the end of the period p respectively and x and y are the longitude and latitude of a specific point on the lake surface respectively for each period in table 1 Œ¥ v was computed by subtracting the lake water volume at the end and beginning of the period the bathymetric maps were computed by utilizing extensive in situ hydrography data and high resolution satellite imagery in a machine learning based model the predictive model gives the complex non linear relationship between water depth and satellite recorded surface reflectance data see danesh yazdi et al 2021 for further details 3 1 2 total direct precipitation p and surface water inflow sw volume daily p data at eight synoptic stations surrounding the lu fig 1 were received from i r of iran meteorological organization irimo regarding the spatial distribution of the synoptic stations p depth across the whole lu in a given day was assumed to be the average of p depth at the eight stations to compute the total volume of p falling directly on the lu in a given period we summed the inner product of the time series of daily p depth and the lu s surface area the time series of the lu s surface area was retrieved by the most recent level area relationship developed for the lu by danesh yazdi et al 2021 to compute the volume of sw to the lake we received monthly streamflow data at the closest stations to the lu see fig 1 from the regional water company of west and east azerbaijan provinces 3 1 3 total evaporation volume e we computed the e rate by using four energy balance based evaporation models i e bowen ratio energy balance breb priesty taylor debruin keijman and penman we chose the best e model by contrasting the computed rates against pan e data available at the golmankhaneh station between 2000 and 2015 fig 1 since the above methods are well recognized in the hydrology community we outline the details on the relating formulations in the appendix we used meteorological data recorded at the urmia station fig 1 to compute daily e rate from the above models moreover the lu s surface water temperature data were obtained from modis lst product to compare the results of the above four models with the pan e data we used sea surface temperature data for the tile in which the golmankhaneh station fig 1 is located however to compute the e rate from the whole lake surface area we used the average sea surface temperature for all the tiles covering the entire lu s extent due to the hypersalinity of the lu the computed e rate from the above models should be adjusted to account for the impact of salinity on the saturated vapor pressure oroud 1994 the relationship between the saturated vapor pressure of salty water ebrine and pure water es is given by heidari et al 2010 4 e brine Œ± w e s where Œ± w is the water activity coefficient since there are no data on Œ± w in the lu we used data at the great salt lake spencer et al 1985 as a proxy because both lakes are similar with respect to several characteristics of morphology chemistry and sedimentology wurtsbaugh 2014 to further account for the impact of water density on the e rate we used water density data collected between 2006 and 2016 by the regional water company of west and east azarbaijan provinces we also aggregated these data with the recent measurements conducted by bayati and danesh yazdi 2021 in 2019 given these data we mapped the relationship between the lu water density and volume as illustrated in fig 2 a it is seen that a significant decreasing relationship holds between water density and stored volume in the lu r2 0 65 we used the above relationship to estimate the lu water density on a daily timescale throughout the study periods fig 2b and c show the extracted time series of water density and stored volume between september 2017 and may 2020 respectively 3 2 groundwater data 3 2 1 groundwater table in the lake urmia s surrounding aquifers to compare the fluctuations of groundwater table with the lu s water level in a long period we received monthly time series of groundwater level data from the urmia lake restoration program these data were measured over 797 observation wells across 17 aquifers surrounding the lu between 2000 and 2017 fig 1 shows the geographical location of the aquifers in lub 3 2 2 groundwater storage to further explore the fluctuations in the groundwater storage we used gldas 2 2 groundwater storage product i e gws released in feb 2020 that was obtained by assimilating grace terrestrial water storage product into a catchment land surface model clsm koster et al 2000 the acceptable accuracy of these data at the regional scale has been demonstrated against in situ groundwater anomaly li et al 2019 3 3 uncertainty analysis to evaluate the uncertainty of lgi estimation in each period we employed the forward uncertainty propagation approach which gives the probability distribution function pdf of the model output from that of the model inputs to determine the pdf of an input in the water budget equation we employed the framework proposed by papalexiou 2018 by which we can generate a number of random time series with the same marginal distribution and autocorrelation structure as the input assume x t 0 t t is a stationary stochastic process e g any of the water budget components in equation 1 with the marginal distribution of f x x and autocorrelation structure of œÅx œÑ where t is time t is the length of x t and œÑ is the autocorrelation time lag also assume z t is a parent gaussian process with a standard normal pdf i e n 0 1 and autocorrelation structure of œÅz œÑ now a probability transformation equation can be defined to transform z t into a time series that have the same marginal distribution as x t this transformation equation can be written as 5 x g z q x œï z z t where q x is the quantile function of x and œï z is the probability distribution function of z t furthermore to keep the same autocorrelation structure of x t a particular autocorrelation structure should be assigned to z t to this end œÅz œÑ 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 95 is first defined as a synthetic autocorrection structure of z t then œÅx œÑ is calculated as 6 œÅ x œÑ c Œ∏ x œÅ z œÑ Œº x 2 œÉ x 2 where 7 c Œ∏ x œÅ z œÑ e x t x œÑ e q x œï z z t q x œï z z œÑ q x œï z z t q x œï z z œÑ œÜ z t z œÑ z t z œÑ d z t d z œÑ in these equations Œº x œÉ x 2 are the mean and variance of the random variable x respectively e a is the expected value of the random variable a œÜ z t z œÑ z t z œÑ is the joint pdf of the standard gaussian variates z t z œÑ that is a bivariate gaussian distribution and Œ∏ x is the parameter vector of f x x the pair of œÅ x œÅ z values are interpolated using 8 œÅ z f œÅ x b c 1 b œÅ x 1 c 1 1 b 1 c 1 b 0 c 0 where b and c are the interpolation parameters the autocorrelation structure of x t is imported into equation 8 to obtain the autocorrelation structure of z t using the above approach a desired number of realizations of x t i e y i t 1 i n with the same pdf and autocorrelation structure of x t can be generated where n is the total number of realizations given y i t s s i is defined as 9 s i 0 t y i t d t which is the sum of y i t values between t 0 and t t finally a pdf is fitted to the s i vector by using the maximum likelihood method here we note that since the uncertainty of h p estimation is already known from the machine learning algorithm used to compute the bathymetric maps danesh yazdi et al 2021 the uncertainty of Œ¥ v in equation 1 is quantified by a different approach than that explained above to this end we first decomposed v p into a constant value v p and a random variable Œµ p as 10 v p v p Œµ p where v p is the lake volume at the beginning or end of the study period p and Œµ p is the error in the measurement of v p which is defined as 11 Œµ p e p a p where a p is the lake surface area random variable at the beginning or end of the study period p to account for the uncertainty in a p we assumed a uniform pdf as a u a min a max where a min and a max are the smallest and largest estimation of the lake surface area respectively we calculated a min and a max by assuming that the lake boundary moves u meter inwards or outwards the lake respectively where u is the error in delineating the lake boundary e p can also be described as 12 e p n Œº p œÉ p where Œº p and œÉ p are the mean absolute error mae and the standard deviation of error in the h p estimation respectively given the independence of e p and a p the pdf of Œµ p was constructed by generating a number of h p a p samples through a monte carlo simulation finally given v p e Œµ p and œÉ Œµ p as the standard deviation of Œµ p the pdf of v p is derived as 13 v p n ŒΩ p e Œµ p œÉ Œµ p to implement the above framework in each of our study periods we generated a number of vp b vp e samples to obtain the pdf of Œ¥v given the pdf of vp b and vp e also in order to obtain the pdf of the volumetric p and e in each period we first generated 1 000 synthetic time series of yi t i e p depth e depth and sw time series to obtain their subsequent si then given the pdf of p depth e depth and the average lake surface area a average for each period we conducted a monte carlo simulation to generate 20 000 samples of p depth a average and e depth a average according to the study of danesh yazdi et al 2021 we considered u as 50 m also Œºi and œÉi were quantified as 0 025 cm and 7 75 cm for the first and third bathymetric maps 0 3 cm and 15 2 cm for the second and sixth bathymetric maps and 0 98 cm and 17 8 cm for the fourth and fifth bathymetric maps respectively we performed the above analysis by using the cosmos package in r papalexiou et al 2021 finally we computed the pdf of lgi for a given period by using the pdf of p e sw and Œ¥v through latin hypercube sampling mckay et al 1979 in this method a specified number of samples are first drawn independently for each variable then by using the correlation matrix of the involved variables we employed the nataf transformation der kiureghian and liu 1986 to generate correlated samples although the correlation matrix consists of all pairwise linear correlation coefficients between the variables li et al 2008 xiao 2014 the validity of the approach is not conditioned on the existence of strong correlations between them instead the transformation attempts merely to preserve the dependency of any significance between the variables to determine the minimum sample number for generating the random p t e t and sw t time series which is necessary to achieve a desirable degree of precision in characterizing the mean and standard deviation of p e and sw random variables in each study period we increased the number of trials until the observed fluctuation of the mean and standard deviation of p e and sw stabilized moreover we conducted the same experiment to determine the sufficient number of samples in simulating the lgi random variable given the pdf of p e sw and Œ¥v using the latin hypercube sampling for each period 3 4 cross correlation analysis to determine the cross correlation of lgi with the rest of the water budget components i e Œ¥v p e and sw as well as with gws in the study periods we considered extra 10 periods the start and end dates of these periods are the same as the dates corresponding to two non consecutive periods defined in table 1 for instance we considered the sixth period with 368 days between the start date of the first bathymetric map i e 09 14 2017 and the start date of the third bathymetric map i e 09 17 2018 we added these new periods to ensure that a statistically meaningful number of data were used for the cross correlation analysis 4 results 4 1 the accuracy of evaporation estimation models the root mean square error rmse between the measured e rate and that estimated from the breb priesty taylor debruin keijman and penman method is 39 1 mm month 40 0 mm month 47 6 mm month and 54 7 mm month respectively we observe that the e rate estimated by the breb model gives the best accuracy in terms of rmse we also note that the e volume has an increasing trend of 0 28 mcm yr over the study period regarding a decreasing trend in the air temperature not shown here the elevated e volume is mainly attributed to the increasing lake surface area as well as decreasing lake water salinity as a result of the increased stored volume the advantage of the breb method to estimate e rate from the lu as compared to the other empirical methods and those based on mass balance remote sensing and machine learning has also been demonstrated by other former studies for instance siadatmousavi and seyedalipour 2019 used modified penman breb and dalton methods to estimate the e depth from the lu in 2017 they found a significant bias between the results of the dalton method i e 433 mm with that obtained from the penman and breb methods i e 872 and 800 mm respectively the inconsistency of the results of dalton method with that from the other competing approaches has been proven by the other past studies in which the annual e rate from the lu was reported between 890 mm and 1360 mm e g sima and tajrishy 2015 sima et al 2013 also computed the e depth from the lu in 2009 by using the breb method enforced by the modis water surface temperature data they estimated the total e depth as 1033 mm which is in agreement with the in situ measurement of 1175 mm from the golmankhaneh pan moreover sima and tajrishy 2015 developed a salinity dependent daily evaporation sdde model based on the breb method to estimate the e rate from the lu based on their model the total e depth from april to october 2010 was 1136 mm the e depth determined by the in situ measurements at the golmankhaneh station was equal to 1041 mm in the same period indicating the high accuracy of the breb method this is expected as the energy balance based methods have been considered a benchmark to validate the estimated e rate from other methods particularly in saline lakes stauffer 1991 rosenberry et al 2007 winter et al 2003 in another attempt to estimate the e rate by a mass balance based model kokya and kokya 2008 indicated a significant improvement in the performance of the model by incorporating the impact of salinity however the accuracy of the proposed model cannot be assessed as the study period was limited to only eight days in addition several studies have modified a few remote sensing based methods e g surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal and surface energy balance system sebs to estimate e from free surface waters by employing the sebal model to estimate the e rate from the lu in 2005 mohebzadeh and fallah 2019 found a 32 bias between the estimated annual e depth against in situ measurements sima and khorsand 2018 have further illustrated the low accuracy of sebs and sebal methods in estimating the e rate and its spatiotemporal variation across the lu finally biazar et al 2020 used artificial neural network ann to simulate the e rate by training the model with data from nine water samples with the salinity concentration ranging between 0 2 g l and 500 g l the correlation coefficient and rmse between the estimated daily e rate and that measured from the water samples ranged from 0 88 to 0 98 and from 1 21 mm day to 2 62 mm day respectively despite the reported high correlation we argue that the accuracy of the proposed model cannot be evaluated because the study period was limited to the summer of 2019 indeed the efficiency of data driven methods such as machine learning can be examined reliably when sufficient long term training data are used such that the model is trained by the data that are representative of a variety of physical conditions that the system represents over the study period 4 2 temporal variation of the lake water budget components fig 3 shows the monthly volumetric time series of p on the lu e from the lake surface sw into the lake and the spatially averaged gws depth over the lu s surrounding aquifers in the five study periods between september 2017 and may 2020 fig 3a indicates that the volumetric p is 384 mcm 1 14 mm day 222 mcm 0 97 mm day 157 mcm 1 1 mm day 175 mcm 1 27 mm day and 1481 mcm 1 11 mm day in period one to five respectively since the duration of each period is different from one to another we also report p and e values in terms of the average daily rate given in parentheses we observe that on average the largest p rate took place in the first period followed by that in the fourth fifth third and second periods respectively however the same direction of change is not observed in the volumetric p between the periods indeed since the volumetric p is controlled by both the precipitation depth and the lake surface area larger p depth does not necessarily lead to larger volumetric p in those periods when e contributed to the lake shrinkage more effectively this is particularly evident in the fourth period which shows the second smallest volumetric p while the second largest p rate was received as compared to the other periods fig 3b indicates that sw is 970 mcm 483 mcm 340 mcm 600 mcm and 5 934 mcm in period one to five respectively we observe that sw volume in period five is much larger than that in the other periods which may be explained by the longer length of this period to further explore sw variation in the study periods we computed sw in the high flow months between january and may in 2018 2019 and 2020 which is equal to 1 150 mcm 4 083 mcm and 1 916 mcm respectively we observe that sw volume between january and may 2019 is 3 5 and 2 1 times larger than that in the same period in 2018 and 2020 which is due to the massive floods that occurred across the country we note that the volumetric p and sw cannot be directly contrasted to explore basin runoff coefficient because they account for the water body and the terrestrial part of the basin respectively fig 3c shows that in period one to five the volumetric e is 758 mcm 2 mm day 1 584 mcm 5 24 mm day 179 mcm 1 51 mm day 265 mcm 1 9 mm day and 5 631 mcm 3 48 mm day respectively we observe that the volumetric e has an increasing trend in the entire study period which can be explained by the changes in the major meteorological and lake water physical condition since the air temperature shows a decreasing trend not shown here it cannot explain the increasing trend in the volumetric e on the other hand we observe in fig 2b that the lake water density shows a remarkable decreasing trend particularly after november 2018 when the lake water volume increases due to the supply of freshwater from the lake feeding rivers in addition fig 2d indicates that the lake surface area increased by 302 between november 2018 and june 2019 therefore the changes in the lake water density and surface area have imposed a stronger influence on the volumetric e than the meteorological factors we note that no significant trend was found in the wind speed which could potentially influence the observed trend in the volumetric e the cross correlation analysis on the monthly time series of volumetric p and sw reveals that they have a strong correlation of 67 moreover while there is a 70 correlation between the volumetric sw and gws without a lag the volumetric p and gws have an 88 correlation with a one month lag the observed one month lag between the volumetric p and gws is consistent with the findings of javadzadeh et al 2020 who found one month lag between the water table fluctuation in each of the lu s aquifers and p confined to the extent of those aquifers moreover the volumetric e shows a 4 month lag with the volumetric p this is because the peak of p occurs at the end of winter and the beginning of spring while e reaches its peaks during summer when the air temperature is at its maximum value as well as the lake surface area is larger than that in winter 4 3 the role of lake groundwater interaction in the lake total water budget by closing the water budget in each of the study periods lgi is 74 mcm 0 33 mcm day 79 mcm 0 54 mcm day 19 mcm 0 2 mcm day 600 mcm 9 23 mcm day and 3 422 mcm 7 62 mcm day in period one to five respectively lgi is positive in all periods implying the net flux of water from groundwater towards the lake fig 4 further shows the relative share of water budget components in each period separately the results indicate that in spite of the negligible 3 contribution of lgi to the water budget in the first three periods its contribution is remarkably large in the fourth and fifth periods which is equal to 37 and 21 respectively we also find no seasonal pattern in the relative contribution of lgi to the water budget indeed while the first and fourth periods happened in winter there is a 34 difference between the lgi s contribution to the water budget in the two periods it is worth mentioning that in all periods sw s contribution to water budget is larger than that for p and lgi this indicates that sw has the largest contribution to increasing the lu water volume the only period in which the lu experienced shrinkage was the second period in the summer of 2018 when evaporation comprised a majority of the lake water budget in that period to further explore the dynamics of lgi change fig 5 a shows the correlation between gws and p depth we observe that changes in the gws depth is strongly influenced by the p depth as evidenced by the correlation coefficient of 63 on the other hand a strong correlation of 93 is observed between the volumetric lgi and gws depth fig 5b this indicates that the periods with a larger gws depth yield a larger volume of water exchange between groundwater and the lu therefore the lake water level is expected to be largely dependent on lgi or gws fluctuations this finding is further explored in fig 6 a which shows the time series of spatially averaged groundwater level and the lu water level between 2001 and 2017 a couple of points are noteworthy first there is clearly a strong positive correlation between the spatially averaged groundwater level and the lu water level which proves the mechanistic necessity of considering lgi for an appropriate study of the lu water budget fig 6b also illustrates that the monthly gws has a mild increasing trend between september 2017 and may 2020 which is in agreement with the changes in the spatially averaged groundwater level in this period second we observe that while the decreasing trend in the spatially averaged groundwater level was ceased in november 2010 the lu water level responded much later in october 2012 such a time lag is explained by the impact of basin storage capacity that is reflected in the slow pore water velocities and consequently the delayed hydrologic response of the lake to groundwater changes in contrast to the majority of former relevant studies on the lu that ignored lgi e g schulz et al 2020 alizade govarchin ghale et al 2018 the above observations highlight the indispensable role of lgi in studying the lu water budget here we note that a strong correlation of 97 is also observed between the volumetric lgi and sw not shown here this is consistent with the findings of shemshaki and karami 2019 who concluded that surface water resources such as rivers play a major role in feeding groundwater aquifers in the southeastern coastal areas of the lub 4 4 uncertainty of the lake groundwater estimation we generated 1 000 random time series for each of the p e and sw variables in all periods and conducted the latin hypercube sampling to estimate the distribution of lgi using 20 000 samples given the distribution of p e sw and Œ¥v table 2 gives the mean standard deviation and coefficient of variation cv of the input random variables p e sw and Œ¥v in all periods we observe that the uncertainty of p e and sw varies significantly from one period to another this can be explained by the statistical concept behind the method we used to assign pdf to the inputs section 3 3 in this method an original time series with a finer temporal resolution or a wider timespan results in a lower randomness in the generated synthetic time series as such p e and sw random variables indicate the lowest and highest uncertainty in the fifth and fourth periods with the length of 449 days and 65 days respectively given the above information as the input to estimate lgi uncertainty fig 7 compares the pdf of lgi estimations in the five study periods the mean standard deviation cv and the cumulative probability of negative lgi are also shown in this figure we observe that there is a significant difference between the cv of lgi in different periods i e 1 51 0 99 2 83 0 50 and 0 11 in the first to fifth periods respectively the high cv of lgi in a given period arises from the significant uncertainty of the inputs i e p e sw and Œ¥v in that period specifically those inputs that have a larger mean value for instance the larger cv of 1 13 and 1 02 for sw and Œ¥v as compared to the cv of 0 36 and 0 40 for p and e respectively have imposed a stronger influence on the uncertainty of lgi this is because of the larger mean value of sw and Œ¥v than p and e in this period on the other hand in the fifth period where lgi has the lowest uncertainty the cv of Œ¥v sw and p also shows the lowest value in all periods which is equal to 0 14 0 49 and 0 17 respectively fig 7 further demonstrates that in spite of the significant cv of the estimated lgi s the cumulative probability of lgi 0 i e flux of water from the lu to groundwater is insignificant in all periods ranging from 0 001 in the fifth period to 0 35 in the third period in addition fig 7f indicates that a lower mean value and or a larger cv makes the cumulative probability of lgi 0 larger since lgi has a very strong correlation with gws fig 5b the above observation implies that a larger gws in a given period makes the probability of outflux from the lu to groundwater smaller by increasing the mean value of lgi in that period 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of approaches for quantifying the uncertainty of lake groundwater interaction different approaches have been proposed to quantify the water balance uncertainty a traditional method relies on considering the standard deviation or confidence limits around the measured terms as the uncertainty or error of those terms moreira et al 2019 sacks et al 1998 if the residual of the water balance equation such as lgi in equation 1 is a linear function of the other measured components its uncertainty estimate is computed as the sum of the variances in the measured components lee and swancar 1997 depending on the equipment measurement errors or the method used the absolute uncertainty for each component may be a function of other uncertainties that can be quantified separately taylor 1997 the underlying assumption of this approach is that there is no correlation between the measurements of different components winter 1981 also although the standard deviation around each component can be quantified independently a common practice is to use the recommended uncertainties obtained by examining various data and methods in a wide range of case studies e g lee and swancar 1997 wiebe et al 2015 therefore such a quantification is subjective and may yield significant underestimation or overestimation of uncertainty as compared to that obtained by the statistical methods in another approach data from different sources are assimilated for each water balance variable and the uncertainty of that variable is estimated by considering the deviation from the ensemble mean of all data sources for that variable e g zhang et al 2018 these data sources include but not limited to remote sensing reanalysis land surface model in situ measurements etc to merge different products for each water balance component a weighted averaging is used where the weights are determined optimally by computing the error variance of each product against its ensemble mean luo et al 2007 sahoo et al 2011 it is seen that the implementation of this method requires various datasets obtained from independent sources that may be at different spatiotemporal resolutions as such data adjustment should be further applied to ensure consistency in the water balance information at the desired spatial resolution pan et al 2012 another widely used method in hydrology is the triple collocation technique that estimates the rmse of an unknown error using three mutually independent measurement systems stoffelen 1998 this technique does not ask for error free measurement systems and treat the error as a linear model where the errors and the target variable are mutually uncorrelated mccoll et al 2014 also introduced the extended triple collocation technique that further estimates the correlation coefficient between each measurement system and the unknown target variable a few studies have used the three cornered hat method to estimate the error variance of a water budget variable e g he et al 2020 long et al 2017 sjoberg et al 2021 the assumption behind the theory of three cornered hat premoli and tavella 1993 is that the error of observations is normally distributed although this method can estimate the variance of a variable without a priori information of its realistic value it requires at least three independent measurements for the variable which can be difficult to obtain in study areas suffering data scarcity of any types moreover this method only estimates the variable s variance which does not describe the entire distribution of uncertainty in the absence of other statistical measures in comparison to the above methods the unified parent gaussian modeling framework employed in the present study only requires one dataset for each variable in the water budget equation also instead of estimating the variable s variance solely this framework yields a pdf for each water balance variable in addition the general mathematical representation of the framework allows for simulating hydrological processes with both cross and autocorrelations regardless of the relating correlation structure or the prescribed marginal probability function although this framework assumes that a there exists a parent gaussian process for a target process it suggests a straightforward procedure to define the correlation transformation function in a simple parametric way the applicability of this framework to a wide range of hydro climatic processes with intermittency heavy tail or bounded marginals has been demonstrated by papalexiou 2018 5 2 implications to the controversial understanding of lake groundwater interaction in the lake urmia over the recent years the declining level of the lu has been accompanied by the degradation of groundwater quality in some coastal aquifers surrounding the lake this observation has raised controversial discussions about the relationship between the lake water level fluctuations and the quality of interacting aquifers some studies have reported almost no interaction between the two environments due to the existence of clay and fine sediments near the coast they argue that among the coastal plains of the west azerbaijan province the decline of groundwater quality was observed only in the kahriz and qalqachi plains also among the coastal plains of the east azerbaijan province only in the shiramin aquifer is there a possibility of hydraulic connection and saline water exchange between groundwater and the lu these studies further highlight that groundwater salinity in some plains is due to the presence of fossil waters or other sources of saline nutrients such as saline rivers and salt zones ulrp 2015 a careful examination of former research on this issue reveals that only a few studies have conducted a hydrogeochemical analysis on the measurements of isotopic tracers or conservative chemicals to evaluate the potential of the lu saltwater intrusion to groundwater based on the hydrochemical facies evoloution hfe diagram of the 141 groundwater samples collected from shallow deep and hand dug wells across the urmia aquifer during june and september 2014 amiri et al 2016 concluded that due to the existence of fine grain sediments saturated with saltwater in the coastal areas of the lu the lake saltwater cannot permeate into the adjacent groundwater they also stated that if water table in the coastal aquifers experiences a significant decrease the aquifers would be fed by the nearby recharge zones and not the lu in another study amiri et al 2017 used 100 groundwater samples of radon 222 and radium 226 isotopes collected from shallow and deep boreholes and hand dug wells of the urmia aquifer during three sampling periods in june 2014 september 2014 and may 2015 to characterize the hydrogeochemistry of this aquifer they demonstrated that the upper part of the lu bed consists of a salty low permeable layer that impedes saltwater intrusion to groundwater by digging boreholes and collecting water samples from the shabestar aquifer located in the northeast of the lu mehr et al 2019 concluded that due to the impermeable sediments in the area no hydraulic continuity exists between the lu and the aquifer they stated that the paleo entrapped saltwater is the prime cause of the observed salinity in this aquifer in addition mosaffa et al 2020 compared Œ¥ 18 o and Œ¥ 2 h isotopic contents of 130 groundwater samples collected in the azarshahr and shabestar sufyan aquifers located in northeast of the lu during two periods in september 2012 and june july 2013 with the same isotopes collected from rainwater samples to find the source of salinity in the studied aquifers they concluded that rainfall is the main source of groundwater recharge while they did not observe any evidence of the lu saltwater intrusion to groundwater instead dissolution of evaporative rocks was suggested as the main source of salinity in the aquifers by an isotopic and chemical analysis of about 40 samples of Œ¥ 18 o deuterium and tritium collected from different water resources such as rivers wells springs and qanats in both wet and dry seasons of the azarshahr basin located on the eastern coast of the lu amirhosseini et al 2015 found no evidence on saltwater intrusion from the lu into the groundwater resources of the studied area they concluded that the salinity of groundwater is mainly due to the evaporating formations of the area similar conclusion was made in a combined hydrochemistry and isotopic study of agharazi ashtiani et al 2019 for the shabestar sufian aquifers located in the northeastern part of the lu in another effort to investigate the salinization process of groundwater in the shabestar azarshar and shiramin aquifers of the east azerbaijan province balderer et al 2015 conducted chemical and isotope analysis of Œ¥ 18 o Œ¥ 2 h and tritium of 149 samples in groundwater river lake and precipitation in both dry and wet seasons in september 2012 and in june july 2013 respectively regarding the regional hydrogeological setting and the analysis of the chemical and isotope composition they concluded that overexploitation of shallow aquifers may cause the intrusion of trapped saline water and brines of the lu into freshwater aquifers in the shore areas heydarirad et al 2019 analyzed physicochemical parameters from 77 groundwater wells in the azarshahr plain using multivariate statistics and hydrogeochemical analysis they attributed the declining groundwater quality in the study area to a number of factors including fertilizer utilization due to extensive agricultural activity contamination and salinization from irrigation and saltwater up coning from pumping in contrast to the above studies a few other studies suggest that there is an active hydraulic connection between the coastal aquifers and the lu that may cause the intrusion of lake saline water to the aquifers by measuring and analyzing stable isotopes of deuterium and Œ¥ 18 o in groundwater surface water and precipitation of the southeastern coastal regions of the lub shemshaki and karami 2019 showed that significant changes were taking place in the groundwater flow direction from 2006 to 2016 where parts of the coastal area have been exposed to saltwater from the lake bed they found that in may 2006 groundwater was following the general slope of the region from the upper plains of the study area to the lu however a sharp reduction of the zarrineh river contribution to feeding the aquifer as well as a reverse in the direction of groundwater flow from the lake to the shore in the northern and central parts of the study area were observed in may 2016 in the southwest of the study area a change in the direction of groundwater flow from the lake to the miandoab plain was further observed by employing a simplified model for the lu bathymetry and the aquifer geometry sheibani et al 2020 conducted a series of numerical simulations to explore the flow pattern between the lu and groundwater they found that by assuming a low hydraulic permeability for the lu bed under the steady state condition outflux from the lu to the surrounding aquifers is negligible while the reverse seems significant to investigate the possibility of lgi in the lu vaheddoost and aksoy 2017 and javadzadeh et al 2020 also conducted a cross correlation analysis between the water level of the lu and that in the adjacent aquifers from 2001 to 2005 and from 2001 to 2018 respectively in comparison to the lu javadzadeh et al 2020 observed higher water level in 15 out of 17 adjacent aquifers concluding that those aquifers recharge the lake furthermore they found a low probability of saltwater intrusion from lu to groundwater in the studied periods which is consistent with the findings of a few studies mentioned above by synthesizing the findings of the above studies a few points are worth mentioning first the probabilistic quantification of lgi in the present study has revealed that the flow of water from the lu to groundwater is insignificant in all the studied periods which is in agreement with the findings of a majority of aforementioned studies e g amiri et al 2017 amiri et al 2016 mehr et al 2019 amirhosseini et al 2015 agharazi ashtiani et al 2019 balderer et al n d heydarirad et al 2019 in addition a few studies have demonstrated that groundwater feeds the lu continuously e g sheibani et al 2020 javadzadeh et al 2020 vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 which is in accordance with the positive average value of lgi s probability distribution estimated in this study second we clearly observe that even though hydrogeochemical analysis based on the measurements of isotopic tracers and conservative chemicals is considered as the most reliable method to explore the exchange of water between a lake and its adjacent aquifers the past relevant studies on the lu are very limited with respect to the extent of measurements and their time span this suggests that future hydrogeochemical studies in lub should consider a more extensive spatiotemporal measurement and analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of the exchange of water and solutes between the lu and its adjacent aquifers across the whole lake boundary finally although an uncertainty analysis is integral to validating the results of any data driven models the majority of former studies based on these models have not conducted probabilistic modeling due to the complexities involved in estimating the uncertainty of their inputs the uncertainty quantification framework proposed in this study can thus be effectively employed to quantify the uncertainty of the lake water budget components in a relatively simple and reliable manner 6 conclusions an appropriate understanding of the interaction between the lu and its coastal aquifers provides important information to the management of excessive withdrawals from them given information gaps and knowledge about this issue in this study we used ground measurements and remotely sensed data to estimate lgi in the lu in five consecutive study periods from september 2017 to may 2020 to this end we proposed a forward uncertainty propagation framework within the lake water budget context to quantify the estimation uncertainty of the lake water budget components particularly lgi the main findings of this study can be summarized as 1 lgi was positive in all periods ranging from 19 mcm in the third period to 3 422 mcm in the fifth period which implies the net flux of flow from groundwater towards the lu during the study period the cumulative probability of lgi 0 which implies the flow of water from the lu to groundwater was also negligible in all periods ranging from 0 001 in the fifth period to 0 35 in the third period 2 we observed that a lower mean value and or a larger coefficient of variation cv of lgi makes the cumulative probability of lgi 0 larger therefore a larger gws in a given period makes the probability of outflux from the lu to groundwater smaller by increasing the mean of lgi probability distribution due to the strong positive correlation between lgi and gws 3 despite the negligible 3 contribution of lgi to the lake water budget in the first three study periods lgi s contribution in the fourth and fifth periods was 37 and 21 respectively 4 no seasonal pattern was observed in the relative contribution of lgi to the lake water budget 5 the cv of lgi showed a significant statistical difference between different periods ranging from 2 83 in the third period to 0 11 in the fifth period depending on the uncertainty of the other lake water budget components used to estimate lgi our findings on the contribution of lgi to the lake water budget emphasize that future studies aiming at developing a hydrodynamic model of the lu and designing a roadmap to restore the lu should consider lgi and the underlying physical processes that control its rate funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial

3331,this study proposes a novel flash flood susceptibility prediction framework with a particular emphasis on the extent of imbalance between the number of flooding and non flooding events as majority of the events result in non flooding the class imbalance issue and the magnitude of the imbalance was explored in this study to highlight the uncertain nature of the flooding phenomenon therefore the random forest rf was initially adopted to evaluate five imbalance class distribution scenarios i e 1x 10x 25x 50x 100x non flood events for each x flood event parameter configurations of developed models were determined with the state of the art metaheuristic the cuckoo search cs algorithm the cs rf model showed the highest 0 8455 prediction capability with regards to the area under the receiver operating characteristic auroc once the extent of imbalance was set as 50x the cs rf model was then benchmarked with another bagging i e extra trees and two boosting i e adaptive boosting adaboost and extreme gradient boosting xgboost algorithms all integrated with the cs technique analysis results showed that the cs rf is the most promising tree based machine learning technique in flash flood susceptibility projection for the selected study area according to the predictions a flash flood susceptibility map was generated where 9 35 of the basin was under very high flash flood risk a recently developed model agnostic game theoretical method shapley additive explanations shap was used for anatomizing the flash flood conditioning factors to highlight the contribution of each feature on the incident outcome prediction ensuring the transparency of the model findings overall this study contributes to both theory and practice with particular focus on the model

unrecoverable consequences i e casualties and economic losses as well as having significant impacts on the sustainable development goals through destroying flora and fauna while endangering waterborne diseases ekmekcioƒülu et al 2021 combined effects of climate change and increased imperviousness due to urbanization lead to severe floods in different formations such as flash floods coastal floods fluvial floods etc across the globe in line more than 2 billion people have been imposed as a consequence of the floods resulting in nearly 200 billion economic loss per annum over the last two decades according to the world bank rentschler and salhab 2020 the united states u s is among the most flood experienced countries across the world along with india china indonesia philippines and brazil hu et al 2018 regarding the number of flood affected people the u s is among the most risky countries based on the international investigations such that a total of 350 people were passed away due to the pluvial and fluvial floods between 2008 and 2012 in the country tellman et al 2020 in addition flood affected economic losses are considerably higher in the u s compared to the other countries hu et al 2018 ashley and ashley 2008 highlighted that almost half of the total flood related mortalities are associated with flash floods towards the contiguous u s country scale assessments also showed that the east of the u s is one of the regions that have frequently experienced flood events encompassing the substantial proportion of the flood induced fatalities in the country this can also be explained by the impacts of tropical cyclone related precipitation amounts contributes nearly 30 on annual rainfalls owing to the geographic position of the region khouakhi et al 2017 in alabama the focus area of this research floods are one of the most destructive nature based threats such that the three of the ten most severe hurricanes i e katrina rita and ivan have affected the state significantly shao et al 2019 flash floods occurred in the state of alabama caused more than 15 deaths and 20 injuries along with over 1 billion of property damage over the last two decades ncei 2021 governments have been increasing their budget to combat floods while relevant authorities and research society have accelerated their attempts to abate the potential effects of floods world health organization 2017 flash floods are described as flooding incidents where the increase in runoff is either during or within a few minutes hours of the rainfall that produces the increase doswell 2015 they are mostly originated from the heavy storm events and or extreme incidents took place in nature such as dam breaks or intense debris flow khosravi et al 2018 valeros et al 2020 apart from the nature induced stressors i e topography soil type and lithology anthropogenic factors such as vegetation imperviousness and land use also play a determinant role in the formation of flash floods local communities are frequently caught off guard against hazardous incidents due to the rapid occurrence of flash floods in this regard identification of the pre flood strategies and early diagnosis of the most triggering factors become essential needs many researchers considered the factors with regards to one of the main pillars of flood risk concept i e hazard in which the criteria required to obtain hazardous consequences are easy to find and mostly related to the topographical and hydrological characteristics of the focalized regions hence researchers adopted a plethora of criteria including topographic i e elevation slope aspect curvature topographic wetness index sediment transport index etc climatic i e temperature rainfall storm frequency evapotranspiration etc hydro geologic i e curve number soil group soil moisture lithology etc and anthropogenic i e land use land cover distance to road etc factors for the assessment of flash flood phenomenon aiding to produce flood susceptibility maps mudashiru et al 2021 flood susceptibility is described as the likelihood of flooding incident in a particular region with regards to the local topographical hydrological and meteorological conditions dottori et al 2018 in this vein the flood susceptibility indicates the degree to which an area can be influenced by potential disruptive flooding events santangelo et al 2011 the assessment of flood susceptibility can either be conducted through quantitatively or qualitatively based on the spatial distribution of floods rather than temporal probability pham et al 2020b thus the existing body of flood susceptibility knowledge has recognized the critical role played by quantitative i e artificial intelligence soft computing methods machine learning ml semi quantitative i e multi criteria decision making algorithms or computational approaches i e hydrologic hydraulic and hydrodynamic modelling koc et al 2021 among all the application of ml techniques has gained much momentum over the last decades leading to countless efforts in regards to the utilization of ml algorithms to determine flood prone areas alipour et al 2020 rahman et al 2019 table 1 summarizes some of the recent efforts devoted to ml aided flood susceptibility mapping scholars have broadly implemented various ml tools in flood susceptibility mapping covering both shallow and deep learning applications panahi et al 2021 tehrany et al 2015 first attempts comprised the implementation of base line models such as lr anfis ann and svm whereas the researchers have focalized on the integration of tree based algorithms such as rf and cart in the following years costache et al 2020 ekmekcioƒülu et al 2020 besides the traditional soft computing approaches and tree based algorithms there are a few cross sectional studies that suggest the application of deep learning techniques in flood susceptibility in the recent literature here dnn tien bui et al 2020 dbn shahabi et al 2021 and lstm fang et al 2021 were employed to determine flood prone areas for various regions in addition advances in modern modelling techniques have also facilitated the usage of optimization techniques in the flood susceptibility mapping domain thus more recent attention has focused on the provision of hyperparameter tuning strategies via both classical i e grid search and bayesian optimization or state of the art meta heuristic algorithms such as ga arora et al 2021 pso tien bui et al 2019 and gwo darabi et al 2021b based on the diligent investigation on past research efforts several research gaps were identified and focalized in this research major research gaps and corresponding objectives of the study can be summarized as follows the primary purpose of the current research is to integrate the class imbalance concept into the flood susceptibility prediction exemplified by the flash flood phenomenon despite vast studies on flood susceptibility predictions performances of the adopted ml models under imbalance data scenarios have not been investigated in the literature in this sense different class imbalance strategies were considered to mimic the real world conditions but at the cost of a decrease in model accuracies this study compared the performances of tree based ensemble ml models i e two for bagging and two for boosting coupled with the cuckoo search cs algorithm researchers widely used some of the tree based methods while comparison of tree based methods coupling with cs for hyperparameter tuning is an initial attempt in the literature accordingly the flash flood susceptibility map of the study area was generated based on the outcomes of the best performed ml strategy ml methods are mostly regarded as black box models which poses a significant challenge in model interpretability hence this research was dedicated to fill another gap in the literature regarding the interpretability of the susceptibility prediction in this context a recently proposed game theory based approach namely shapley additive explanations shap was employed to examine the contributions of each feature on each output prediction overall integration of imbalance concept is expected to present more robust and reliable flash flood susceptibility map while model interpretability can provide confidence and visibility regarding the underlying causes of the analysis findings with the methodological and practical perspectives developed in this study a novel lens to the field of flood susceptibility assessments can assist researchers and practitioners generate more robust and interpretable flash flood susceptibility maps the remaining part of the paper proceeds as follows section 2 materials containing the description of study area 2 1 flash flood conditioning factors

the introduction of flash flood inventory map of the study area to compare the results obtained with the past flooding events section 2 3 respectively 2 1 study area this study was applied to the black warrior river basin located in alabama u s the basin which is the largest basin within the entire boundaries of alabama state covers the surface of 16 250 km2 the basin drains the northcentral of alabama being part of 17 counties across the state the length of the river is nearly 286 km and a total of 15 tributaries adjoins the black warrior river afshari et al 2018 the river starts from collecting the water of forested areas extended at the extreme southern end of the appalachian mountains while it flows across the forests of the coastal plain by passing downtown of tuscaloosa the largest city ascends the river black warrior 2021 the majority of the basin contains the urban landscapes along with forested areas with a small portion the highest point in the basin has an altitude of 472 m while the lowest point has elevated at 12 m fig 1 the alabama state s climate is temperate with an average temperature of 18 c reaching about 26 c in summers and decreasing to 9 c in winters the annual rainfall of the state is about 1 420 mm and the hurricane induced conditions are experienced during warmer months starting from the coast to the northern regions norrell and gomillion 2021 in a similar vein the coastal counties of alabama stand among the risky regions in terms of climatic conditions the compound effects of infrastructural exposure and population growth which was more than 6 during the last decade along with the storm surges further affect the susceptibility of the state against climate basis hazards kc et al 2021 it is important to note that there is one levee and two dams constructed on the river to deal with flash floods playing a disincentive role through their flow regulatory features and backwater effects during extreme events afshari et al 2018 2 2 flash flood conditioning factors designation of the appropriate geospatial information related to the topographical and hydrological characteristics of the regions inducing hazardous consequences is essential to remediate flood risk properly in this context plenty of topographic climatic hydro geologic and anthropogenic factors were considered in the literature to produce flood susceptibility maps in this study a thorough literature survey was conducted and the main drivers of flash floods were determined leading to a total of 14 geo environmental flash flood conditioning factors as shown in fig 2 i e elevation slope aspect plan curvature profile curvature drainage density distance to river curve number rainfall normalized difference vegetation index topographic wetness index topographic roughness index sediment transport index and stream power index the utilized input features were mapped in raster format with a resolution of 30 m 30 m by using arcgis 10 3 software esri 2016 the digital elevation model dem was derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm through a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m usgs 2021 it is well documented that elevation is one of the most important factors in flood susceptibility mapping and there is an inverse proportional relationship between the elevation and flood occurrence as most of the flooding events take place in low elevated areas panahi et al 2021 in addition the slope is another significant morphometric factor to determine flood prone areas in this study the information regarding the slope criterion was explored by means of the digital elevation model similar to the elevation the slope is inversely correlated with the flooding processes such that the slope angle controls the spreading speed of surface runoff and flat areas were associated with flood risk by scholars rahman et al 2019 this study also derived the spatial information of the aspect plan curvature profile curvature drainage density distance to river by means of the digital elevation model aspect has a significant impact on soil moisture content dodangeh et al 2020 and the saturated soils are expected to contribute more to the surface runoff compared to the dry soils that are generally located over sunny slopes costache and tien bui 2019 plan curvature and profile curvature are other key determinants in flood susceptibility assessments such that they are strongly related to the budget of the flooded water keith et al 2010 tien bui et al 2020 drainage density is another influential factor in flood susceptibility such that the higher the drainage densities the lower the probability of flooding events distance to river refers to the more likelihood of flooding in areas closer to the river while the areas far from the river are vice versa note that the euclidean distance module in arcgis 10 3 was used for the extraction of distance to river map in this research esri 2016 one other class of the major determinant factors is curve number which is used for the identification of imperviousness perviousness of a region curve number incapsulates the combined information on hydrological characteristics containing land use land cover soil type and soil moisture koc et al 2021 in this study we acquired the curve number information for the black warrior river basin by using the global gridded curve numbers gcn250 provided by jaafar et al jaafar et al 2019 rainfall is a prerequisite of flood as can be seen from several theories on the origin of flood mapping studies tay≈üi and √∂zgerm 2021 data related to the rainfall was acquired from the surface water data for the nation interface usgs 2021 in terms of annual average values a total of nine climatic stations data containing the annual average rainfalls recorded between 1989 and 2021 was adopted and the final rainfall map was generated through the inverse distance weighting idw method with a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m by arcgis 10 3 software esri 2016 in addition the relevant information on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was retrieved from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis terra v6 product many scholars have showed the inverse relationship between ndvi and flooding processes as the likelihood of flooding decreases once the vegetation density increases in a particular region dodangeh et al 2020 kumar and acharya 2016 topographic wetness index twi also known as soil wetness index is another major driver considered in flood susceptibility assessments which represents the accumulation of water quantitatively based on the gravity effect and strongly correlated with the soil moisture patterns in a region naito and cairns 2011 topographic roughness index tri is associated with the local topographic conditions of a watershed and has inverse relationship between flooding processes here lower tri values indicate more likelihood of flooding occurrence and vice versa for the higher values talukdar et al 2020 sediment transport index sti manifests the capability of storing water in the river cross sections small sediment transportation rates lead to clogging of the particular cross section by sediment accumulation and this can increase the flood risk sti is based on the unit stream power theory such that it is represented as a non linear function of geomorphologic i e slope and hydro climatic i e specific discharge characteristics of a region bannari et al 2017 besides the capacity of sediment transfer of a stream was explained by the stream power index spi factor and a semi empirical method is used to estimate the sedimentation ratio in watershed serving the flood susceptibility assessment overall the correlation matrix showing the relationship between included factors are shown in fig 3 2 3 flash flood inventory mapping identification of the past locations that have experienced flood events is a leading issue in predicting future events aiding to generate flood inventory mapping as addressed by many scholars costache et al 2021 2020 nhu et al 2020 saha et al 2021 wang et al 2021 this study examined the flood inventory records based on the dataset acquired from the national centers for environmental information ncei of the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa according to the storm events database of ncei a total of 172 point based flash flood inundated locations were obtained in the black warrior river basin between 2000 and 2020 flash flood points pertaining to the historical data records were diligently investigated according to the satellite images via google earth and a flood inventory map was generated through arcgis 10 3 interface esri 2016 regarding the determination of non flooded points the class imbalance between flooding and non flooding incidents was taken into account to typify the real life conditions considering that the number of non flooding locations is far more than the number of flood inundated locations in a particular region this approach is purely different from the entire literature as the background on this issue points toward the selection of the same number of random non flooding points as the flooding points avand et al 2021 bui et al 2018 chapi et al 2017 costache et al 2020 costache and tien bui 2019 prasad et al 2021 tien bui et al 2016 it is worth mentioning that the non flooding locations were assigned randomly by means of the create random points tool of arcgis 10 3 software esri 2016 details regarding the number of non flooding locations selection are presented in the following sections 3 research methodology the current research aims to illustrate the effectiveness of hybrid ml models in the estimation of flash flood events considering the added value of class imbalance distributions therefore in this section we first introduced the framework of the research applied section 3 1 which is followed by data pre processing steps section 3 2 applied ml models and the optimization technique section 3 3 performance indicators indicating the accuracy of the models section 3 4 and the interpretability of the prediction respectively 3 1 research framework this section summarizes the procedures adopted within the scope of this research in order to achieve the study objective accordingly this research was designed to propose a comprehensive prediction model for the early detection of areas that are prone to flash flood events with a particular focus on the existence of imbalance in the number of flooding and non flooding incidents in other words whether a location in a particular region is flash flooded or not binary classification is the primary focus of the application the plethora of the flood prediction studies in the literature focus on generating random non flood event locations as much as the number of flood events collected from related institutions for the binary classification i e flooded vs non flooded however the imbalance between the number of flooding and non flooding events should be addressed by analysing its legitimacy since non flooding events occur more frequently compared to flooding events in most regions around the world fig 4 illustrates the five step methodology adopted to achieve the study objective as a preliminary step a dataset comprising flood events occurred between 2000 and 2020 in alabama u s was attained from the ncei features influential to flood susceptibility were ensured via a comprehensive literature survey leading to 14 flood conditioning factors to predict flood prone locations this step was followed by the comparative analysis of five imbalanced data scenarios in this context for each flood event i same number of non flooding event 1x ii 10 times non flooding events 10x iii 25 times non flooding events 25x iv 50 times non flooding events 50x and v 100 times non flooding events 100x were randomly generated since the range unit or extent of the data attributed to each feature could vary from others data scaling was applied in the second step of the analysis to abate incorrect classification interpretations through standardscaler function of the scikit learn library in python 3 8 pedregosa et al 2011 this step was followed by splitting the training 70 and testing sets 30 of the 5 normalized datasets i e size of imbalance 1x 10x 25x 50x and 100x since the output labels were imbalanced to draw a practical baseline training sets of the generated datasets need further treatment with resampling techniques in this study the random under sampling rus technique was utilized to turn the imbalanced training sets into balanced in order to prevent bias towards the majority class non flood in which otherwise the majority of the non flood instances might be predicted correctly but erroneously it should be noted that the rus was not applied to the testing set to highlight the class imbalance issue between flood and non flood instances commonly encountered in practice the imbalanced learn library of python 3 8 was utilized to deal with class imbalance issue lema√Ætre et al 2017 in the next step the performances of the 5 datasets were compared by applying random forest rf method in which the parameters were optimized through the cs algorithm during cs implementation five fold cross validation was applied to the training set 70 to determine the optimum parameter configurations of the rf algorithm for each dataset and the model performances were compared based on the blinded testing set 30 once the most powerful imbalanced data scenario has been selected via the rf algorithm the cs rf results were benchmarked with other tree based ml algorithms i e extra trees adaboost and xgboost note that the rf et and adaboost applications were carried out through the ensemble methods library of python 3 8 pedregosa et al 2011 while the predictions with xgboost were performed by xgboost package chen and guestrin 2016a in addition sklearn nature inspired algorithms library of python 3 8 was used for cs application pedregosa et al 2011 with the most powerful imbalance strategy and ml method the contribution of each feature to each prediction was examined with a game theory approach namely shap in the subsequent step of the proposed framework a model agnostic approach could generate shapley values to probe into the interpretability of the ml methods lack of which has been a central criticism to the prediction studies in the literature in this study shap library of python 3 8 was utilized to perform feature importance analysis subjected to the most powerful ml model lundberg and lee 2017 finally a flood susceptibility map of the concentrated study area the black warrior river basin was generated by using jenks natural break method to highlight potential areas that are likely to encounter flood events in future 3 2 data pre processing this study adopted two consecutive steps for data pre processing data scaling and data resampling values of numerical features affecting flood susceptibility could vary regarding units ranges magnitudes and contexts thus the standard scaler method was employed for the normalization which relies on the idea that the new distribution is generated not only with a standard deviation of 1 but also with a mean value of 0 eq 1 1 z x m s where m is the feature mean s is the feature standard deviation x is the initial value of an instance of a feature and z is the standardized value this study further explored the effects of imbalance datasets on flash flood susceptibility prediction hence along with the balanced dataset of the number of flooded and non flooded points the extent of imbalance between flooding and non flooding events was also addressed within the context of four alternative scenarios 10x 25x 50x and 100x hence 10 times 25 times 50 times and 100 times as many non flooding points were randomly created as the number of flood points respectively although this approach boosted the practical contribution of the study its contribution can be limited unless the training set is not balanced otherwise developed models could predict all the presented instances as non flooded with significantly high accuracies hence the imbalance between flooding and non flooding classes should be incorporated in testing sets while training sets are further required to be resampled despite this approach has not been adopted in past flood susceptibility prediction studies the literature on other research domains addressed two most commonly used data resampling algorithms random oversampling ros and random under sampling rus samples in the minority class are randomly replicated in the ros algorithm while that of the majority class are randomly excluded from the dataset in the rus algorithm until the class distribution is balanced many researchers highlight that the major disadvantages of these methods are overfitting problem in the ros algorithm while the elimination of the useful data in the rus algorithm kalamatianos et al 2018 it is important to note that the excess of the majority class non flooded was generated randomly in this study which does not include much of a useful data additionally computational load is significantly higher in the ros compared to the rus algorithm which is particularly important when parameter optimization is also of concern accordingly the rus algorithm was utilized as a resampling method and applied to training sets only to address class imbalance issue in this study 3 3 model development 3 3 1 machine learning algorithms a considerable amount of literature exists in the water resources domain regarding the utilization of ml algorithms this study comprises the application of four widely used tree based ensemble approaches i e rf and extremely randomized trees et as bagging and adaptive boosting adaboost and extreme gradient boosting xgboost as boosting algorithms to spatially detect flash flood susceptible locations in the black warrior river basin alabama u s and correspondingly to produce the susceptibility map of the region this study adopted tree based approaches since they have an advanced capability in presenting information on causal effects during prediction process making these methods highly interpretable while addressing complex problems due to the time consuming feature and overfitting problems especially encountered in solving the complex problems bagging and boosting algorithms were proposed to increase the accuracy of single decision trees rf is based on the combination of two advanced techniques i e bagging and bootstrapping to acquire satisfactory classification performance in which the first gathers the decision of multivariate trees while the latter is utilized for generating various sub training sets referred also as random sub space to designate the best branched variable in the corresponding leaf node breiman 2001 apart from the ability to deal with overfitting rf can be intertwined with different statistical approaches such as survival analysis and unsupervised learning elmahdy et al 2020 and provide the importance levels of the attributes during modelling complex interactions between predictors et a supervised tree based ensemble ml algorithm is another member of the bagging family unlike rf et divides each node by considering completely random cut points that are attained for each attribute in the input space to split the nodes to reach the optimum tree structure ahmad et al 2018 this results in less computational complexity along with more tree diversity also instead of bootstrap replication et benefits from the entire learning instances to grow the generated trees over another commonly practiced tree based ensemble approach covers the boosting algorithms one class of the boosting techniques utilized in this study i e adaboost is based on the utilization of weak classifiers to reach accurate classification performance weak classifiers are picked according to the bias errors and formerly mis classified samples are used to improve the training of weak classifiers thus the weights of mis classified instances obtained at each iteration are boosted to ensure that the next classifier increases the accuracy of the model by correctly classifying the mis classified data samples this iterative process helps minimize the exponential loss function and makes the model less sensitive to the outliers that exist in many datasets unlike the voting rule embraced in bagging algorithms adaboost finds the final output of estimation by averaging the weak learners outputs the xgboost which was also adopted in this study was proposed to enhance the predictive performance of the gradient boosting decision trees with the integration of various regularization techniques chen and guestrin 2016b through an iterative process the xgboost creates sequential decision trees by means of the tree parallelization since it is capable of switching between inner and outer loops while creating the basic learners basically outer loops constitute the leaves of a decision tree while the inner loops compute the features however parallelization is limited due to the fact that the outer loops cannot be terminated before the inner loops are terminated that is the leaves of the tree cannot be formed without calculating the features in addition xgboost can perform depth search first algorithm used in tree structures this algorithm allows searching from the randomly starting node to the reachable deepest node when there is no deeper node left to receive the algorithm rewinds and pursues navigating by prioritizing deep nodes 3 3 2 cuckoo search yang and deb 2009 first proposed the cs algorithm inspired by the feeding and breeding habits of the cuckoo birds rajabioun 2011 further took the pioneering role for cs algorithm by formulating it as an optimization technique in practice cuckoo birds take their eggs into the host nest and the baby cuckoo is taken in by a host bird until it becomes a mature cuckoo when the agent egg maturates it immigrates to another habitat to start breeding and the newly mature egg starts following the same procedure that its parent has already done note that the term habitat can be considered the equivalent of commonly known terms i e chromosome and particle position referred to in genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization respectively in the optimization the matrix containing the randomly determined candidates is created and a certain number of eggs is allocated to each bird by determining the highest and lowest limits in the algorithm the cuckoos lay these eggs at the maximum possible distance from their natural environment called the egg laying radius overall as a reflection of the breeding phenomena that originated in nature the cs algorithm starts with identifying the center of the cuckoo bird groups followed by determining the distances of cuckoo birds to the center and adjusting the updated center point of groups based on the relocated cuckoos khan et al 2021 note that the second and third steps are repeatedly performed until the center points become stabilized 3 4 performance evaluation criteria validation is an essential part of flood susceptibility prediction studies as the scientific value of the attained results is limited without validation there are many performance evaluation indicators to validate the analysis results four fundamental statistical measures are used in binary classification true positive tp true negative tn false positive fp and false negative fn brief definition of these metrices are as follows tp it indicates the number of correctly classified cases in the positive label i e actual flood predicted flood tn it shows the number of correctly classified cases in the negative label i e actual non flood predicted non flood fp it depicts the number of incorrectly classified negative cases i e actual non flood predicted flood fn it represent the number of incorrectly classified positive cases i e actual flood predicted non flood according to these four measures accuracy acc precision or positive predictive value ppv recall rc and f1 score f can be calculated acc is measured by the number of correct classifications tp t n divided by the total number of instances tp f n f p t n acc is a widely used measure but it is only representative if the output labels are balanced allah bukhsh et al 2020 another widely used evaluation metric i e ppv identifies the exactness of the model which is defined by the ratio of correctly classified positive instances tp to the total number of positively classified instances tp f p on the contrary rc also known as true positive rate calculated through the ratio of correctly classified positive instance tp to the total number of actual positive instances tp f n measures the completeness of the model hence ppv focuses on the false positives while rc emphasizes the false negatives in the performance evaluation allah bukhsh et al 2020 finally f1 score is calculated as an overall evaluation metric through the harmonic average of ppv and rc accordingly the f measure is calculated as follows chen et al 2018 2 f 2 p p v r c ppv r c in this study the area under receiver operating characteristic auroc was primarily used to examine the robustness of the adopted methods since the area under curve auc is not sensitive to imbalanced class distribution and is widely accepted for binary classification purposes chi et al 2020 choi et al 2020 xie and qiu 2007 false positive rate fpr and true positive rate tpr are plotted on the horizontal x and vertical y axes and correspondingly the auc can be calculated which makes the interpretation of the results easier tpr is the same as rc whereas fpr is the ratio of incorrectly classified positive instances fp to the total number of negatively classified instances fp tn hence auc indicates how reliably the model classifies two output labels flood and non flood in this study chen et al 2018 auc value of 0 5 represents unskilled prediction while 1 indicates a perfect matched model supposing that receiver operating characteristic curve if constituted by attaching x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x m y m the auc is computed by using the following formula feng et al 2020 yang et al 2019 3 auc 1 1 m m x m x m f x f x 1 2 f x f x where m and m are positive and negative examples m and m are set of all positive and negative classes x and x are positive and negative classes respectively in the formula f x defines the result of prediction model sample x 3 5 model interpretability with shapley additive explanations shap shap is a game theoretical approach initially developed to evaluate the impact of a player in a collaborative game shapley 1953 the recent improvement for interpreting black box ml methods by lundberg and lee 2017 namely shap addresses the contribution of each feature on each prediction outcome shap an emerging but embryonic nascent feature importance model enables more stable transparent and consistent feature rankings than previous feature importance methods ransom et al 2021 hence we draw a shap summary plot to present the relationship between flood susceptibility factors and flood events thus providing transparency and confidence to the flood risk management entities 4 results based on the constructed comprehensive framework the first issue that is essential to designate is the determination of optimum imbalance data handling strategy which is presented in section 4 1 afterwards this study introduced the application and the results obtained through the ml techniques based on the diagnosed imbalance strategy section 4 2 this section also contains the interpretability of the ml models with the shap algorithm and the generation of the flash flood susceptibility map of the study area in sections 4 3 and 4 4 respectively 4 1 optimum imbalance data handling strategy this study compared the performances of five randomly generated non flood datasets to highlight the extent of the imbalance in flood susceptibility prediction the rf method was adopted and inertial parameters were tuned through the cs metaheuristic optimization algorithm comparative analysis of the extent of imbalance with respect to the precision recall f1 score and auc is shown in table 2 the results show that the cs rf developed with the size of imbalance 1 cs rf 1 outweighed other models regarding recall 0 7885 and auc 0 8627 as expected similarly cs rf 100 outperformed others in terms of precision 0 9870 and f1 score 0 8467 due to the extent of inordinate class distribution however the auc value 0 8317 and separated recall 0 0291 and f1 score 0 0561 of flood class in the model cs rf 100 were the poorest interestingly despite the recall value of cs rf 25 model showed the most powerful prediction accuracy 0 8448 the overall recall value of the model was the lowest 0 6930 many researchers used auc value for imbalanced and or binary classification problem while f1 score illustrates the combination of precision and recall cs rf 1 achieved the highest auc value highlighting the highest classification performance however the balanced class distribution between the flooding and non flooding events is not practical hence might pose an erroneously powerful prediction performance here cs rf 50 showed the second highest prediction performance regarding the auc 0 8455 while the f1 score of the model was higher than that of cs rf 1 with 0 8195 compared to 0 7885 table 2 therefore the size of imbalance was determined as 50 which might envisage the practical utilization of the study while addressing the high classification power 4 2 tree based ml applications the size of imbalance was set to 50x in this study according to the results of the cs rf application in the subsequent step the applicability and performance of the rf method were investigated by the comparison between other tree based ml methods i e et adaboost and xgboost in this context the same training and testing sets as separated for determining the extent of imbalance were acquired and used to perform a fair comparison parameter configurations of each method were searched within 1 000 combinations based on two common parameters such as the number of estimators and maximum depth for the bagging algorithms rf and et while the number of estimators and learning rate for the boosting methods adaboost and xgboost other inertial parameters such as the minimum number of samples minimum child weight etc were identified through the trial and error approach and included in the cs algorithm as the fixed parameters search space of the number of estimators was between 50 and 1 000 with a pace of 50 while the maximum tree depth was scanned between 1 and 50 with a step of 1 table 3 the learning rate of the boosting methods was also set between 0 01 and 0 50 with a pace of 0 01 note that the random state was considered as 0 in all the optimization scenarios fig 5 illustrates the process of cs optimization attained from the optimization logs the results present that the rf model converged at the 84th candidate with a corresponding iteration of 46 while it was the 161st candidate corresponding to the 72nd generation in et predictions regarding the adaboost and xgboost methods the highest accuracies were obtained at the 146th and 154th candidates with the corresponding iterations of 111 and 109 respectively table 3 shows the optimized parameters of the adopted ml methods optimum parameters of the rf were 200 and 2 for the number of estimators and the maximum depth while they were 150 and 6 in et application respectively on the other hand a lower number of estimators i e number of trees 50 showed the highest accuracies in boosting methods whereas the learning rate was optimized at 0 1 and 0 01 for the adaboost and xgboost respectively it is essential to note that only training sets were utilized with regards to five fold cross validation to determine the optimum parameters of the tree based algorithms as for the performance comparison of the adopted ml methods unresampled and blinded testing sets were taken into account table 4 analysis results showed multi tier performances of ml methods such that the cs xgboost outweighed its counterparts regarding precision 0 9763 while the cs et was the most powerful method with regards to recall 0 7401 and the f1 score 0 8336 for the individual evaluation of the correct flash flood point predictions recall the cs et and cs rf showed the same and highest prediction accuracy of 0 7647 fig 6 depicts the overall performance scheme with reference to the auc values the findings illustrate that the cs rf outperformed others with an auc value of 0 8455 followed by the cs xgboost 0 8429 and cs et 0 8344 one of the definite judgments of this study is that the cs adaboost was the weakest classifier for flash flood susceptibility prediction showing the poorest performance based on any evaluation metrics with reference to the literature on the binary classification of imbalanced datasets highlighting the auc performance metric chi et al 2020 choi et al 2020 xie and qiu 2007 cs rf was concluded to be the most powerful tree based ensemble method to classify flash flood events aiding to develop flash flood susceptibility map 4 3 importance levels of the flash flood conditioning factors ml methods are commonly regarded as black box models hindering their interpretability on how the predictions are made a recent model agnostic game theoretical feature importance approach the shap enables the understanding of the contributions of each feature on the model outputs fig 7 illustrates the summary plot of shap analysis providing a plot with features on the vertical axis y axis and shapley values on the horizontal axis x axis each point in the figure denotes an individual classification with respect to the corresponding feature while the red points refer to the high value of the features blue stands for the low value of the features in addition if the point is placed at the right side of the figure positive of the shapley values it indicates that the classification was likely to be made regarding flash flooded whereas negative of the shapley values denote that the prediction was likely to be made as non flash flooded another advantage of the shap summary plot is that it also provides a ranking of features the upper the features positioned in the figure the higher the contributions of the features to flash flood susceptibility prediction the results show that the curve number was the most influential attribute affecting flash flood susceptibility and the higher the value of curve number red dots the more likelihood of that location to experience flash flood event right side and vice versa the second third and fourth most contributor factors of the flash flood phenomenon were determined as normalized difference vegetation index slope and drainage density high values of all attributes were associated with the low level of flash flood susceptibility while the low attribute values present the higher flash flood susceptibility relatively linear transitions can be observed from the features low values to their high values purple dots between blue and red except the slope criterion in contrast to the other two both high red and medium purple feature values of the slope imply low flash flood susceptibility other influential features were yearly average rainfall and aspect showing an opposite direction to flood susceptibility such that high and low values of aspect and rainfall are associated with the high flash flood susceptibility level respectively 4 4 flash flood susceptibility mapping this study found the integrated cs rf method as the best performed strategy for flash flood susceptibility assessment in the black warrior river basin compared to the cs et cs adaboost and cs xgboost therefore the predictions of the cs rf method were used for the flood susceptibility map generation based on the findings obtained through the cs rf method the jenks natural break method was applied via arcgis 10 3 interface esri 2016 fig 8 depicts the attained map comprising the areas categorized into five different classes i e very low low moderate high and very high as the vast majority of the scholars followed the same manner avand et al 2021 band et al 2020 el haddad et al 2021 the findings revealed that the very low susceptible 0 0 172 surface areas to the flash flooding covers 48 62 of the entire basin while the low 0 173 0 364 susceptible areas were found as 21 21 of the basin the results showed that the significant portion of the entire basin is under low susceptibility in terms of flash flooding incidents in addition the results indicated that 11 53 of the entire basin is expected to be affected by flash flooding moderately 0 365 0 549 the figure also depicts that the likelihood of flash flooding was high 0 550 0 768 for 9 29 while the very high 0 769 1 flash flood susceptible zones cover 9 35 mostly located at the north east parts of the basin from the findings of flash flood susceptibility assessment one can observe the good match between the historically flash flood inundated locations and the high and very high likelihood of flood inundated zones acquired as a result of the cs rf hybrid model 5 discussions this section discussed the adopted methodology within the scope of the present research by comparing the framework with the past efforts in the pertinent literature first section 5 1 and then the most determinant flash flood conditioning factors were assessed based on the findings emerged from the shap application section 5 2 in section 5 3 the limitations of the study and future research directions were highlighted to provide a transparent overview 5 1 assessment of the adopted methodology in the current study the applicability of the four tree based ml approaches all coupled with the cs algorithm was explored for the flash flood susceptibility assessment in the black warrior river basin there are some resemblances and differences based on the comparison between the generic of this study and the existing body of knowledge in the field as shown in table 5 the scholars have applied many ml models to spatially derive flood susceptibility of various study domains in mostly provincial county and watershed scales in addition past literature has divergently introduced the applicability of different basis of ml methods for flood susceptibility mapping such as anfis by ahmadlou et al 2019 and arora et al 2021 and tree based algorithms reptree m5p rt by talukdar et al 2020 recent attempts by fang et al 2021 and panahi et al 2021 also showed the implementation of deep learning methods in flood susceptibility assessments it is worth mentioning that the peculiarity of this study comes from the fact that it is the first attempt providing the comparison of the performances of bagging and boosting methods majority of the scholars have taken many hyperparameter tuning strategies into account by implementing ga de pso bbo ca iwo ica fa however this study adopted another time efficient but overlooked meta heuristic shehab et al 2017 i e cs algorithm to acquire the optimal model configurations one of the significant issues in ml applications is the identification of the most determinant factors in flood susceptibility mapping several method based approaches have been proposed in the literature such as rf based arora et al 2021 rahmati and pourghasemi 2017 and mlp based costache and tien bui 2019 while some others adopted entropy based fang et al 2021 talukdar et al 2020 or expert knowledge based implementations ahmadlou et al 2019 panahi et al 2021 even though these techniques have commonly been used by researchers they mainly rely on the utilized models principles statistical assumptions or subjective judgment of the experts this study used a recent model agnostic interpretability technique namely shap in this regard the impacts of variations in the numerical values of input features on the classification results can be observed and the interpretability of the models is increased through understanding the key roles of each input on the flash flooding occurrence the integration of class imbalance issue in the number of flooding and non flooding events is another novelty and practical contribution of this study to accomplish this reformist approach we used different class imbalance scenarios by incorporating one of the most reliable resampling techniques rus to better represent the nature of the flash flood occurrence mechanism besides differences and contrasts this study also poses some similarities with the existing literature which can be summarized as follows i applying the commonly considered splitting strategy 70 30 to divide the original dataset into different groups for model training and validation ii benefiting from the information of widely used flood conditioning factors iii limiting the study area to a one location such as a watershed province city etc we hope that the research society and practitioners will benefit from the methodological contributions of this study 5 2 assessment of the most determinant factors this study applied the game theory based shap method to provide the importance levels of the inputs elucidating the causal effects of the flash flood incidents the findings illustrate that the curve number played the most influential role in the estimation of flash floods in the selected study domain it is well established from a variety of studies that the increase in curve number represents the increase in impervious layers causing significant flooding even in storm events pertaining to the low recurrence intervals in the pertinent literature there are a few attempts that include the curve number in the input space darabi et al 2021a 2021b ma et al 2019 norallahi and seyed kaboli 2021 while the scholars mainly considered the land use land cover criterion to explain the perviousness imperviousness of study domains on the one hand norallahi and seyed kaboli 2021 and ma et al 2019 also found curve number among the most important criteria in line with this study on the other hand several studies concluded that the land use land cover outperformed other factors in terms of feature importance to explain flood events arabameri et al 2020b costache and tien bui 2019 tehrany et al 2015 the second order most important factor was found as ndvi according to the shap analysis results here the decrease in the ndvi values is associated with the increase in the flash flood occurrences in the study area this can also be supported based on the relationship between the historical flash floods especially in the east and northeast parts of the basin fig 1 and the produced map for ndvi fig 2 the findings highlight that the impact of dense vegetation minimizes the number of flooding incidents in a similar manner several cross sectional studies can be found in the literature that put forward ndvi as among the most important factors in flood susceptibility assessments arabameri et al 2020a bui et al 2020 prasad et al 2021 the model interpretability analysis conducted in this research also showed that the slope plays a vital role in flash flood occurrences in the black warrior river basin the flat areas are more prone to flash flooding phenomenon in the study domain by catching a huge volume of runoff since the spread of the water is not allowed due to their morphometric conditions thus this outcome is also congruent with the relevant literature as the slope has been found to be extremely influencing flood occurrences in a wide spectrum of studies abedi et al 2021 costache et al 2021 pham et al 2020a rahmati and pourghasemi 2017 another significant finding acquired from the shap results is related to the drainage density criterion in which the increase in drainage density has a positive impact on the probability of flash flood incidents as the poor drainage system entails the risk of lagging infrastructural condition arabameri et al 2020a zhao et al 2019 regarding rainfall among the most influential attributes there is a distinction between the evidence of this study and the existing body of knowledge regarding the impact of the factor based on the shap analysis the decrease in rainfall has resulted in more susceptibility to flooding this controversy finding can be explained by the exiguousness in the alterations observed in the annual average rainfall values minimum 1221 78 mm and maximum 1441 4 throughout the extent of the selected study region the amount of rainfall is relatively lower particularly in the central north and northwest of the basin fig 2 however these areas experienced an important portion of the past flash floods fig 1 the reason behind the fewer flood occurrences in the regions that received more amount of precipitation might also be related to the constructed levee and dams to regulate flows afshari et al 2018 thus the potential impacts of heavy storm events might have been precluded before they turn into overflow resulting in inundation within the vicinity of these zones the same conclusion can also be made for the elevation criterion the existing body of literature highlighted that the lower the elevation the higher the probability of flooding however in our case higher elevated areas were found as more susceptible to flash flooding the reason of this contraposition could be strongly related to the constructed water structures on the black warrior river mostly located in lower elevated zones regulating the flow through levee and dams help these regions stand the flooding incidents off in this regard overall the major findings that emerged from the current research can be used by flood management authorities especially for not only determining the spatial distribution of flash flood susceptible zones but also for identifying the triggering factors in the characterization of flash floods it is also worth mentioning that this study will help professionals to locate potential flash flooded zones with easy to find topographical hydro meteorological and environmental criteria this research included a broad set of hazard related criteria containing flash flood conditioning factors and investiggated the contribution of each factor in the localization of flash floods however encapsulating vulnerability related determinants i e socio demographic cultural societal and anthropogenic factors will elevate the analysis scope from the hazard assessments to risk assessments aiding to be a remedy for ascertaining potential mitigation strategies against the unintended consequences of floods 5 3 limitations and future work the efforts made in this research have mainly dedicated to exhibit the vitality of taking the class imbalance issue into the consideration in the flash flood susceptibility assessments which is principally the nature based phenomenon having the potential to result in serious consequences once it consolidated to the man made stressors as from data collection the conceptual framework adopted in this research covers the implementation of pre processing with class imbalance processing with tree based ensemble ml methods coupled with the meta heuristic hyperparameter tuning and post processing through the generation of final flash flood susceptibility map along with presenting model interpretability together with the novelties presented this research is not free of limitations regarding the employed methods and to the inherent research question for instance this study examined the relationships between flash flood predictors and flash flooded locations using the shap approach however examining the spatial dependence not only to measure the spatial autocorrelations but also for distinguishing the spatial clusters and outliers perihanoƒülu and karaman 2020 could enhance the evaluations before the predictions also the ml models considered in this study are limited to the tree based ensemble algorithms while only one optimization algorithm was integrated for hyperparameter tuning it is also important to note that this study focalized the rf method to select the most robust class imbalance scenario then the rf method was benchmarked with other tree based ml methods with the extent of imbalance that achieved the highest accuracy in rf method which might be biased against other adopted tree based methods et adaboost xgboost hence further studies can focus on which ml methods yield the highest prediction accuracy with which class imbalance scenario in addition only the rus technique was executed to address class imbalance issue in the training set in these regards the interested researchers are suggested to include deep learning methods whether to find improvements in the accuracies and advised to use more optimization techniques to abate the uncertainties that exist in the ml models besides illustrating the usability of different resampling techniques may further disclose new research attempts not only for flood modelling but also for other natural hazards additionally vulnerability and exposure assessments could make these analyses more comprehensive in terms of investigating the degree of loss to a given set of elements at flood risk resulting from the negative impacts of flooding and consequences that a person or community members undergo azad et al 2013 gomez cunya et al 2022 therefore additional value of vulnerability factors might also make a valuable contribution to the extent of flood related predictions as a fertile for future extensions in addition this study included nine meteorological stations considering the data availability and covered study area to retrieve the rainfall raster map however increasing the number of climatic stations would help to enhance the accuracy of the produced map this study provides a valuable basis for supporting the development of flood risk mitigation strategies however attained results have not been discussed with practitioners from the study domain which if considered can add significant value to the practice therefore future research can be directed towards the discussion of the findings specific to the study area with experienced practitioners after flood susceptibility prediction finally illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks on different study domains particularly in developing countries could navigate the corresponding studies to be more robust and make them practically widespread 6 concluding remarks in this study we examined the extent of imbalance in the class distribution of flooded and non flooded events for flash flood susceptibility analysis through a set of ml applications the rf method was initially used to evaluate five imbalanced data scenarios i e 1x 10x 25x 50x 100x despite the ml methods have widely been used in flood susceptibility studies the extent of imbalance has not been examined in any of the previous attempts accordingly the size of imbalance showing the most powerful prediction was found as the multiplication of the number of flooded points with 50 addressing that extreme skewness in the class distribution can also provide high accuracies by reflecting the real life dynamics of flash flood phenomenon with the imbalanced dataset that showed the highest prediction power the performances of four tree based ml methods i e rf et adaboost xgboost were compared it is worth to note that all models were coupled with a state of the art optimization technique the cs algorithm for determining the optimal model configurations according to the analysis results the integrated cs rf method was deduced to be the most powerful tree based ensemble method optimization and ml processes were practices on the training set while the performance measurement was performed with blinded testing set to support practical utilization of the proposed research one of the most substantial contributions of this study is that a game theoretical approach namely shap was adopted to anatomize the attributes influential to flash flood susceptibility the shap algorithm not only provided the most determinant features but also delineated flash flood events causal effects by exploring the impacts of each feature on each prediction case the shap algorithm results highlighted the curve number normalized difference vegetation index slope and drainage density as the most influential factors to interpret flash flood prediction finally a flash flood susceptibility map of the black warrior river basin was developed based on the prediction outcomes we believe that the results and analysis procedures followed in this study can be used explicatively for the development of robust flood risk management strategies besides this study is also expected to make a valuable contribution to theory by highlighting the existence of imbalance in the flood susceptibility studies as well as the importance of model interpretability credit authorship contribution statement √∂mer ekmekcioƒülu conceptualization methodology software formal analysis

3331,this study proposes a novel flash flood susceptibility prediction framework with a particular emphasis on the extent of imbalance between the number of flooding and non flooding events as majority of the events result in non flooding the class imbalance issue and the magnitude of the imbalance was explored in this study to highlight the uncertain nature of the flooding phenomenon therefore the random forest rf was initially adopted to evaluate five imbalance class distribution scenarios i e 1x 10x 25x 50x 100x non flood events for each x flood event parameter configurations of developed models were determined with the state of the art metaheuristic the cuckoo search cs algorithm the cs rf model showed the highest 0 8455 prediction capability with regards to the area under the receiver operating characteristic auroc once the extent of imbalance was set as 50x the cs rf model was then benchmarked with another bagging i e extra trees and two boosting i e adaptive boosting adaboost and extreme gradient boosting xgboost algorithms all integrated with the cs technique analysis results showed that the cs rf is the most promising tree based machine learning technique in flash flood susceptibility projection for the selected study area according to the predictions a flash flood susceptibility map was generated where 9 35 of the basin was under very high flash flood risk a recently developed model agnostic game theoretical method shapley additive explanations shap was used for anatomizing the flash flood conditioning factors to highlight the contribution of each feature on the incident outcome prediction ensuring the transparency of the model findings overall this study contributes to both theory and practice with particular focus on the model interpretability and existence of imbalance in the occurrence of flash flood events assisting decision makers in enhancing strategies to combat hazardous impacts of floods keywords artificial intelligence flash flood susceptibility geographic information system gis imbalance data machine learning shapley additive explanations shap flood risk management 1 introduction floods lead to unrecoverable consequences i e casualties and economic losses as well as having significant impacts on the sustainable development goals through destroying flora and fauna while endangering waterborne diseases ekmekcioƒülu et al 2021 combined effects of climate change and increased imperviousness due to urbanization lead to severe floods in different formations such as flash floods coastal floods fluvial floods etc across the globe in line more than 2 billion people have been imposed as a consequence of the floods resulting in nearly 200 billion economic loss per annum over the last two decades according to the world bank rentschler and salhab 2020 the united states u s is among the most flood experienced countries across the world along with india china indonesia philippines and brazil hu et al 2018 regarding the number of flood affected people the u s is among the most risky countries based on the international investigations such that a total of 350 people were passed away due to the pluvial and fluvial floods between 2008 and 2012 in the country tellman et al 2020 in addition flood affected economic losses are considerably higher in the u s compared to the other countries hu et al 2018 ashley and ashley 2008 highlighted that almost half of the total flood related mortalities are associated with flash floods towards the contiguous u s country scale assessments also showed that the east of the u s is one of the regions that have frequently experienced flood events encompassing the substantial proportion of the flood induced fatalities in the country this can also be explained by the impacts of tropical cyclone related precipitation amounts contributes nearly 30 on annual rainfalls owing to the geographic position of the region khouakhi et al 2017 in alabama the focus area of this research floods are one of the most destructive nature based threats such that the three of the ten most severe hurricanes i e katrina rita and ivan have affected the state significantly shao et al 2019 flash floods occurred in the state of alabama caused more than 15 deaths and 20 injuries along with over 1 billion of property damage over the last two decades ncei 2021 governments have been increasing their budget to combat floods while relevant authorities and research society have accelerated their attempts to abate the potential effects of floods world health organization 2017 flash floods are described as flooding incidents where the increase in runoff is either during or within a few minutes hours of the rainfall that produces the increase doswell 2015 they are mostly originated from the heavy storm events and or extreme incidents took place in nature such as dam breaks or intense debris flow khosravi et al 2018 valeros et al 2020 apart from the nature induced stressors i e topography soil type and lithology anthropogenic factors such as vegetation imperviousness and land use also play a determinant role in the formation of flash floods local communities are frequently caught off guard against hazardous incidents due to the rapid occurrence of flash floods in this regard identification of the pre flood strategies and early diagnosis of the most triggering factors become essential needs many researchers considered the factors with regards to one of the main pillars of flood risk concept i e hazard in which the criteria required to obtain hazardous consequences are easy to find and mostly related to the topographical and hydrological characteristics of the focalized regions hence researchers adopted a plethora of criteria including topographic i e elevation slope aspect curvature topographic wetness index sediment transport index etc climatic i e temperature rainfall storm frequency evapotranspiration etc hydro geologic i e curve number soil group soil moisture lithology etc and anthropogenic i e land use land cover distance to road etc factors for the assessment of flash flood phenomenon aiding to produce flood susceptibility maps mudashiru et al 2021 flood susceptibility is described as the likelihood of flooding incident in a particular region with regards to the local topographical hydrological and meteorological conditions dottori et al 2018 in this vein the flood susceptibility indicates the degree to which an area can be influenced by potential disruptive flooding events santangelo et al 2011 the assessment of flood susceptibility can either be conducted through quantitatively or qualitatively based on the spatial distribution of floods rather than temporal probability pham et al 2020b thus the existing body of flood susceptibility knowledge has recognized the critical role played by quantitative i e artificial intelligence soft computing methods machine learning ml semi quantitative i e multi criteria decision making algorithms or computational approaches i e hydrologic hydraulic and hydrodynamic modelling koc et al 2021 among all the application of ml techniques has gained much momentum over the last decades leading to countless efforts in regards to the utilization of ml algorithms to determine flood prone areas alipour et al 2020 rahman et al 2019 table 1 summarizes some of the recent efforts devoted to ml aided flood susceptibility mapping scholars have broadly implemented various ml tools in flood susceptibility mapping covering both shallow and deep learning applications panahi et al 2021 tehrany et al 2015 first attempts comprised the implementation of base line models such as lr anfis ann and svm whereas the researchers have focalized on the integration of tree based algorithms such as rf and cart in the following years costache et al 2020 ekmekcioƒülu et al 2020 besides the traditional soft computing approaches and tree based algorithms there are a few cross sectional studies that suggest the application of deep learning techniques in flood susceptibility in the recent literature here dnn tien bui et al 2020 dbn shahabi et al 2021 and lstm fang et al 2021 were employed to determine flood prone areas for various regions in addition advances in modern modelling techniques have also facilitated the usage of optimization techniques in the flood susceptibility mapping domain thus more recent attention has focused on the provision of hyperparameter tuning strategies via both classical i e grid search and bayesian optimization or state of the art meta heuristic algorithms such as ga arora et al 2021 pso tien bui et al 2019 and gwo darabi et al 2021b based on the diligent investigation on past research efforts several research gaps were identified and focalized in this research major research gaps and corresponding objectives of the study can be summarized as follows the primary purpose of the current research is to integrate the class imbalance concept into the flood susceptibility prediction exemplified by the flash flood phenomenon despite vast studies on flood susceptibility predictions performances of the adopted ml models under imbalance data scenarios have not been investigated in the literature in this sense different class imbalance strategies were considered to mimic the real world conditions but at the cost of a decrease in model accuracies this study compared the performances of tree based ensemble ml models i e two for bagging and two for boosting coupled with the cuckoo search cs algorithm researchers widely used some of the tree based methods while comparison of tree based methods coupling with cs for hyperparameter tuning is an initial attempt in the literature accordingly the flash flood susceptibility map of the study area was generated based on the outcomes of the best performed ml strategy ml methods are mostly regarded as black box models which poses a significant challenge in model interpretability hence this research was dedicated to fill another gap in the literature regarding the interpretability of the susceptibility prediction in this context a recently proposed game theory based approach namely shapley additive explanations shap was employed to examine the contributions of each feature on each output prediction overall integration of imbalance concept is expected to present more robust and reliable flash flood susceptibility map while model interpretability can provide confidence and visibility regarding the underlying causes of the analysis findings with the methodological and practical perspectives developed in this study a novel lens to the field of flood susceptibility assessments can assist researchers and practitioners generate more robust and interpretable flash flood susceptibility maps the remaining part of the paper proceeds as follows section 2 materials containing the description of study area 2 1 flash flood conditioning factors

the introduction of flash flood inventory map of the study area to compare the results obtained with the past flooding events section 2 3 respectively 2 1 study area this study was applied to the black warrior river basin located in alabama u s the basin which is the largest basin within the entire boundaries of alabama state covers the surface of 16 250 km2 the basin drains the northcentral of alabama being part of 17 counties across the state the length of the river is nearly 286 km and a total of 15 tributaries adjoins the black warrior river afshari et al 2018 the river starts from collecting the water of forested areas extended at the extreme southern end of the appalachian mountains while it flows across the forests of the coastal plain by passing downtown of tuscaloosa the largest city ascends the river black warrior 2021 the majority of the basin contains the urban landscapes along with forested areas with a small portion the highest point in the basin has an altitude of 472 m while the lowest point has elevated at 12 m fig 1 the alabama state s climate is temperate with an average temperature of 18 c reaching about 26 c in summers and decreasing to 9 c in winters the annual rainfall of the state is about 1 420 mm and the hurricane induced conditions are experienced during warmer months starting from the coast to the northern regions norrell and gomillion 2021 in a similar vein the coastal counties of alabama stand among the risky regions in terms of climatic conditions the compound effects of infrastructural exposure and population growth which was more than 6 during the last decade along with the storm surges further affect the susceptibility of the state against climate basis hazards kc et al 2021 it is important to note that there is one levee and two dams constructed on the river to deal with flash floods playing a disincentive role through their flow regulatory features and backwater effects during extreme events afshari et al 2018 2 2 flash flood conditioning factors designation of the appropriate geospatial information related to the topographical and hydrological characteristics of the regions inducing hazardous consequences is essential to remediate flood risk properly in this context plenty of topographic climatic hydro geologic and anthropogenic factors were considered in the literature to produce flood susceptibility maps in this study a thorough literature survey was conducted and the main drivers of flash floods were determined leading to a total of 14 geo environmental flash flood conditioning factors as shown in fig 2 i e elevation slope aspect plan curvature profile curvature drainage density distance to river curve number rainfall normalized difference vegetation index topographic wetness index topographic roughness index sediment transport index and stream power index the utilized input features were mapped in raster format with a resolution of 30 m 30 m by using arcgis 10 3 software esri 2016 the digital elevation model dem was derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm through a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m usgs 2021 it is well documented that elevation is one of the most important factors in flood susceptibility mapping and there is an inverse proportional relationship between the elevation and flood occurrence as most of the flooding events take place in low elevated areas panahi et al 2021 in addition the slope is another significant morphometric factor to determine flood prone areas in this study the information regarding the slope criterion was explored by means of the digital elevation model similar to the elevation the slope is inversely correlated with the flooding processes such that the slope angle controls the spreading speed of surface runoff and flat areas were associated with flood risk by scholars rahman et al 2019 this study also derived the spatial information of the aspect plan curvature profile curvature drainage density distance to river by means of the digital elevation model aspect has a significant impact on soil moisture content dodangeh et al 2020 and the saturated soils are expected to contribute more to the surface runoff compared to the dry soils that are generally located over sunny slopes costache and tien bui 2019 plan curvature and profile curvature are other key determinants in flood susceptibility assessments such that they are strongly related to the budget of the flooded water keith et al 2010 tien bui et al 2020 drainage density is another influential factor in flood susceptibility such that the higher the drainage densities the lower the probability of flooding events distance to river refers to the more likelihood of flooding in areas closer to the river while the areas far from the river are vice versa note that the euclidean distance module in arcgis 10 3 was used for the extraction of distance to river map in this research esri 2016 one other class of the major determinant factors is curve number which is used for the identification of imperviousness perviousness of a region curve number incapsulates the combined information on hydrological characteristics containing land use land cover soil type and soil moisture koc et al 2021 in this study we acquired the curve number information for the black warrior river basin by using the global gridded curve numbers gcn250 provided by jaafar et al jaafar et al 2019 rainfall is a prerequisite of flood as can be seen from several theories on the origin of flood mapping studies tay≈üi and √∂zgerm 2021 data related to the rainfall was acquired from the surface water data for the nation interface usgs 2021 in terms of annual average values a total of nine climatic stations data containing the annual average rainfalls recorded between 1989 and 2021 was adopted and the final rainfall map was generated through the inverse distance weighting idw method with a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m by arcgis 10 3 software esri 2016 in addition the relevant information on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was retrieved from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis terra v6 product many scholars have showed the inverse relationship between ndvi and flooding processes as the likelihood of flooding decreases once the vegetation density increases in a particular region dodangeh et al 2020 kumar and acharya 2016 topographic wetness index twi also known as soil wetness index is another major driver considered in flood susceptibility assessments which represents the accumulation of water quantitatively based on the gravity effect and strongly correlated with the soil moisture patterns in a region naito and cairns 2011 topographic roughness index tri is associated with the local topographic conditions of a watershed and has inverse relationship between flooding processes here lower tri values indicate more likelihood of flooding occurrence and vice versa for the higher values talukdar et al 2020 sediment transport index sti manifests the capability of storing water in the river cross sections small sediment transportation rates lead to clogging of the particular cross section by sediment accumulation and this can increase the flood risk sti is based on the unit stream power theory such that it is represented as a non linear function of geomorphologic i e slope and hydro climatic i e specific discharge characteristics of a region bannari et al 2017 besides the capacity of sediment transfer of a stream was explained by the stream power index spi factor and a semi empirical method is used to estimate the sedimentation ratio in watershed serving the flood susceptibility assessment overall the correlation matrix showing the relationship between included factors are shown in fig 3 2 3 flash flood inventory mapping identification of the past locations that have experienced flood events is a leading issue in predicting future events aiding to generate flood inventory mapping as addressed by many scholars costache et al 2021 2020 nhu et al 2020 saha et al 2021 wang et al 2021 this study examined the flood inventory records based on the dataset acquired from the national centers for environmental information ncei of the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa according to the storm events database of ncei a total of 172 point based flash flood inundated locations were obtained in the black warrior river basin between 2000 and 2020 flash flood points pertaining to the historical data records were diligently investigated according to the satellite images via google earth and a flood inventory map was generated through arcgis 10 3 interface esri 2016 regarding the determination of non flooded points the class imbalance between flooding and non flooding incidents was taken into account to typify the real life conditions considering that the number of non flooding locations is far more than the number of flood inundated locations in a particular region this approach is purely different from the entire literature as the background on this issue points toward the selection of the same number of random non flooding points as the flooding points avand et al 2021 bui et al 2018 chapi et al 2017 costache et al 2020 costache and tien bui 2019 prasad et al 2021 tien bui et al 2016 it is worth mentioning that the non flooding locations were assigned randomly by means of the create random points tool of arcgis 10 3 software esri 2016 details regarding the number of non flooding locations selection are presented in the following sections 3 research methodology the current research aims to illustrate the effectiveness of hybrid ml models in the estimation of flash flood events considering the added value of class imbalance distributions therefore in this section we first introduced the framework of the research applied section 3 1 which is followed by data pre processing steps section 3 2 applied ml models and the optimization technique section 3 3 performance indicators indicating the accuracy of the models section 3 4 and the interpretability of the prediction respectively 3 1 research framework this section summarizes the procedures adopted within the scope of this research in order to achieve the study objective accordingly this research was designed to propose a comprehensive prediction model for the early detection of areas that are prone to flash flood events with a particular focus on the existence of imbalance in the number of flooding and non flooding incidents in other words whether a location in a particular region is flash flooded or not binary classification is the primary focus of the application the plethora of the flood prediction studies in the literature focus on generating random non flood event locations as much as the number of flood events collected from related institutions for the binary classification i e flooded vs non flooded however the imbalance between the number of flooding and non flooding events should be addressed by analysing its legitimacy since non flooding events occur more frequently compared to flooding events in most regions around the world fig 4 illustrates the five step methodology adopted to achieve the study objective as a preliminary step a dataset comprising flood events occurred between 2000 and 2020 in alabama u s was attained from the ncei features influential to flood susceptibility were ensured via a comprehensive literature survey leading to 14 flood conditioning factors to predict flood prone locations this step was followed by the comparative analysis of five imbalanced data scenarios in this context for each flood event i same number of non flooding event 1x ii 10 times non flooding events 10x iii 25 times non flooding events 25x iv 50 times non flooding events 50x and v 100 times non flooding events 100x were randomly generated since the range unit or extent of the data attributed to each feature could vary from others data scaling was applied in the second step of the analysis to abate incorrect classification interpretations through standardscaler function of the scikit learn library in python 3 8 pedregosa et al 2011 this step was followed by splitting the training 70 and testing sets 30 of the 5 normalized datasets i e size of imbalance 1x 10x 25x 50x and 100x since the output labels were imbalanced to draw a practical baseline training sets of the generated datasets need further treatment with resampling techniques in this study the random under sampling rus technique was utilized to turn the imbalanced training sets into balanced in order to prevent bias towards the majority class non flood in which otherwise the majority of the non flood instances might be predicted correctly but erroneously it should be noted that the rus was not applied to the testing set to highlight the class imbalance issue between flood and non flood instances commonly encountered in practice the imbalanced learn library of python 3 8 was utilized to deal with class imbalance issue lema√Ætre et al 2017 in the next step the performances of the 5 datasets were compared by applying random forest rf method in which the parameters were optimized through the cs algorithm during cs implementation five fold cross validation was applied to the training set 70 to determine the optimum parameter configurations of the rf algorithm for each dataset and the model performances were compared based on the blinded testing set 30 once the most powerful imbalanced data scenario has been selected via the rf algorithm the cs rf results were benchmarked with other tree based ml algorithms i e extra trees adaboost and xgboost note that the rf et and adaboost applications were carried out through the ensemble methods library of python 3 8 pedregosa et al 2011 while the predictions with xgboost were performed by xgboost package chen and guestrin 2016a in addition sklearn nature inspired algorithms library of python 3 8 was used for cs application pedregosa et al 2011 with the most powerful imbalance strategy and ml method the contribution of each feature to each prediction was examined with a game theory approach namely shap in the subsequent step of the proposed framework a model agnostic approach could generate shapley values to probe into the interpretability of the ml methods lack of which has been a central criticism to the prediction studies in the literature in this study shap library of python 3 8 was utilized to perform feature importance analysis subjected to the most powerful ml model lundberg and lee 2017 finally a flood susceptibility map of the concentrated study area the black warrior river basin was generated by using jenks natural break method to highlight potential areas that are likely to encounter flood events in future 3 2 data pre processing this study adopted two consecutive steps for data pre processing data scaling and data resampling values of numerical features affecting flood susceptibility could vary regarding units ranges magnitudes and contexts thus the standard scaler method was employed for the normalization which relies on the idea that the new distribution is generated not only with a standard deviation of 1 but also with a mean value of 0 eq 1 1 z x m s where m is the feature mean s is the feature standard deviation x is the initial value of an instance of a feature and z is the standardized value this study further explored the effects of imbalance datasets on flash flood susceptibility prediction hence along with the balanced dataset of the number of flooded and non flooded points the extent of imbalance between flooding and non flooding events was also addressed within the context of four alternative scenarios 10x 25x 50x and 100x hence 10 times 25 times 50 times and 100 times as many non flooding points were randomly created as the number of flood points respectively although this approach boosted the practical contribution of the study its contribution can be limited unless the training set is not balanced otherwise developed models could predict all the presented instances as non flooded with significantly high accuracies hence the imbalance between flooding and non flooding classes should be incorporated in testing sets while training sets are further required to be resampled despite this approach has not been adopted in past flood susceptibility prediction studies the literature on other research domains addressed two most commonly used data resampling algorithms random oversampling ros and random under sampling rus samples in the minority class are randomly replicated in the ros algorithm while that of the majority class are randomly excluded from the dataset in the rus algorithm until the class distribution is balanced many researchers highlight that the major disadvantages of these methods are overfitting problem in the ros algorithm while the elimination of the useful data in the rus algorithm kalamatianos et al 2018 it is important to note that the excess of the majority class non flooded was generated randomly in this study which does not include much of a useful data additionally computational load is significantly higher in the ros compared to the rus algorithm which is particularly important when parameter optimization is also of concern accordingly the rus algorithm was utilized as a resampling method and applied to training sets only to address class imbalance issue in this study 3 3 model development 3 3 1 machine learning algorithms a considerable amount of literature exists in the water resources domain regarding the utilization of ml algorithms this study comprises the application of four widely used tree based ensemble approaches i e rf and extremely randomized trees et as bagging and adaptive boosting adaboost and extreme gradient boosting xgboost as boosting algorithms to spatially detect flash flood susceptible locations in the black warrior river basin alabama u s and correspondingly to produce the susceptibility map of the region this study adopted tree based approaches since they have an advanced capability in presenting information on causal effects during prediction process making these methods highly interpretable while addressing complex problems due to the time consuming feature and overfitting problems especially encountered in solving the complex problems bagging and boosting algorithms were proposed to increase the accuracy of single decision trees rf is based on the combination of two advanced techniques i e bagging and bootstrapping to acquire satisfactory classification performance in which the first gathers the decision of multivariate trees while the latter is utilized for generating various sub training sets referred also as random sub space to designate the best branched variable in the corresponding leaf node breiman 2001 apart from the ability to deal with overfitting rf can be intertwined with different statistical approaches such as survival analysis and unsupervised learning elmahdy et al 2020 and provide the importance levels of the attributes during modelling complex interactions between predictors et a supervised tree based ensemble ml algorithm is another member of the bagging family unlike rf et divides each node by considering completely random cut points that are attained for each attribute in the input space to split the nodes to reach the optimum tree structure ahmad et al 2018 this results in less computational complexity along with more tree diversity also instead of bootstrap replication et benefits from the entire learning instances to grow the generated trees over another commonly practiced tree based ensemble approach covers the boosting algorithms one class of the boosting techniques utilized in this study i e adaboost is based on the utilization of weak classifiers to reach accurate classification performance weak classifiers are picked according to the bias errors and formerly mis classified samples are used to improve the training of weak classifiers thus the weights of mis classified instances obtained at each iteration are boosted to ensure that the next classifier increases the accuracy of the model by correctly classifying the mis classified data samples this iterative process helps minimize the exponential loss function and makes the model less sensitive to the outliers that exist in many datasets unlike the voting rule embraced in bagging algorithms adaboost finds the final output of estimation by averaging the weak learners outputs the xgboost which was also adopted in this study was proposed to enhance the predictive performance of the gradient boosting decision trees with the integration of various regularization techniques chen and guestrin 2016b through an iterative process the xgboost creates sequential decision trees by means of the tree parallelization since it is capable of switching between inner and outer loops while creating the basic learners basically outer loops constitute the leaves of a decision tree while the inner loops compute the features however parallelization is limited due to the fact that the outer loops cannot be terminated before the inner loops are terminated that is the leaves of the tree cannot be formed without calculating the features in addition xgboost can perform depth search first algorithm used in tree structures this algorithm allows searching from the randomly starting node to the reachable deepest node when there is no deeper node left to receive the algorithm rewinds and pursues navigating by prioritizing deep nodes 3 3 2 cuckoo search yang and deb 2009 first proposed the cs algorithm inspired by the feeding and breeding habits of the cuckoo birds rajabioun 2011 further took the pioneering role for cs algorithm by formulating it as an optimization technique in practice cuckoo birds take their eggs into the host nest and the baby cuckoo is taken in by a host bird until it becomes a mature cuckoo when the agent egg maturates it immigrates to another habitat to start breeding and the newly mature egg starts following the same procedure that its parent has already done note that the term habitat can be considered the equivalent of commonly known terms i e chromosome and particle position referred to in genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization respectively in the optimization the matrix containing the randomly determined candidates is created and a certain number of eggs is allocated to each bird by determining the highest and lowest limits in the algorithm the cuckoos lay these eggs at the maximum possible distance from their natural environment called the egg laying radius overall as a reflection of the breeding phenomena that originated in nature the cs algorithm starts with identifying the center of the cuckoo bird groups followed by determining the distances of cuckoo birds to the center and adjusting the updated center point of groups based on the relocated cuckoos khan et al 2021 note that the second and third steps are repeatedly performed until the center points become stabilized 3 4 performance evaluation criteria validation is an essential part of flood susceptibility prediction studies as the scientific value of the attained results is limited without validation there are many performance evaluation indicators to validate the analysis results four fundamental statistical measures are used in binary classification true positive tp true negative tn false positive fp and false negative fn brief definition of these metrices are as follows tp it indicates the number of correctly classified cases in the positive label i e actual flood predicted flood tn it shows the number of correctly classified cases in the negative label i e actual non flood predicted non flood fp it depicts the number of incorrectly classified negative cases i e actual non flood predicted flood fn it represent the number of incorrectly classified positive cases i e actual flood predicted non flood according to these four measures accuracy acc precision or positive predictive value ppv recall rc and f1 score f can be calculated acc is measured by the number of correct classifications tp t n divided by the total number of instances tp f n f p t n acc is a widely used measure but it is only representative if the output labels are balanced allah bukhsh et al 2020 another widely used evaluation metric i e ppv identifies the exactness of the model which is defined by the ratio of correctly classified positive instances tp to the total number of positively classified instances tp f p on the contrary rc also known as true positive rate calculated through the ratio of correctly classified positive instance tp to the total number of actual positive instances tp f n measures the completeness of the model hence ppv focuses on the false positives while rc emphasizes the false negatives in the performance evaluation allah bukhsh et al 2020 finally f1 score is calculated as an overall evaluation metric through the harmonic average of ppv and rc accordingly the f measure is calculated as follows chen et al 2018 2 f 2 p p v r c ppv r c in this study the area under receiver operating characteristic auroc was primarily used to examine the robustness of the adopted methods since the area under curve auc is not sensitive to imbalanced class distribution and is widely accepted for binary classification purposes chi et al 2020 choi et al 2020 xie and qiu 2007 false positive rate fpr and true positive rate tpr are plotted on the horizontal x and vertical y axes and correspondingly the auc can be calculated which makes the interpretation of the results easier tpr is the same as rc whereas fpr is the ratio of incorrectly classified positive instances fp to the total number of negatively classified instances fp tn hence auc indicates how reliably the model classifies two output labels flood and non flood in this study chen et al 2018 auc value of 0 5 represents unskilled prediction while 1 indicates a perfect matched model supposing that receiver operating characteristic curve if constituted by attaching x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x m y m the auc is computed by using the following formula feng et al 2020 yang et al 2019 3 auc 1 1 m m x m x m f x f x 1 2 f x f x where m and m are positive and negative examples m and m are set of all positive and negative classes x and x are positive and negative classes respectively in the formula f x defines the result of prediction model sample x 3 5 model interpretability with shapley additive explanations shap shap is a game theoretical approach initially developed to evaluate the impact of a player in a collaborative game shapley 1953 the recent improvement for interpreting black box ml methods by lundberg and lee 2017 namely shap addresses the contribution of each feature on each prediction outcome shap an emerging but embryonic nascent feature importance model enables more stable transparent and consistent feature rankings than previous feature importance methods ransom et al 2021 hence we draw a shap summary plot to present the relationship between flood susceptibility factors and flood events thus providing transparency and confidence to the flood risk management entities 4 results based on the constructed comprehensive framework the first issue that is essential to designate is the determination of optimum imbalance data handling strategy which is presented in section 4 1 afterwards this study introduced the application and the results obtained through the ml techniques based on the diagnosed imbalance strategy section 4 2 this section also contains the interpretability of the ml models with the shap algorithm and the generation of the flash flood susceptibility map of the study area in sections 4 3 and 4 4 respectively 4 1 optimum imbalance data handling strategy this study compared the performances of five randomly generated non flood datasets to highlight the extent of the imbalance in flood susceptibility prediction the rf method was adopted and inertial parameters were tuned through the cs metaheuristic optimization algorithm comparative analysis of the extent of imbalance with respect to the precision recall f1 score and auc is shown in table 2 the results show that the cs rf developed with the size of imbalance 1 cs rf 1 outweighed other models regarding recall 0 7885 and auc 0 8627 as expected similarly cs rf 100 outperformed others in terms of precision 0 9870 and f1 score 0 8467 due to the extent of inordinate class distribution however the auc value 0 8317 and separated recall 0 0291 and f1 score 0 0561 of flood class in the model cs rf 100 were the poorest interestingly despite the recall value of cs rf 25 model showed the most powerful prediction accuracy 0 8448 the overall recall value of the model was the lowest 0 6930 many researchers used auc value for imbalanced and or binary classification problem while f1 score illustrates the combination of precision and recall cs rf 1 achieved the highest auc value highlighting the highest classification performance however the balanced class distribution between the flooding and non flooding events is not practical hence might pose an erroneously powerful prediction performance here cs rf 50 showed the second highest prediction performance regarding the auc 0 8455 while the f1 score of the model was higher than that of cs rf 1 with 0 8195 compared to 0 7885 table 2 therefore the size of imbalance was determined as 50 which might envisage the practical utilization of the study while addressing the high classification power 4 2 tree based ml applications the size of imbalance was set to 50x in this study according to the results of the cs rf application in the subsequent step the applicability and performance of the rf method were investigated by the comparison between other tree based ml methods i e et adaboost and xgboost in this context the same training and testing sets as separated for determining the extent of imbalance were acquired and used to perform a fair comparison parameter configurations of each method were searched within 1 000 combinations based on two common parameters such as the number of estimators and maximum depth for the bagging algorithms rf and et while the number of estimators and learning rate for the boosting methods adaboost and xgboost other inertial parameters such as the minimum number of samples minimum child weight etc were identified through the trial and error approach and included in the cs algorithm as the fixed parameters search space of the number of estimators was between 50 and 1 000 with a pace of 50 while the maximum tree depth was scanned between 1 and 50 with a step of 1 table 3 the learning rate of the boosting methods was also set between 0 01 and 0 50 with a pace of 0 01 note that the random state was considered as 0 in all the optimization scenarios fig 5 illustrates the process of cs optimization attained from the optimization logs the results present that the rf model converged at the 84th candidate with a corresponding iteration of 46 while it was the 161st candidate corresponding to the 72nd generation in et predictions regarding the adaboost and xgboost methods the highest accuracies were obtained at the 146th and 154th candidates with the corresponding iterations of 111 and 109 respectively table 3 shows the optimized parameters of the adopted ml methods optimum parameters of the rf were 200 and 2 for the number of estimators and the maximum depth while they were 150 and 6 in et application respectively on the other hand a lower number of estimators i e number of trees 50 showed the highest accuracies in boosting methods whereas the learning rate was optimized at 0 1 and 0 01 for the adaboost and xgboost respectively it is essential to note that only training sets were utilized with regards to five fold cross validation to determine the optimum parameters of the tree based algorithms as for the performance comparison of the adopted ml methods unresampled and blinded testing sets were taken into account table 4 analysis results showed multi tier performances of ml methods such that the cs xgboost outweighed its counterparts regarding precision 0 9763 while the cs et was the most powerful method with regards to recall 0 7401 and the f1 score 0 8336 for the individual evaluation of the correct flash flood point predictions recall the cs et and cs rf showed the same and highest prediction accuracy of 0 7647 fig 6 depicts the overall performance scheme with reference to the auc values the findings illustrate that the cs rf outperformed others with an auc value of 0 8455 followed by the cs xgboost 0 8429 and cs et 0 8344 one of the definite judgments of this study is that the cs adaboost was the weakest classifier for flash flood susceptibility prediction showing the poorest performance based on any evaluation metrics with reference to the literature on the binary classification of imbalanced datasets highlighting the auc performance metric chi et al 2020 choi et al 2020 xie and qiu 2007 cs rf was concluded to be the most powerful tree based ensemble method to classify flash flood events aiding to develop flash flood susceptibility map 4 3 importance levels of the flash flood conditioning factors ml methods are commonly regarded as black box models hindering their interpretability on how the predictions are made a recent model agnostic game theoretical feature importance approach the shap enables the understanding of the contributions of each feature on the model outputs fig 7 illustrates the summary plot of shap analysis providing a plot with features on the vertical axis y axis and shapley values on the horizontal axis x axis each point in the figure denotes an individual classification with respect to the corresponding feature while the red points refer to the high value of the features blue stands for the low value of the features in addition if the point is placed at the right side of the figure positive of the shapley values it indicates that the classification was likely to be made regarding flash flooded whereas negative of the shapley values denote that the prediction was likely to be made as non flash flooded another advantage of the shap summary plot is that it also provides a ranking of features the upper the features positioned in the figure the higher the contributions of the features to flash flood susceptibility prediction the results show that the curve number was the most influential attribute affecting flash flood susceptibility and the higher the value of curve number red dots the more likelihood of that location to experience flash flood event right side and vice versa the second third and fourth most contributor factors of the flash flood phenomenon were determined as normalized difference vegetation index slope and drainage density high values of all attributes were associated with the low level of flash flood susceptibility while the low attribute values present the higher flash flood susceptibility relatively linear transitions can be observed from the features low values to their high values purple dots between blue and red except the slope criterion in contrast to the other two both high red and medium purple feature values of the slope imply low flash flood susceptibility other influential features were yearly average rainfall and aspect showing an opposite direction to flood susceptibility such that high and low values of aspect and rainfall are associated with the high flash flood susceptibility level respectively 4 4 flash flood susceptibility mapping this study found the integrated cs rf method as the best performed strategy for flash flood susceptibility assessment in the black warrior river basin compared to the cs et cs adaboost and cs xgboost therefore the predictions of the cs rf method were used for the flood susceptibility map generation based on the findings obtained through the cs rf method the jenks natural break method was applied via arcgis 10 3 interface esri 2016 fig 8 depicts the attained map comprising the areas categorized into five different classes i e very low low moderate high and very high as the vast majority of the scholars followed the same manner avand et al 2021 band et al 2020 el haddad et al 2021 the findings revealed that the very low susceptible 0 0 172 surface areas to the flash flooding covers 48 62 of the entire basin while the low 0 173 0 364 susceptible areas were found as 21 21 of the basin the results showed that the significant portion of the entire basin is under low susceptibility in terms of flash flooding incidents in addition the results indicated that 11 53 of the entire basin is expected to be affected by flash flooding moderately 0 365 0 549 the figure also depicts that the likelihood of flash flooding was high 0 550 0 768 for 9 29 while the very high 0 769 1 flash flood susceptible zones cover 9 35 mostly located at the north east parts of the basin from the findings of flash flood susceptibility assessment one can observe the good match between the historically flash flood inundated locations and the high and very high likelihood of flood inundated zones acquired as a result of the cs rf hybrid model 5 discussions this section discussed the adopted methodology within the scope of the present research by comparing the framework with the past efforts in the pertinent literature first section 5 1 and then the most determinant flash flood conditioning factors were assessed based on the findings emerged from the shap application section 5 2 in section 5 3 the limitations of the study and future research directions were highlighted to provide a transparent overview 5 1 assessment of the adopted methodology in the current study the applicability of the four tree based ml approaches all coupled with the cs algorithm was explored for the flash flood susceptibility assessment in the black warrior river basin there are some resemblances and differences based on the comparison between the generic of this study and the existing body of knowledge in the field as shown in table 5 the scholars have applied many ml models to spatially derive flood susceptibility of various study domains in mostly provincial county and watershed scales in addition past literature has divergently introduced the applicability of different basis of ml methods for flood susceptibility mapping such as anfis by ahmadlou et al 2019 and arora et al 2021 and tree based algorithms reptree m5p rt by talukdar et al 2020 recent attempts by fang et al 2021 and panahi et al 2021 also showed the implementation of deep learning methods in flood susceptibility assessments it is worth mentioning that the peculiarity of this study comes from the fact that it is the first attempt providing the comparison of the performances of bagging and boosting methods majority of the scholars have taken many hyperparameter tuning strategies into account by implementing ga de pso bbo ca iwo ica fa however this study adopted another time efficient but overlooked meta heuristic shehab et al 2017 i e cs algorithm to acquire the optimal model configurations one of the significant issues in ml applications is the identification of the most determinant factors in flood susceptibility mapping several method based approaches have been proposed in the literature such as rf based arora et al 2021 rahmati and pourghasemi 2017 and mlp based costache and tien bui 2019 while some others adopted entropy based fang et al 2021 talukdar et al 2020 or expert knowledge based implementations ahmadlou et al 2019 panahi et al 2021 even though these techniques have commonly been used by researchers they mainly rely on the utilized models principles statistical assumptions or subjective judgment of the experts this study used a recent model agnostic interpretability technique namely shap in this regard the impacts of variations in the numerical values of input features on the classification results can be observed and the interpretability of the models is increased through understanding the key roles of each input on the flash flooding occurrence the integration of class imbalance issue in the number of flooding and non flooding events is another novelty and practical contribution of this study to accomplish this reformist approach we used different class imbalance scenarios by incorporating one of the most reliable resampling techniques rus to better represent the nature of the flash flood occurrence mechanism besides differences and contrasts this study also poses some similarities with the existing literature which can be summarized as follows i applying the commonly considered splitting strategy 70 30 to divide the original dataset into different groups for model training and validation ii benefiting from the information of widely used flood conditioning factors iii limiting the study area to a one location such as a watershed province city etc we hope that the research society and practitioners will benefit from the methodological contributions of this study 5 2 assessment of the most determinant factors this study applied the game theory based shap method to provide the importance levels of the inputs elucidating the causal effects of the flash flood incidents the findings illustrate that the curve number played the most influential role in the estimation of flash floods in the selected study domain it is well established from a variety of studies that the increase in curve number represents the increase in impervious layers causing significant flooding even in storm events pertaining to the low recurrence intervals in the pertinent literature there are a few attempts that include the curve number in the input space darabi et al 2021a 2021b ma et al 2019 norallahi and seyed kaboli 2021 while the scholars mainly considered the land use land cover criterion to explain the perviousness imperviousness of study domains on the one hand norallahi and seyed kaboli 2021 and ma et al 2019 also found curve number among the most important criteria in line with this study on the other hand several studies concluded that the land use land cover outperformed other factors in terms of feature importance to explain flood events arabameri et al 2020b costache and tien bui 2019 tehrany et al 2015 the second order most important factor was found as ndvi according to the shap analysis results here the decrease in the ndvi values is associated with the increase in the flash flood occurrences in the study area this can also be supported based on the relationship between the historical flash floods especially in the east and northeast parts of the basin fig 1 and the produced map for ndvi fig 2 the findings highlight that the impact of dense vegetation minimizes the number of flooding incidents in a similar manner several cross sectional studies can be found in the literature that put forward ndvi as among the most important factors in flood susceptibility assessments arabameri et al 2020a bui et al 2020 prasad et al 2021 the model interpretability analysis conducted in this research also showed that the slope plays a vital role in flash flood occurrences in the black warrior river basin the flat areas are more prone to flash flooding phenomenon in the study domain by catching a huge volume of runoff since the spread of the water is not allowed due to their morphometric conditions thus this outcome is also congruent with the relevant literature as the slope has been found to be extremely influencing flood occurrences in a wide spectrum of studies abedi et al 2021 costache et al 2021 pham et al 2020a rahmati and pourghasemi 2017 another significant finding acquired from the shap results is related to the drainage density criterion in which the increase in drainage density has a positive impact on the probability of flash flood incidents as the poor drainage system entails the risk of lagging infrastructural condition arabameri et al 2020a zhao et al 2019 regarding rainfall among the most influential attributes there is a distinction between the evidence of this study and the existing body of knowledge regarding the impact of the factor based on the shap analysis the decrease in rainfall has resulted in more susceptibility to flooding this controversy finding can be explained by the exiguousness in the alterations observed in the annual average rainfall values minimum 1221 78 mm and maximum 1441 4 throughout the extent of the selected study region the amount of rainfall is relatively lower particularly in the central north and northwest of the basin fig 2 however these areas experienced an important portion of the past flash floods fig 1 the reason behind the fewer flood occurrences in the regions that received more amount of precipitation might also be related to the constructed levee and dams to regulate flows afshari et al 2018 thus the potential impacts of heavy storm events might have been precluded before they turn into overflow resulting in inundation within the vicinity of these zones the same conclusion can also be made for the elevation criterion the existing body of literature highlighted that the lower the elevation the higher the probability of flooding however in our case higher elevated areas were found as more susceptible to flash flooding the reason of this contraposition could be strongly related to the constructed water structures on the black warrior river mostly located in lower elevated zones regulating the flow through levee and dams help these regions stand the flooding incidents off in this regard overall the major findings that emerged from the current research can be used by flood management authorities especially for not only determining the spatial distribution of flash flood susceptible zones but also for identifying the triggering factors in the characterization of flash floods it is also worth mentioning that this study will help professionals to locate potential flash flooded zones with easy to find topographical hydro meteorological and environmental criteria this research included a broad set of hazard related criteria containing flash flood conditioning factors and investiggated the contribution of each factor in the localization of flash floods however encapsulating vulnerability related determinants i e socio demographic cultural societal and anthropogenic factors will elevate the analysis scope from the hazard assessments to risk assessments aiding to be a remedy for ascertaining potential mitigation strategies against the unintended consequences of floods 5 3 limitations and future work the efforts made in this research have mainly dedicated to exhibit the vitality of taking the class imbalance issue into the consideration in the flash flood susceptibility assessments which is principally the nature based phenomenon having the potential to result in serious consequences once it consolidated to the man made stressors as from data collection the conceptual framework adopted in this research covers the implementation of pre processing with class imbalance processing with tree based ensemble ml methods coupled with the meta heuristic hyperparameter tuning and post processing through the generation of final flash flood susceptibility map along with presenting model interpretability together with the novelties presented this research is not free of limitations regarding the employed methods and to the inherent research question for instance this study examined the relationships between flash flood predictors and flash flooded locations using the shap approach however examining the spatial dependence not only to measure the spatial autocorrelations but also for distinguishing the spatial clusters and outliers perihanoƒülu and karaman 2020 could enhance the evaluations before the predictions also the ml models considered in this study are limited to the tree based ensemble algorithms while only one optimization algorithm was integrated for hyperparameter tuning it is also important to note that this study focalized the rf method to select the most robust class imbalance scenario then the rf method was benchmarked with other tree based ml methods with the extent of imbalance that achieved the highest accuracy in rf method which might be biased against other adopted tree based methods et adaboost xgboost hence further studies can focus on which ml methods yield the highest prediction accuracy with which class imbalance scenario in addition only the rus technique was executed to address class imbalance issue in the training set in these regards the interested researchers are suggested to include deep learning methods whether to find improvements in the accuracies and advised to use more optimization techniques to abate the uncertainties that exist in the ml models besides illustrating the usability of different resampling techniques may further disclose new research attempts not only for flood modelling but also for other natural hazards additionally vulnerability and exposure assessments could make these analyses more comprehensive in terms of investigating the degree of loss to a given set of elements at flood risk resulting from the negative impacts of flooding and consequences that a person or community members undergo azad et al 2013 gomez cunya et al 2022 therefore additional value of vulnerability factors might also make a valuable contribution to the extent of flood related predictions as a fertile for future extensions in addition this study included nine meteorological stations considering the data availability and covered study area to retrieve the rainfall raster map however increasing the number of climatic stations would help to enhance the accuracy of the produced map this study provides a valuable basis for supporting the development of flood risk mitigation strategies however attained results have not been discussed with practitioners from the study domain which if considered can add significant value to the practice therefore future research can be directed towards the discussion of the findings specific to the study area with experienced practitioners after flood susceptibility prediction finally illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks on different study domains particularly in developing countries could navigate the corresponding studies to be more robust and make them practically widespread 6 concluding remarks in this study we examined the extent of imbalance in the class distribution of flooded and non flooded events for flash flood susceptibility analysis through a set of ml applications the rf method was initially used to evaluate five imbalanced data scenarios i e 1x 10x 25x 50x 100x despite the ml methods have widely been used in flood susceptibility studies the extent of imbalance has not been examined in any of the previous attempts accordingly the size of imbalance showing the most powerful prediction was found as the multiplication of the number of flooded points with 50 addressing that extreme skewness in the class distribution can also provide high accuracies by reflecting the real life dynamics of flash flood phenomenon with the imbalanced dataset that showed the highest prediction power the performances of four tree based ml methods i e rf et adaboost xgboost were compared it is worth to note that all models were coupled with a state of the art optimization technique the cs algorithm for determining the optimal model configurations according to the analysis results the integrated cs rf method was deduced to be the most powerful tree based ensemble method optimization and ml processes were practices on the training set while the performance measurement was performed with blinded testing set to support practical utilization of the proposed research one of the most substantial contributions of this study is that a game theoretical approach namely shap was adopted to anatomize the attributes influential to flash flood susceptibility the shap algorithm not only provided the most determinant features but also delineated flash flood events causal effects by exploring the impacts of each feature on each prediction case the shap algorithm results highlighted the curve number normalized difference vegetation index slope and drainage density as the most influential factors to interpret flash flood prediction finally a flash flood susceptibility map of the black warrior river basin was developed based on the prediction outcomes we believe that the results and analysis procedures followed in this study can be used explicatively for the development of robust flood risk management strategies besides this study is also expected to make a valuable contribution to theory by highlighting the existence of imbalance in the flood susceptibility studies as well as the importance of model interpretability credit authorship contribution statement √∂mer ekmekcioƒülu conceptualization methodology software formal analysis

3332,this paper describes a case study that employs an in situ methodology for monitoring sedimentation processes at a multi barrel culvert site this area is seldom discussed in the scientific and engineering literature the methodology integrates ground and aerial surveys from real time kinematic rtk and drone based photogrammetry with traditional hydro geomorphological monitoring techniques e g on site photography webcams soil coring and in stream measurements to acquire data continuously or for specific weather events the paper focuses on presenting how experimental methods and their associated protocols can be assembled to complement each other to enable a comprehensive and detailed investigation of culvert sedimentation processes the investigation entails the inception of the sediment deposits in the culvert vicinity and the progression of the depositional pattern over time e g individual storms seasons and annual cycles the data and information produced by our combined observational system lead to practical insights regarding the interplay between local hydraulic and geomorphological variables which can be otherwise difficult to obtain a automated data processing technique is applied in this study to automatically connect aerial photogrammetry results with the rtk based ground survey to improve the accuracy of the monitoring keywords sediment transport culvert sedimentation experimental methods monitoring uav aerial photogrammetry 1 introduction the vast majority of the u s midwestern secondary roads include culverts to enable stream crossings different construction types are used to accommodate the hydraulics of the culvert site and the hydrology of its drainage area typically multi barrel culverts are sized to handle specific return flows i e 25 50 or 100 years in the culvert design process cafferata et al 2017 pyles et al 1989 there is no substantial evidence to suggest that culverts failures are related to limited capabilities to convey the design discharges cafferata et al 2017 a more prevalent cause of culvert failure especially in humid continental environments is the accumulation of sediment and or debris at the culvert inlet these sediment deposits partially block the culverts and lead to culvert overtopping during flood events furniss et al 1998 foltz et al 2008 macdonald coe 2008 multi barrel culverts are often deployed at stream crossing with larger flows and higher road embankments this type of culvert is also known as multi box culverts muste xu 2017 a sample of ideal multi box culvert operation is indicated by a stable stream geometry in the culvert vicinity over time as illustrated in fig 1 a however situations such as those shown in fig 1a are rare across the u s midwest landscape surveys conducted by our research team in 2009 and 2013 indicate that about 95 of iowa culverts are silted ho 2010 muste xu 2017b sediment accumulations at culvert inlets considerably reduce their capability to handle more significant flow events as the partial blockage of the structures may severely impair their hydraulic capacity as illustrated in fig 1b obstruction at the culvert inlet may cause both damages to the transportation structure due to the culvert and road overtopping it also causes damages to upstream areas by creating a ponding area during floods the high degree severity of culvert sedimentation observed in many regions stems from the fact that the main and in many cases the only culvert design criteria is to ensure the design flow conveyance limited attention is paid to the sediment transport processes in the uphill areas and the vicinity of culverts during spring and summer storm events wolman 1967 culvert sedimentation concerns are widespread in the nation from california to pennsylvania and from wisconsin to florida rowley 2014 with direct bearing on the culvert s ability to maintain normal operation during extreme flows when the structure is essential for the communities they serve despite its ubiquitous presence the mitigation of sedimentation at culverts is a peripheral activity called upon only for extreme situations the systematic research efforts for the mitigation of culvert sedimentation are limited despite the availability of many technical means that can enable the comprehensive observation and understanding of the processes this situation is not well aligned with modern design concepts that focus on both the long term sustainability of the structures and the structural design that is solely based on their purpose erpicum et al 2021 a few past studies have extensive experience with various aspects of sedimentation at culverts our previous work entails laboratory modeling ho 2010 numerical simulations muste et al 2009 field observations muste xu 2017b and data driven modeling xu et al 2019a applied to a variety of multi box culvert and watersheds following these studies we screened designed and implemented several in situ retrofitting approaches to limit or totally eliminate the formation of the sediment deposits at culverts ho 2010 muste xu 2020 during a series of field observations we developed a suite of protocols for in situ monitoring of the culvert sedimentation processes including their onset and evolution our previous studies have developed a data driven approach i e multi criteria decision analysis and clustering to identify and explore factors e g watershed characteristics and culvert structure attribute contributing to culvert sediment accumulation xu et al 2019a xu et al 2019b since the previous studies shed light on the underlying culvert sedimentation processes and their dynamics this paper does not conduct further theory based analyses to explore and model culvert sedimentation processes

sedimentation processes to highlight the process variables of interest and monitoring requirements then we present the design and implementation of the multi pronged approach including the workflow a suite of instruments and ancillary protocols we close with a case study to substantiate the utility of our method by presenting sample results and research insights 2 culvert sedimentation processes and monitoring measurement needs conceptually the processes associated with culvert sedimentation can be grouped into three major categories as depicted in fig 2 1 soil detachment i e erosion sediment supply and sediment production as illustrated in fig 2a 2 sediment transport overland and in stream demonstrated in fig 2b and 3 sediment deposition settling at culvert structure and stabilization due to vegetation growth as shown in fig 2b the three categories of sedimentation processes are tightly related in an end to end spatial continuum the continuum connects the sedimentation sources in drainage basins and the transport pathways through watersheds and stream networks with the deposits formed at the culverts haan et al 1994 schumm 1977 merritt et al 2003 and lord et al 2009 multi box culverts located within flat erodible watersheds are prone to sediment blockage a data driven study by xu 2019 investigates the origin and interconnections among the processes involved in forming sediment deposits at culverts as an end to end process more than 800 iowa culverts have been analyzed using machine learning to determine sedimentation causality and dependencies as physical based investigations of culvert sedimentation through simulation are scarcely reported in the literature this section discusses some salient features of the sedimentation process to substantiate the variables of interest for monitoring culvert sedimentation in the field these variables are selected as surrogates of the underlying sedimentation processes and are summarized in fig 2 and table 1 along with their relevant data sources the findings published in the literature along with our recent observations indicate that surrogate variables related to the flow sediment interaction within the culvert vicinity are significant contributors to the deposition of sediment at culverts in detail our previous work found that the most important local factors leading to sedimentation at culverts include the stream to culvert width scw ratio the type of culvert flow control i e inlet or outlet and the stream geomorphological and ecological aspects at culvert location ho 2010 xu et al 2019b information assembled during field visits and from aerial photographs collected over successive years has revealed that the process of sedimentation at culverts can attain a stable form of sediment deposits in no more than four to five years muste xu 2017a the outcomes of the above mentioned data driven studies support informed decisions for developing methods towards the effective mitigation of culvert sedimentation they also facilitate the design of the monitoring methods presented in this paper this paper focuses on an experiment driven case study to explore and monitor the environmental and structure variables identified from previous studies to shed light on the culvert sedimentation processes this paper s main goal is to assemble a set of tools and ancillary customized analyses to systematically and comprehensively monitor the culvert sedimentation process s evolution and illustrate how these tool kits and protocols can underpin in situ research of sedimentation at culverts through these observations we can also evaluate the effectiveness of the mitigation solution 3 methodology this section provides an overview of our methodology to present the necessary context of the culvert sedimentation we also describe the overall design of our methods then we introduce our study area and describe the technical details of our monitoring and surveying methods 3 1 overview the dynamics of the sediment movement from the erosion source to the deposition area depend on multiple factors these factors include culvert location in the drainage area the culvert s configuration and its structure positioning with respect to the stream for the same culvert location the sediment transport regimes can be different depending on the characteristics of individual storm events and the type of the culvert s hydraulic control for example at an inlet control culvert the sediment prone area is upstream near the culvert s inlet for a culvert with outlet control its barrels and downstream area can be more silted given that the top criteria for culvert design are the conveyance of water without considering the sediment transport an implicit assumption is that the culvert site morphology does not change over time this assumption is rarely fulfilled in natural scale conditions as repeated storms passing through the culvert can dramatically change the as constructed situation a consideration not accounted for in the culvert design aggravating concerns are related to vegetation growth and debris accumulation on the sediment deposits these concerns further complicate both the flow conveyance and stability of the culvert structures as they stabilize the sediment deposits this peculiar combination of factors requires a combination of long term continuous monitoring protocols complemented by ad hoc event based measurements and surveys to capture the sediment dynamics and its actual progression closely the monitoring methods and associated equipment described in this paper are identified for serving the needs of a series of studies focused on understanding the inception and progression of sedimentation at culverts muste xu 2017a muste xu 2017b muste xu 2020 none of these experimental methods and prescribed protocols are new when used individually however their selection and assemblage for fulfilling the investigation needs related to culvert sedimentation are original innovative and practical there are few references if at all that guide users on how to tackle such in situ investigations the assembled experimental observation methods include 1 the volumetric estimation of the sediment deposits 2 photo documentation of the culvert sites and their progression in time and 3 hydrologic hydraulic variables that reflect in stream sediment load discharge and the type of sediment material near the culvert the methods can be grouped into two classes as shown in fig 3 an automated data processing technique is adopted in this study to connect aerial photogrammetry results with the rtk based ground survey to improve the accuracy of the volumetric estimation of the sediment deposits the data processing technique analyzes the digitized culvert structure and terrain as 3d point cloud data and conducts a multivariate clustering analysis to identify ground control points in the point cloud to connect their coordinates with the measurement from rtk through further spatial transformations the technique automates the digitized culvert and sediment deposit measurement to ensure a centimeter level accuracy the event based measurements and surveys are short term field observation campaigns which are critical for the targeted processes as the event s intensity dictates the magnitude and extent of the changes in the sediment deposition continuous monitoring is required to track slowly progressing processes such as sediment deposit stabilization and vegetation growth it also helps establish the critical progression thresholds for the sedimentation at culvert dynamics we screened tested and evaluated the efficiency of this set of complementary methods in situ during a case study subsequently presented while the methods fit our specific research needs our methodology can serve the investigative needs for other multiple faceted geomorphological studies it can also be applied to monitor environmental and fluvial processes at other stream crossings the main variables tracked through these surveys are the changes in the stream to culvert width ratio scw over time scw b w the areal degree of sedimentation and the blockage at the culvert entrance as illustrated in fig 4 b is the width of the undisturbed stream that is upstream of a culvert and its inlet expansion area considered as distributed streams due to the hydraulic changes induced by the culvert structure w is the structural width of the culvert the degree of the sedimentation a critical parameter for the present study defines the ratio between the area occupied by sediment deposits at any given time and that of the original clearance between the inlet and outlet in relation to the natural stream at the time of the culvert construction the degree of sediment blockage characterizes the reduction of the culvert s inlet cross section which directly affects the structure s capacity to convey high flows 3 2 study area study site most of the measurement and monitoring technologies described in this and the next section are applied to a three box culvert located on willow creek in iowa city iowa the culvert has an upstream watershed of 11 943 km2 it has been undergoing intensive urbanization in the last 30 years the culvert passes return flows of 26 40 75 and 92 m3 s for 5 10 50 and 100 years respectively this culvert was retrofitted with a self cleaning design a concept launched by ho et al 2013 these designs mitigate sedimentation inception and progression without external intervention relying entirely on the streams hydraulic power to pass suspended and bedload downstream the culvert the self cleaning solution implemented for this culvert consists of a low head weir located downstream at a short distance from the culvert s outlet as shown in fig 5 a muste xu 2020 the weir creates a shallow pool of water both upstream and downstream of the culvert to keep the deposited sediment layers submersed from all flow regimes passing through the culvert see fig 5b and 5c the inspection of the underwater sediment deposit formation was facilitated by a gated pipe installed at the bottom of the downstream weir as illustrated in fig 5d by opening the valve the pool created by the weir could be drained whenever a site inspection was needed i e after large storm events at the beginning and the end of the seasons for consolidating the temporarily installed weir this arrangement enables the effective monitoring and situational awareness of the underwater sediment deposits in the culvert vicinity allowing a good understanding of the hydrodynamic processes and the nature of the deposits materials 3 3 event based field measurements surveys event based field surveys are acquired at the beginning and the end of the observation period as well as in conjunction with major sediment transport events following large storms 3 3 1 ground surveys real time kinetic rtk for sites where the sedimentation s quantitative estimation is essential an in situ survey with rtk gps has been used barry and coakley 2013 gerke and przybilla 2016 the instrument used in our study is a trimble r8s oy 2017 the resultant survey of the sediment deposits quantifies the degree of culvert sedimentation and the blockage at the culvert inlet and outlet the two global indicators for the operational status of the culvert see fig 5 given that the equipment and personnel s in situ deployment for acquiring the needed rtk data is time and cost consuming only a few such surveys have been conducted due to the limited number of points that can be surveyed using the rtk the resolution of the rtk based topographic survey is relatively courses despite its centimeter level accuracy riley et al 2000 therefore another role of the detailed rtk in situ surveys is to compare or supplement the digital terrain reconstruction using aerial photographs as described in the following subsection a leica d2 hand held laser range finder for surveying was used within the culvert structure as the gps signals are blocked in that area ground based photographic documentation comprehensive visual evidence of the sedimentation processes can be obtained with photo documentation in the vicinity of the culvert to capture the sedimentation process generic features our team used this method when inspecting more than 250 culvert sites in the state of iowa through previous projects this type of survey is most effective when conducted using a uniform image acquisition sequence during periods of minimal vegetation coverage i e march and april before the vegetation is dormant the established imaging sequence used the same succession and coverage to uniformly offer the same viewing angles for each documented culvert as illustrated in fig 6 the close up images provide detailed information on the sediment deposit footprint and if periodically acquired over time valuable hints for understanding the underlying mechanism for sedimentation patterns and their evolution this type of survey provides the highest resolution information on the status and the effects of vegetation and its connection with sediment deposit formation and progression 3 3 2 aerial surveys analysis photographic mapping this protocol provides an efficient alternative to the in situ photographic surveys for estimating the degree of sedimentation the aerial photographs can be obtained from freely accessible digital repositories managed by various third party sources over long periods a decade or more examples of these sources include esri u s department of agriculture usda and google databases most of the aerial images that we used in our studies were acquired through aerial surveys covering large areas of the landscape such surveys are annually acquired for almost the entire iowa state by eagleview inc https www eagleview com the images taken from low altitude flights are high resolution up to 3 inch enabling qualitative and quantitative inferences the quantitative analyses can be obtained from the ortho rectified and geo referenced aerial photographs fig 7 illustrates a sample of quantitative estimation of the degree of sedimentation at the culvert subsequently discussed see section 4 the images allow a 2 5 dimension mapping of the sediment extent i e segment lengths and polygon areas using a geoprocessing tool that allows the delineation of the sediment deposit contours directly on aerial images xu 2019 volumetric estimations can be made if in situ surveys are available for specific locations this detailed quantitative information can be used to determine numerical indices on the sediment extent that can usefully support the morphological interpretation of the stream structure interaction unmanned aerial vehicles uav photogrammetry uav based digital elevation surveys are increasingly popular due to their low cost and simple deployment as most contemporary uavs are equipped with digital cameras with continuously increased resolution and positioning accuracy they become reliable substitutes for aerial photo surveys compared with aerial images from low altitude flights the photographs collected from uavs are of higher accuracy and offer better processing flexibility uav based surveys entail the acquisition of repeated images the blue rectangles in fig 8 a show the position and orientation of the camera plane during individual shots that can be subsequently processed with structure from motion sfm software in conjunction with specialized photogrammetry processing packages such as the agisoft photoscan barbasiewicz et al 2018 used in this study like other photographic methods the drone surveys are most efficient if conducted just before spring with minimum vegetation in the surroundings aerial photographs carried out with drone based surveys can be subsequently processed to provide the three dimensional 3d characterization of the targeted areas the sequence of steps leading to 3d quantitative maps i e digital terrain models entails the following steps see fig 8 the 3d volumetric estimation is produced using the surface area tool embedded in arcgis s 3d analyst toolbox using the optical characteristics of the camera and the altitude recorded by the drone in the navigation software agisoft can create ortho rectified images the 3d maps allow us to quantitively visualize the degree of culvert sedimentation and volumetrically measure the sediment blockage at the culvert inlet and outlet ground control points definition in order to improve the accuracy of the uav surveys we typically use several ground control points spread uniformly over the observation area prior to the aerial survey the locations of the points were marked on the ground with large paint spots visible for the uav s camera the ground control points are subsequently surveyed with high accuracy topographic surveying tools such as an rtk the quality of the digital terrain reconstruction can be improved by using the auxiliary scaling provided by the ground control point coordinates in addition to the point cloud generated by the agisoft software if the site contains points with known locations from previous road or structure surveys the number of additional ground control points can be accordingly reduced previously analysts were required to manually specify ground control point coordinates and their visual characteristics in the photogrammetry software with the increased number of ground control points during the survey of larger areas this procedure can be time and labor consuming however the procedure is critical as it scales the point cloud generated from the photogrammetry based on the centimeter level rtk measurements to improve the overall accuracy of the original photogrammetric results whose accuracy depends on built in gps in a uav the built in gps sensors are less accurate than those from rtk in this study we devised and applied a novel data processing technique to automate the photogrammetric results scaling procedure using ground control points measured from rtk the technique aims to improve the accuracy of the volumetric estimation of the sediment deposits and reduce manual efforts the data processing technique analyzes the photogrammetry results 3d point cloud as multivariate data consisting of six essential fields these fields include three coordinate fields x y z and three pixel color fields rgb which can be exported to a csv file through the agisoft software then we conducted a multivariate clustering analysis to group the cloud of points based on its points similarity in the multivariate dimension points that are close to each other and have similar rgb values are placed into the same cluster by filtering clusters with the same or similar rgb values as the paint used to mark the control point we could automatically extract the control points marking in the point cloud and automatically map the rtk s coordinate based on their relative positions which are calculated as spatial indices the multivariate clustering of the point cloud is implemented using a python based self organizing map som which can perform multivariant clustering and preserve the topology between resulting clusters wittek et al 2013 the topology can be used to calculate the spatial indices afterward a geoprocessing script is developed to scale the point cloud based on the rtk control points measurement using the affine transformation algorithm weisstein 2004 our data processing technique for connecting control points with the photogrammetry results has been validated by digitizing objects with known volume and geometry the technique can be used to automate the control point handling procedure during other photogrammetric surveys 3 3 3 soil core sampling a better understanding of the origin of the material in the depositional islands can be obtained from soil core analysis the soil coring provides information on the sediment s thickness the sediment s material in the deposits and the stratification of the sediment layers indicative of the type of sediment transport occurring at various locations in the culvert vicinity in our culvert mitigation studies we conducted soil core sampling before removing the original sediment islands to provide a reference for the investigation subsequently the core sampling and analysis were conducted every year during the observational period the relatively small height of the depositional islands i e up to 2 m allowed us to manually collect the soil samples down to the bottom of the sediment deposits the samples were acquired with plastic tubes which have a diameter of 5 cm driven in the ground through percussion and rotation as specified in usda 2012 guidelines the sampling strategy took into account a representative spatial distribution of the samples in the culvert s vicinity 3 4 continuous monitoring the overall goal of the continuous monitoring is to document the effects of single and repeated storms propagating through the culvert with special attention given to the inception and subsequent development of the deposition patterns another important role of continuous monitoring is to better understand the role of vegetation in retaining the sediment for our case study the continuous monitoring enabled us to assess the impact of the newly created deposits on the culvert operation in various implementation stages of the sedimentation mitigation project i e before or after retrofitting with the low head downstream weir 3 4 1 on site sensors the detailed analysis of the sediment transport at culverts requires information on the originator and transporter of the sediment material accumulated at the culverts these agents are closely related to the local hydrologic and hydraulic conditions in our case study the weather conditions in the culvert drainage area are obtained from a network of meteorological stations provided by the iowa flood center iowafloodcenter org stream variables are captured with pressure sensors deployed at the culvert inlet and outlet and a turbidity sensor deployed near the upstream pressure sensor as illustrated in fig 9 a we use a pair of non vented pressure transducers i e in situ level troll 500 1 use of trade product or commercial names does not imply endorsement by the authors or authors institutions 1 the pressure transducer s accuracy is 0 05 full scale at 15 c the resolution is 0 005 of full scale according to the product brochure https www in situ com tracing the water stages in the culvert vicinity helps us determine the stream free surface slope across the culvert s structure and hence the energy losses as well as any potential backwater effects produced by the sediment accumulations see fig 9b top by tracking the rates of change of the turbidity recorded by the upstream sensor one can estimate the rates of suspended sediments moving through the culvert a sample of this type of measurement is illustrated in fig 9c the short duration of our low head weir study does not allow the development of a stage discharge rating that could be used to determine loads of suspended sediment passing through the culvert however the above mentioned measurements allow us to infer dependencies between sediment deposition rates and the factors driving sedimentation at this culvert site see fig 9 3 4 2 web cameras the real time communication web cameras are useful and efficient complementary tools for continuous observation of the local hydrologic hydraulic and morphologic conditions their use for our case study enables valuable observations on the flow patterns at the culvert inlet and outlet over a range of flows and inferences on the inception of the depositional patterns and the dynamics of sediment accumulation more importantly they provide valuable observations on the growth of vegetation in the vicinity of the culvert another decisive factor in the sediment island formation fig 10 a illustrates a customized enclosure for an off the shelf webcam with real time communication https www moultriemobile com the enclosure is waterproof adjustable for various viewing angles and equipped with a solar panel to ensure continuous operation without an external source of power in some of our previous monitoring studies the above described webcam system was complemented with a bridge mounted river stage sensor kruger et al 2016 this combination shown in fig 10 allows us to associate webcam images with stage measurements in real time 4 case study the previous section presents various measurement and monitoring methods acting alone these methods often need to be combined to complement each other for attaining specific analysis goals an illustration of the synergy between the methods is described below for a case study that aims to observe the performance of implementing a self cleaning design to a culvert chronically affected by the formation of sediment deposits muste xu 2020 the specific tasks associated with the evaluation of the culvert retrofit performance included the documentation of the progression of the following variables 1 degree of sedimentation at the culvert inlet 2 degree of blockage at the culvert entrance cross section 3 critical features for characterizing the hydro geomorphological dynamics and the nature of the sediment in the deposits and 4 vegetation growth given that completing the tasks resulted in qualitative and quantitative results we present the case study groped as qualitative and quantitative analyses the former analyses only result in descriptive data rather than definitive measurements guiding more rigorous analyses and generalizations in the future qualitative observations are critical for understanding the mechanics of complex interlinked processes and formulating research questions the quantitative observations are essential for supporting culvert design and maintenance activities and providing dependencies that can be used in the numerical modeling of the involved processes 4 1 qualitative sediment deposit analysis the qualitative investigation of the operation efficiency of the culvert retrofitted with the low head weir see fig 5 was primarily accomplished through photo documentation for this purpose we executed multiple field campaigns supported by protocols described in section 3 3 1 ground based photographic documentation section 3 3 2 aerial photography and section 3 4 2 web camera monitoring these protocols were used collectively in a complementary manner for most of the photographic documentation campaigns the pool was slowly drained by releasing the water in the culvert pool through the gated valve located in the downstream weir see fig 5d the results of the repeated ground based photographic surveys were assembled in fig 11 the ground based photographic documentation revealed that the preferential location for the inception of sediment deposition coincides with the location of the flow recirculation zones see fig 11b repeated photographic surveys of the progression over time of the underwater sediment deposit illustrated in fig 11a to 11e indicated the changes in the paths of the flow and sediment in the inundated area as expected sediment deposition is favored in areas where the flow conveyance velocity decreases e g outer bank and recirculation zones this inference reinforced observations obtained from laboratory experiments and numerical simulations executed on the same type of culverts ho et al 2013 the initial depositional areas continued to grow in elevation on practically the same footprint while these deposits developed quickly they did not protrude the water surface within the inundated area even during low flows consequently there was no vegetation growing on the underwater sediment deposits during the two year project lifetime another notable feature of ground based photo documentation was its capability to capture vegetation s growth on the sediment deposits which was difficult and costly to be estimated by other means the role of vegetation growth in culvert sedimentation is underestimated and is currently scarcely investigated as the prevalent assumption is that the sediment accumulated at the culvert will be flushed out during subsequent storm events the sediment flushing assumption might be valid for areas where the material in the deposits consists of coarse sediments without considerable fine soil fraction despite that compaction and stabilization are time evolving processes that limit sediment mobility our extensive field campaigns have not found evidence to support this assumption in the midwest waterscape where unstratified silt i e loess is a large portion of the deposition islands at culverts on the contrary our investigations together with a few other observations e g carey 2006 freyer jefferson 2013 suggest that vegetation presence and growth are critical for the initiation and consolidation of the sedimentation islands in order to test this hypothesis we took advantage of the natural scale conditions offered by our retrofitted culvert and made observations on the vegetation growth after the end of the study when the temporary weir was removed repeated photographs of the sediment islands exposed to air after the removal of the weir have demonstrated that the fertile soil in the deposits fed abundantly with moisture and seeded by naturally spread terrestrial vegetation facilitates fast vegetation growth rates this insight is illustrated in fig 12 remarkably the photograph sequence is acquired in late summer this observed vegetation growth is similar to the one occurring during the rainy springs when the sediment islands become exposed to air between storm events complementary to the photo documentation described above additional qualitative inferences were obtained from the imaging offered by aerial mapping and uav surveys described in section 3 2 2 the larger scale images from aerial mapping have the advantage of reducing the distortion inherent in ground based photographs see fig 13 the uav surveys were useful for observing the extent of the inundated area and the time lapsed changes produced by the underwater sediment deposits on the flow distribution similarly continuous photographic observations were obtained with two web cameras deployed at the culvert site one of the cameras captures the culvert inlet and the other captures the outlet their role was to monitor the pool created in the vicinity of the culvert by the downstream weir and inform the research team of unexpected changes occurring at the study site 4 2 quantitative sediment deposit analysis within the duration of the study we have executed four uav photogrammetric surveys following the protocols described in section 3 2 2 the images are acquired with a 4 k high resolution camera 12 76 mpixels installed on a dji inspire1 drone the photogrammetric software used for digital elevation reconstruction has built in packages specifically developed for the dji inspire1 s cameral model fc350 that resolve lens distortions and other optical constraints given that each combination of equipment components and processing software results in specific uncertainty ranges we have conducted several verification tests prior to the in situ measurements by mapping static objects e g cargo cases and cars of various dimensions with the same uav photogrammetry system during these calibration tests we found that the addition of rtk ground control points improved the measurement accuracy from 0 5 to 0 1 m the final results of the quantitative photogrammetric surveys are illustrated in fig 14 the first pair of surveys were conducted before and after the culvert cleanup operation which preceded the installation of the downstream weir two more surveys were conducted at the end of each monitoring year the last two surveys were obtained by draining the culvert pool by opening the gated pipe located in the weir the open sky area has been surveyed with uav the thickness of the deposition strata within the boxes was obtained by mapping the deposited layers with a laser range finder and a total station the uav and total station surveying results were combined during the post processing of surveyed data the quantitative nature of these surveys allows us to numerically estimate the volumes of the accumulated sediment reported in table 2 the close values of the areas occupied by the sediment deposits suggest that there has been no significant development of the planar extent of the sediment footprint during the observation period see the last column of the table the increase in the deposit volumes after the cleanup indicates that there has been a slight increase in their height during the observation period the limited planar growth of the underwater sediment deposits reinforces the assumption of an equilibrium regime attained between sediment and water mobility the streamflow conveyance through the culvert for various flow stages was constantly satisfactory during the observation period this type of hydraulic driven equilibrium did not block the cross sections at the culvert inlet and maintained the sediment deposits submersed precluding the growth of vegetation over their top surface another insightful quantitative assessment used in this study is the analysis of the soil stratification in the deposits the soli cores sampled from the sediment deposits before culvert retrofitting and one year after weir installation are shown in fig 15 a the core heights in this figure are represented in the same scale revealing that while the underwater sediment strata grew quite fast in the first observation year they were shorter than the pre cleanup values the soil cores sampled during the two surveys display alternations of coarse and fine sediment layers distinguishable by their color i e the dark color visualizes the silty loam soil while the lighter color the coarse sand the alternation of different types of layers within the cores is a signature of the strength of the storms passing through the culvert whereby the medium to high flows convey mostly suspended sediment dark colored layers while the extreme storms mobilize the bedload too light colored layer this observation was reinforced by the event based tracking done during the passage of the july 2018 storm the storm passage is visible in the stage turbidity plot illustrated in fig 15b with recordings acquired in situ by the deployed sensors the coarse sand layers observed at the top of the cores located in the upstream central area of the deposits shown in the lower part of fig 15a are unmistakably related to the passage of the july 2018 extreme storm as the coring was done mid october and between august to october period there were no significant storms passing through the culvert finally the last quantitative results presented herein reveal the origin of the sediment in the deposits as derived from the particle size distribution curves before retrofitting the culvert these analyses were carried out one year after downstream weir installation fig 16 summarizes the results of the particle size distribution analysis given that the cores sampled from the sediment deposits before retrofitting were considerably taller than those sampled one year after retrofitting the sediment analysis of the first set of cores was conducted separately for two or three sublayers for each core upper part of fig 16 the submerged deposits formed after retrofitting were significantly lower therefore we conducted only one sediment analysis per core lower plots in fig 16 as expected the granulometric analysis of the cores visualized in fig 16 reveals that the sediment in the deposit is a mixture of the silty loam with fine and coarse sand for practically all the analyzed cores the stratification of the coarse and fine layers in the cores is well correlated with the bimodal distribution of the particle size distribution shown in fig 16 while more explanations and interpretations can be extracted from the data collected during the executed measurements and monitoring pursuing a more detailed discussion is beyond the present paper s scope as our goal for the present paper is to substantiate the usability and complementarity of the observing methods moreover the observation period for this case study was of only two years which is a relatively short time compared with the lifetime of a culvert structure this short time interval impedes conclusive inferences from these preliminary analyses as they might not be sufficient to develop robust interpretations and correlations among the local hydrologic and hydraulic variables 5 conclusions the suite of measurement and monitoring methods presented in this paper facilitates the observation of the evolving sedimentation process at culvert sites the identified methods used in isolation are not unknown to the morphological community but their synergistic combination is novel and innovative fulfilling a wide range of research and practical goals and budgets unquestionably the in situ observations produced by these methods are difficult if possible at all to be gleaned from laboratory or numerical studies the main contribution of this methodological paper is that it identifies assembles and illustrates the usefulness of various techniques working complementary to capture the local processes with the proper spatial temporal granularity to support subsequent in depth research on the subject of sedimentation at the culvert most of the tools used in our investigation are modern and efficient and can be readily used to investigate other practical sedimentation problems i e channel migration floodplain evolution debris flows over a wide range of scales the practical implementation of the developed methods is demonstrated through a case study while the results obtained through this study can be regarded as indicative rather than confirmative they reveal that the suspended load dominates over the bedload in the depositional process an additional important factor involved in the overall sedimentation process is the growth of vegetation over the freshly formed sediment deposits this natural and inherent process is not typically accounted for in sedimentation studies despite that it can be used as a control agent for sedimentation processes another relevant finding inferred from the case study is that sedimentation is initiated and subsequently developed in the expansion area typically set at the culvert s inlet improved designs for constructing the expansion area could potentially reduce the accumulation of sediments at the culverts the preliminary results obtained with the described proof of concept methods are not exhaustive as not all the details on the system efficiency validation and uncertainty for individual procedures are presented herein such details would provide important information on the limitations of various measurement components and useful information on the maintenance and frequency of checking their accuracy however it is deemed that the presented instruments and the monitoring illustrates the variety of holistic observations that can be garnered to inform the community about sedimentation through multi barrel

3332,this paper describes a case study that employs an in situ methodology for monitoring sedimentation processes at a multi barrel culvert site this area is seldom discussed in the scientific and engineering literature the methodology integrates ground and aerial surveys from real time kinematic rtk and drone based photogrammetry with traditional hydro geomorphological monitoring techniques e g on site photography webcams soil coring and in stream measurements to acquire data continuously or for specific weather events the paper focuses on presenting how experimental methods and their associated protocols can be assembled to complement each other to enable a comprehensive and detailed investigation of culvert sedimentation processes the investigation entails the inception of the sediment deposits in the culvert vicinity and the progression of the depositional pattern over time e g individual storms seasons and annual cycles the data and information produced by our combined observational system lead to practical insights regarding the interplay between local hydraulic and geomorphological variables which can be otherwise difficult to obtain a automated data processing

sedimentation experimental methods monitoring uav aerial photogrammetry 1 introduction the vast majority of the u s midwestern secondary roads include culverts to enable stream crossings different construction types are used to accommodate the hydraulics of the culvert site and the hydrology of its drainage area typically multi barrel culverts are sized to handle specific return flows i e 25 50 or 100 years in the culvert design process cafferata et al 2017 pyles et al 1989 there is no substantial evidence to suggest that culverts failures are related to limited capabilities to convey the design discharges cafferata et al 2017 a more prevalent cause of culvert failure especially in humid continental environments is the accumulation of sediment and or debris at the culvert inlet these sediment deposits partially block the culverts and lead to culvert overtopping during flood events furniss et al 1998 foltz et al 2008 macdonald coe 2008 multi barrel culverts are often deployed at stream crossing with larger flows and higher road embankments this type of culvert is also known as multi box culverts muste xu 2017 a sample of ideal multi box culvert operation is indicated by a stable stream geometry in the culvert vicinity over time as illustrated in fig 1 a however situations such as those shown in fig 1a are rare across the u s midwest landscape surveys conducted by our research team in 2009 and 2013 indicate that about 95 of iowa culverts are silted ho 2010 muste xu 2017b sediment accumulations at culvert inlets considerably reduce their capability to handle more significant flow events as the partial blockage of the structures may severely impair their hydraulic capacity as illustrated in fig 1b obstruction at the culvert inlet may cause both damages to the transportation structure due to the culvert and road overtopping it also causes damages to upstream areas by creating a ponding area during floods the high degree severity of culvert sedimentation observed in many regions stems from the fact that the main and in many cases the only culvert design criteria is to ensure the design flow conveyance limited attention is paid to the sediment transport processes in the uphill areas and the vicinity of culverts during spring and summer storm events wolman 1967 culvert sedimentation concerns are widespread in the nation from california to pennsylvania and from wisconsin to florida rowley 2014 with direct bearing on the culvert s ability to maintain normal operation during extreme flows when the structure is essential for the communities they serve despite its ubiquitous presence the mitigation of sedimentation at culverts is a peripheral activity called upon only for extreme situations the systematic research efforts for the mitigation of culvert sedimentation are limited despite the availability of many technical means that can enable the comprehensive observation and understanding of the processes this situation is not well aligned with modern design concepts that focus on both the long term sustainability of the structures and the structural design that is solely based on their purpose erpicum et al 2021 a few past studies have extensive experience with various aspects of sedimentation at culverts our previous work entails laboratory modeling ho 2010 numerical simulations muste et al 2009 field observations muste xu 2017b and data driven modeling xu et al 2019a applied to a variety of multi box culvert and watersheds following these studies we screened designed and implemented several in situ retrofitting approaches to limit or totally eliminate the formation of the sediment deposits at culverts ho 2010 muste xu 2020 during a series of field observations we developed a suite of protocols for in situ monitoring of the culvert sedimentation processes including their onset and evolution our previous studies have developed a data driven approach i e multi criteria decision analysis and clustering to identify and explore factors e g watershed characteristics and culvert structure attribute contributing to culvert sediment accumulation xu et al 2019a xu et al 2019b since the previous studies shed light on the underlying culvert sedimentation processes and their dynamics this paper does not conduct further theory based analyses to explore and model culvert sedimentation processes instead the paper presents a multi pronged approach to support the investigation and monitoring of culvert sedimentation processes from an experimental field perspective our methodology combines a suite of surveying tools ancillary instruments and spatial analyses to enable the continuous and systematic monitoring of sediment depositions and their evolution e g sediment composition initial accumulation patterns event and long term progression at selected culverts the effort intends to illustrate how field instruments and protocols can underpin the in situ sedimentation research at culverts to compliment the previous data driven research we present a comprehensive workflow that integrates ground and aerial surveys from real time kinematic rtk and drone based photogrammetry with traditional hydro geomorphological monitoring techniques e g on site photography webcams soil coring and in stream measurements the workflow enables qualitative and quantitative monitoring of the sediment deposition together with multiple hydro geomorphological and culvert structural attributes identified through previous data driven studies creating a realistic 3d digital model of the culvert structure and surrounding terrain e g sediment deposited at the culvert s inlet to support various types of analyses a novel data processing technique is adopted in this study to automatically scale aerial photogrammetry results using the rtk based ground survey to improve the accuracy of the 3d terrain mapping subsequently the paper is organized as follows we start with a short review of the sedimentation processes to highlight the process variables of interest and monitoring requirements then we present the design and implementation of the multi pronged approach including the workflow a suite of instruments and ancillary protocols we close with a case study to substantiate the utility of our method by presenting sample results and research insights 2 culvert sedimentation processes and monitoring measurement needs conceptually the processes associated with culvert sedimentation can be grouped into three major categories as depicted in fig 2 1 soil detachment i e erosion sediment supply and sediment production as illustrated in fig 2a 2 sediment transport overland and in stream demonstrated in fig 2b and 3 sediment deposition settling at culvert structure and stabilization due to vegetation growth as shown in fig 2b the three categories of sedimentation processes are tightly related in an end to end spatial continuum the continuum connects the sedimentation sources in drainage basins and the transport pathways through watersheds and stream networks with the deposits formed at the culverts haan et al 1994 schumm 1977 merritt et al 2003 and lord et al 2009 multi box culverts located within flat erodible watersheds are prone to sediment blockage a data driven study by xu 2019 investigates the origin and interconnections among the processes involved in forming sediment deposits at culverts as an end to end process more than 800 iowa culverts have been analyzed using machine learning to determine sedimentation causality and dependencies as physical based investigations of culvert sedimentation through simulation are scarcely reported in the literature this section discusses some salient features of the sedimentation process to substantiate the variables of interest for monitoring culvert sedimentation in the field these variables are selected as surrogates of the underlying sedimentation processes and are summarized in fig 2 and table 1 along with their relevant data sources the findings published in the literature along with our recent observations indicate that surrogate variables related to the flow sediment interaction within the culvert vicinity are significant contributors to the deposition of sediment at culverts in detail our previous work found that the most important local factors leading to sedimentation at culverts include the stream to culvert width scw ratio the type of culvert flow control i e inlet or outlet and the stream geomorphological and ecological aspects at culvert location ho 2010 xu et al 2019b information assembled during field visits and from aerial photographs collected over successive years has revealed that the process of sedimentation at culverts can attain a stable form of sediment deposits in no more than four to five years muste xu 2017a the outcomes of the above mentioned data driven studies support informed decisions for developing methods towards the effective mitigation of culvert sedimentation they also facilitate the design of the monitoring methods presented in this paper this paper focuses on an experiment driven case study to explore and monitor the environmental and structure variables identified from previous studies to shed light on the culvert sedimentation processes this paper s main goal is to assemble a set of tools and ancillary customized analyses to systematically and comprehensively monitor the culvert sedimentation process s evolution and illustrate how these tool kits and protocols can underpin in situ research of sedimentation at culverts through these observations we can also evaluate the effectiveness of the mitigation solution 3 methodology this section provides an overview of our methodology to present the necessary context of the culvert sedimentation we also describe the overall design of our methods then we introduce our study area and describe the technical details of our monitoring and surveying methods 3 1 overview the dynamics of the sediment movement from the erosion source to the deposition area depend on multiple factors these factors include culvert location in the drainage area the culvert s configuration and its structure positioning with respect to the stream for the same culvert location the sediment transport regimes can be different depending on the characteristics of individual storm events and the type of the culvert s hydraulic control for example at an inlet control culvert the sediment prone area is upstream near the culvert s inlet for a culvert with outlet control its barrels and downstream area can be more silted given that the top criteria for culvert design are the conveyance of water without considering the sediment transport an implicit assumption is that the culvert site morphology does not change over time this assumption is rarely fulfilled in natural scale conditions as repeated storms passing through the culvert can dramatically change the as constructed situation a consideration not accounted for in the culvert design aggravating concerns are related to vegetation growth and debris accumulation on the sediment deposits these concerns further complicate both the flow conveyance and stability of the culvert structures as they stabilize the sediment deposits this peculiar combination of factors requires a combination of long term continuous monitoring protocols complemented by ad hoc event based measurements and surveys to capture the sediment dynamics and its actual progression closely the monitoring methods and associated equipment described in this paper are identified for serving the needs of a series of studies focused on understanding the inception and progression of sedimentation at culverts muste xu 2017a muste xu 2017b muste xu 2020 none of these experimental methods and prescribed protocols are new when used individually however their selection and assemblage for fulfilling the investigation needs related to culvert sedimentation are original innovative and practical there are few references if at all that guide users on how to tackle such in situ investigations the assembled experimental observation methods include 1 the volumetric estimation of the sediment deposits 2 photo documentation of the culvert sites and their progression in time and 3 hydrologic hydraulic variables that reflect in stream sediment load discharge and the type of sediment material near the culvert the methods can be grouped into two classes as shown in fig 3 an automated data processing technique is adopted in this study to connect aerial photogrammetry results with the rtk based ground survey to improve the accuracy of the volumetric estimation of the sediment deposits the data processing technique analyzes the digitized culvert structure and terrain as 3d point cloud data and conducts a multivariate clustering analysis to identify ground control points in the point cloud to connect their coordinates with the measurement from rtk through further spatial transformations the technique automates the digitized culvert and sediment deposit measurement to ensure a centimeter level accuracy the event based measurements and surveys are short term field observation campaigns which are critical for the targeted processes as the event s intensity dictates the magnitude and extent of the changes in the sediment deposition continuous monitoring is required to track slowly progressing processes such as sediment deposit stabilization and vegetation growth it also helps establish the critical progression thresholds for the sedimentation at culvert dynamics we screened tested and evaluated the efficiency of this set of complementary methods in situ during a case study subsequently presented while the methods fit our specific research needs our methodology can serve the investigative needs for other multiple faceted geomorphological studies it can also be applied to monitor environmental and fluvial processes at other stream crossings the main variables tracked through these surveys are the changes in the stream to culvert width ratio scw over time scw b w the areal degree of sedimentation and the blockage at the culvert entrance as illustrated in fig 4 b is the width of the undisturbed stream that is upstream of a culvert and its inlet expansion area considered as distributed streams due to the hydraulic changes induced by the culvert structure w is the structural width of the culvert the degree of the sedimentation a critical parameter for the present study defines the ratio between the area occupied by sediment deposits at any given time and that of the original clearance between the inlet and outlet in relation to the natural stream at the time of the culvert construction the degree of sediment blockage characterizes the reduction of the culvert s inlet cross section which directly affects the structure s capacity to convey high flows 3 2 study area study site most of the measurement and monitoring technologies described in this and the next section are applied to a three box culvert located on willow creek in iowa city iowa the culvert has an upstream watershed of 11 943 km2 it has been undergoing intensive urbanization in the last 30 years the culvert passes return flows of 26 40 75 and 92 m3 s for 5 10 50 and 100 years respectively this culvert was retrofitted with a self cleaning design a concept launched by ho et al 2013 these designs mitigate sedimentation inception and progression without external intervention relying entirely on the streams hydraulic power to pass suspended and bedload downstream the culvert the self cleaning solution implemented for this culvert consists of a low head weir located downstream at a short distance from the culvert s outlet as shown in fig 5 a muste xu 2020 the weir creates a shallow pool of water both upstream and downstream of the culvert to keep the deposited sediment layers submersed from all flow regimes passing through the culvert see fig 5b and 5c the inspection of the underwater sediment deposit formation was facilitated by a gated pipe installed at the bottom of the downstream weir as illustrated in fig 5d by opening the valve the pool created by the weir could be drained whenever a site inspection was needed i e after large storm events at the beginning and the end of the seasons for consolidating the temporarily installed weir this arrangement enables the effective monitoring and situational awareness of the underwater sediment deposits in the culvert vicinity allowing a good understanding of the hydrodynamic processes and the nature of the deposits materials 3 3 event based field measurements surveys event based field surveys are acquired at the beginning and the end of the observation period as well as in conjunction with major sediment transport events following large storms 3 3 1 ground surveys real time kinetic rtk for sites where the sedimentation s quantitative estimation is essential an in situ survey with rtk gps has been used barry and coakley 2013 gerke and przybilla 2016 the instrument used in our study is a trimble r8s oy 2017 the resultant survey of the sediment deposits quantifies the degree of culvert sedimentation and the blockage at the culvert inlet and outlet the two global indicators for the operational status of the culvert see fig 5 given that the equipment and personnel s in situ deployment for acquiring the needed rtk data is time and cost consuming only a few such surveys have been conducted due to the limited number of points that can be surveyed using the rtk the resolution of the rtk based topographic survey is relatively courses despite its centimeter level accuracy riley et al 2000 therefore another role of the detailed rtk in situ surveys is to compare or supplement the digital terrain reconstruction using aerial photographs as described in the following subsection a leica d2 hand held laser range finder for surveying was used within the culvert structure as the gps signals are blocked in that area ground based photographic documentation comprehensive visual evidence of the sedimentation processes can be obtained with photo documentation in the vicinity of the culvert to capture the sedimentation process generic features our team used this method when inspecting more than 250 culvert sites in the state of iowa through previous projects this type of survey is most effective when conducted using a uniform image acquisition sequence during periods of minimal vegetation coverage i e march and april before the vegetation is dormant the established imaging sequence used the same succession and coverage to uniformly offer the same viewing angles for each documented culvert as illustrated in fig 6 the close up images provide detailed information on the sediment deposit footprint and if periodically acquired over time valuable hints for understanding the underlying mechanism for sedimentation patterns and their evolution this type of survey provides the highest resolution information on the status and the effects of vegetation and its connection with sediment deposit formation and progression 3 3 2 aerial surveys analysis photographic mapping this protocol provides an efficient alternative to the in situ photographic surveys for estimating the degree of sedimentation the aerial photographs can be obtained from freely accessible digital repositories managed by various third party sources over long periods a decade or more examples of these sources include esri u s department of agriculture usda and google databases most of the aerial images that we used in our studies were acquired through aerial surveys covering large areas of the landscape such surveys are annually acquired for almost the entire iowa state by eagleview inc https www eagleview com the images taken from low altitude flights are high resolution up to 3 inch enabling qualitative and quantitative inferences the quantitative analyses can be obtained from the ortho rectified and geo referenced aerial photographs fig 7 illustrates a sample of quantitative estimation of the degree of sedimentation at the culvert subsequently discussed see section 4 the images allow a 2 5 dimension mapping of the sediment extent i e segment lengths and polygon areas using a geoprocessing tool that allows the delineation of the sediment deposit contours directly on aerial images xu 2019 volumetric estimations can be made if in situ surveys are available for specific locations this detailed quantitative information can be used to determine numerical indices on the sediment extent that can usefully support the morphological interpretation of the stream structure interaction unmanned aerial vehicles uav photogrammetry uav based digital elevation surveys are increasingly popular due to their low cost and simple deployment as most contemporary uavs are equipped with digital cameras with continuously increased resolution and positioning accuracy they become reliable substitutes for aerial photo surveys compared with aerial images from low altitude flights the photographs collected from uavs are of higher accuracy and offer better processing flexibility uav based surveys entail the acquisition of repeated images the blue rectangles in fig 8 a show the position and orientation of the camera plane during individual shots that can be subsequently processed with structure from motion sfm software in conjunction with specialized photogrammetry processing packages such as the agisoft photoscan barbasiewicz et al 2018 used in this study like other photographic methods the drone surveys are most efficient if conducted just before spring with minimum vegetation in the surroundings aerial photographs carried out with drone based surveys can be subsequently processed to provide the three dimensional 3d characterization of the targeted areas the sequence of steps leading to 3d quantitative maps i e digital terrain models entails the following steps see fig 8 the 3d volumetric estimation is produced using the surface area tool embedded in arcgis s 3d analyst toolbox using the optical characteristics of the camera and the altitude recorded by the drone in the navigation software agisoft can create ortho rectified images the 3d maps allow us to quantitively visualize the degree of culvert sedimentation and volumetrically measure the sediment blockage at the culvert inlet and outlet ground control points definition in order to improve the accuracy of the uav surveys we typically use several ground control points spread uniformly over the observation area prior to the aerial survey the locations of the points were marked on the ground with large paint spots visible for the uav s camera the ground control points are subsequently surveyed with high accuracy topographic surveying tools such as an rtk the quality of the digital terrain reconstruction can be improved by using the auxiliary scaling provided by the ground control point coordinates in addition to the point cloud generated by the agisoft software if the site contains points with known locations from previous road or structure surveys the number of additional ground control points can be accordingly reduced previously analysts were required to manually specify ground control point coordinates and their visual characteristics in the photogrammetry software with the increased number of ground control points during the survey of larger areas this procedure can be time and labor consuming however the procedure is critical as it scales the point cloud generated from the photogrammetry based on the centimeter level rtk measurements to improve the overall accuracy of the original photogrammetric results whose accuracy depends on built in gps in a uav the built in gps sensors are less accurate than those from rtk in this study we devised and applied a novel data processing technique to automate the photogrammetric results scaling procedure using ground control points measured from rtk the technique aims to improve the accuracy of the volumetric estimation of the sediment deposits and reduce manual efforts the data processing technique analyzes the photogrammetry results 3d point cloud as multivariate data consisting of six essential fields these fields include three coordinate fields x y z and three pixel color fields rgb which can be exported to a csv file through the agisoft software then we conducted a multivariate clustering analysis to group the cloud of points based on its points similarity in the multivariate dimension points that are close to each other and have similar rgb values are placed into the same cluster by filtering clusters with the same or similar rgb values as the paint used to mark the control point we could automatically extract the control points marking in the point cloud and automatically map the rtk s coordinate based on their relative positions which are calculated as spatial indices the multivariate clustering of the point cloud is implemented using a python based self organizing map som which can perform multivariant clustering and preserve the topology between resulting clusters wittek et al 2013 the topology can be used to calculate the spatial indices afterward a geoprocessing script is developed to scale the point cloud based on the rtk control points measurement using the affine transformation algorithm weisstein 2004 our data processing technique for connecting control points with the photogrammetry results has been validated by digitizing objects with known volume and geometry the technique can be used to automate the control point handling procedure during other photogrammetric surveys 3 3 3 soil core sampling a better understanding of the origin of the material in the depositional islands can be obtained from soil core analysis the soil coring provides information on the sediment s thickness the sediment s material in the deposits and the stratification of the sediment layers indicative of the type of sediment transport occurring at various locations in the culvert vicinity in our culvert mitigation studies we conducted soil core sampling before removing the original sediment islands to provide a reference for the investigation subsequently the core sampling and analysis were conducted every year during the observational period the relatively small height of the depositional islands i e up to 2 m allowed us to manually collect the soil samples down to the bottom of the sediment deposits the samples were acquired with plastic tubes which have a diameter of 5 cm driven in the ground through percussion and rotation as specified in usda 2012 guidelines the sampling strategy took into account a representative spatial distribution of the samples in the culvert s vicinity 3 4 continuous monitoring the overall goal of the continuous monitoring is to document the effects of single and repeated storms propagating through the culvert with special attention given to the inception and subsequent development of the deposition patterns another important role of continuous monitoring is to better understand the role of vegetation in retaining the sediment for our case study the continuous monitoring enabled us to assess the impact of the newly created deposits on the culvert operation in various implementation stages of the sedimentation mitigation project i e before or after retrofitting with the low head downstream weir 3 4 1 on site sensors the detailed analysis of the sediment transport at culverts requires information on the originator and transporter of the sediment material accumulated at the culverts these agents are closely related to the local hydrologic and hydraulic conditions in our case study the weather conditions in the culvert drainage area are obtained from a network of meteorological stations provided by the iowa flood center iowafloodcenter org stream variables are captured with pressure sensors deployed at the culvert inlet and outlet and a turbidity sensor deployed near the upstream pressure sensor as illustrated in fig 9 a we use a pair of non vented pressure transducers i e in situ level troll 500 1 use of trade product or commercial names does not imply endorsement by the authors or authors institutions 1 the pressure transducer s accuracy is 0 05 full scale at 15 c the resolution is 0 005 of full scale according to the product brochure https www in situ com tracing the water stages in the culvert vicinity helps us determine the stream free surface slope across the culvert s structure and hence the energy losses as well as any potential backwater effects produced by the sediment accumulations see fig 9b top by tracking the rates of change of the turbidity recorded by the upstream sensor one can estimate the rates of suspended sediments moving through the culvert a sample of this type of measurement is illustrated in fig 9c the short duration of our low head weir study does not allow the development of a stage discharge rating that could be used to determine loads of suspended sediment passing through the culvert however the above mentioned measurements allow us to infer dependencies between sediment deposition rates and the factors driving sedimentation at this culvert site see fig 9 3 4 2 web cameras the real time communication web cameras are useful and efficient complementary tools for continuous observation of the local hydrologic hydraulic and morphologic conditions their use for our case study enables valuable observations on the flow patterns at the culvert inlet and outlet over a range of flows and inferences on the inception of the depositional patterns and the dynamics of sediment accumulation more importantly they provide valuable observations on the growth of vegetation in the vicinity of the culvert another decisive factor in the sediment island formation fig 10 a illustrates a customized enclosure for an off the shelf webcam with real time communication https www moultriemobile com the enclosure is waterproof adjustable for various viewing angles and equipped with a solar panel to ensure continuous operation without an external source of power in some of our previous monitoring studies the above described webcam system was complemented with a bridge mounted river stage sensor kruger et al 2016 this combination shown in fig 10 allows us to associate webcam images with stage measurements in real time 4 case study the previous section presents various measurement and monitoring methods acting alone these methods often need to be combined to complement each other for attaining specific analysis goals an illustration of the synergy between the methods is described below for a case study that aims to observe the performance of implementing a self cleaning design to a culvert chronically affected by the formation of sediment deposits muste xu 2020 the specific tasks associated with the evaluation of the culvert retrofit performance included the documentation of the progression of the following variables 1 degree of sedimentation at the culvert inlet 2 degree of blockage at the culvert entrance cross section 3 critical features for characterizing the hydro geomorphological dynamics and the nature of the sediment in the deposits and 4 vegetation growth given that completing the tasks resulted in qualitative and quantitative results we present the case study groped as qualitative and quantitative analyses the former analyses only result in descriptive data rather than definitive measurements guiding more rigorous analyses and generalizations in the future qualitative observations are critical for understanding the mechanics of complex interlinked processes and formulating research questions the quantitative observations are essential for supporting culvert design and maintenance activities and providing dependencies that can be used in the numerical modeling of the involved processes 4 1 qualitative sediment deposit analysis the qualitative investigation of the operation efficiency of the culvert retrofitted with the low head weir see fig 5 was primarily accomplished through photo documentation for this purpose we executed multiple field campaigns supported by protocols described in section 3 3 1 ground based photographic documentation section 3 3 2 aerial photography and section 3 4 2 web camera monitoring these protocols were used collectively in a complementary manner for most of the photographic documentation campaigns the pool was slowly drained by releasing the water in the culvert pool through the gated valve located in the downstream weir see fig 5d the results of the repeated ground based photographic surveys were assembled in fig 11 the ground based photographic documentation revealed that the preferential location for the inception of sediment deposition coincides with the location of the flow recirculation zones see fig 11b repeated photographic surveys of the progression over time of the underwater sediment deposit illustrated in fig 11a to 11e indicated the changes in the paths of the flow and sediment in the inundated area as expected sediment deposition is favored in areas where the flow conveyance velocity decreases e g outer bank and recirculation zones this inference reinforced observations obtained from laboratory experiments and numerical simulations executed on the same type of culverts ho et al 2013 the initial depositional areas continued to grow in elevation on practically the same footprint while these deposits developed quickly they did not protrude the water surface within the inundated area even during low flows consequently there was no vegetation growing on the underwater sediment deposits during the two year project lifetime another notable feature of ground based photo documentation was its capability to capture vegetation s growth on the sediment deposits which was difficult and costly to be estimated by other means the role of vegetation growth in culvert sedimentation is underestimated and is currently scarcely investigated as the prevalent assumption is that the sediment accumulated at the culvert will be flushed out during subsequent storm events the sediment flushing assumption might be valid for areas where the material in the deposits consists of coarse sediments without considerable fine soil fraction despite that compaction and stabilization are time evolving processes that limit sediment mobility our extensive field campaigns have not found evidence to support this assumption in the midwest waterscape where unstratified silt i e loess is a large portion of the deposition islands at culverts on the contrary our investigations together with a few other observations e g carey 2006 freyer jefferson 2013 suggest that vegetation presence and growth are critical for the initiation and consolidation of the sedimentation islands in order to test this hypothesis we took advantage of the natural scale conditions offered by our retrofitted culvert and made observations on the vegetation growth after the end of the study when the temporary weir was removed repeated photographs of the sediment islands exposed to air after the removal of the weir have demonstrated that the fertile soil in the deposits fed abundantly with moisture and seeded by naturally spread terrestrial vegetation facilitates fast vegetation growth rates this insight is illustrated in fig 12 remarkably the photograph sequence is acquired in late summer this observed vegetation growth is similar to the one occurring during the rainy springs when the sediment islands become exposed to air between storm events complementary to the photo documentation described above additional qualitative inferences were obtained from the imaging offered by aerial mapping and uav surveys described in section 3 2 2 the larger scale images from aerial mapping have the advantage of reducing the distortion inherent in ground based photographs see fig 13 the uav surveys were useful for observing the extent of the inundated area and the time lapsed changes produced by the underwater sediment deposits on the flow distribution similarly continuous photographic observations were obtained with two web cameras deployed at the culvert site one of the cameras captures the culvert inlet and the other captures the outlet their role was to monitor the pool created in the vicinity of the culvert by the downstream weir and inform the research team of unexpected changes occurring at the study site 4 2 quantitative sediment deposit analysis within the duration of the study we have executed four uav photogrammetric surveys following the protocols described in section 3 2 2 the images are acquired with a 4 k high resolution camera 12 76 mpixels installed on a dji inspire1 drone the photogrammetric software used for digital elevation reconstruction has built in packages specifically developed for the dji inspire1 s cameral model fc350 that resolve lens distortions and other optical constraints given that each combination of equipment components and processing software results in specific uncertainty ranges we have conducted several verification tests prior to the in situ measurements by mapping static objects e g cargo cases and cars of various dimensions with the same uav photogrammetry system during these calibration tests we found that the addition of rtk ground control points improved the measurement accuracy from 0 5 to 0 1 m the final results of the quantitative photogrammetric surveys are illustrated in fig 14 the first pair of surveys were conducted before and after the culvert cleanup operation which preceded the installation of the downstream weir two more surveys were conducted at the end of each monitoring year the last two surveys were obtained by draining the culvert pool by opening the gated pipe located in the weir the open sky area has been surveyed with uav the thickness of the deposition strata within the boxes was obtained by mapping the deposited layers with a laser range finder and a total station the uav and total station surveying results were combined during the post processing of surveyed data the quantitative nature of these surveys allows us to numerically estimate the volumes of the accumulated sediment reported in table 2 the close values of the areas occupied by the sediment deposits suggest that there has been no significant development of the planar extent of the sediment footprint during the observation period see the last column of the table the increase in the deposit volumes after the cleanup indicates that there has been a slight increase in their height during the observation period the limited planar growth of the underwater sediment deposits reinforces the assumption of an equilibrium regime attained between sediment and water mobility the streamflow conveyance through the culvert for various flow stages was constantly satisfactory during the observation period this type of hydraulic driven equilibrium did not block the cross sections at the culvert inlet and maintained the sediment deposits submersed precluding the growth of vegetation over their top surface another insightful quantitative assessment used in this study is the analysis of the soil stratification in the deposits the soli cores sampled from the sediment deposits before culvert retrofitting and one year after weir installation are shown in fig 15 a the core heights in this figure are represented in the same scale revealing that while the underwater sediment strata grew quite fast in the first observation year they were shorter than the pre cleanup values the soil cores sampled during the two surveys display alternations of coarse and fine sediment layers distinguishable by their color i e the dark color visualizes the silty loam soil while the lighter color the coarse sand the alternation of different types of layers within the cores is a signature of the strength of the storms passing through the culvert whereby the medium to high flows convey mostly suspended sediment dark colored layers while the extreme storms mobilize the bedload too light colored layer this observation was reinforced by the event based tracking done during the passage of the july 2018 storm the storm passage is visible in the stage turbidity plot illustrated in fig 15b with recordings acquired in situ by the deployed sensors the coarse sand layers observed at the top of the cores located in the upstream central area of the deposits shown in the lower part of fig 15a are unmistakably related to the passage of the july 2018 extreme storm as the coring was done mid october and between august to october period there were no significant storms passing through the culvert finally the last quantitative results presented herein reveal the origin of the sediment in the deposits as derived from the particle size distribution curves before retrofitting the culvert these analyses were carried out one year after downstream weir installation fig 16 summarizes the results of the particle size distribution analysis given that the cores sampled from the sediment deposits before retrofitting were considerably taller than those sampled one year after retrofitting the sediment analysis of the first set of cores was conducted separately for two or three sublayers for each core upper part of fig 16 the submerged deposits formed after retrofitting were significantly lower therefore we conducted only one sediment analysis per core lower plots in fig 16 as expected the granulometric analysis of the cores visualized in fig 16 reveals that the sediment in the deposit is a mixture of the silty loam with fine and coarse sand for practically all the analyzed cores the stratification of the coarse and fine layers in the cores is well correlated with the bimodal distribution of the particle size distribution shown in fig 16 while more explanations and interpretations can be extracted from the data collected during the executed measurements and monitoring pursuing a more detailed discussion is beyond the present paper s scope as our goal for the present paper is to substantiate the usability and complementarity of the observing methods moreover the observation period for this case study was of only two years which is a relatively short time compared with the lifetime of a culvert structure this short time interval impedes conclusive inferences from these preliminary analyses as they might not be sufficient to develop robust interpretations and correlations among the local hydrologic and hydraulic variables 5 conclusions the suite of measurement and monitoring methods presented in this paper facilitates the observation of the evolving sedimentation process at culvert sites the identified methods used in isolation are not unknown to the morphological community but their synergistic combination is novel and innovative fulfilling a wide range of research and practical goals and budgets unquestionably the in situ observations produced by these methods are difficult if possible at all to be gleaned from laboratory or numerical studies the main contribution of this methodological paper is that it identifies assembles and illustrates the usefulness of various techniques working complementary to capture the local processes with the proper spatial temporal granularity to support subsequent in depth research on the subject of sedimentation at the culvert most of the tools used in our investigation are modern and efficient and can be readily used to investigate other practical sedimentation problems i e channel migration floodplain evolution debris flows over a wide range of scales the practical implementation of the developed methods is demonstrated through a case study while the results obtained through this study can be regarded as indicative rather than confirmative they reveal that the suspended load dominates over the bedload in the depositional process an additional important factor involved in the overall sedimentation process is the growth of vegetation over the freshly formed sediment deposits this natural and inherent process is not typically accounted for in sedimentation studies despite that it can be used as a control agent for sedimentation processes another relevant finding inferred from the case study is that sedimentation is initiated and subsequently developed in the expansion area typically set at the culvert s inlet improved designs for constructing the expansion area could potentially reduce the accumulation of sediments at the culverts the preliminary results obtained with the described proof of concept methods are not exhaustive as not all the details on the system efficiency validation and uncertainty for individual procedures are presented herein such details would provide important information on the limitations of various measurement components and useful information on the maintenance and frequency of checking their accuracy however it is deemed that the presented instruments and the monitoring illustrates the variety of holistic observations that can be garnered to inform the community about sedimentation through multi barrel

3333,the interspecific and temporal dynamics of tree water use are poorly understood we investigated in high temporal resolution patterns of water use of two tree species platycladus orientalis and quercus variabilis in a temperate mountainous monsoon forest in northern china we leverage a unique sampling design where we systematically traced tree water source of ten individuals continuously throughout a three year period 2015 2017 using stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen coupled with root distribution assessment and measurements of transpiration rates we observed species specific patterns in tree water use q variabilis withdrew water evenly from different soil layers without detectable seasonal changes in pattern in water use throughout the different years by contrast p orientalis increases shallow source water uptake during the rainy season in all three years isotopic composition of both species plotted along an evaporation line below the local meteoric water line lmwl however during sporadic periods in the rainy and transition season p orientalis plotted on the lmwl and showed similar isotopic to spring water this suggests an ephemeral ecohydrological connectivity between tree water source and spring water during short periods within the wet and transition season the observed distinct patterns in tree water use between the two species may be associated with root distribution characteristics besides root morphological traits our data also suggest that the influence of overall stem volume vob on water source contribution depends on the rainfall and species our results support the seasonality of ecohydrological separation observed in previous studies additionally our data show that that ecohydrological separation may be species dependent in a temperate mountainous monsoon forest keywords ecohydrological separation root morphology source water partitioning stable isotopes temperate forest 1 introduction water availability is one of the key resources that determines plant species distribution across terrestrial ecosystems silvertown et al 2015 on the other hand plant transpiration represents about 60 of all evaporation flux on land good et al 2015 li et al 2019 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wei et al 2017 thus plants play a key role in influencing climate conditions sheil 2014 and regulating ecosystems hydrological cycle brantley et al 2017 changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are expected to increase drought frequency and forest mortality bose et al 2021 thus a comprehensive understanding of plant water sources is crucial to improved projections of forest distribution good et al 2017 tree mortality choat et al 2018 and ecohydrological feedback between the biosphere and the atmosphere berg et al 2016 under projected climate change scenarios stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o respectively have been used to trace vegetation water source and shed light on ecohydrological processes brooks et al 2010 tetzlaff et al 2021 von freyberg et al 2020 this approach compares the isotopic signature of the plant xylem water with the potential water sources to infer the mixture of water sources contributing to xylem corbin et al 2005 edwin et al 2014 rothfuss and javaux 2017 tree water use investigations have provided insights into intra specific water source partitioning carri√®re et al 2020c del castillo et al 2016 mart√≠n g√≥mez et al 2017 and seasonal tree water use barbeta et al 2015 deng et al 2021 sohel et al 2021 these previous studies showed that depth of water source contribution is sensitive to seasonal climate fluctuations indeed tree species shows seasonal shifts in the depth of root water uptake in response to soil water availability carri√®re et al 2020b fan et al 2017 and precipitation seasonality jia et al 2017 retzlaff et al 2001 and in short time scales shifts are triggered by changes in tree water status in response to environmental conditions nehemy et al 2021 tree water use investigations in semiarid and arid regions have shown clear shifts in water source from shallow during the rainy season to deeper layers during the dry season dai et al 2015 nie et al 2011 the plasticity of plant water uptake patterns in response to seasonal fluctuations in soil water availability has significant implications to maintaining vital plant functions chitra tarak et al 2021 klein 2014 voltas et al 2015 such as transpiration and growth br√©da et al 2006 schenk and jackson 2002 however this information is incomplete in many ecosystems therefore high resolution and long term observations of xylem and soil water isotopic composition covering the annual dry wet cycle can provide understanding of tree water use and future insights into tree response to water availability under predicted changes in patterns of precipitation inputs konapala et al 2020 besides tree water use plasticity and response to changes in patterns of moisture availability the use of higher frequency sampling of xylem and soil water throughout different seasons is especially important to understand tree water use and the connectivity with various sources of transpiration tree water source investigations have shown evidence of ecohydrological separation between trees and the more mobile water that recharge groundwater and later contribute to streams brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2015 goldsmith et al 2012 these studies suggest that mixing process involving precipitation and soil matrix is incomplete and trees rely on soil water that is tightly bound to the soil matrix brooks et al 2010 this pool of water stored in soil pores that supply transpiration appears to be functionally disconnected from water that contributes to streamflow however more recent investigations herv√© fern√°ndez et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 showed evidence of ecohydrological connectivity between trees and stream during the wet season these studies showed that xylem water offset from more mobile water and observe in previous tree water use investigations could be explained by mechanisms that is seasonally dependent herv√© fern√°ndez et al 2016 and zhao et al 2018 studies proposed that the connectivity between trees and streams is subjected to seasonality but evidence of this ecohydrological connectivity is limited to forests with high precipitation inputs during the wet season e g 1413 mm in a rainy temperate forest herv√© fern√°ndez et al 2016 and 703 mm in subtropical monsoon forest zhao et al 2018 or throughout the year geris et al 2015 further investigation of connectivity between trees and groundwater in more arid environments with increasing sampling frequency throughout wet dry cycles would be useful to test mechanisms proposed in wetter climates ecohydrological study in the critical zone is of utmost concern especially for future forest management in areas that face critical water resources challenge carri√®re et al 2020a creed et al 2019 mcdonnell et al 2018 the assessment of intra specific differences in access the diverse water sources may be relevant for understanding the impact of warming on contemporary populations and for tailoring mitigation strategies to climate change climate change is expected to increase the occurrence of extreme precipitation events myhre et al 2019 and alter water balance dynamics reshmidevi et al 2018 exposing mountainous forests in drought prone areas to greater challenges of water accessibility however the understanding is incomplete regarding tree water use in temperate mountain forests where precipitation inputs concentrated during a short period in the wet season insights in plant water use strategy in this area has important implications to comprehend adaptive mechanism underlying forest survival and which species may thrive under possible climate scenarios here we present a high temporal resolution investigation on patterns of source water partitioning and the ecohydrological connectivity between trees water source and groundwater in a temperate mountainous forest we leverage a unique experimental setting where we continuously traced the water source of two species of contrasting growing forms throughout a three year period 2015 2017 in an environment where potential evapotranspiration pet doubles precipitation inputs we coupled stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen with individual morphological information of root and stem volume to specifically ask 1 what is the source of transpiration in this temperate monsoon environment through the different seasons 2 how does patterns of source water use vary among species and individuals with different morphological characteristics 3 do we observe an ecohydrological separation between trees and nearby spring during the wet season these findings have wide relevance for understanding the mechanism of tree water use drought impact in species survival and species coexistence in temperate mountain areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experimental site has an area of 16 km2 and is located within the jiufeng national forest park 116 05 39 116 05 31 e 40 03 27 40 03 56 n 150 m a s l beijing china which covers an area of 16 km2 fig s1 the area is strongly influenced by the continental monsoon climate the mean annual temperature is 11 6 c 2000 2017 the annual potential evapotranspiration reaches 1100 mm meanwhile the annual average precipitation is 660 mm 30 years average 1988 2017 70 of which occurs from june to september considering the diversity of species composition we selected mixed stands of platycladus orientalis an evergreen coniferous species and quercus variabilis a deciduous broad leaved species as our research subject the stands are a result of an afforestation campaign in 1970 s to restore the native forest the study area falls in the range of the karst hydrosystem in the west mountain area in beijing liu et al 2019 the study site does not lie on the geological fault zone anticline or syncline soils in our study site are characterized as a thin mountain cinnamon ustalf which are calcareous soils formed mainly from weathering of gneissic granitite limestone and shale zheng et al 2020 the depth of soil layer above the fractured granite bedrock ranges from 40 cm to 120 cm with an average depth of 60 cm the humus is relative rich at the surface 10 cm the upper layers 0 40 cm contain a high amount of clay and a low amount of gravel the deep layers below 40 cm feature the loam texture with a high amount of gravel liu et al 2019 2 2 microclimatic and soil moisture measurements meteorological variables including temperature relative humidity solar radiation and precipitation were monitored by hobo weather station u30 nrc onset usa located 1 km away from the experimental plots soil water content was observed with ech2o moisture sensors decagon usa at 20 cm intervals from 0 to 100 cm the soil water content data were recorded by the em50 data collector decagon usa the data was recorded every 30 min 2 3 morphological traits we sampled tree root system in august of 2015 2016 and 2017 to obtain the vertical profile of root biomass soil samples were extracted using hand augers inner diameter d 90 mm at the depth of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 cm it was difficult to obtain soil samples beneath 80 cm due to the rocky nature of the underground layers therefore the sampling depths varied below 80 cm until we reached bedrock the deepest soil sampling was obtained from 120 cm deep we selected three individual trees from each species and sampled soil in three different directions 50 cm away from each trunk the samples from each corresponding individual were mixed and sealed in a bag and taken to the lab for further root biomass measurements we first sieved the samples using a 5 mm sieves to separate the larger roots d 5 mm then we used nylon mesh sieves to separate fine roots 2 mm and coarse roots d 2 mm akburak and makineci 2021 fin√©r et al 2011 we used tweezers to collect the sieved roots root of different diameter classes were then oven dried at 70 c for 48 h to get the root biomass g to understand the root biomass distribution along the examined soil profiles we calculated the root biomass ratio as the percentage of the weight of individual root diameter categories to the total root biomass of the soil profile we also measured dbh diameter at breast height and height to calculate stem volume over bark vob for each sampling tree climent et al 2008 reinhardt et al 2006 2 4 isotope sampling and analysis to examine tree water sources in different seasons we grouped the months into three main periods the dry season from november to april the rainy season from june to september and two transition periods in may and october we collected precipitation spring xylem and soil samples for water isotopic analysis during the three main seasons throughout 2015 2017 we collected simultaneously soil and xylem samples during each sampling campaign this was done to determine the isotopic composition of the two species throughout the three year period original sample size nprecip 142 nspring 51 nsoil 1420 nxylem 5130 n stands for sample size we collected three suberized branches per tree immediately removed the bark and stored in 50 ml vials sealed with parafilm m to avoid evaporative fractionation we collected soil samples using soil augers within a 50 cm radius away from the truck of the individual tree the soil sampling depths followed the same depth distribution as the root biomass excavation with maximum depth reaching the soil bedrock interface approximately 1 m depth we changed the auger head after each drilling to avoid isotopic contamination from previous layers we discarded approximately 3 cm of the 0 20 cm soil sample to eliminate the possible evaporative enrichment effect of the uppermost layer because that part of the dry season overlaps with winter soil sampling was not possible during periods when the soil was frozen therefore soil sampling during the dry season was less frequent and only occurred when soil thawed during the rainy season and the transition period the sampling campaigns were carried after rainfall events soil samples of each layer were stored in 50 ml vials and sealed with parafilm m xylem and soil samples were stored in a portable fridge and transported to the laboratory in the laboratory the samples were stored at 4 until isotopic analysis we collected precipitation near the meteorological station we used ball in funnel type collectors prechsl et al 2014 to minimize evaporative fractionation precipitation samples were collected after each rainfall event we also collected grab samples of a nearby natural spring 600 m distance from trees the spring water seeps out of the ground and water flows throughout all seasons we transferred water precipitation and spring samples to polyethylene vials sealed with parafilm m and transported back to the lab samples were refrigerated until analysis sampling campaigns were carried between morning and midday for all sampling materials isotopic offset between xylem and soil precipitation water source has been reported barbeta et al 2020 barbeta et al 2019 recent study cautioned that isotopic information of xylem water extracted through the cryogenic method might affect xylem water and thus yield an isotopic offset chen et al 2020 however it has also been shown that cryogenic vacuum extraction can reveal reliable isotope results k√ºhnhammer et al 2021 newberry et al 2017 moreover the integration of oxygen isotope signals in the bayesian inference framework can improve the source water attribution evaristo et al 2017 therefore the xylem and soil water was extracted using cryogenic vacuum distillation koeniger et al 2011 the isotopic compositions of all water samples were measured with a liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 lgr inc usa at the laboratory both Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values can be measured simultaneously with this instrument isotope ratios are expressed as 1 Œ¥ 2 h o r Œ¥ 18 o r sample r s tan d a r d 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard indicate the isotope ratio of the samples were calculated relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the measurement accuracies of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o were 0 83 and 0 36 respectively plants are abundant in organic matter which can lead to spectral contamination if such compounds are co extracted during cryogenic vacuum distillation mart√≠n g√≥mez et al 2015 among the diverse range of organic compounds methanol is shown to lead to larger discrepancies on isotopic measurements using laser spectrometry leen et al 2012 schultz et al 2011 spectrally contaminated samples were identified using the software provided by lgr lwia spectral contamination identifier v1 0 lwia sci and then post corrected following method developed by schultz et al 2011 and leen et al 2012 and shown to be applicable to tree water isotopic measurements barbeta et al 2019 mart√≠n g√≥mez et al 2015 specific contamination curve was individually fitted for the specific analyzer see supplementary information 2 5 transpiration sap flow was monitored as a proxy of the transpiration of ten individual trees ten individuals of different dbh sizes were selected from each species table s1 thermal dissipation probes tdp dynamax inc houston tx usa were inserted following protocols chen et al 2011 the 30 min average was recorded in cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan ut usa the sap flux density js g cm 2 s 1 was calculated as follows 4 j s 0 0119 d tm d t d t 1 231 where dtm and dt are the maximum temperature difference and the temperature difference at time t between the two probes transpiration ec mm d 1 was then calculated as follows 5 e c 3600 i 0 24 j s a s a c where as is the sapwood area cm2 and ac is the canopy area m2 of the tree 3600 is the coefficient for conversion from seconds to hour as was determined through tree cores two cores were drilled along the north south and the east west of one sample trees cores were not taken from the sampled trees for tdp observation to avoid the possible influence from the wound with the measurements of tree cores as calculated as follows 6 a s œÄ r d r h 2 where rd is the de barked diameter i e dbh minus bark thickness rh means the diameter of the heartwood which was derived by subtracting sapwood depth from rd the sapwood depth was determined by the color discrimination between sapwood and heartwood of the increment cores empirical relationships between dbh and as were established as as 0 852dbh2 0979 r2 0 99 p 0 01 and as 0 785dbh2 0782 r2 0 99 p 0 01 for p orientalis and q variabilis respectively the as of un cored trees were derived from these empirical relationships 2 6 tree water source partitioning and statistical analysis we used the mixsiar bayesian mixing model stock et al 2018 to determine the contribution of potential water sources the sampling dates were tested independently for their respective water source therefore for each date the xylem water was entered as the mixture information the isotopic signatures of each potential water source were entered in the model as follows soil water isotope data from 1 3 40 cm 2 40 80 cm and 3 80 cm on the day of xylem sampling campaign the 3 40 cm layer represents the upper layers where roots are abundant and is more affected by evaporation layers below 80 cm represents the deep layers at the soil bedrock interface where the soil starts to be replaced by rocks and larger fractures might exist in between these the 40 80 cm represents the middle soil layer line conditioned excess offset from the local meteoric water line lmwl Œ¥2h 6 37Œ¥18o 6 61 can reflect the evaporative loss of different water source comparing to local precipitation henceforth lc excess was used to assess the offset of different water pools from the lwml the line conditioned excess was calculated following landwehr and coplen 2006 lc excess Œ¥ 2 h a Œ¥ 18 o b where a and b are the slope and intercept of the lmwl respectively negative lc excess values indicate isotopic enrichment due to evaporation in analogy to lc excess we also used sw excess as suggested by barbeta et al 2019 to investigate the offset between xylem soil in relation to the soil the soil water line excess is then defined as sw excess Œ¥ 2 h a s Œ¥ 18 o b s where as and bs are the slope and intercept of the soil water line respectively negative sw excess indicated the xylem data plot below the soil water line of the corresponding soil water isotopes sampled on the same day since we used cryogenic vacuum distillation to extract soil water sw excess represents the distance of xylem water to bulk soil water which is composed mainly of tightly bound and more mobile water one way anova was employed to test significant differences of samples that qualified the homogeneity of variance tests due to the sample size disparities of different seasons the kruskal wallis k w test was used to detect significant differences of values among different seasons we conducted partial correlation analysis to determine the importance of tree morphological traits on tree water source partitioning the environmental variables served as the covariate variables in the partial correlation analysis including soil volumetric water content vwc vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa and solar radiation r mj m 2 statistical analyses were conducted using r software version 3 6 2 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions solar radiation in 2017 84 19 2 43 s e s e stands for standard error w m 2 was significantly lower than in 2015 130 97 4 07 s e w m 2 and 2016 75 83 5 07 s e w m 2 p 0 05 one way anova there was no significant difference among the three years p 0 05 one way anova precipitation was 580 mm 649 mm and 309 3 mm in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively soil water content demonstrated strong seasonality this was consistent with the rainfall inputs in different seasons soil moisture increased close to saturation during the rainy season this was especially the case for the surface layers moreover the differences in soil moisture of different layers were small during the rainy season fig 1 3 2 isotopic compositions of the soil water we observed large variability in the isotopic composition of soil and precipitation throughout the different seasons fig 2 fig s2 precipitation Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o followed a progressive depletion as the rainy season began and became more enriched by the end of this period fig 2a the soil water was isotopically distinct from precipitation during the study period p 0 05 one way anova however soil water isotopic composition still reflected the temporal trend of precipitation isotopic signature fig 2b g soil water isotopic composition was significantly more depleted in 2h and 18o in the rainy season than in the dry and transition season p 0 05 for both Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o respectively k w test therefore the soil water Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o profile across the observation depth in the rainy season was different from that in the dry and transition season fig 2c v s 2b d fig 2f v s 2e 2g during the dry and transition season the surface 3 40 cm soil water was more enriched in 2h and 18o than the deep layers indicating evaporative fractionation at the surface during this season bulk soil water isotopic composition followed a consistent pattern of increasing depletion with depth the latter was the opposite from what was observed in the soil water profile during the rainy season in all seasons the surface 0 20 cm soil water was significantly different from the deeper layers with few exceptions the one way anova analysis detected significant differences among soil layers table 1 indicating isotopic heterogeneity along with the soil profile 3 3 discrimination of water sources and tree water uptake patterns we observed distinct xylem water isotopic composition across the different species fig 3 the isotopic signature of p orientalis spread along soil water isotopic composition distribution on dual isotope space this species also showed different xylem isotopic composition between the different seasons p 0 05 for xylem Œ¥2h k w test p orientalis xylem water isotopic composition plotted closer or overlapped with the spring water isotopic composition and the lwml during the transition and rainy season fig 3a c the xylem water of this species was significantly more depleted in 2h and 18o during the rainy in relation to other seasons p 0 01 k w test by contrast q variabilis maintained a relatively stable xylem isotopic composition without significant differences across different seasons p 0 05 k w test visual observation of the xylem water samples in the dual isotope space indicated that some xylem samples from q variabilis also fell outside of the observed distribution of soil water isotopic composition fig 3d f and showed to be slightly more fractionated isotopic composition than soil water fig 4 and s5 shows the mixing model analysis for p orientalis and q variabilis during the three seasons p orientalis demonstrated a significant variation in water uptake patterns from different layers depending on seasonality fig 4 a s5a while q variabilis maintained a relative equal partitioning of water uptake among the different layers irrespective of seasonality fig 4b s5b dual isotope observations indicate that p orientalis isotopic composition was more similar to shallow soil layers fig s2 s3 during the rainy and transition season the soil water of the layer at 3 40 cm accounted for 41 49 and 27 86 of the xylem water of this species in the rainy season and transition period respectively fig 4a p orientalis relied on soil water below 40 cm reducing shallow soil water uptake during the dry season the shift of water source from dry season to rainy season was observed as surface water contribution significantly increased from 26 01 to 41 49 by contrast water uptake by q variabilis from the surface and deep layers remained around 30 33 in all three seasons respectively 3 4 ecohydrological separation and connectivity between trees and groundwater we evaluated the isotopic offset between xylem and soil water using the sw excess per sampling campaign fig 5 overall the sw excess of q variabilis sw excess 7 96 7 28 mean sd was lower than p orientalis 1 60 6 30 fig 5a the deviation of q variabilis from sw excess of 0 occurred independent of rainy seasons or soil moisture conditions larger differences from a zero sw excess for both species were observed during the dry season between 2016 and 2017 p orientalis showed positive sw excess during some occasions throughout the transition and rainy season this indicates that bulk soil water was more depleted in heavy isotopes than xylem water the isotopic composition of spring water showed small deviation from that of the precipitation and spring lc excess was close to 0 i e plot close or on the lmwl fig 5 soil water and xylem lc excess from p orientalis and q variabilis were negative during the dry season indicating an offset from the lwml however p orientalis showed lc excess values close to 0 during sampling periods within the transition and rainy season of 2015 2016 and the rainy season of 2017 on days where p orientalis lc excess was close to zero we observed no significant difference between the xylem water of p orientalis and that of the spring water this was observed during 21 may 2 june 2015 p 0 05 k w test 6 jun 2015 p 0 05 k w test 11 oct in 2016 p 0 05 k w test 4 8 nov in 2016 p 0 05 k w test and 20 28 aug in 2017 p 0 05 k w test the same was not observed for q variabilis which showed a constant negative lc excess throughout the transition and wet seasons q variabilis lc excess was more negative than p orientalis and soil water excess throughout the three years 3 5 tree morphological traits and source water partitioning q variabilis and p orientalis exhibited contrasting root biomass distributions along with the soil profile fig 6 p orientalis showed well developed shallow lateral roots and deep penetrating taproots this is species also showed small variability in root biomass of different diameter classes within soil layers p orientalis showed an overall decline in root biomass with increasing soil depth fig 6a specifically the fine roots biomass was significantly higher at 0 20 cm depth than in deeper layers p 0 05 one way anova by contrast q variabilis demonstrated a relatively even distribution of root biomass along with the soil profile except for the large roots d 5 mm at the depth of 20 40 cm also large roots d 5 mm of this species were present in all layers and in larger proportions than roots of same diameter for p orientalis q variabilis fine roots were mainly found above 60 cm and in lower proportions than fine roots of p orientalis fig 6 table 2 shows a constant positive correlation between root biomass and source of water uptake across different soil layers however the relationship between vob and different soil layers depended on the species and seasonality 4 discussion we know that transpiration is a dominant flux on land surface schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wei et al 2017 and that there are evidence of the connectivity between transpiration and streamflow during the wet season in more humid environments herv√© fern√°ndez et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 geris et al 2015 however our knowledge is incomplete regarding the connectivity between source of transpiration and nearby spring in drier environments specially across trees with distinct growing forms an evergreen and a deciduous species our high temporal resolution tree water source investigation in a temperate forest in china showed a distinct tree water use pattern between the two coexisting species and seasonal connectivity between trees and nearby spring original sample size nprecip 142 nspring 51 nsoil 1420 nxylem 5130 n stands for sample size to our knowledge we are the first to investigate ecohydrological separation in high temporal resolution in a temperate mountainous forest and systematically trace tree water source throughout a three year period 4 1 root morphology and water source partitioning our high temporal resolution tree water source investigation showed a distinct tree water use pattern between coexisting p orientalis and q variabilis tree species we observed differences in the proportional contributions of water across soil layers throughout the different seasons between the two species while q variabilis showed a more constant source water partitioning and equal contribution from different layers independent of the season p orientalis showed changes in source water partition with changes in seasonality our data suggest an increase in shallow soil water uptake during the rainy season by p orientalis previous studies observed distinct patterns in water use by coexisting plants dai et al 2015 del castillo et al 2016 wang et al 2020 and suggested that different strategies in source water uptake is a primary mechanism for plant coexistence schenk 2008 silvertown et al 2015 thus observed patterns in tree water use brings ecological understanding about hydrological niche segregation and coexistence of individual species de deurwaerder et al 2018 rooting depth and biomass are essential for trees to acquire water and nutrient and may help to explain distinct tree water use patterns among the different species we showed that p orientalis had more developed fine root system in the surface layers than the co occurring species q variabilis fine roots are important for soil water uptake and this may have resulted in the observed larger water uptake from the upper soil profile with increase water availability in the rainy season from p orientalis the maximized fine roots in shallow layers characterizes species with fast resource acquisition strategy which are more opportunistic regarding water use moreno guti√©rrez et al 2012 by contrast we observed a more developed deep root system in q variabilis with larger biomass of coarser roots than p orientalis the root biomass of q variabilis was also relatively evenly distributed across the soil profile the higher proportion of coarse root biomass and well distributed across the soil profile characterized species with a more conservative root water acquisition strategy fort et al 2017 moreno guti√©rrez et al 2012 thus such root system may have enabled a steady access to water without any significant shifts in water uptake patterns across different seasons which may explain our observations additionally q variabilis could have developed roots into the fractured bedrock and accessed rock moisture during the dry season this is has been observed for other quercus species hahm et al 2020 rempe and dietrich 2018 the more stable source water apportionment may have been also a result of a combination of hydraulic traits that allowed q variabilis to maintain stable water status which may not have been the case for p orientalis the support of a stable water source observed in q variabilis is also indicated by a steadier transpiration rates when compared to p orientalis throughout seasons fig s4 we hypothesize that such changes in water uptake patterns observed through high temporal sampling resolution may have been a result of changes in water status in p orientalis and resulted in observed shifts with changes in soil wetness conditions this has been previously observed in controlled conditions and proposed as the mechanism to explain source water apportionment nehemy et al 2021 4 2 seasonal ecohydrological separation early work by brooks et al 2010 proposed the ecohydrological separation hypothesis by showing that trees use soil water that is more tightly bound and is isotopically distinct from the more mobile water that infiltrates the soil and travels through preferential flow paths and later contributes to streams while a more mechanistic understanding is yet necessary to explain observed ecohydrological separation sprenger allen 2020 this has been a useful hypothesis to understand patterns of tree water use across different study sites and seasons previous tree water use investigation by herv√© fern√°ndez et al 2016 in a rainy temperate forest in chile and by zhao et al 2018 in a hillslope in a subtropical monsoon climate in china supported the ecohydrological separation hypothesis during the dry season however they indicated a hydrological connectivity between trees and streams during the wet season according to them this could be explained by larger antecedent precipitation amounts before sampling period the previous studies were conducted in climates with relatively large precipitation inputs during the wet season and until now we lacked seasonal understanding between trees and underground streams in more arid climates overall xylem water from q variabilis was consistently distinct from spring water and showed a negative lc excess while this was also mostly the case for p orientallis there were specific sampling periods where this species xylem isotopic was not distinct from spring water and showed a lc excess close to zero although we did not find any direct connection between these events and precipitation amounts the overlap between xylem water and lmwl occurred during the transition and wet season thus our data suggests an ephemeral ecohydrological connectivity between p orientallis s source water and spring sources at our sites fig 5 p orientallis with higher proportion of fine roots at the shallow layers may have enable this species to acquire recent precipitation inputs and subsurface flow moving through the subsurface towards the spring during the rainy season by comparison the fine roots of q variabilis at surface layer accounts for small portion of total biomass and across the whole soil profile it only accounts for 10 which decrease the ability of this species to absorb water from surface layers although we were unable to obtain the root distribution within the fractured bedrock it is possible that q variabilis developed deeper root system into the rock fractures therefore the hydrogeological and morphological conditions may lay the foundation for the observed difference in ecohydrological separation between species 5 methodological limitations the xylem water isotopic composition of p orientalis overlapped with available soil water sources across all three years of observation however dual isotope assessment of q variabilis and sw excess indicates that xylem water was more depleted in 2h than bulk soil water sources previous work has shown that xylem water isotopic composition can be more depleted than soil water signatures and this offset has been observed in particular for Œ¥2h barbeta et al 2019 tetzlaff et al 2021 however the mechanisms that explain this offset are still unknown several studies have discussed possible mechanisms that could affect xylem water isotopic signatures and result in an offset between xylem and soil water sources this includes the role of mycorrhiza fungi during root water uptake poca et al 2019 the mixing of internal water sources zhao et al 2016 nehemy et al 2022 the influence of plant water status barbeta et al 2020 possible fractionation caused by cryogenic extraction of xylem water chen et al 2020 the extraction of bulk xylem water rather than sap water barbeta et al 2022 or results influenced by more depleted rock moisture hahm et al 2020 rempe and dietrich 2018 oshun et al 2016 regardless of the relative magnitude of this offset between xylem and soil water the steady assessment of water sources by q variabilis is still supported by the analysis during the three year observed period in contrast p orientalis xylem water was not observed to be more depleted in 2h than soil water as xylem plotted along soil water distribution on dual isotope space fig 3 thus possible mechanisms that result in more negative Œ¥2h values may affect only or more strongly q variabilis tree water source investigations rely on the adequate sampling of all available sources to root water uptake we may have failed to characterize all sources for q variabilis since this species showed some xylem water isotopic composition that plotted outside of soil water distribution because we sampled until we met the soil bedrock interface we hypothesize that q variabilis could have deeper roots that access water into the bedrock not sampled in our study site the latter could more likely explain the offset between xylem and soil water for this species which was also more evident during the dry and transition season the use of rock moisture as discussed above has been previously reported in the literature as an important water source to sustain transpiration of other oak species hahm et al 2020 rempe and dietrich 2018 and forests in general during drier periods mccormick et al 2021 the water extracted from rocks is usually more depleted in 2h and 18o than soil water in previous studies hahm et al 2020 rempe and dietrich 2018 oshun et al 2016 and it could be a potential explanation to our observed offset between q variabilis and soil the use of rock moisture by q variabilis may also support the steady water source across different seasons as this deeper resource may be more reliable than water storage within the thin soil layer further research is needed to confirm this assumption by sampling rock moisture at the research site to reduce uncertainties regarding xylem water isotopic composition and to disentangle possible causes of the offset between xylem and soil water one might consider using continuous in situ methods to measure xylem water and bypass uncertainties related to extraction approaches marshall et al 2020 volkmann et al 2016 or record sample water content when using cryogenic extraction systems to understand potential effects of this method chen et al 2020 since in situ monitoring is not suitable in remote areas accessing tree water isotopic heterogeneity by sampling phloem water nehemy et al 2022 or sampling sap water directly instead of bulk xylem water barbeta et al 2022 might also help to understand potential offsets in xylem isotopic values additionally tree hydraulic monitoring might improve source water interpretations by not relying on stable isotopes alone nehemy et al 2021 dubbert et al 2019 6 conclusion our observations highlight distinct tree water use patterns across species growing in a temperate forest environment in china during a long term observation period from an ecological perspective our results show that co occurring species in this karst environment explore different water sources we also show that combining morphological traits with tracers can improve understanding of patterns in tree water use the shallow rooted p orientalis increases shallow soil water uptake during the rainy season while the more deep rooted q variabilis draws water evenly from different soil layers independent of seasonality these findings were consistent throughout the three year observation period and provided an understanding of how the studied ecosystem functions throughout the different seasons by understanding how the current ecosystem functions we can better evaluate how future climate warming may impact patterns in tree water use and potential shifts in species composition our data suggested an ephemeral ecohydrological connectivity between p orientalis and groundwater during the wet and transition period but an ecohydrological separation for q variabilis irrespective of the precipitation seasonality these observations were consistent across the three monitored years and seems to be a characteristic of the investigated ecosystem the ephemeral occurrence of ecohydrological connectivity underlines the necessity to cover multiple seasons to improve understanding of the connectivity between transpiration and groundwater and its impact on water availability investigating tree water sources continuously throughout different years provides important means to understanding tree water source partitioning and our ability to conceptualize how forests explore subsurface water storage credit authorship contribution statement guodong jia conceptualization methodology data curation

3333,the interspecific and temporal dynamics of tree water use are poorly understood we investigated in high temporal resolution patterns of water use of two tree species platycladus orientalis and quercus variabilis in a temperate mountainous monsoon forest in northern china we leverage a unique sampling design where we systematically traced tree water source of ten individuals continuously throughout a three year period 2015 2017 using stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen coupled with root distribution assessment and measurements of transpiration rates we observed species specific patterns in tree water use q variabilis withdrew water evenly from different soil layers without detectable seasonal changes in pattern in water use throughout the different years by contrast p orientalis increases shallow source water uptake during the rainy season in all three years isotopic composition of both species plotted along an evaporation line below the local meteoric water line lmwl however during sporadic periods in the rainy and transition season p orientalis plotted on the lmwl and showed similar isotopic to spring water this suggests an ephemeral ecohydrological connectivity between tree water source and spring water during short periods within the wet and transition season the observed distinct patterns in tree water use between the two species may be associated with root distribution characteristics besides root morphological traits our data also suggest that the influence of overall stem volume vob on water source contribution depends on the rainfall and species our results support the seasonality of ecohydrological separation observed in previous studies additionally our data show that that ecohydrological separation may be species dependent in a temperate mountainous monsoon forest keywords ecohydrological separation root morphology source water partitioning stable isotopes temperate forest 1 introduction water availability is one of the key resources that determines plant species distribution across terrestrial ecosystems silvertown et al 2015 on the other hand plant transpiration represents about 60 of all evaporation flux on land good et al 2015 li et al 2019 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wei et al 2017 thus plants play a key role in influencing climate conditions sheil 2014 and regulating ecosystems hydrological cycle brantley et al 2017 changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are expected to increase drought frequency and forest mortality bose et al 2021 thus a comprehensive understanding of plant water sources is crucial to improved projections of forest distribution good et al 2017 tree mortality choat et al 2018 and ecohydrological feedback between the biosphere and the atmosphere berg et al 2016 under projected climate change scenarios stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o respectively have been used to trace vegetation water source and shed light on ecohydrological processes brooks et al 2010 tetzlaff et al 2021 von freyberg et al 2020 this approach compares the isotopic signature of the plant xylem water with the potential water sources to infer the mixture of water sources contributing to xylem corbin et al 2005 edwin et al 2014 rothfuss and javaux 2017 tree water use investigations have provided insights into intra specific water source partitioning carri√®re et al 2020c del castillo et al 2016 mart√≠n g√≥mez et al 2017 and seasonal tree water use barbeta et al 2015 deng et al 2021 sohel et al 2021 these previous studies showed that depth of water source contribution is sensitive to seasonal climate fluctuations indeed tree species shows seasonal shifts in the depth of root water uptake in response to soil water availability carri√®re et al 2020b fan et al 2017 and precipitation seasonality jia et al 2017 retzlaff et al 2001 and in short time scales shifts are triggered by changes in tree water status in response to environmental conditions nehemy et al 2021 tree water use investigations in semiarid and arid regions have shown clear shifts in water source from shallow during the rainy season to deeper layers during the dry season dai et al 2015 nie et al 2011 the plasticity of plant water uptake patterns in response to seasonal fluctuations in soil water availability has significant implications to maintaining vital plant functions chitra tarak et al 2021 klein 2014 voltas et al 2015 such as transpiration and growth br√©da et al 2006 schenk and jackson 2002 however this information is incomplete in many ecosystems therefore high resolution and long term observations of xylem and soil water isotopic composition covering the annual dry wet cycle can provide understanding of tree water use and future insights into tree response to water availability under predicted changes in patterns of precipitation inputs konapala et al 2020 besides tree water use plasticity and response to changes in patterns of moisture availability the use of higher frequency sampling of xylem and soil water throughout different seasons is especially important to understand tree water use and the connectivity with various sources of transpiration tree water source investigations have shown evidence of ecohydrological separation between trees and the more mobile water that recharge groundwater and later contribute to streams brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2015 goldsmith et al 2012 these studies suggest that mixing process involving precipitation and soil matrix is incomplete and trees rely on soil water that is tightly bound to the soil matrix brooks et al 2010 this pool of water stored in soil pores that supply transpiration appears to be functionally disconnected from water that contributes to streamflow however more recent investigations herv√© fern√°ndez et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 showed evidence of ecohydrological connectivity between trees and stream during the wet season these studies showed that xylem water offset from more mobile water and observe in previous tree water use investigations could be explained by mechanisms that is seasonally dependent herv√© fern√°ndez et al 2016 and zhao et al 2018 studies proposed that the connectivity between trees and streams is subjected to seasonality but evidence of this ecohydrological connectivity is limited to forests with high precipitation inputs during the wet season e g 1413 mm in a rainy temperate forest herv√© fern√°ndez et al 2016 and 703 mm in subtropical monsoon forest zhao et al 2018 or throughout the year geris et al 2015 further investigation of connectivity between trees and groundwater in more arid environments with increasing sampling frequency throughout wet dry cycles would be useful to test mechanisms proposed in wetter climates ecohydrological study in the critical zone is of utmost concern especially for future forest management in areas that face critical water resources challenge carri√®re et al 2020a creed et al 2019 mcdonnell et al 2018 the assessment of intra specific differences in access the diverse water sources may be relevant for understanding the impact of warming on contemporary populations and for tailoring mitigation strategies to climate change climate change is expected to increase the occurrence of extreme precipitation events myhre et al 2019 and alter water balance dynamics reshmidevi et al 2018 exposing mountainous forests in drought prone areas to greater challenges of water accessibility however the understanding is incomplete regarding tree water use in temperate mountain forests where precipitation inputs concentrated during a short period in the wet season insights in plant water use strategy in this area has important implications to comprehend adaptive mechanism underlying forest survival and which species may thrive under possible climate scenarios here we present a high temporal resolution investigation on patterns of source water partitioning and the ecohydrological connectivity between trees water source and groundwater in a temperate mountainous forest we leverage a unique experimental setting where we continuously traced the water source of two species of contrasting growing forms throughout a three year period 2015 2017 in an environment where potential evapotranspiration pet doubles precipitation inputs we coupled stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen with individual morphological information of root and stem volume to specifically ask 1 what is the source of transpiration in this temperate monsoon environment through the different seasons 2 how does patterns of source water use vary among species and individuals with different morphological characteristics 3 do we observe an ecohydrological separation between trees and nearby spring during the wet season these findings have wide relevance for understanding the mechanism of tree water use drought impact in species survival and species coexistence in temperate mountain areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experimental site has an area of 16 km2 and is located within the jiufeng national forest park 116 05 39 116 05 31 e 40 03 27 40 03 56 n 150 m a s l beijing china which covers an area of 16 km2 fig s1 the area is strongly influenced by the continental monsoon climate the mean annual temperature is 11 6 c 2000 2017 the annual potential evapotranspiration reaches 1100 mm meanwhile the annual average precipitation is 660 mm 30 years average 1988 2017 70 of which occurs from june to september considering the diversity of species composition we selected mixed stands of platycladus orientalis an evergreen coniferous species and quercus variabilis a deciduous broad leaved species as our research subject the stands are a result of an afforestation campaign in 1970 s to restore the native forest the study area falls in the range of the karst hydrosystem in the west mountain area in beijing liu et al 2019 the study site does not lie on the geological fault zone anticline or syncline soils in our study site are characterized as a thin mountain cinnamon ustalf which are calcareous soils formed mainly from weathering of gneissic granitite limestone and shale zheng et al 2020 the depth of soil layer above the fractured granite bedrock ranges from 40 cm to 120 cm with an average depth of 60 cm the humus is relative rich at the surface 10 cm the upper layers 0 40 cm contain a high amount of clay and a low amount of gravel the deep layers below 40 cm feature the loam texture with a high amount of gravel liu et al 2019 2 2 microclimatic and soil moisture measurements meteorological variables including temperature relative humidity solar radiation and precipitation were monitored by hobo weather station u30 nrc onset usa located 1 km away from the experimental plots soil water content was observed with ech2o moisture sensors decagon usa at 20 cm intervals from 0 to 100 cm the soil water content data were recorded by the em50 data collector decagon usa the data was recorded every 30 min 2 3 morphological traits we sampled tree root system in august of 2015 2016 and 2017 to obtain the vertical profile of root biomass soil samples were extracted using hand augers inner diameter d 90 mm at the depth of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 cm it was difficult to obtain soil samples beneath 80 cm due to the rocky nature of the underground layers therefore the sampling depths varied below 80 cm until we reached bedrock the deepest soil sampling was obtained from 120 cm deep we selected three individual trees from each species and sampled soil in three different directions 50 cm away from each trunk the samples from each corresponding individual were mixed and sealed in a bag and taken to the lab for further root biomass measurements we first sieved the samples using a 5 mm sieves to separate the larger roots d 5 mm then we used nylon mesh sieves to separate fine roots 2 mm and coarse roots d 2 mm akburak and makineci 2021 fin√©r et al 2011 we used tweezers to collect the sieved roots root of different diameter classes were then oven dried at 70 c for 48 h to get the root biomass g to understand the root biomass distribution along the examined soil profiles we calculated the root biomass ratio as the percentage of the weight of individual root diameter categories to the total root biomass of the soil profile we also measured dbh diameter at breast height and height to calculate stem volume over bark vob for each sampling tree climent et al 2008 reinhardt et al 2006 2 4 isotope sampling and analysis to examine tree water sources in different seasons we grouped the months into three main periods the dry season from november to april the rainy season from june to september and two transition periods in may and october we collected precipitation spring xylem and soil samples for water isotopic analysis during the three main seasons throughout 2015 2017 we collected simultaneously soil and xylem samples during each sampling campaign this was done to determine the isotopic composition of the two species throughout the three year period original sample size nprecip 142 nspring 51 nsoil 1420 nxylem 5130 n stands for sample size we collected three suberized branches per tree immediately removed the bark and stored in 50 ml vials sealed with parafilm m to avoid evaporative fractionation we collected soil samples using soil augers within a 50 cm radius away from the truck of the individual tree the soil sampling depths followed the same depth distribution as the root biomass excavation with maximum depth reaching the soil bedrock interface approximately 1 m depth we changed the auger head after each drilling to avoid isotopic contamination from previous layers we discarded approximately 3 cm of the 0 20 cm soil sample to eliminate the possible evaporative enrichment effect of the uppermost layer because that part of the dry season overlaps with winter soil sampling was not possible during periods when the soil was frozen therefore soil sampling during the dry season was less frequent and only occurred when soil thawed during the rainy season and the transition period the sampling campaigns were carried after rainfall events soil samples of each layer were stored in 50 ml vials and sealed with parafilm m xylem and soil samples were stored in a portable fridge and transported to the laboratory in the laboratory the samples were stored at 4 until isotopic analysis we collected precipitation near the meteorological station we used ball in funnel type collectors prechsl et al 2014 to minimize evaporative fractionation precipitation samples were collected after each rainfall event we also collected grab samples of a nearby natural spring 600 m distance from trees the spring water seeps out of the ground and water flows throughout all seasons we transferred water precipitation and spring samples to polyethylene vials sealed with parafilm m and transported back to the lab samples were refrigerated until analysis sampling campaigns were carried between morning and midday for all sampling materials isotopic offset between xylem and soil precipitation water source has been reported barbeta et al 2020 barbeta et al 2019 recent study cautioned that isotopic information of xylem water extracted through the cryogenic method might affect xylem water and thus yield an isotopic offset chen et al 2020 however it has also been shown that cryogenic vacuum extraction can reveal reliable isotope results k√ºhnhammer et al 2021 newberry et al 2017 moreover the integration of oxygen isotope signals in the bayesian inference framework can improve the source water attribution evaristo et al 2017 therefore the xylem and soil water was extracted using cryogenic vacuum distillation koeniger et al 2011 the isotopic compositions of all water samples were measured with a liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 lgr inc usa at the laboratory both Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values can be measured simultaneously with this instrument isotope ratios are expressed as 1 Œ¥ 2 h o r Œ¥ 18 o r sample r s tan d a r d 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard indicate the isotope ratio of the samples were calculated relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the measurement accuracies of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o were 0 83 and 0 36 respectively plants are abundant in organic matter which can lead to spectral contamination if such compounds are co extracted during cryogenic vacuum distillation mart√≠n g√≥mez et al 2015 among the diverse range of organic compounds methanol is shown to lead to larger discrepancies on isotopic measurements using laser spectrometry leen et al 2012 schultz et al 2011 spectrally contaminated samples were identified using the software provided by lgr lwia spectral contamination identifier v1 0 lwia sci and then post corrected following method developed by schultz et al 2011 and leen et al 2012 and shown to be applicable to tree water isotopic measurements barbeta et al 2019 mart√≠n g√≥mez et al 2015 specific contamination curve was individually fitted for the specific analyzer see supplementary information 2 5 transpiration sap flow was monitored as a proxy of the transpiration of ten individual trees ten individuals of different dbh sizes were selected from each species table s1 thermal dissipation probes tdp dynamax inc houston tx usa were inserted following protocols chen et al 2011 the 30 min average was recorded in cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan ut usa the sap flux density js g cm 2 s 1 was calculated as follows 4 j s 0 0119 d tm d t d t 1 231 where dtm and dt are the maximum temperature difference and the temperature difference at time t between the two probes transpiration ec mm d 1 was then calculated as follows 5 e c 3600 i 0 24 j s a s a c where as is the sapwood area cm2 and ac is the canopy area m2 of the tree 3600 is the coefficient for conversion from seconds to hour as was determined through tree cores two cores were drilled along the north south and the east west of one sample trees cores were not taken from the sampled trees for tdp observation to avoid the possible influence from the wound with the measurements of tree cores as calculated as follows 6 a s œÄ r d r h 2 where rd is the de barked diameter i e dbh minus bark thickness rh means the diameter of the heartwood which was derived by subtracting sapwood depth from rd the sapwood depth was determined by the color discrimination between sapwood and heartwood of the increment cores empirical relationships between dbh and as were established as as 0 852dbh2 0979 r2 0 99 p 0 01 and as 0 785dbh2 0782 r2 0 99 p 0 01 for p orientalis and q variabilis respectively the as of un cored trees were derived from these empirical relationships 2 6 tree water source partitioning and statistical analysis we used the mixsiar bayesian mixing model stock et al 2018 to determine the contribution of potential water sources the sampling dates were tested independently for their respective water source therefore for each date the xylem water was entered as the mixture information the isotopic signatures of each potential water source were entered in the model as follows soil water isotope data from 1 3 40 cm 2 40 80 cm and 3 80 cm on the day of xylem sampling campaign the 3 40 cm layer represents the upper layers where roots are abundant and is more affected by evaporation layers below 80 cm represents the deep layers at the soil bedrock interface where the soil starts to be replaced by rocks and larger fractures might exist in between these the 40 80 cm represents the middle soil layer line conditioned excess offset from the local meteoric water line lmwl Œ¥2h 6 37Œ¥18o 6 61 can reflect the evaporative loss of different water source comparing to local precipitation henceforth lc excess was used to assess the offset of different water pools from the lwml the line conditioned excess was calculated following landwehr and coplen 2006 lc excess Œ¥ 2 h a Œ¥ 18 o b where a and b are the slope and intercept of the lmwl respectively negative lc excess values indicate isotopic enrichment due to evaporation in analogy to lc excess we also used sw excess as suggested by barbeta et al 2019 to investigate the offset between xylem soil in relation to the soil the soil water line excess is then defined as sw excess Œ¥ 2 h a s Œ¥ 18 o b s where as and bs are the slope and intercept of the soil water line respectively negative sw excess indicated the xylem data plot below the soil water line of the corresponding soil water isotopes sampled on the same day since we used cryogenic vacuum distillation to extract soil water sw excess represents the distance of xylem water to bulk soil water which is composed mainly of tightly bound and more mobile water one way anova was employed to test significant differences of samples that qualified the homogeneity of variance tests due to the sample size disparities of different seasons the kruskal wallis k w test was used to detect significant differences of values among different seasons we conducted partial correlation analysis to determine the importance of tree morphological traits on tree water source partitioning the environmental variables served as the covariate variables in the partial correlation analysis including soil volumetric water content vwc vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa and solar radiation r mj m 2 statistical analyses were conducted using r software version 3 6 2 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions solar radiation in 2017 84 19 2 43 s e s e stands for standard error w m 2 was significantly lower than in 2015 130 97 4 07 s e w m 2 and 2016 75 83 5 07 s e w m 2 p 0 05 one way anova there was no significant difference among the three years p 0 05 one way anova precipitation was 580 mm 649 mm and 309 3 mm in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively soil water content demonstrated strong seasonality this was consistent with the rainfall inputs in different seasons soil moisture increased close to saturation during the rainy season this was especially the case for the surface layers moreover the differences in soil moisture of different layers were small during the rainy season fig 1 3 2 isotopic compositions of the soil water we observed large variability in the isotopic composition of soil and precipitation throughout the different seasons fig 2 fig s2 precipitation Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o followed a progressive depletion as the rainy season began and became more enriched by the end of this period fig 2a the soil water was isotopically distinct from precipitation during the study period p 0 05 one way anova however soil water isotopic composition still reflected the temporal trend of precipitation isotopic signature fig 2b g soil water isotopic composition was significantly more depleted in 2h and 18o in the rainy season than in the dry and transition season p 0 05 for both Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o respectively k w test therefore the soil water Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o profile across the observation depth in the rainy season was different from that in the dry and transition season fig 2c v s 2b d fig 2f v s 2e 2g during the dry and transition season the surface 3 40 cm soil water was more enriched in 2h and 18o than the deep layers indicating evaporative fractionation at the surface during this season bulk soil water isotopic composition followed a consistent pattern of increasing depletion with depth the latter was the opposite from what was observed in the soil water profile during the rainy season in all seasons the surface 0 20 cm soil water was significantly different from the deeper layers with few exceptions the one way anova analysis detected significant differences among soil layers table 1 indicating isotopic heterogeneity along with the soil profile 3 3 discrimination of water sources and tree water uptake patterns we observed distinct xylem water isotopic composition across the different species fig 3 the isotopic signature of p orientalis spread along soil water isotopic composition distribution on dual isotope space this species also showed different xylem isotopic composition between the different seasons p 0 05 for xylem Œ¥2h k w test p orientalis xylem water isotopic composition plotted closer or overlapped with the spring water isotopic composition and the lwml during the transition and rainy season fig 3a c the xylem water of this species was significantly more depleted in 2h and 18o during the rainy in relation to other seasons p 0 01 k w test by contrast q variabilis maintained a relatively stable xylem isotopic composition without significant differences across different seasons p 0 05 k w test visual observation of the xylem water samples in the dual isotope space indicated that some xylem samples from q variabilis also fell outside of the observed distribution of soil water isotopic composition fig 3d f and showed to be slightly more fractionated isotopic composition than soil water fig 4 and s5 shows the mixing model analysis for p orientalis and q variabilis during the three seasons p orientalis demonstrated a significant variation in water uptake patterns from different layers depending on seasonality fig 4 a s5a while q variabilis maintained a relative equal partitioning of water uptake among the different layers irrespective of seasonality fig 4b s5b dual isotope observations indicate that p orientalis isotopic composition was more similar to shallow soil layers fig s2 s3 during the rainy and transition season the soil water of the layer at 3 40 cm accounted for 41 49 and 27 86 of the xylem water of this species in the rainy season and transition period respectively fig 4a p orientalis relied on soil water below 40 cm reducing shallow soil water uptake during the dry season the shift of water source from dry season to rainy season was observed as surface water contribution significantly increased from 26 01 to 41 49 by contrast water uptake by q variabilis from the surface and deep layers remained around 30 33 in all three seasons respectively 3 4 ecohydrological separation and connectivity between trees and groundwater we evaluated the isotopic offset between xylem and soil water using the sw excess per sampling campaign fig 5 overall the sw excess of q variabilis sw excess 7 96 7 28 mean sd was lower than p orientalis 1 60 6 30 fig 5a the deviation of q variabilis from sw excess of 0 occurred independent of rainy seasons or soil moisture conditions larger differences from a zero sw excess for both species were observed during the dry season between 2016 and 2017 p orientalis showed positive sw excess during some occasions throughout the transition and rainy season this indicates that bulk soil water was more depleted in heavy isotopes than xylem water the isotopic composition of spring water showed small deviation from that of the precipitation and spring lc excess was close to 0 i e plot close or on the lmwl fig 5 soil water and xylem lc excess from p orientalis and q variabilis were negative during the dry season indicating an offset from the lwml however p orientalis showed lc excess values close to 0 during sampling periods within the transition and rainy season of 2015 2016 and the rainy season of 2017 on days where p orientalis lc excess was close to zero we observed no significant difference between the xylem water of p orientalis and that of the spring water this was observed during 21 may 2 june 2015 p 0 05 k w test 6 jun 2015 p 0 05 k w test 11 oct in 2016 p 0 05 k w test 4 8 nov in 2016 p 0 05 k w test and 20 28 aug in 2017 p 0 05 k w test the same was not observed for q variabilis which showed a constant negative lc excess throughout the transition and wet seasons q variabilis lc excess was more negative than p orientalis and soil water excess throughout the three years 3 5 tree morphological traits and source water partitioning q variabilis and p orientalis exhibited contrasting root biomass distributions along with the soil profile fig 6 p orientalis showed well developed shallow lateral roots and deep penetrating taproots this is species also showed small variability in root biomass of different diameter classes within soil layers p orientalis showed an overall decline in root biomass with increasing soil depth fig 6a specifically the fine roots biomass was significantly higher at 0 20 cm depth than in deeper layers p 0 05 one way anova by contrast q variabilis demonstrated a relatively even distribution of root biomass along with the soil profile except for the large roots d 5 mm at the depth of 20 40 cm also large roots d 5 mm of this species were present in all layers and in larger proportions than roots of same diameter for p orientalis q variabilis fine roots were mainly found above 60 cm and in lower proportions than fine roots of p orientalis fig 6 table 2 shows a constant positive correlation between root biomass and source of water uptake across different soil layers however the relationship between vob and different soil layers depended on the species and seasonality 4 discussion we know that transpiration is a dominant flux on land surface schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wei et al 2017 and that there are evidence of the connectivity between transpiration and streamflow during the wet season in more humid environments herv√© fern√°ndez et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 geris et al 2015 however our knowledge is incomplete regarding the connectivity between source of transpiration and nearby spring in drier environments specially across trees with distinct growing forms an evergreen and a deciduous species our high temporal resolution tree water source investigation in a temperate forest in china showed a distinct tree water use pattern between the two coexisting species and seasonal connectivity between trees and nearby spring original sample size nprecip 142 nspring 51 nsoil 1420 nxylem 5130 n stands for sample size to our knowledge we are the first to investigate ecohydrological separation in high temporal resolution in a temperate mountainous forest and systematically trace tree water source throughout a three year period 4 1 root morphology and water source partitioning our high temporal resolution tree water source investigation showed a distinct tree water use pattern between coexisting p orientalis and q variabilis tree species we observed differences in the proportional contributions of water across soil layers throughout the different seasons between the two species while q variabilis showed a more constant source water partitioning and equal contribution from different layers independent of the season p orientalis showed changes in source water partition with changes in seasonality our data suggest an increase in shallow soil water uptake during the rainy season by p orientalis previous studies observed distinct patterns in water use by coexisting plants dai et al 2015 del castillo et al 2016 wang et al 2020 and suggested that different strategies in source water uptake is a primary mechanism for plant coexistence schenk 2008 silvertown et al 2015 thus observed patterns in tree water use brings ecological understanding about hydrological niche segregation and coexistence of individual species de deurwaerder et al 2018 rooting depth and biomass are essential for trees to acquire water and nutrient and may help to explain distinct tree water use patterns among the different species we showed that p orientalis had more developed fine root system in the surface layers than the co occurring species q variabilis fine roots are important for soil water uptake and this may have resulted in the observed larger water uptake from the upper soil profile with increase water availability in the rainy season from p orientalis the maximized fine roots in shallow layers characterizes species with fast resource acquisition strategy which are more opportunistic regarding water use moreno guti√©rrez et al 2012 by contrast we observed a more developed deep root system in q variabilis with larger biomass of coarser roots than p orientalis the root biomass of q variabilis was also relatively evenly distributed across the soil profile the higher proportion of coarse root biomass and well distributed across the soil profile characterized species with a more conservative root water acquisition strategy fort et al 2017 moreno guti√©rrez et al 2012 thus such root system may have enabled a steady access to water without any significant shifts in water uptake patterns across different seasons which may explain our observations additionally q variabilis could have developed roots into the fractured bedrock and accessed rock moisture during the dry season this is has been observed for other quercus species hahm et al 2020 rempe and dietrich 2018 the more stable source water apportionment may have been also a result of a combination of hydraulic traits that allowed q variabilis to maintain stable water status which may not have been the case for p orientalis the support of a stable water source observed in q variabilis is also indicated by a steadier transpiration rates when compared to p orientalis throughout seasons fig s4 we hypothesize that such changes in water uptake patterns observed through high temporal sampling resolution may have been a result of changes in water status in p orientalis and resulted in observed shifts with changes in soil wetness conditions this has been previously observed in controlled conditions and proposed as the mechanism to explain source water apportionment nehemy et al 2021 4 2 seasonal ecohydrological separation early work by brooks et al 2010 proposed the ecohydrological separation hypothesis by showing that trees use soil water that is more tightly bound and is isotopically distinct from the more mobile water that infiltrates the soil and travels through preferential flow paths and later contributes to streams while a more mechanistic understanding is yet necessary to explain observed ecohydrological separation sprenger allen 2020 this has been a useful hypothesis to understand patterns of tree water use across different study sites and seasons previous tree water use investigation by herv√© fern√°ndez et al 2016 in a rainy temperate forest in chile and by zhao et al 2018 in a hillslope in a subtropical monsoon climate in china supported the ecohydrological separation hypothesis during the dry season however they indicated a hydrological connectivity between trees and streams during the wet season according to them this could be explained by larger antecedent precipitation amounts before sampling period the previous studies were conducted in climates with relatively large precipitation inputs during the wet season and until now we lacked seasonal understanding between trees and underground streams in more arid climates overall xylem water from q variabilis was consistently distinct from spring water and showed a negative lc excess while this was also mostly the case for p orientallis there were specific sampling periods where this species xylem isotopic was not distinct from spring water and showed a lc excess close to zero although we did not find any direct connection between these events and precipitation amounts the overlap between xylem water and lmwl occurred during the transition and wet season thus our data suggests an ephemeral ecohydrological connectivity between p orientallis s source water and spring sources at our sites fig 5 p orientallis with higher proportion of fine roots at the shallow layers may have enable this species to acquire recent precipitation inputs and subsurface flow moving through the subsurface towards the spring during the rainy season by comparison the fine roots of q variabilis at surface layer accounts for small portion of total biomass and across the whole soil profile it only accounts for 10 which decrease the ability of this species to absorb water from surface layers although we were unable to obtain the root distribution within the fractured bedrock it is possible that q variabilis developed deeper root system into the rock fractures therefore the hydrogeological and morphological conditions may lay the foundation for the observed difference in ecohydrological separation between species 5 methodological limitations the xylem water isotopic composition of p orientalis overlapped with available soil water sources across all three years of observation however dual isotope assessment of q variabilis and sw excess indicates that xylem water was more depleted in 2h than bulk soil water sources previous work has shown that xylem water isotopic composition can be more depleted than soil water signatures and this offset has been observed in particular for Œ¥2h barbeta et al 2019 tetzlaff et al 2021 however the mechanisms that explain this offset are still unknown several studies have discussed possible mechanisms that could affect xylem water isotopic signatures and result in an offset between xylem and soil water sources this includes the role of mycorrhiza fungi during root water uptake poca et al 2019 the mixing of internal water sources zhao et al 2016 nehemy et al 2022 the influence of plant water status barbeta et al 2020 possible fractionation caused by cryogenic extraction of xylem water chen et al 2020 the extraction of bulk xylem water rather than sap water barbeta et al 2022 or results influenced by more depleted rock moisture hahm et al 2020 rempe and dietrich 2018 oshun et al 2016 regardless of the relative magnitude of this offset between xylem and soil water the steady assessment of water sources by q variabilis is still supported by the analysis during the three year observed period in contrast p orientalis xylem water was not observed to be more depleted in 2h than soil water as xylem plotted along soil water distribution on dual isotope space fig 3 thus possible mechanisms that result in more negative Œ¥2h values may affect only or more strongly q variabilis tree water source investigations rely on the adequate sampling of all available sources to root water uptake we may have failed to characterize all sources for q variabilis since this species showed some xylem water isotopic composition that plotted outside of soil water distribution because we sampled until we met the soil bedrock interface we hypothesize that q variabilis could have deeper roots that access water into the bedrock not sampled in our study site the latter could more likely explain the offset between xylem and soil water for this species which was also more evident during the dry and transition season the use of rock moisture as discussed above has been previously reported in the literature as an important water source to sustain transpiration of other oak species hahm et al 2020 rempe and dietrich 2018 and forests in general during drier periods mccormick et al 2021 the water extracted from rocks is usually more depleted in 2h and 18o than soil water in previous studies hahm et al 2020 rempe and dietrich 2018 oshun et al 2016 and it could be a potential explanation to our observed offset between q variabilis and soil the use of rock moisture by q variabilis may also support the steady water source across different seasons as this deeper resource may be more reliable than water storage within the thin soil layer further research is needed to confirm this assumption by sampling rock moisture at the research site to reduce uncertainties regarding xylem water isotopic composition and to disentangle possible causes of the offset between xylem and soil water one might consider using continuous in situ methods to measure xylem water and bypass uncertainties related to extraction approaches marshall et al 2020 volkmann et al 2016 or record sample water content when using cryogenic extraction systems to understand potential effects of this method chen et al 2020 since in situ monitoring is not suitable in remote areas accessing tree water isotopic heterogeneity by sampling phloem water nehemy et al 2022 or sampling sap water directly instead of bulk xylem water barbeta et al 2022 might also help to understand potential offsets in xylem isotopic values additionally tree hydraulic monitoring might improve source water interpretations by not relying on stable isotopes alone nehemy et al 2021 dubbert et al 2019 6 conclusion our observations highlight distinct tree water use patterns across species growing in a temperate forest environment in china during a long term observation period from an ecological perspective our results show that co occurring species in this karst environment explore different water sources we also show that combining morphological traits with tracers can improve understanding of patterns in tree water use the shallow rooted p orientalis increases shallow soil water uptake during the rainy season while the more deep rooted q variabilis draws water evenly from different soil layers independent of seasonality these findings were consistent throughout the three year observation period and provided an understanding of how the studied ecosystem functions throughout the different seasons by understanding how the current ecosystem functions we can better evaluate how future climate warming may impact patterns in tree water use and potential shifts in species composition our data suggested an ephemeral ecohydrological connectivity between p orientalis and groundwater during the wet and transition period but an ecohydrological separation for q variabilis irrespective of the precipitation seasonality these observations were consistent across the three monitored years and seems to be a characteristic of the investigated ecosystem the ephemeral occurrence of ecohydrological connectivity underlines the necessity to cover multiple seasons to improve understanding of the connectivity between transpiration and groundwater and its impact on water availability investigating tree water sources continuously throughout different years provides important means to understanding tree water source partitioning and our ability to conceptualize how forests explore subsurface water storage credit authorship contribution statement guodong jia conceptualization methodology data curation

3334,in permafrost regions temperature and precipitation play decisive roles in hydrological processes soil freeze thaw cycles in the active layer cause the runoff generation process to show multiple mechanisms and seasonal alternating patterns in this study based on the precipitation runoff modeling system implemented in the java modeling framework object modeling system prms oms we developed a runoff generation model with temperature induced variable source area tvsa for permafrost regions by introducing an active layer parameterization scheme an active layer freeze thaw module a glacier

below 0 c for at least two consecutive years biskaborn et al 2019 in permafrost regions the hydrological effect of the active layer the seasonally thawed soil layer above the permafrost has the greatest impact on the runoff process is primarily reflected in the following aspects the influence of the freeze thaw processes of the active layer on surface runoff the phase transition and migration of water in the active layer during freezing and thawing and the interaction between supra permafrost groundwater and permafrost in the active layer ding et al 2020 for example the low permeability and storage capacity of frozen ground is conducive to surface runoff generation soil moisture driven by the soil temperature gradient tends to accumulate in the impermeable layer formed by frozen ground causing saturation and generating interflow or groundwater flow the soil moisture distribution and the position of supra permafrost groundwater are controlled by the position of the freeze thaw front which eventually determines the generation and composition of runoff in permafrost regions wang et al 2017 runoff connectivity interflow and suprapermafrost groundwater flow in the active layer and their discharge to surface waters are substantially controlled by variations in the freeze thaw processes of the active layer wang et al 2017 one quarter of the northern hemisphere land surface is underlain by permafrost biskaborn et al 2019 which is primarily distributed in high altitude or high latitude areas such as the arctic and the qinghai tibet plateau qtp these areas have experienced the most significant warming in the past few decades biskaborn et al 2019 permafrost degradation with climate change has serious consequences for ecosystems hydrological systems and infrastructure integrity wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b for hydrological systems studies show that permafrost degradation increases base flow and decreases surface runoff due to increased soil infiltration capacity and water storage capacity shi et al 2020 wang et al 2018b yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 other studies produce opposite conclusions ji et al 2020 lyon et al 2009 global differences in the response of surface hydrological processes to climate change may be caused by differences between permafrost environments and ecosystems gao et al 2018 the source regions of large rivers e g the three river source region are mostly distributed in permafrost regions thus studying and assessing the hydrological impact of permafrost degradation is helpful for the development and management of downstream water resources therefore it is of great importance to study the interactions and changes in permafrost and runoff process with climate warming the traditional hydrological models such as xinanjiang model zhao 1984 swat arnold et al 1995 hbv model krysanova et al 1999 and topmodel kirkby and beven 1979 focus on soil moisture conditions and approximate the precipitation runoff relationship through the storage capacity curve and or infiltration curve without considering the effect of changes in soil thermal conditions on infiltration water migration and surface runoff process in the soil freeze thaw process the representative soil vegetation atmosphere transfer system svats models such as shaw flerchinger and saxton 1989 and coupmodel jansson and moon 2001 fully consider the water phase change and the accompanying water heat coupling physical process including the transmission and exchange of water and heat through plant cover snow and soil these svats models can accurately simulate the dynamic change of soil moisture and temperature water migration and evapotranspiration in the soil freezing and thawing process but it is limited to the point scale simulation and doesn t perform flow routing researchers have tried to improve the traditional hydrological model to adapt to the runoff characteristics in cold regions guan and duan 2003 assumed that frozen soil formation is a function of accumulated negative temperature and improved the calculation of water storage capacity in xinanjiang model li et al 2021 introduced the conceptual model of frozen soil hydraulic conductivity changing exponentially with the temperature in the freeze thaw process into the gbhm model yang et al 1998 to simulate the impact of soil freeze thaw cycle on water transport but the improved model doesn t consider the temporal change of thawing freezing depth of active layer most of these improved hydrological models consider the influence of frozen soil on hydrological process by empirical formula and the hydrothermal coupling process and its influence are not considered comprehensively which has certain limitations in promotion in the past few decades physical process based cold regions hydrological models e g the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1996 the water balance simulation wasim model liljedahl 2011 the water and energy

have been developed to evaluate the various hydrological impacts of permafrost degradation physical processes of these models are relatively complete however the high data input requirements e g soil vegetation and meteorological data complex parameterization scheme that leads to simulation uncertainty gao et al 2018 and slow calculation speed limit application in addition the harsh climate and environmental conditions make conducting field observations in permafrost regions difficult which further increases the difficulty of local parameterization the precipitation runoff modeling system prms leavesley et al 1983 implemented in the java modeling framework object modeling system oms david et al 2010 prms oms is a deterministic distributed parameter physical process hydrologic model used to simulate and evaluate the watershed response of various combinations of climate and land use avanzi et al 2020 ragettli et al 2017 the response to normal and extreme rainfall and snowmelt can be simulated to evaluate changes in water balance relations streamflow regimes soil moisture relations and groundwater recharge soil freeze thaw cycles which throughout the runoff process such as infiltration evaporation and water migration is the central link of hydrological cycle in cold regions chen et al 2006 the active layer determines the conditions for plant growth gas fluxes groundwater flow regimes and soil formation permafrost beneath the active layer limits the amount of soil water percolation and subsurface storage of water bui et al 2020 hydrological models are a fundamental tool for quantitatively investigating and projecting hydrological processes and the model schemes for snow ice melt glacier response and soil freezing and thawing should be involved in simulating the hydrological conditions over the permafrost regions zhao et al 2019 the original prms oms model does not consider the freeze thaw dynamics of soil and cannot be used to simulate the influence of soil thermal moisture conditions on hydrological processes in permafrost regions therefore in this study considered the complete physical process description of prms oms and the convenience of module modeling we developed a temperature induced variable source area runoff generation model for permafrost regions by introducing an active layer parameterization scheme an active layer freeze thaw module a new infiltration module that considers the interaction between surface water and groundwater supra permafrost groundwater a glacier module and the sub permafrost groundwater module to better represent the hydrological processes in the permafrost regions the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces runoff generation mechanisms in permafrost regions section 3 introduces prms oms improvements according to the runoff generation mechanisms in permafrost regions section 4 introduces the study region data collection pre processing and model evaluation section 5 introduces the uncertainties in the simulations model comparison and analyzed the effect of permafrost degradation on the runoff section 6 presents the conclusions 2 runoff generation mechanisms in permafrost regions the runoff generation mechanisms in permafrost regions are similar to those in non permafrost regions and primarily composed of infiltration excess horton runoff saturation excess dunne runoff interflow runoff and groundwater flow runoff however in permafrost regions changes in the runoff generation process are not only determined by precipitation and soil moisture conditions but also by temperature variations wang et al 2017 the runoff generation process shows obvious multiple mechanisms and alternating seasonal patterns due to the influence of soil freeze thaw cycles in the active layer wang and zhang 2016 the runoff processes in permafrost regions are divided into four stages according to the dynamic characteristics of thermal moisture regimes in the active layer the initial thaw stage the complete thawed stage the initial freeze stage and the complete frozen stage fig 1 in the initial thaw stage during the early vegetation growing season the surface of the active layer begins to thaw as the temperature increases and receives snow melt water large amount and precipitation supply and the vegetation transpiration in this stage is also very limited under the combined effect of the above mentioned factors the surface of the active layer is easily saturated forming saturation excess runoff rd on the ground surface the composition of runoff components during this period is as follows 1 r r d where r is the total runoff m as the thaw depth increases interflow appears above the thaw front at this stage the runoff process is dominated by a mixture of saturation excess rd and interflow ri runoff primarily preferential flow rp 2 r r d r i in the completely thawed stage and the vegetation growing season evapotranspiration gradually increases and most rainfall events occur at this stage the surface runoff process is dominated by infiltration excess runoff rh subsurface runoff primarily occurs in the form of interflow and or groundwater flow rg 3 r r h r i r g in permafrost regions the freeze process is two directional downward from the surface and upward from the bottom of the active layer the downward freeze process from the ground surface controls surface runoff generation and supra permafrost groundwater recharge whereas the upward freeze process from bottom of the active layer greatly affects supra permafrost groundwater discharge this stage features a short period of excess runoff infiltration although groundwater discharge sharply decreases the runoff is primarily sourced from groundwater li et al 2020 wang et al 2017 4 r r d r g in the completely frozen stage there may be a small amount of short term or temporary saturation excess runoff formed by snow melting and rivers can stop flowing in supra permafrost dominated regions in addition the ground temperature in the lower altitude areas of the basin rises earlier than that in the higher altitude areas and the temperature of the sunny slope rises faster than that of the shady slope which forms the development process of saturation excess runoff from lower altitude to higher altitude areas and from sunny slope to shady slope on the one hand the difference in temperature between low and high altitudes and shady and sunny slopes affects the freeze thaw process of the active layer which results in a difference in runoff generation time and area on the other hand the freeze thaw dynamics of the active layer affected the composition of runoff components this pattern of runoff generation time and area change caused by regional temperature difference and the aforementioned transformation of runoff generation mechanism in different freeze thaw stages due to the change of temperature constitute the basic forms of runoff in permafrost regions these two aspects are defined as variable source runoff in the permafrost region and include runoff area source and mode 3 the tvsa model leavesley et al 1983 and markstrom et al 2015 presented the land atmosphere interactions flow routing process and original runoff generation formulated by prms however the original prms oms did not consider the soil freeze thaw processes and glacier runoff process which were crucial for the runoff process of permafrost regions here based on the prms oms we introduce the active layer freeze thaw processes module aft parameterization scheme of the active layer new infiltration module sub permafrost groundwater module and glacier module according to permafrost runoff generation mechanisms to better represent the hydrological processes in the permafrost regions fig 2 specifically parameterization scheme of the active layer was developed to better depict the influence of freeze thaw process on soil infiltration water migration and runoff generation process within active layer in permafrost regions the aft module can accurately simulate the change of freezing and thawing depth in the active layer only through the input air temperature and solar radiation combined with the parameterization scheme of the active layer the runoff generation thickness and hydraulic conductivity are determined for the calculation of the runoff generation process the new infiltration module uses the garto infiltration algorithm developed by lai et al 2015 this algorithm considers the interaction between surface water and groundwater in describing the movement and redistribution of soil moisture in the infiltration process and improves the computational efficiency compared with the original infiltration scheme of prms oms model the degree day factor method was selected to calculate glacier runoff because of its low data requirement and outstanding simulation performance in addition we established an empirical model between sub permafrost groundwater and precipitation and air temperature to simulate and predict changes in deep groundwater in permafrost basins under future climate change scenarios the following is a detailed introduction to each improved or newly developed module for tvsa model compared with original prms oms model 3 1 active layer freeze thaw processes the thermal moisture conditions of the active layer directly affect the ecological environment hydrological processes and stability of permafrost in cold regions bibi et al 2018 however permafrost mostly develops in high altitude or high latitude regions with harsh climate environments that lead to a lack of surface temperature and soil moisture observation data and limit simulation of freeze thaw processes in the active layer based on the improved high resolution empirical surface energy balance hres seb model zaksek and schroedter homscheidt 2009 the s curve model see below for details and the two directional stefan algorithm woo et al 2004 we developed an active layer freeze thaw module that accurately simulates the freeze thaw process defined as changes in the 0 c isotherm in the active layer using air temperature solar radiation and land surface characteristics input data that included the dem digital elevation model vegetation cover the monthly normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and surface albedo fig 3 the improved hres seb model which considers the effects of vegetation and relief characteristics on the surface energy balance was selected to determine the surface temperature 5 lst b 1 b 2 √¢ t p b

calculated surface freeze thaw index and the soil water content woo et al 2004 presented the detailed formulation and parameterization scheme of the two directional stefan algorithm text s1 we use tvsa coupmodel and shaw models to simulate the freezing and thawing process of 2 borehole in fenghuoshan watershed fig s2 a in the thawing stage the thawing depth of the three models is all greater than the measured and the simulation performance of tvsa model in deep soil layer is significantly better than the other two models both shaw model and coupmodel obviously overestimate the maximum thawing depth in the freezing stage the simulation performance of shaw model is significantly better than that of coupmodel and the tvsa model and the tvsa model overestimates the downward freezing rate in summary the simulation performance of tvsa model r 2 0 92 rmse 0 28 m is slightly inferior to that of shaw r 2 0 90 rmse 0 13 m but better than that of coupmodel r 2 0 98 rmse 0 37 m the tvsa model is comparable to coupled hydrothermal models to simulate the freeze thaw dynamics of active layer and even better 3 2 parameterization scheme of the active layer different from the non frozen soil regions the seasonal freeze thaw processes of the active layer in permafrost regions significantly affect the soil infiltration water migration and runoff generation process within the active layer therefore it is necessary to parameterize the soil in permafrost basin to adapt to the effect of freeze thaw processes previous studies have reported a critical depth for the influence of the active layer on the runoff process and the freeze thaw regimes of soil above the critical depth significantly affect the runoff generation process wang et al 2017 here we defined this critical depth as the maximum runoff generation depth of the active layer mrda for soil depths less than the mrda the runoff generation process of the active layer is affected by the freeze thaw cycles for soil depths greater than or equal to the mrda the runoff generation process of the active layer is no longer affected by the freeze thaw cycles the change in runoff generation thickness with the freeze or thaw depth is as follows 11 h hru t Œæ t h r u t Œæ t h r u t Œ≥ hru Œ≥ hru Œæ t h r u t Œ≥ hru Œ≥ hru Œæ f d h r u t alt hru Œ≥ hru Œæ f u h r u t 2 Œ≥ hru alt hru Œæ f u h r u t Œæ f d h r u t alt

frozen fig 4 3 3 sub permafrost groundwater several studies report that permafrost in valley areas easily develops into seasonally frozen ground or open taliks and then establishing the hydraulic connection between supra permafrost and sub permafrost aquifers and between surface waters and the sub permafrost groundwater and ensuring the continuous flow of rivers throughout the year shrestha et al 2021 walvoord et al 2012 the quantitative analysis of the linkage among surface water supra permafrost sub permafrost and groundwater is challenging due to the complicated interactions of regional

detailed numerical models walvoord et al 2012 statistical methods such as the separation of hydrographs baseflow recession analyses and flow duration curves are widely used to analyze changes in groundwater storage evans et al 2020 lin et al 2020 interaction between surface water groundwater and runoff components song et al 2021 wang et al 2021 in permafrost regions song et al 2021 suggested that the q90 streamflow at exceedance probabilities of 90 reflects steady deep groundwater sub permafrost groundwater for permafrost rivers is more sensitive to warming than variations in precipitation and shows a higher positive correlation with mean annual air temperature than other percentile flows in the tvsa model q90 was selected to approximately represent recharge from sub

interaction between surface water and groundwater in addition garto discretizes the soil moisture into continuous bins with constant water content which greatly reduces the error caused by the discontinuous wetting front and improves model accuracy fig 5 shows the unsaturated soil moisture profiles in the garto model with three surface wetting fronts and four groundwater fronts lai et al

areas of the world are shrinking and showing an accelerating trend resulting in significant changes in hydrological processes in many watersheds especially for alpine mountains e g permafrost regions zhao et al 2019 under climate warming the increase of temperature will accelerate the rate of snow glacier melt in spring resulting in faster earlier and larger spring runoff and accelerate the water cycle in alpine mountainous areas shen et al 2013 thus affecting water supply food security and hydropower energy production in the middle and lower reaches immerzeel et al 2010 accurate calculation of glacier runoff is an integral part of climate change risk assessment and sustainable water resource management in glacier covered basins viviroli et al 2011 although the melting process of glaciers depends on the surface energy budget the energy balance model method involves many parameters and a complex calculation process that is difficult to popularize in remote alpine especially permafrost areas yin et al 2016 the degree day factor model is an empirical statistical relationship based on temperature and glacier ablation that is widely used in glacier runoff simulations because of its simple input data and easy acquisition and processing konz and seibert 2010 the glaciated regions in each hru can be divided into a set of elevation bands at intervals of 200 m the inverse distance

uncertain soil hydrothermal parameters a sensitivity analysis is conducted with the method outlined by lenhart et al 2002 the dependence of an output variable y on an input parameter x is determined by the normalized dimensionless sensitivity index i 20 i y 2 y 1 y 0 2 √¢ Œ¥ x x 0 where y 0 is the model output with parameter value at x 0 after calibration Œ¥ x is the percentage adjustment of the

referred to previous studies ficklin et al 2012 krogh et al 2017 lenhart et al 2002 the greater the absolute value of i the more sensitive the parameter is for model prediction mean values of these parameters over every month and the whole year are calculated 4 4 freeze thaw process simulation at the fenghuoshan watershed the purpose of this simulation was to examine the freeze thaw process simulations in the tvsa model table 1 summarizes the calibrated parameters of the aft module holes 5 10 were selected to calibrate parameters relating to freeze thaw processes and holes 1 4 distributed in different vegetation coverages of shady slopes or sunny slopes were selected for validation because only one year for 2017 of soil temperature and moisture data were available fig 7 compares the simulations and observations the model reproduced the freeze and thaw processes of the active layer well at different aspects elevations and vegetation coverage with r2 ranging from 0 89 to 0 97 average of 0 935 and rmse ranging from 0 12 to 0 36 m average of 0 225 m the simulation results for the validation site 1 4 showed that the active layer began to thaw in late april the thaw depth of the active layer peaked in the early october and the active layer began to freeze in late october except for the slight deviation in the simulation of the thaw process of hole 1 the simulated freeze and thaw depths of the other holes were well fitted with the measured data in addition according to zhao et al 2010 the active layer thickness of the fenghuoshan site 34 73 n 92 90 e will reach 2 25 m in 2017 which is not far from our simulation result 2 02 m therefore we reasonably believe that the model can effectively capture freeze thaw dynamics in the active layer 4 5 calibration and validation of the discharge at fenghuoshan watershed the average freeze thaw depth of all grid points in each hru was used to calculate the runoff generation process the 2017 stream data were used to calibrate parameters related to the runoff generation and flow routing processes and the validation period was 2018 2019 table 2 summarizes the calibrated runoff process parameters fig 8 illustrates the daily observed and simulated stream flows from 2017 to 2019 during the calibration period the results with high accuracies were obtained with an nse value of 0 99 and an r2 value of 0 99 results with acceptable accuracies were obtained with an nse value of 0 91 and r2 value of 0 94 during the validation period although the magnitude of the annual peak flow was slightly overestimated the peak time was accurately predicted the runoff of the fenghuoshan watershed was primarily dominated by the interflow and supra permafrost groundwater which accounted for 77 8 of annual stream flow the saturation excess and infiltration excess flow accounted for 22 2 of annual stream flow li et al 2020 reported that the supra permafrost groundwater accounts for 49 of the river water at the zhimenda station outlet of the source area of the yangtze river sryr permafrost coverage in the fhs almost 100 song et al 2020a is higher than that in the sryr thus the simulated results is reasonable in addition the model accurately reproduced the spring flood process caused by precipitation snow melt and ice thaw wang et al 2017 collectively the tvsa model can be used to simulate or predict streamflow in permafrost regions 4 6 calibration and validation of the discharge at tuotuohe catchment stream data for 1990 1999 were used to calibrate parameters related to the runoff generation and flow routing processes the validation period was 2000 2018 may to october table 2 summarizes the calibrated parameters for the runoff processes fig 9 illustrates the monthly observed and simulated stream flows from 1990 to 2018 unlike the fhs watershed the tth catchment contains perennial snow and glaciers additionally the year round stream flow in the catchment may be related to the recharge of sub permafrost groundwater through taliks near the river during the calibration period the results with high accuracies were obtained with an nse value of 0 87 and an r2 value of 0 87 results with acceptable accuracies were obtained with an nse value of 0 85 and an r2 value of 0 86 during the validation period the re value of 0 4 indicated underestimated runoff and was related to the general underestimation of summer peak flow one possible reason could be the deviation between the cmfd dataset and the real meteorological data owing to the lack of soil temperature and moisture observations in the tth we directly applied the freeze thaw parameters calibrated in the fhs to the tth simulation this substitution led to deviations in the freeze thaw depth of the active layer and affected the runoff simulation however the model accurately reproduced the spring flood process caused by precipitation glacier snow melt and ice thaw collectively the tvsa model can be used to simulate or predict streamflow in permafrost regions despite data scarcity heterogeneity and complexity 5 discussions 5 1 simulation uncertainties simulations uncertainties are attributable to the different model parameters adopted forcing products and the hydrological model structure huss et al 2014 in the tvsa model the study area was divided into sub basins hrus according to dem data additionally soil physical properties e g hydraulic conductivity field capacity and porosity in different areas e g aspects and elevations in the same hrus were determined by the different soil type fraction which might inevitably lead to simulation deviations table 3 shows the normalized sensitivity index for the soil hydrothermal parameters tth simulation the sensitivity index is ranked into four classes lenhart et al 2002 i 0 05 small to negligible sensitivity 0 05 i 0 20 medium sensitivity 0 20 i 1 00 high sensitivity and i 1 00 indicates extremely high sensitivity on the annual scale the field capacity was medium sensitivity i 0 05 to runoff simulation and the sensitivity of other parameters to runoff simulation is small to negligible however the influence of soil hydrothermal parameters on runoff simulation shows seasonal variation characteristics at this time these parameters significantly affect the runoff process in different seasons and cannot be neglected for example the soil thermal conductivity is high or even extremely high sensitive to the runoff process in the early stage of thawing april to may and the late stage of freezing november to december the initial freezing time and thawing time is delayed and advanced with the increase of thermal conductivity respectively which inevitable affect the runoff generation process the change of bulk density and porosity affects the proportion distribution of soil particles air and water in soil and then affects the thermal conductivity thereby affecting the freeze thaw process of the active layer and runoff process in contrast changes in saturated hydraulic conductivity have negligible effect on the runoff process in permafrost regions several previous studies suggest that the uncertainties associated with model soil parameters are much smaller than those from meteorological forcing data zhao et al 2019 the cmfd dataset used in this study was made through fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis datasets and in situ station data he et al 2020 and the cmfd is of superior quality than other forcing dataset e g global land data assimilation system gldas for china due to a larger number of stations 753 stations are used to generate the cmfd than are utilized in the gldas however there is only one weather station in an area of 17 130 km2 in the tth basin which may cause some errors in the estimation of meteorological element especially the precipitation at different altitude of the whole basin therefore we conducted a sensitivity experiment of modeling performance in the tth catchment by changing the daily precipitation by 5 10 20 30 5 10 20 and 30 when the precipitation increased by 5 30 the simulated runoff increased by 2 5 14 73 when the precipitation decreased by 5 30 the simulated runoff decreased by 2 47 14 82 indicating that the tvsa model is very sensitive to variations in precipitation especially in july to september fig 10 b because the greatest limitation for evaluating the model performance in permafrost regions is the heterogeneity and scarcity of meteorological stations a comprehensive program of meteorological element measurement and analysis is necessary for the permafrost regions and further efforts are also needed to assess the applicability of forcing products in these regions 5 2 permafrost degradation and its effect on runoff over the past few decades especially since the 1980s the eurasia artic and the qtp has experienced a more significant warming than other regions song et al 2021 under climate warming frozen ground degradation associated with an increase of air temperature ecosystem transformation and land cover changes is expected to have a profound effect on the thermal and hydrological conditions of regions covered by large areas of permafrost and seasonally frozen soil cuo et al 2015 the simulated average alt 2000 2018 in tth basin was 2 39 m which was similar to the value of 2 51 m 2000 2015 reported by ni et al 2021 and the simulate change rate of alt in this study was 0 10 m 10a 1990 2018 fig 11 a which is smaller than the average value 0 15 m 10a 1981 2010 on the qtp reported by guo and wang 2013 and the possible reason could be the spatial heterogeneity of permafrost changes on the qtp the annual runoff of tth basin also showed an increasing trend with the increase of active layer thickness especially after 2000 fig 11 b previous studies suggested that the enhancement of soil infiltration and water storage capacity caused by the increase of alt during the warm season shi et al 2020 might decrease the runoff wang et al 2018a zhao et al 2019 however the cold season discharge is expected to substantially increase due to the permafrost soil degradation and earlier soil thawing zhao et al 2019 the results of the air temperature sensitivity experiment showed that the simulated alt increased by 0 41 m and the warm season june to october runoff decreased by 3 while the cold season november to may runoff increased by as much as 25 when the air temperature increased by 1 c the runoff increased most significantly in april to may 26 and november to december 22 of the cold season fig 12 which may be related to the early thawing 15 days and delayed freezing upward 17 days downward 9 days of the active layer with the increase of air temperature with the climate gradually changing warm and wet on the qtp gao et al 2021 if the increase of precipitation cannot offset the decrease of runoff caused by the thickening of active layer then the warm season runoff will gradually decrease in the future then reduce the water supply for warm season downstream agriculture zhao et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to formulate more targeted water resources development and utilization policies based on possible changes in runoff under climate change 5 3 comparison and limitations process based hydrological models in cold regions such as vic wasim geotop crhm etc for the consideration of soil freeze thaw processes based on energy and mass conservation and heat transfer equation physical mechanism of these models is relatively complete but they also have high requirements for input data and large number of input parameters which are difficult to calibrate specifically the vic model focuses on the surface runoff process without considering the interflow while the geotop model focuses on the description of the groundwater transport especially the impact of micro topography wasim model is highly sensitive to spatial and temporal resolution and it requires intensive input data and model parameters for each grid cell of the model domain since it is a fully distributed model for crhm the model parameters are normally obtained based on the expert knowledge of the modeled catchment leading to high uncertainty of the modeling results bui et al 2020 compared with the previous models the tvsa model has the following advantages 1 the low requirements for input data meteorological forcing data only need precipitation temperature and solar radiation data and soil and vegetation data mainly include ndvi albedo land use and soil texture data which currently have a large amount of data products are available so the model is suitable for promotion in data scarcity permafrost regions 2 the two directional stefan algorithm is used to calculate the change of freeze thaw depth without solving the complex state equation for temperature distribution and soil water flux in the soil matrix which greatly improves the efficiency of the model the aft module fully considers the effect of vegetation and relief characteristics on the surface energy balance and the effect of climate conditions and soil thermal properties on soil moisture conditions ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the simulation while the tvsa model ensures model simplicity reliability and computational efficiency its runoff simulation performance in permafrost regions is comparable to or even better than that of the coupled hydrothermal model fig s2 b c 3 the sub permafrost groundwater is considered for the first time 4 modular modeling is conducive to module improvement and development however challenges that remain targets for future research include the identification of seasonal frozen ground and taliks and the development of the corresponding hydrothermal process algorithm previous studies report that taliks or seasonally frozen ground often develop near surface water bodies e g lakes rivers or faults whose hydrothermal processes are quite different from those of active layers in permafrost regions song et al 2020b in particular the exchange between the supra permafrost and sub permafrost aquifers and between surface water and sub permafrost aquifers only occur within open taliks walvoord et al 2012 however this fact is not considered in most previous studies the developed empirical sub permafrost groundwater model may be limited for predicting the impact of future climate change on runoff variations due to the complex physical processes of surface water groundwater exchange in addition under the premise of ensuring the simulation accuracy as far as possible in order to deal with the data scarcity in permafrost regions and improve the computational efficiency of the model some processes are simplified for example the calculation of surface temperature and glacier runoff are based on empirical models moreover current cold regions hydrological models most focused on 1d vertical fluxes and solving water energy balance differential equations while neglecting horizontal landscape heterogeneities and mountainous terrain both of which are important factors connecting point scale permafrost observations and basin scale hydrograph data gao et al 2021 and the effect of organic matter layer under alpine meadow on soil hydrothermal characteristics is not considered which are the future needs to be improved 6 conclusions in this study we developed a variable source area runoff generation model with permafrost parameterization by considering the freeze thaw processes of the active layer in permafrost regions the model depicted the freeze and thaw depth of soil at permafrost sites and successfully reproduced river discharge the model performance was evaluated in the fhs a typical permafrost watershed and the tth a typical permafrost glacier catchment on the qtp we first calibrated and validated the model for freeze thaw depth at the soil moisture and temperature observational sites of the fhs the tvsa model accurately reproduced the daily freeze and thaw dynamics and obtained reasonable rmse values we then calibrated and validated the model for the discharge at the outlet of the fhs and the tth the model reproduced the spring summer flood and autumn runoff recession processes well and obtained reasonable nse values we analyzed the simulations uncertainty through model parameters and forcing data and confirm the high sensitivity of the tvsa model to precipitation input the lack of reliable precipitation data creates major challenges and uncertainties in simulations and a reliable estimation of thermal conductivity and potential changes due to a changing environment is advised for future applications in addition simulation results of tth basin showed that different seasons have different responses to air temperature rise when the air temperature rose by 1 c the runoff in the cold season increased by 25 while the runoff in the warm season decreased by 3 and threaten the water supply for downstream in summary the tvsa model is a powerful tool for the system identification of variable source runoff generation processes and the associated physical mechanism under temperature control in

below 0 c for at least two consecutive years biskaborn et al 2019 in permafrost regions the hydrological effect of the active layer the seasonally thawed soil layer above the permafrost has the greatest impact on the runoff process is primarily reflected in the following aspects the influence of the freeze thaw processes of the active layer on surface runoff the phase transition and migration of water in the active layer during freezing and thawing and the interaction between supra permafrost groundwater and permafrost in the active layer ding et al 2020 for example the low permeability and storage capacity of frozen ground is conducive to surface runoff generation soil moisture driven by the soil temperature gradient tends to accumulate in the impermeable layer formed by frozen ground causing saturation and generating interflow or groundwater flow the soil moisture distribution and the position of supra permafrost groundwater are controlled by the position of the freeze thaw front which eventually determines the generation and composition of runoff in permafrost regions wang et al 2017 runoff connectivity interflow and suprapermafrost groundwater flow in the active layer and their discharge to surface waters are substantially controlled by variations in the freeze thaw processes of the active layer wang et al 2017 one quarter of the northern hemisphere land surface is underlain by permafrost biskaborn et al 2019 which is primarily distributed in high altitude or high latitude areas such as the arctic and the qinghai tibet plateau qtp these areas have experienced the most significant warming in the past few decades biskaborn et al 2019 permafrost degradation with climate change has serious consequences for ecosystems hydrological systems and infrastructure integrity wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b for hydrological systems studies show that permafrost degradation increases base flow and decreases surface runoff due to increased soil infiltration capacity and water storage capacity shi et al 2020 wang et al 2018b yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 other studies produce opposite conclusions ji et al 2020 lyon et al 2009 global differences in the response of surface hydrological processes to climate change may be caused by differences between permafrost environments and ecosystems gao et al 2018 the source regions of large rivers e g the three river source region are mostly distributed in permafrost regions thus studying and assessing the hydrological impact of permafrost degradation is helpful for the development and management of downstream water resources therefore it is of great importance to study the interactions and changes in permafrost and runoff process with climate warming the traditional hydrological models such as xinanjiang model zhao 1984 swat arnold et al 1995 hbv model krysanova et al 1999 and topmodel kirkby and beven 1979 focus on soil moisture conditions and approximate the precipitation runoff relationship through the storage capacity curve and or infiltration curve without considering the effect of changes in soil thermal conditions on infiltration water migration and surface runoff process in the soil freeze thaw process the representative soil vegetation atmosphere transfer system svats models such as shaw flerchinger and saxton 1989 and coupmodel jansson and moon 2001 fully consider the water phase change and the accompanying water heat coupling physical process including the transmission and exchange of water and heat through plant cover snow and soil these svats models can accurately simulate the dynamic change of soil moisture and temperature water migration and evapotranspiration in the soil freezing and thawing process but it is limited to the point scale simulation and doesn t perform flow routing researchers have tried to improve the traditional hydrological model to adapt to the runoff characteristics in cold regions guan and duan 2003 assumed that frozen soil formation is a function of accumulated negative temperature and improved the calculation of water storage capacity in xinanjiang model li et al 2021 introduced the conceptual model of frozen soil hydraulic conductivity changing exponentially with the temperature in the freeze thaw process into the gbhm model yang et al 1998 to simulate the impact of soil freeze thaw cycle on water transport but the improved model doesn t consider the temporal change of thawing freezing depth of active layer most of these improved hydrological models consider the influence of frozen soil on hydrological process by empirical formula and the hydrothermal coupling process and its influence are not considered comprehensively which has certain limitations in promotion in the past few decades physical process based cold regions hydrological models e g the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1996 the water balance simulation wasim model liljedahl 2011 the water and energy

have been developed to evaluate the various hydrological impacts of permafrost degradation physical processes of these models are relatively complete however the high data input requirements e g soil vegetation and meteorological data complex parameterization scheme that leads to simulation uncertainty gao et al 2018 and slow calculation speed limit application in addition the harsh climate and environmental conditions make conducting field observations in permafrost regions difficult which further increases the difficulty of local parameterization the precipitation runoff modeling system prms leavesley et al 1983 implemented in the java modeling framework object modeling system oms david et al 2010 prms oms is a deterministic distributed parameter physical process hydrologic model used to simulate and evaluate the watershed response of various combinations of climate and land use avanzi et al 2020 ragettli et al 2017 the response to normal and extreme rainfall and snowmelt can be simulated to evaluate changes in water balance relations streamflow regimes soil moisture relations and groundwater recharge soil freeze thaw cycles which throughout the runoff process such as infiltration evaporation and water migration is the central link of hydrological cycle in cold regions chen et al 2006 the active layer determines the conditions for plant growth gas fluxes groundwater flow regimes and soil formation permafrost beneath the active layer limits the amount of soil water percolation and subsurface storage of water bui et al 2020 hydrological models are a fundamental tool for quantitatively investigating and projecting hydrological processes and the model schemes for snow ice melt glacier response and soil freezing and thawing should be involved in simulating the hydrological conditions over the permafrost regions zhao et al 2019 the original prms oms model does not consider the freeze thaw dynamics of soil and cannot be used to simulate the influence of soil thermal moisture conditions on hydrological processes in permafrost regions therefore in this study considered the complete physical process description of prms oms and the convenience of module modeling we developed a temperature induced variable source area runoff generation model for permafrost regions by introducing an active layer parameterization scheme an active layer freeze thaw module a new infiltration module that considers the interaction between surface water and groundwater supra permafrost groundwater a glacier module and the sub permafrost groundwater module to better represent the hydrological processes in the permafrost regions the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces runoff generation mechanisms in permafrost regions section 3 introduces prms oms improvements according to the runoff generation mechanisms in permafrost regions section 4 introduces the study region data collection pre processing and model evaluation section 5 introduces the uncertainties in the simulations model comparison and analyzed the effect of permafrost degradation on the runoff section 6 presents the conclusions 2 runoff generation mechanisms in permafrost regions the runoff generation mechanisms in permafrost regions are similar to those in non permafrost regions and primarily composed of infiltration excess horton runoff saturation excess dunne runoff interflow runoff and groundwater flow runoff however in permafrost regions changes in the runoff generation process are not only determined by precipitation and soil moisture conditions but also by temperature variations wang et al 2017 the runoff generation process shows obvious multiple mechanisms and alternating seasonal patterns due to the influence of soil freeze thaw cycles in the active layer wang and zhang 2016 the runoff processes in permafrost regions are divided into four stages according to the dynamic characteristics of thermal moisture regimes in the active layer the initial thaw stage the complete thawed stage the initial freeze stage and the complete frozen stage fig 1 in the initial thaw stage during the early vegetation growing season the surface of the active layer begins to thaw as the temperature increases and receives snow melt water large amount and precipitation supply and the vegetation transpiration in this stage is also very limited under the combined effect of the above mentioned factors the surface of the active layer is easily saturated forming saturation excess runoff rd on the ground surface the composition of runoff components during this period is as follows 1 r r d where r is the total runoff m as the thaw depth increases interflow appears above the thaw front at this stage the runoff process is dominated by a mixture of saturation excess rd and interflow ri runoff primarily preferential flow rp 2 r r d r i in the completely thawed stage and the vegetation growing season evapotranspiration gradually increases and most rainfall events occur at this stage the surface runoff process is dominated by infiltration excess runoff rh subsurface runoff primarily occurs in the form of interflow and or groundwater flow rg 3 r r h r i r g in permafrost regions the freeze process is two directional downward from the surface and upward from the bottom of the active layer the downward freeze process from the ground surface controls surface runoff generation and supra permafrost groundwater recharge whereas the upward freeze process from bottom of the active layer greatly affects supra permafrost groundwater discharge this stage features a short period of excess runoff infiltration although groundwater discharge sharply decreases the runoff is primarily sourced from groundwater li et al 2020 wang et al 2017 4 r r d r g in the completely frozen stage there may be a small amount of short term or temporary saturation excess runoff formed by snow melting and rivers can stop flowing in supra permafrost dominated regions in addition the ground temperature in the lower altitude areas of the basin rises earlier than that in the higher altitude areas and the temperature of the sunny slope rises faster than that of the shady slope which forms the development process of saturation excess runoff from lower altitude to higher altitude areas and from sunny slope to shady slope on the one hand the difference in temperature between low and high altitudes and shady and sunny slopes affects the freeze thaw process of the active layer which results in a difference in runoff generation time and area on the other hand the freeze thaw dynamics of the active layer affected the composition of runoff components this pattern of runoff generation time and area change caused by regional temperature difference and the aforementioned transformation of runoff generation mechanism in different freeze thaw stages due to the change of temperature constitute the basic forms of runoff in permafrost regions these two aspects are defined as variable source runoff in the permafrost region and include runoff area source and mode 3 the tvsa model leavesley et al 1983 and markstrom et al 2015 presented the land atmosphere interactions flow routing process and original runoff generation formulated by prms however the original prms oms did not consider the soil freeze thaw processes and glacier runoff process which were crucial for the runoff process of permafrost regions here based on the prms oms we introduce the active layer freeze thaw processes module aft parameterization scheme of the active layer new infiltration module sub permafrost groundwater module and glacier module according to permafrost runoff generation mechanisms to better represent the hydrological processes in the permafrost regions fig 2 specifically parameterization scheme of the active layer was developed to better depict the influence of freeze thaw process on soil infiltration water migration and runoff generation process within active layer in permafrost regions the aft module can accurately simulate the change of freezing and thawing depth in the active layer only through the input air temperature and solar radiation combined with the parameterization scheme of the active layer the runoff generation thickness and hydraulic conductivity are determined for the calculation of the runoff generation process the new infiltration module uses the garto infiltration algorithm developed by lai et al 2015 this algorithm considers the interaction between surface water and groundwater in describing the movement and redistribution of soil moisture in the infiltration process and improves the computational efficiency compared with the original infiltration scheme of prms oms model the degree day factor method was selected to calculate glacier runoff because of its low data requirement and outstanding simulation performance in addition we established an empirical model between sub permafrost groundwater and precipitation and air temperature to simulate and predict changes in deep groundwater in permafrost basins under future climate change scenarios the following is a detailed introduction to each improved or newly developed module for tvsa model compared with original prms oms model 3 1 active layer freeze thaw processes the thermal moisture conditions of the active layer directly affect the ecological environment hydrological processes and stability of permafrost in cold regions bibi et al 2018 however permafrost mostly develops in high altitude or high latitude regions with harsh climate environments that lead to a lack of surface temperature and soil moisture observation data and limit simulation of freeze thaw processes in the active layer based on the improved high resolution empirical surface energy balance hres seb model zaksek and schroedter homscheidt 2009 the s curve model see below for details and the two directional stefan algorithm woo et al 2004 we developed an active layer freeze thaw module that accurately simulates the freeze thaw process defined as changes in the 0 c isotherm in the active layer using air temperature solar radiation and land surface characteristics input data that included the dem digital elevation model vegetation cover the monthly normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and surface albedo fig 3 the improved hres seb model which considers the effects of vegetation and relief characteristics on the surface energy balance was selected to determine the surface temperature 5 lst b 1 b 2 √¢ t p b

calculated surface freeze thaw index and the soil water content woo et al 2004 presented the detailed formulation and parameterization scheme of the two directional stefan algorithm text s1 we use tvsa coupmodel and shaw models to simulate the freezing and thawing process of 2 borehole in fenghuoshan watershed fig s2 a in the thawing stage the thawing depth of the three models is all greater than the measured and the simulation performance of tvsa model in deep soil layer is significantly better than the other two models both shaw model and coupmodel obviously overestimate the maximum thawing depth in the freezing stage the simulation performance of shaw model is significantly better than that of coupmodel and the tvsa model and the tvsa model overestimates the downward freezing rate in summary the simulation performance of tvsa model r 2 0 92 rmse 0 28 m is slightly inferior to that of shaw r 2 0 90 rmse 0 13 m but better than that of coupmodel r 2 0 98 rmse 0 37 m the tvsa model is comparable to coupled hydrothermal models to simulate the freeze thaw dynamics of active layer and even better 3 2 parameterization scheme of the active layer different from the non frozen soil regions the seasonal freeze thaw processes of the active layer in permafrost regions significantly affect the soil infiltration water migration and runoff generation process within the active layer therefore it is necessary to parameterize the soil in permafrost basin to adapt to the effect of freeze thaw processes previous studies have reported a critical depth for the influence of the active layer on the runoff process and the freeze thaw regimes of soil above the critical depth significantly affect the runoff generation process wang et al 2017 here we defined this critical depth as the maximum runoff generation depth of the active layer mrda for soil depths less than the mrda the runoff generation process of the active layer is affected by the freeze thaw cycles for soil depths greater than or equal to the mrda the runoff generation process of the active layer is no longer affected by the freeze thaw cycles the change in runoff generation thickness with the freeze or thaw depth is as follows 11 h hru t Œæ t h r u t Œæ t h r u t Œ≥ hru Œ≥ hru Œæ t h r u t Œ≥ hru Œ≥ hru Œæ f d h r u t alt hru Œ≥ hru Œæ f u h r u t 2 Œ≥ hru alt hru Œæ f u h r u t Œæ f d h r u t alt

set the hydraulic conductivity of the surface layer near the freeze thaw front to vary linearly with the runoff generation process during the freeze thaw process as follows 12 k r h hru t k res h hru

frozen fig 4 3 3 sub permafrost groundwater several studies report that permafrost in valley areas easily develops into seasonally frozen ground or open taliks and then establishing the hydraulic connection between supra permafrost and sub permafrost aquifers and between surface waters and the sub permafrost groundwater and ensuring the continuous flow of rivers throughout the year shrestha et al 2021 walvoord et al 2012 the quantitative analysis of the linkage among surface water supra permafrost sub permafrost and groundwater is challenging due to the complicated interactions of regional scale permafrost hydrology and the scarcity of permafrost and hydrogeological information e g hydraulic head data detailed hydrostratigraphy and groundwater age data that impedes the development of detailed numerical models walvoord et al 2012 statistical methods such as the separation of hydrographs baseflow recession analyses and flow duration curves are widely used to analyze changes in groundwater storage evans et al 2020 lin et al 2020 interaction between surface water groundwater and runoff components song et al 2021 wang et al 2021 in permafrost regions song et al 2021 suggested that the q90 streamflow at exceedance probabilities of 90 reflects steady deep groundwater sub permafrost groundwater for permafrost rivers is more sensitive to warming than variations in precipitation and shows a higher positive correlation with mean annual air temperature than other percentile flows in the tvsa model q90 was selected to approximately represent recharge from sub permafrost groundwater r g 2 we analyzed the characteristics of runoff variation in the eurasian arctic and qtp permafrost regions over the past decades table s1 fig s1 and found a significant linear

that simulates infiltration and redistribution in the presence of a shallow dynamic water table builds upon the improved green ampt infiltration with the redistribution gar model ogden and saghafian 1997 and incorporates features from the talbot ogden t o infiltration and redistribution method talbot and ogden 2008 garto sets the groundwater level as the lower boundary and considers the interaction between surface water and groundwater in addition garto discretizes the soil moisture into continuous bins with constant water content which greatly reduces the error caused by the discontinuous wetting front and improves model accuracy fig 5 shows the unsaturated soil moisture profiles in the garto model with three surface wetting fronts and four groundwater fronts lai et al 2015 presented additional garto model details text s2 3 5 glacier runoff glacier is a sensitive indicator of global climate change fischer 2010 affected by climate change glaciers in most mountainous areas of the world are shrinking and showing an accelerating trend resulting in significant changes in hydrological processes in many watersheds especially for alpine mountains e g permafrost regions zhao et al 2019 under climate warming the increase of temperature will accelerate the rate of snow glacier melt in spring resulting in faster earlier and larger spring runoff and accelerate the water cycle in alpine mountainous areas shen et al 2013 thus affecting water supply food security and hydropower energy production in the middle and lower reaches immerzeel et al 2010 accurate calculation of glacier runoff is an integral part of climate change risk assessment and sustainable water resource management in glacier covered basins viviroli et al 2011 although the melting process of glaciers depends on the surface energy budget the energy balance model method involves many parameters and a complex calculation process that is difficult to popularize in remote alpine especially permafrost areas yin et al 2016 the degree day factor model is an empirical statistical relationship based on temperature and glacier ablation that is widely used in glacier runoff simulations because of its simple input data and easy acquisition and processing konz and seibert 2010 the glaciated regions in each hru can be divided into a set of elevation bands at intervals of 200 m the inverse distance

glacier volume was updated every year with the simulated ice melt from all glacier hrus the updated glacier area was determined by inverting eq 15 with the updated ice volume this procedure was repeated for all the simulation periods 4 model evaluations 4 1 study area the model performance was evaluated in fenghuoshan fhs 92 50 93 03 e 34 40 34 47 n a typical permafrost small catchment and

initial 2010 glacier input data https data tpdc ac cn the recorded runoff data were primarily concentrated between may and october because the water surface of tuotuohe station is mostly frozen in spring and winter the dem data were used to calculate the aspect and to divide the subbasins hru and river channels number each subbasin and river channel and establish a topological relationship each hru used a combination of land use type and soil type the monthly ndvi monthly surface albedo down welling short wave radiation solar azimuth angle solar incidence angle and solar zenith angle data were used to drive the active layer freeze thaw process simulation module the dem ndvi and surface albedo data are downloaded from the geospatial data cloud https www gscloud cn tvsa was calibrated using observations the simulations were performed at both the point and basin scales at the point scale the parameters of the aft module were calibrated by comparing the observed and simulated freeze thaw processes at the fhs observation sites at the basin scale the daily hydrograph was calibrated by tuning soil hydraulic parameters the performance of the tvsa was evaluated using statistical parameters including the root mean square error rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the coefficient of determination r2 and the relative error re the formulas for calculating these parameters are as follows 16 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 17 nse 1 i 1 n s i m i 2 i 1 n m i m 2 18 r 2 i 1 n s i s m i m 2 i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n m i m 2 19 re i 1 n s i i 1 n m i i 1 n m i 100 where n denotes the number of samples s i and m i denote the simulated and measured values respectively and s and m denote the average simulated and measured values respectively the best fit between the measured and simulated values would have an rmse of 0 and an nse of 1 4 3 sensitivity analysis to quantify the uncertainty on simulated runoff in permafrost regions associated with the typically uncertain soil hydrothermal parameters a sensitivity analysis is conducted with the method outlined by lenhart et al 2002 the dependence of an output variable y on an input parameter x is determined by the normalized dimensionless sensitivity index i 20 i y 2 y 1 y 0 2 √¢ Œ¥ x x 0 where y 0 is the model output with parameter value at x 0 after calibration Œ¥ x is the percentage adjustment of the parameter being considered y 1 is the model output value predicted with x 1 x 0 Œ¥ x and y 2 is the model output value predicted with x 2 x 0 Œ¥ x the Œ¥ x x 0 in eq 20 was set to 10 of this study referred to previous studies ficklin et al 2012 krogh et al 2017 lenhart et al 2002 the greater the absolute value of i the more sensitive the parameter is for model prediction mean values of these parameters over every month and the whole year are calculated 4 4 freeze thaw process simulation at the fenghuoshan watershed the purpose of this simulation was to examine the freeze thaw process simulations in the tvsa model table 1 summarizes the calibrated parameters of the aft module holes 5 10 were selected to calibrate parameters relating to freeze thaw processes and holes 1 4 distributed in different vegetation coverages of shady slopes or sunny slopes were selected for validation because only one year for 2017 of soil temperature and moisture data were available fig 7 compares the simulations and observations the model reproduced the freeze and thaw processes of the active layer well at different aspects elevations and vegetation coverage with r2 ranging from 0 89 to 0 97 average of 0 935 and rmse ranging from 0 12 to 0 36 m average of 0 225 m the simulation results for the validation site 1 4 showed that the active layer began to thaw in late april the thaw depth of the active layer peaked in the early october and the active layer began to freeze in late october except for the slight deviation in the simulation of the thaw process of hole 1 the simulated freeze and thaw depths of the other holes were well fitted with the measured data in addition according to zhao et al 2010 the active layer thickness of the fenghuoshan site 34 73 n 92 90 e will reach 2 25 m in 2017 which is not far from our simulation result 2 02 m therefore we reasonably believe that the model can effectively capture freeze thaw dynamics in the active layer 4 5 calibration and validation of the discharge at fenghuoshan watershed the average freeze thaw depth of all grid points in each hru was used to calculate the runoff generation process the 2017 stream data were used to calibrate parameters related to the runoff generation and flow routing processes and the validation period was 2018 2019 table 2 summarizes the calibrated runoff process parameters fig 8 illustrates the daily observed and simulated stream flows from 2017 to 2019 during the calibration period the results with high accuracies were obtained with an nse value of 0 99 and an r2 value of 0 99 results with acceptable accuracies were obtained with an nse value of 0 91 and r2 value of 0 94 during the validation period although the magnitude of the annual peak flow was slightly overestimated the peak time was accurately predicted the runoff of the fenghuoshan watershed was primarily dominated by the interflow and supra permafrost groundwater which accounted for 77 8 of annual stream flow the saturation excess and infiltration excess flow accounted for 22 2 of annual stream flow li et al 2020 reported that the supra permafrost groundwater accounts for 49 of the river water at the zhimenda station outlet of the source area of the yangtze river sryr permafrost coverage in the fhs almost 100 song et al 2020a is higher than that in the sryr thus the simulated results is reasonable in addition the model accurately reproduced the spring flood process caused by precipitation snow melt and ice thaw wang et al 2017 collectively the tvsa model can be used to simulate or predict streamflow in permafrost regions 4 6 calibration and validation of the discharge at tuotuohe catchment stream data for 1990 1999 were used to calibrate parameters related to the runoff generation and flow routing processes the validation period was 2000 2018 may to october table 2 summarizes the calibrated parameters for the runoff processes fig 9 illustrates the monthly observed and simulated stream flows from 1990 to 2018 unlike the fhs watershed the tth catchment contains perennial snow and glaciers additionally the year round stream flow in the catchment may be related to the recharge of sub permafrost groundwater through taliks near the river during the calibration period the results with high accuracies were obtained with an nse value of 0 87 and an r2 value of 0 87 results with acceptable accuracies were obtained with an nse value of 0 85 and an r2 value of 0 86 during the validation period the re value of 0 4 indicated underestimated runoff and was related to the general underestimation of summer peak flow one possible reason could be the deviation between the cmfd dataset and the real meteorological data owing to the lack of soil temperature and moisture observations in the tth we directly applied the freeze thaw parameters calibrated in the fhs to the tth simulation this substitution led to deviations in the freeze thaw depth of the active layer and affected the runoff simulation however the model accurately reproduced the spring flood process caused by precipitation glacier snow melt and ice thaw collectively the tvsa model can be used to simulate or predict streamflow in permafrost regions despite data scarcity heterogeneity and complexity 5 discussions 5 1 simulation uncertainties simulations uncertainties are attributable to the different model parameters adopted forcing products and the hydrological model structure huss et al 2014 in the tvsa model the study area was divided into sub basins hrus according to dem data additionally soil physical properties e g hydraulic conductivity field capacity and porosity in different areas e g aspects and elevations in the same hrus were determined by the different soil type fraction which might inevitably lead to simulation deviations table 3 shows the normalized sensitivity index for the soil hydrothermal parameters tth simulation the sensitivity index is ranked into four classes lenhart et al 2002 i 0 05 small to negligible sensitivity 0 05 i 0 20 medium sensitivity 0 20 i 1 00 high sensitivity and i 1 00 indicates extremely high sensitivity on the annual scale the field capacity was medium sensitivity i 0 05 to runoff simulation and the sensitivity of other parameters to runoff simulation is small to negligible however the influence of soil hydrothermal parameters on runoff simulation shows seasonal variation characteristics at this time these parameters significantly affect the runoff process in different seasons and cannot be neglected for example the soil thermal conductivity is high or even extremely high sensitive to the runoff process in the early stage of thawing april to may and the late stage of freezing november to december the initial freezing time and thawing time is delayed and advanced with the increase of thermal conductivity respectively which inevitable affect the runoff generation process the change of bulk density and porosity affects the proportion distribution of soil particles air and water in soil and then affects the thermal conductivity thereby affecting the freeze thaw process of the active layer and runoff process in contrast changes in saturated hydraulic conductivity have negligible effect on the runoff process in permafrost regions several previous studies suggest that the uncertainties associated with model soil parameters are much smaller than those from meteorological forcing data zhao et al 2019 the cmfd dataset used in this study was made through fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis datasets and in situ station data he et al 2020 and the cmfd is of superior quality than other forcing dataset e g global land data assimilation system gldas for china due to a larger number of stations 753 stations are used to generate the cmfd than are utilized in the gldas however there is only one weather station in an area of 17 130 km2 in the tth basin which may cause some errors in the estimation of meteorological element especially the precipitation at different altitude of the whole basin therefore we conducted a sensitivity experiment of modeling performance in the tth catchment by changing the daily precipitation by 5 10 20 30 5 10 20 and 30 when the precipitation increased by 5 30 the simulated runoff increased by 2 5 14 73 when the precipitation decreased by 5 30 the simulated runoff decreased by 2 47 14 82 indicating that the tvsa model is very sensitive to variations in precipitation especially in july to september fig 10 b because the greatest limitation for evaluating the model performance in permafrost regions is the heterogeneity and scarcity of meteorological stations a comprehensive program of meteorological element measurement and analysis is necessary for the permafrost regions and further efforts are also needed to assess the applicability of forcing products in these regions 5 2 permafrost degradation and its effect on runoff over the past few decades especially since the 1980s the eurasia artic and the qtp has experienced a more significant warming than other regions song et al 2021 under climate warming frozen ground degradation associated with an increase of air temperature ecosystem transformation and land cover changes is expected to have a profound effect on the thermal and hydrological conditions of regions covered by large areas of permafrost and seasonally frozen soil cuo et al 2015 the simulated average alt 2000 2018 in tth basin was 2 39 m which was similar to the value of 2 51 m 2000 2015 reported by ni et al 2021 and the simulate change rate of alt in this study was 0 10 m 10a 1990 2018 fig 11 a which is smaller than the average value 0 15 m 10a 1981 2010 on the qtp reported by guo and wang 2013 and the possible reason could be the spatial heterogeneity of permafrost changes on the qtp the annual runoff of tth basin also showed an increasing trend with the increase of active layer thickness especially after 2000 fig 11 b previous studies suggested that the enhancement of soil infiltration and water storage capacity caused by the increase of alt during the warm season shi et al 2020 might decrease the runoff wang et al 2018a zhao et al 2019 however the cold season discharge is expected to substantially increase due to the permafrost soil degradation and earlier soil thawing zhao et al 2019 the results of the air temperature sensitivity experiment showed that the simulated alt increased by 0 41 m and the warm season june to october runoff decreased by 3 while the cold season november to may runoff increased by as much as 25 when the air temperature increased by 1 c the runoff increased most significantly in april to may 26 and november to december 22 of the cold season fig 12 which may be related to the early thawing 15 days and delayed freezing upward 17 days downward 9 days of the active layer with the increase of air temperature with the climate gradually changing warm and wet on the qtp gao et al 2021 if the increase of precipitation cannot offset the decrease of runoff caused by the thickening of active layer then the warm season runoff will gradually decrease in the future then reduce the water supply for warm season downstream agriculture zhao et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to formulate more targeted water resources development and utilization policies based on possible changes in runoff under climate change 5 3 comparison and limitations process based hydrological models in cold regions such as vic wasim geotop crhm etc for the consideration of soil freeze thaw processes based on energy and mass conservation and heat transfer equation physical mechanism of these models is relatively complete but they also have high requirements for input data and large number of input parameters which are difficult to calibrate specifically the vic model focuses on the surface runoff process without considering the interflow while the geotop model focuses on the description of the groundwater transport especially the impact of micro topography wasim model is highly sensitive to spatial and temporal resolution and it requires intensive input data and model parameters for each grid cell of the model domain since it is a fully distributed model for crhm the model parameters are normally obtained based on the expert knowledge of the modeled catchment leading to high uncertainty of the modeling results bui et al 2020 compared with the previous models the tvsa model has the following advantages 1 the low requirements for input data meteorological forcing data only need precipitation temperature and solar radiation data and soil and vegetation data mainly include ndvi albedo land use and soil texture data which currently have a large amount of data products are available so the model is suitable for promotion in data scarcity permafrost regions 2 the two directional stefan algorithm is used to calculate the change of freeze thaw depth without solving the complex state equation for temperature distribution and soil water flux in the soil matrix which greatly improves the efficiency of the model the aft module fully considers the effect of vegetation and relief characteristics on the surface energy balance and the effect of climate conditions and soil thermal properties on soil moisture conditions ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the simulation while the tvsa model ensures model simplicity reliability and computational efficiency its runoff simulation performance in permafrost regions is comparable to or even better than that of the coupled hydrothermal model fig s2 b c 3 the sub permafrost groundwater is considered for the first time 4 modular modeling is conducive to module improvement and development however challenges that remain targets for future research include the identification of seasonal frozen ground and taliks and the development of the corresponding hydrothermal process algorithm previous studies report that taliks or seasonally frozen ground often develop near surface water bodies e g lakes rivers or faults whose hydrothermal processes are quite different from those of active layers in permafrost regions song et al 2020b in particular the exchange between the supra permafrost and sub permafrost aquifers and between surface water and sub permafrost aquifers only occur within open taliks walvoord et al 2012 however this fact is not considered in most previous studies the developed empirical sub permafrost groundwater model may be limited for predicting the impact of future climate change on runoff variations due to the complex physical processes of surface water groundwater exchange in addition under the premise of ensuring the simulation accuracy as far as possible in order to deal with the data scarcity in permafrost regions and improve the computational efficiency of the model some processes are simplified for example the calculation of surface temperature and glacier runoff are based on empirical models moreover current cold regions hydrological models most focused on 1d vertical fluxes and solving water energy balance differential equations while neglecting horizontal landscape heterogeneities and mountainous terrain both of which are important factors connecting point scale permafrost observations and basin scale hydrograph data gao et al 2021 and the effect of organic matter layer under alpine meadow on soil hydrothermal characteristics is not considered which are the future needs to be improved 6 conclusions in this study we developed a variable source area runoff generation model with permafrost parameterization by considering the freeze thaw processes of the active layer in permafrost regions the model depicted the freeze and thaw depth of soil at permafrost sites and successfully reproduced river discharge the model performance was evaluated in the fhs a typical permafrost watershed and the tth a typical permafrost glacier catchment on the qtp we first calibrated and validated the model for freeze thaw depth at the soil moisture and temperature observational sites of the fhs the tvsa model accurately reproduced the daily freeze and thaw dynamics and obtained reasonable rmse values we then calibrated and validated the model for the discharge at the outlet of the fhs and the tth the model reproduced the spring summer flood and autumn runoff recession processes well and obtained reasonable nse values we analyzed the simulations uncertainty through model parameters and forcing data and confirm the high sensitivity of the tvsa model to precipitation input the lack of reliable precipitation data creates major challenges and uncertainties in simulations and a reliable estimation of thermal conductivity and potential changes due to a changing environment is advised for future applications in addition simulation results of tth basin showed that different seasons have different responses to air temperature rise when the air temperature rose by 1 c the runoff in the cold season increased by 25 while the runoff in the warm season decreased by 3 and threaten the water supply for downstream in summary the tvsa model is a powerful tool for the system identification of variable source runoff generation processes and the associated physical mechanism under temperature control in
