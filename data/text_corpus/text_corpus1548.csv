input to forecast the final output for a day ahead reservoir inflow forecasting data pre processing and efficient model building greatly improve the correlation between measured and predicted flow rates used to maximize hydroelectricity production ghayekhloo et al 2015 jaramillo mor√°n et al 2021 meydani et al 2022 yousefi et al 2022 the electrical energy sector of cameroon is highly hydro dominant with 96 of all the energy generated from the nation being from hydropower djiela et al 2021 despite this high potential there is still frequent blackout though its hydro potential if fully maximized can meet its energy demand and that of its neighboring nations simo et al 2006 good management of the sanaga watershed the largest watershed in the nation is very important to meet its energy needs tengeleng et al 2014 tengeleng et al 2014 used a neural network to forecast the monthly river flow of the song bengue river the result showed that a window size of two months gave a strong correlation between the forecast and the measured values there exist several time series decomposition methods for pre processing such as classical decomposition x11 decomposition and seats seasonal extraction in autoregressive integrated moving average arima time series decomposition though classical decomposition is widely used it contains some drawbacks such as the unavailability of the trend cycle for the first and last few observations the period of its seasonality is one year which is not the case with all times series data the x11 decomposition method overcomes the shortcomings of the classical decomposition method and is robust to outliers some drawback of the x11 decomposition method is its ability to handle only monthly and quarterly data just like x11 decomposition the seats decomposition method cannot work with data with daily hourly or weekly seasonality as its seasonality is monthly and quarterly due to the above downside of the decomposition methods we apply seasonal trend decomposition with loess stl for time series decomposition loess is a means of correlating nonlinear relationships stl handles all kinds of seasonality the smoothness of the trend cycle can be managed by the user the seasonal component changes over time and not just yearly and the user can control its seasonality hyndman and athanasopoulos 2018 other methods for time series decomposition such as empirical mode decomposition emd is a data driven method that decomposes a time series into its intrinsic mode functions imfs which are functions that are defined by their extrema and zero crossings emd extracts the high frequency imfs first and the low frequency ones last variational mode decomposition vmd is a non linear and non parametric method for decomposing a signal into a sum of imfs it is similar to emd but uses a variation optimization to decompose the signal into imfs vmd is more robust to noise and it can extract more modes than emd qi et al 2019 liu et al 2022 the strong seasonality of the input data led to the application of stl for decomposition in this study the main drawback with the above cited models is their inability to decompose the input variables and partition the decomposed components for better understanding among decomposed variables and efficient flow rate forecast this preprocessing method helps in the understanding of the hydrological correlation between each of the decomposed components and their impact on the forecast variable as a contribution to solving this problem different window sizes and horizons are used to determine a good correlation between measured and forecast values also a comparative study among deep learning algorithms is carried out to obtain the best with minimal statistical errors next the input data are decomposed using seasonal trend decomposition with loess stl and the forty two different decomposed variables were partitions and used as input in the deep learning models to study the correlation between each parameter and the predicted flow rate this is applied to study the flow rate of song bengue confluent which has four upstream reservoirs to regulate the flow rate and two downstream hydro production plants this study is organized as follows section 1 gives the introduction of the work section 2 is about the materials and study area section 3 gives the study methodology implemented section 4 summarizes the findings and section 5 gives a discussion of the result the conclusion of the work is in section 6 2 materials song bengue is found in the sanaga watershed in cameroon it is confluent that receives water from four upstream reservoirs namely mbakaou lom pangar mape and bamenjin at 637 km 466 km 372 km and 394 km respectively from the confluent the study zone has the following geographical coordinates 3 510 n 10 100 e and 6 330 n 14 420e songloulou and edea are hydropower plants located downstream of song bengue and supply energy to the entire southern interconnected grid sig of cameroon all the data used for this study was collected from eneo energy new the main electricity distributor company in cameroon daily historical data from 2015 to 2020 were used for the training and testing of the models the fourteen undecomposed data used in this study for the multivariate flow rate forecast include the flow rate in m3 s and precipitation in mm for song bengue the inflow in m3 s namely bamenjin inflow lom pangar inflow mape inflow and the mbakaou inflow the outflow in m3 s includes bamenjin outflow lom pangar outflow mape outflow and the mbakaou outflow and the precipitation in mm includes bamenjin precipitation lom pangar precipitation mape precipitation and mbakaou precipitation of the four upstream reservoirs the reservoirs serve to regulate the flow rate on the sanaga watershed for hydroelectricity production the inflow from the reservoirs into the study site and precipitation at the site is shown in fig 1 fig 2 represents the study site fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 represent the upstream reservoirs inflows outflows and precipitations respectively much seasonality can be seen in fig 1 fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 song bengue confluent receives input from four upstream reservoirs that function to regulate its flow rate for hydroelectricity production the seasonality in the figures is due to the nature of the rainy season and dry season of cameroon and also due to the stochastic nature of the demand for hydroelectricity from sig simo et al 2007 with the inflow and precipitation being accounted for by the seasonal changes while the reservoir output is dependent on the demand for hydroelectricity 3 methodology deep learning models dlms are a subset of machine learning models that implement multiple layers of artificial neural networks to learn the representation of data these layers called hidden layers permit dlms to master hierarchical representations of data this structure allows dlms to learn more powerful representations of data dlms are typically trained using a variant of the backpropagation algorithms which is used to adjust the parameters of the model to minimize the error between the model s forecast and the actual training data goodfellow et al 2016 xu et al 2017 anubala et al 2018 mezzini et al 2019 schons et al 2018 the following deep learning models were used for forecasting the flow rate 3 1 dense model for a neural network nn a dense layer is a layer with all its neurons connected to those of the previous layer the neurons in a dense layer model receive as inputs the outputs from the preceding layer the neurons from the dense layer perform a vector matrix multiplication a process where the number of row vectors in the preceding layer equals the number of column vectors in the dense layer goodfellow 2016 luo et al 2020 the dense network is shown in fig 6 3 2 one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn model convolution neural networks cnn are deep learning tools with a lot of applications depending on the input data in 1d cnn the kernel moves in 1 direction with two dimensional data and is mostly applied to time series prediction in 2d cnn the kernel s movement is in 2 directions and uses three dimensional data and is mostly used on image data in 3d cnn the kernel moves in 3 directions and uses 4 dimensional data like ct scans cnn typically has two layers namely the convolution layers and the multi layer feed forward mlff layers as shown in fig 7 qazi et al 2022 the input layer precedes the convolution layer which precedes the mlff layer convolutions are performed sliding the kernel over the input causally or non causally in the convolution layer with other operations on the input like feature extraction and mlff dense like layer as the decision block goodfellow 2016 anubala et al 2018 mezzini et al 2019 in this work 1d cnn is used for the flow rate time series forecasting using tensorflow a free open sourced end to end software a library for numerous machine learning functions with keras a high level neural network library that runs on top of tensorflow 3 3 long short term memory model long short term memory lstm is an improved version of recurrent neural networks that handle the long term memory problem of rnn rnns handle efficiently learning in short intervals and when the intervals are long their efficiency reduces lstm is applied in time series data processing prediction and classification debasish 2022 it consists of a cell an input gate a forget gate and an output gate the flow of information into and out of the cell is controlled by three gates and the cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals fig 8 shows the basic structure of an lstm cell the input gate determines which of the input values should be used to change the memory the sigmoid function determines whether to allow 0 or 1 values through the gate the tanh function assigns weight to the data provided on a scale of 1 1 eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 represents the equations of the input gate the outcome of the cell and the forget gate respectively 1 i t œÉ w i h t 1 x t b i 2 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c the forget gate finds the

confluent 3 4 models parameters the models were applied using python with tensorflow in keras and possess the general and specific parameters as shown in table 1 tensorflow is an open source machine learning library for numerical computation and large scale machine learning keras is a high level neural network written in python and capable of running on top of tensorflow for building and training deep learning models table 1 presents the parameters and hyperparameters of the deep models 3 5 time series decomposition while observing the plot of our historical flow rate in fig 1 a we noticed that the seasonal component of the data is almost constant over time with this observation we chose the additive time series decomposition over the multiplicative time series decomposition mills 2019 fig 9 shows the proposed methodology fig 10 shows the time series decomposition of the flow rate data into seasonal trend and random or remainder components eq 6 represents the decomposition of the additive time series into various components namely seasonal components trend components and random components 6 y x s x t x r x y x is the data s x is the seasonal component t x is the trend component and r x is the random component of the time series all the inflow outflow and precipitation of the reservoirs and flow rate with precipitation of song bengue were decomposed using stl as shown in fig 10 seasonal trend decomposition with loess stl was applied for the time series decomposition stl was chosen due to its versatile and robust qualities it is advantageous over other decomposition methods due to its ability to handle any type of seasonality the rate of change of the seasonal and trend component can be controlled by the forecaster fig 9 shows the proposed methodology to forecast the flow rate the input data are decomposed using stl and each component is partitioned the partitions are used as input into the deep learning models for forecasting river flow rates the scenario with the least error is chosen as the optimum for flow rate forecasting fig 10 depicts the decomposition of the flow rate using stl decomposition preprocessing is done through the decomposition of the input variables using stl the objective is to minimize the error between the model s forecast and the actual training flow rate data table 2 shows the statistical metrics of maximum minimum standard deviation std and mean values of the decomposed input variables the robust stl is used to decompose the input variables into the random seasonal and trend components fig 10 presents the time series of song bengue flow rate fig 10 a decomposed into its random seasonal and trend components as represented in fig 10 b fig 10 c and fig 10 d respectively all fourteen input components are decomposed into these three components and grouped as scenarios for forecasting table 2 represents the statistical characteristics of all the forty two decomposed input variables for the flow rate its mean standard deviation minimum and the maximum value is 1810 99 m3 s 1005 92 m3 s 820 m3 s and 7911 m3 s from fig 9 we propose a framework for time series forecast where the hydrological data are all decomposed using stl and the various components partitioned in all the given sets and each set is then combined with the flow rate before fitting the multivariate data into the deep learning model the partition with the minimum error is then considered the partition with optimum input variables for flow rate forecast 80 of our data was used to train the models and 20 was used to test the models 3 6 valuation criteria for the deep learning models in this section four different evaluation criteria were used to evaluate the forecasting abilities of the different models and partitioned inputs of the models these criteria include the mean absolute error mae samadrita ghosh 2022 mean squared error mse samadrita ghosh 2022 root mean squared error rmse samadrita ghosh 2022 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mccuen et al 2006 respectively 7 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y ÀÜ i 8 mse 1 n i 1 n y i y ÀÜ i 2 9 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y ÀÜ i 2 10 n s e 1 i 1 n y i y ÀÜ i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i is the observed value y ÀÜ i the forecast value and y the mean of the observed value n represents the sample size 4 results 4 1 justification of window size input and horizon output we used a univariate dense model with window sizes and horizons of seven past days and a day ahead thirty past days and a day ahead and thirty past days and seven days ahead the choices of the window sizes and horizons are due to the evaluation of the interval for forecasting that is from short term one day to a week to medium term forecast one month these windows and horizons were evaluated using the dense model and the mae gives 61 68 m3 s 82 89 m3 s and 222 74 m3 s respectively the error increases with decreasing window size and increasing forecast horizon aligning with the findings of bogner et al 2019 therefore a window size of seven days and a day ahead forecast horizon were utilized for the three deep learning models 4 2 models results for multivariate time series forecast forecasting on the test data was done using three different models namely the dense model the conv1d model and the lstm model for univariate time series and the evaluation criteria were tested to choose the best model table 3 summarizes the results obtained from table 3 the dense model is the best with the minimum evaluation criteria followed by the lstm model and lastly the conv1d model fig 11 shows a plot of the forecast with the different models with an offset of 300 on the test data 4 3 multivariate prediction with different decomposed partition sets from the result in table 3 the dense model gave the best result for univariate time series the models were further used to forecast the flow rate using the different decomposed partitions of the multivariate time series forecast and the results are shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 the plots for the different partitions are shown in fig 12 fig 13 fig 14 fig 15 fig 16 and fig 17 the results of the evaluation criteria for these plots are shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 the bar plot of the evaluation criteria for mae and rmse for the three models with all the scenarios is depicted in fig 18 the evaluation criteria for each partition were measured as shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 the bar plot is shown in fig 18 since the mean square error is squared of the root mean square error we chose to leave out mse to best appreciate the difference in the partitions fig 1 fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 show a strong and predictable seasonality in the input data this strong seasonality can be seen from the results shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 when the random only seasonal only and trend only were used as scenarios the seasonal only scenario produced the least error among the three scenarios for all three models used this is in accord with the strong seasonality in the input components again the greatest mae of 49 849 m3 s for the dense model was obtained when the forecast was done without the seasonal term this strongly indicates the importance of the seasonal term for forecasting the song bengue flow rate the random or remainder component of the flow rate as shown in fig 10 b represents the stochasticity or the unexplained pattern in the time series forecasting the flow rate with the scenario of the random term produces an interesting result that is not too different from the result obtained with the trend only scenario as shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 this indicates the importance of the remainder term in the time series for the song bengue confluent the scenario of total decomposed data produces the best result for all three deep learning models as shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 this indicates the importance and correlation of all the decomposed variables in forecasting the song bengue confluent flow rate furthermore the scenario of total undecomposed data produced the next best result as such all the input data namely inflows outflows and precipitations are important for forecasting the flow rate of the confluent 5 discussion the article discusses the results of a study on forecasting the flow rate of song bengue using different sizes and horizons the study found that as the forecasting interval and window size increased the efficiency of the model for forecasting song bengue confluent decreased which aligns with the findings of bogner et al 2019 who studied the impact of window size and horizon on the efficiency of models the study also found that the deep models used in the study namely the dense model conv1d model and lstm model had a high coefficient of nse value greater than 0 9 indicating a very good fit according to nash and sutcliffe 1970 who defined nse model evaluation as 1 for a perfect fit and nse 0 75 as a very good fit this good fit is due to the choice of hyperparameters due to tuning and experimentation of the deep learning models sufficient training data and the suitable architecture of the models the study also found that the lowest error occurred when utilizing all decomposed variables as input emphasizing the importance of preprocessing input data for time series forecasting this is supported by the work of ghayekhloo et al 2015 who studied the impact of data preprocessing on time series forecasting jaramillo mor√°n et al 2021 who applied preprocessing tools for improving forecasting results by decomposing the time series into its trend and fluctuations and decomposition into intrinsic mode functions imf using empirical mode decomposition emd meydani et al 2022 who preprocessed data for reservoir inflow forecasting by downscaling raw precipitation and temperature forecast which increases the model accuracy for forecast and yousefi et al 2022 who used causal empirical decomposition to improve the model s efficiency for forecasting this study specifically used stl decomposition preprocessing due to its ability to treat data with strong seasonality the forecasting error for the daily flow rate forecast is shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 additionally the study found that the random component of the time series should not be disregarded as the least error occurred when all the components of the time series are used scenario of total decompose data as inputs into the forecasting model furthermore the study found that decomposing the input time series before using it as input for prediction reduces the prediction error the study also found that using univariate forecasting resulted in a larger mae than its multivariate counterpart overall the study highlights the importance of utilizing all components of time series data for forecasting and the benefits of preprocessing input data for time series forecasting of the song bengue confluent this is consistent with the findings of other studies in the field which have shown that preprocessing and including all components of a time series in the model can lead to improved forecasting results 6 conclusion in conclusion this study aimed at examining the flow rate of song bengue using different window sizes and horizons the results revealed that the forecasting efficiency decreased as the forecasting interval and window size increased which is in line with previous studies that have shown that models tend to become less efficient as the window size and horizon increase furthermore the study found that the deep learning models used had a high nse value of greater than 0 9 indicating a very good fit according to nash and sutcliffe additionally the study found that the lowest error occurred when utilizing all decomposed variables as input which highlights the importance of preprocessing input data for time series forecasting and the importance and correlation of these hydrological input data to forecast the flow rate of song bengue this is consistent with the findings of other studies in the field which have shown that preprocessing and including all components of a time series in the model can lead to improved forecasting results the study also found that using univariate forecasting for the deep models results in a larger error than their multivariate counterpart in forecasting the song bengue confluent flow rate the study also found that the random or remainder component of the time series should not be neglected as the least error occurred when all the decomposed components are used as input this study emphasizes the importance of including all components of time series data for forecasting and the benefits of preprocessing input data for time series forecasting this preprocessing method to improve model forecasting efficiency is proposed but we acknowledge the limitations of the deep learning models due to uncertainty analysis applying ensemble learning to each decomposed

forecast and the actual training data goodfellow et al 2016 xu et al 2017 anubala et al 2018 mezzini et al 2019 schons et al 2018 the following deep learning models were used for forecasting the flow rate 3 1 dense model for a neural network nn a dense layer is a layer with all its neurons connected to those of the previous layer the neurons in a dense layer model receive as inputs the outputs from the preceding layer the neurons from the dense layer perform a vector matrix multiplication a process where the number of row vectors in the preceding layer equals the number of column vectors in the dense layer goodfellow 2016 luo et al 2020 the dense network is shown in fig 6 3 2 one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn model convolution neural networks cnn are deep learning tools

layers namely the convolution layers and the multi layer feed forward mlff layers as shown in fig 7 qazi et al 2022 the input layer precedes the convolution layer which precedes the mlff layer convolutions are performed sliding the kernel over the input causally or non causally in the convolution layer with other operations on the input like feature extraction and mlff dense like layer as the decision block goodfellow 2016 anubala et al 2018 mezzini et al 2019 in this work 1d cnn is used for the flow rate time series forecasting using tensorflow a free open sourced end to end software

confluent 3 4 models parameters the models were applied using python with tensorflow in keras and possess the general and specific parameters as shown in table 1 tensorflow is an open source machine learning library for numerical computation and large scale machine learning keras is a high level neural network written in python and capable of running on top of tensorflow for building and training deep learning models table 1 presents the parameters and hyperparameters of the deep models 3 5 time series decomposition while observing the plot of our historical flow rate in fig 1 a we noticed that the seasonal component of the data is almost constant over time with this observation we chose the additive time series decomposition over the multiplicative time series decomposition mills 2019 fig 9 shows the proposed methodology fig 10 shows the time series decomposition of the flow rate data into seasonal trend and random or remainder components eq 6 represents the decomposition of the additive time series into various components namely seasonal components trend components and random components 6 y x s x t x r x y x is the data s x is the seasonal component t x is the trend component and r x is the random component of the time series all the inflow outflow and precipitation of the reservoirs and flow rate with precipitation of song bengue were decomposed using stl as shown in fig 10 seasonal trend decomposition with loess stl was applied for the time series decomposition stl was chosen due to its versatile and robust qualities it is advantageous over other decomposition methods due to its ability to handle any type of seasonality the rate of change of the seasonal and trend component can be controlled by the forecaster fig 9 shows the proposed methodology to forecast the flow rate the input data are decomposed using stl and each component is partitioned the partitions are used as input into the deep learning models for forecasting river flow rates the scenario with the least error is chosen as the optimum for flow rate forecasting fig 10 depicts the decomposition of the flow rate using stl decomposition preprocessing is done through the decomposition of the input variables using stl the objective is to minimize the error between the model s forecast and the actual training flow rate data table 2 shows the statistical metrics of maximum minimum standard deviation std and mean values of the decomposed input variables the robust stl is used to decompose the input variables into the random seasonal and trend components fig 10 presents the time series of song bengue flow rate fig 10 a decomposed into its random seasonal and trend components as represented in fig 10 b fig 10 c and fig 10 d respectively all fourteen input components are decomposed into these three components and grouped as scenarios for forecasting table 2 represents the statistical characteristics of all the forty two decomposed input variables for the flow rate its mean standard deviation minimum and the maximum value is 1810 99 m3 s 1005 92 m3 s 820 m3 s and 7911 m3 s from fig 9 we propose a framework for time series forecast where the hydrological data are all decomposed using stl and the various components partitioned in all the given sets and each set is then combined with the flow rate before fitting the multivariate data into the deep learning model the partition with the minimum error is then considered the partition with optimum input variables for flow rate forecast 80 of our data was used to train the models and 20 was used to test the models 3 6 valuation criteria for the deep learning models in this section four different evaluation criteria were used to evaluate the forecasting abilities of the different models and partitioned inputs of the models these criteria include the mean absolute error mae samadrita ghosh 2022 mean squared error mse samadrita ghosh 2022 root mean squared error rmse samadrita ghosh 2022 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mccuen et al 2006 respectively 7 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y ÀÜ i 8 mse 1 n i 1 n y i y ÀÜ i 2 9 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y ÀÜ i 2 10 n s e 1 i 1 n y i y ÀÜ i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i is the observed value y ÀÜ i the forecast value and y the mean of the observed value n represents the sample size 4 results 4 1 justification of window size input and horizon output we used a univariate dense model with window sizes and horizons of seven past days and a day ahead thirty past days and a day ahead and thirty past days and seven days ahead the choices of the window sizes and horizons are due to the evaluation of the interval for forecasting that is from short term one day to a week to medium term forecast one month these windows and horizons were evaluated using the dense model and the mae gives 61 68 m3 s 82 89 m3 s and 222 74 m3 s respectively the error increases with decreasing window size and increasing forecast horizon aligning with the findings of bogner et al 2019 therefore a window size of seven days and a day ahead forecast horizon were utilized for the three deep learning models 4 2 models results for multivariate time series forecast forecasting on the test data was done using three different models namely the dense model the conv1d model and the lstm model for univariate time series and the evaluation criteria were tested to choose the best model table 3 summarizes the results obtained from table 3 the dense model is the best with the minimum evaluation criteria followed by the lstm model and lastly the conv1d model fig 11 shows a plot of the forecast with the different models with an offset of 300 on the test data 4 3 multivariate prediction with different decomposed partition sets from the result in table 3 the dense model gave the best result for univariate time series the models were further used to forecast the flow rate using the different decomposed partitions of the multivariate time series forecast and the results are shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 the plots for the different partitions are shown in fig 12 fig 13 fig 14 fig 15 fig 16 and fig 17 the results of the evaluation criteria for these plots are shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 the bar plot of the evaluation criteria for mae and rmse for the three models with all the scenarios is depicted in fig 18 the evaluation criteria for each partition were measured as shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 the bar plot is shown in fig 18 since the mean square error is squared of the root mean square error we chose to leave out mse to best appreciate the difference in the partitions fig 1 fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 show a strong and predictable seasonality in the input data this strong seasonality can be seen from the results shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 when the random only seasonal only and trend only were used as scenarios the seasonal only scenario produced the least error among the three scenarios for all three models used this is in accord with the strong seasonality in the input components again the greatest mae of 49 849 m3 s for the dense model was obtained when the forecast was done without the seasonal term this strongly indicates the importance of the seasonal term for forecasting the song bengue flow rate the random or remainder component of the flow rate as shown in fig 10 b represents the stochasticity or the unexplained pattern in the time series forecasting the flow rate with the scenario of the random term produces an interesting result that is not too different from the result obtained with the trend only scenario as shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 this indicates the importance of the remainder term in the time series for the song bengue confluent the scenario of total decomposed data produces the best result for all three deep learning models as shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 this indicates the importance and correlation of all the decomposed variables in forecasting the song bengue confluent flow rate furthermore the scenario of total undecomposed data produced the next best result as such all the input data namely inflows outflows and precipitations are important for forecasting the flow rate of the confluent 5 discussion the article discusses the results of a study on forecasting the flow rate of song bengue using different sizes and horizons the study found that as the forecasting interval and window size increased the efficiency of the model for forecasting song bengue confluent decreased which aligns with the findings of bogner et al 2019 who studied the impact of window size and horizon on the efficiency of models the study also found that the deep models used in the study namely the dense model conv1d model and lstm model had a high coefficient of nse value greater than 0 9 indicating a very good fit according to nash and sutcliffe 1970 who defined nse model evaluation as 1 for a perfect fit and nse 0 75 as a very good fit this good fit is due to the choice of hyperparameters due to tuning and experimentation of the deep learning models sufficient training data and the suitable architecture of the models the study also found that the lowest error occurred when utilizing all decomposed variables as input emphasizing the importance of preprocessing input data for time series forecasting this is supported by the work of ghayekhloo et al 2015 who studied the impact of data preprocessing on time series forecasting jaramillo mor√°n et al 2021 who applied preprocessing tools for improving forecasting results by decomposing the time series into its trend and fluctuations and decomposition into intrinsic mode functions imf using empirical mode decomposition emd meydani et al 2022 who preprocessed data for reservoir inflow forecasting by downscaling raw precipitation and temperature forecast which increases the model accuracy for forecast and yousefi et al 2022 who used causal empirical decomposition to improve the model s efficiency for forecasting this study specifically used stl decomposition preprocessing due to its ability to treat data with strong seasonality the forecasting error for the daily flow rate forecast is shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 additionally the study found that the random component of the time series should not be disregarded as the least error occurred when all the components of the time series are used scenario of total decompose data as inputs into the forecasting model furthermore the study found that decomposing the input time series before using it as input for prediction reduces the prediction error the study also found that using univariate forecasting resulted in a larger mae than its multivariate counterpart overall the study highlights the importance of utilizing all components of time series data for forecasting and the benefits of preprocessing input data for time series forecasting of the song bengue confluent this is consistent with the findings of other studies in the field which have shown that preprocessing and including all components of a time series in the model can lead to improved forecasting results 6 conclusion in conclusion this study aimed at examining the flow rate of song bengue using different window sizes and horizons the results revealed that the forecasting efficiency decreased as the forecasting interval and window size increased which is in line with previous studies that have shown that models tend to become less efficient as the window size and horizon increase furthermore the study found that the deep learning models used had a high nse value of greater than 0 9 indicating a very good fit according to nash and sutcliffe additionally the study found that the lowest error occurred when utilizing all decomposed variables as input which highlights the importance of preprocessing input data for time series forecasting and the importance and correlation of these hydrological input data to forecast the flow rate of song bengue this is consistent with the findings of other studies in the field which have shown that preprocessing and including all components of a time series in the model can lead to improved forecasting results the study also found that using univariate forecasting for the deep models results in a larger error than their multivariate counterpart in forecasting the song bengue confluent flow rate the study also found that the random or remainder component of the time series should not be neglected as the least error occurred when all the decomposed components are used as input this study emphasizes the importance of including all components of time series data for forecasting and the benefits of preprocessing input data for time series forecasting this preprocessing method to improve model forecasting efficiency is proposed but we acknowledge the limitations of the deep learning models due to uncertainty analysis applying ensemble learning to each decomposed

7741,study region zhangjiakou competition zone zjk cz of the beijing olympic winter games study focus under the extreme uncertainty of future climate change scenarios a system solution capable of snow depth forecasting is urgently needed for the sustainable use of olympic winter games venues and the regular organization of winter sports in the post winter olympic era this study predicts the snow depth distribution and changes in the zjk cz of the beijing olympic winter games for the next 30 years utilizing the gbehm geomorphology based ecohydrological model model together with cmip6 climate forecast model data and analyzes the operation and profitability of the zjk cz in the post winter olympic era new hydrological insights for the region this study developed a new integrated simulation methodology for the climate risk assessment of olympic winter games venues in the context of future climate change the percent bias of the snow depth simulated based on the new integrated model was found to be only 3 in the next 30 years the zjk cz will need to be replenished with at least 190 mm of artificial snow annually to meet the minimum standards for suitable winter sports days and requires an average of at least 49 days of artificially assisted snowmaking per year to ensure proper operation and profitability this study is expected to provide a climate risk assessment for the construction and operation of winter sports venues graphical abstract ga1 keywords snow depth olympic winter games winter sports artificial snowmaking data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction natural snow simulation is an essential guide for constructing olympic winter games venues and snow depth is undoubtedly the central natural factor affecting the proper realization of winter sports the climate risk assessment of winter sports venue operations mainly relies on snow distribution and snow depth in the context of climate change the ability of winter sports venues to operate appropriately and profitably requires real time forecasting of snow depth data tervo 2008 in addition climate risk assessment of existing winter sports venues in the future will create higher requirements for the real time forecasting of long time series snow depth hennessy et al 2008 under the climate change scenario of global warming snow cover distribution and snow depth will decrease rapidly thus whether most olympic winter games venues will remain suitable for winter sports in the next 30 years is a hot topic fang et al 2021 snow conditions in olympic winter games zone are often monitored in three ways station monitoring breiling and charamza 1999 remote sensing monitoring de jong and barth 2008 and numerical model monitoring fran√ßois et al 2014 scott et al 2003 steiger 2010 station monitoring can obtain real time temperature precipitation and wind speed data for snow depth forecasting wang et al 2020 but tracking spatial distribution is limited and future long term predictions cannot be realized remote sensing involves monitoring snow conditions at the olympic winter games zone to obtain continuous changes in snow depth at a spatial scale however this type of monitoring is also affected by clouds resulting in missing monitoring data likewise remote monitoring is unavailable for the future forecasting of snow depths in olympic winter games zone the numerical model can assimilate real time station observations and remote sensing observations to simulate the snow depth of the olympic winter games zone on a large spatial scale and perform long term forecasting of the snow depth of the olympic winter games zone together with climate forecast model data there are two general methods used for numerical model monitoring data driven models and process based models data driven models mainly include statistical linear models and non linear models statistical linear models are relatively simple and often based on temperature and precipitation information observed from weather stations to establish a linear regression equation with snow depth thereby predicting snow depth variation breiling and charamza 1999 non linear methods represented by machine learning models or non linear statistical models are also commonly used to estimate snow depth yang et al 2020 2022 yu et al 2022 process based models consider the snow energy balance process and snow accumulation melting process in detail which can more accurately simulate the snow depth changes in the olympic winter games zone gilaberte b√∫rdalo et al 2017 marks et al 1999 however the most commonly used snow melting models and snow energy balance models only consider the snow melting process snow accumulation process and snow energy balance process in detail and lack careful consideration of meteorological conditions and land surface process conditions hendrikx and hreinsson 2012 hendrikx et al 2013 in addition some hybrid models based on deep learning methods such as lstm alo yuan et al 2018 anfis gbo adnan et al 2022b elm psogwo adnan et al 2021 lssvm imvo ikram et al 2022b svr samoa adnan et al 2022a ann empa ikram et al 2022c and elm crfoa ikram et al 2022a have been widely used for time series modeling and forecasting however these models are mostly used for agricultural and environmental forecasting thus forecasting for snow parameters needs to be explored more deeply in the context of climate change most ski resorts normally cannot operate without artificially assisted snowfall earlier studies suggested that a ski area could only work successfully if the snow depth exceeded 300 mm for at least 100 days in a calendar year abegg 1996 2007 with the continuous advancement of artificially assisted snowfall technology the successful operation of winter sports venues has come to depend more on artificial snowfall in addition to natural snowfall artificial snowmaking is not dependent on weather conditions which makes the snowmaking process more flexible and easier to quantify importantly artificially assisted snowfall can significantly reduce the impact of climate change risks on the regular operation of ski resorts currently skisim1 0 scott et al 2003 and skisim2 steiger 2010 are widely used models for assessing the climate risks of ski resorts considering both natural snowfall processes and artificial snowmaking processes in general by simulating and forecasting the snow depths generated by natural snowfall it is possible to quantitatively estimate the amount of artificial snowmaking required for the regular operation of winter sports competition zones from the opposite side however although most current climate risk assessment models for winter sports venues consider the artificially assisted snowfall process simulation of the natural snowfall process is relatively imperfect and the process for defining the parameters is overly complicated which affects the accuracy of the evaluation results for the climate risk of winter sports venues in the context of climate change open questions worthy of further study include whether existing olympic winter games venues can be used sustainably and whether the climate risk assessment method based on a physical snow model can provide a theoretical reference for the sustainable operation of global winter sports venues in this study the gbehm model yang et al 2015 for which our team participated in theory development and key code construction was used as the basic simulation tool this model uses multi source remote sensing data to calibrate its parameters additionally we incorporated a single snowmelt path tracking algorithm and a blowing snow algorithm into the model li et al 2019 which made the model very suitable for snow process simulations in the alpine region in addition the model uses the heat and water balance method to simulate the snow accumulation process which has good accuracy in forecasting snow depth under this background we used the gbehm model combined with the statistical downscaled nex gddp cmip6 dataset to carry out a real time simulation of the snow depth in the zjk cz of the beijing olympic winter games and predict the temporal and spatial variation in the characteristics of snow depth in zjk cz from 2021 to 2050 based on the snow depth and economic indicators for hosting winter sports this paper comprehensively evaluates the climate risk for the zjk cz of the beijing olympic winter games over the next 30 years this study also analyzes the zone s operation and profitability conditions in the post winter olympic era 2 research region and data 2 1 research region the xxiv olympic winter games were held in beijing china this study used the zjk cz one of the venues for the 2022 olympic winter games in beijing as the research region fig 1 the zhangjiakou includes three competition venues the genting snow park gsp national cross country skiing center nccsc and national ski jumping center nsjc the gsp covers an area of 1 192 km¬≤ at an altitude of 2042 m and is the venue for aerials halfpipe moguls slopestyle cross and parallel giant slalom in both snowboard and freestyle skiing the nccsc covers an area of 1 06 km¬≤ at an altitude of 1721 m and mainly hosted the cross country and nordic combined events of the beijing 2022 olympic winter games the nsjc covers an area of 0 024 km¬≤ with an altitude of 1771 5 m and is the venue for ski jumping events the elevation of the research region ranges between 1280 and 2161 m and the snow season encompasses november december january and february 2 2 data 2 2 1 station observation data in this study we obtained detailed meteorological station observations around the three venues of nccsc gsp and nsjc in zjk cz the temporal resolution of the meteorological observation data was 1 h and the period ranged from january 1 2018 to december 31 2021 detailed information about the meteorological observation station is provided in table 1 the station observation data are mainly used for the accuracy evaluation and availability analysis of the gbehm model these data includes explicit longwave radiation flux shortwave radiation flux 2 m wind speed temperature precipitation relative humidity atmospheric pressure and snow depth observed by meteorological stations and automatic weather stations table 2 2 2 2 nex gddp cmip6 dataset the core driving data for snow depth forecast in winter sports venues based on the gbehm model were provided by nex gddp cmip6 nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections thrasher et al 2022 the nex gddp cmip6 dataset was generated via statistical downscaling methods combining cmip6 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 and gcm general circulation model eyring et al 2016 o neill et al 2016 this method provides a global high resolution bias corrected climate forecast dataset suitable for climate change related studies at a regional scale the nex gddp cmip6 was bias corrected using gmfd global meteorological forcing dataset historical data thrasher et al 2022 the nex gddp cmip6 dataset mainly includes surface downwelling shortwave radiation surface downwelling longwave radiation near surface relative humidity near surface specific humidity precipitation near surface air temperature and near surface wind speed data the variables of the nex gddp cmip6 dataset are introduced in table 3 in this study we selected canesm5 canadian earth system model version 5 model data which perform relatively well on the nex gddp cmip6 dataset in the northern hemisphere as driving data for the gbehm model to predict future snow depth changes in the study area jin et al 2022 3 methodology 3 1 construction of a snow depth forecasting model for the olympic winter games zone in this study a modified gbehm li et al 2019 was used to simulate the snow accumulation and melting process and then simulate and predict the snow depth distribution the gbehm model integrates the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm yang et al 2002 the common land model colm dai et al 2003 the community land model clm oleson et al 2004 the wind blowing snow model and the snow ice and aerosol radiative snicar model flanner et al 2021 this model can simulate glaciers melting and freezing processes as well as snow permafrost vegetation growth rivers and stream flow in the gbehm model snow accumulation and melting are based on the snow mass and energy balance principle in addition the wind blowing snow process is creatively coupled in the gbehm model for the snow mass and energy balance which makes the model simulate the snow depth variation of natural snowfall more accurately and credibly in this study we use the nex gddp cmip6 dataset processed by the statistical downscaling method as the base driving data of the gbehm model we also combine dem data soil data and land use data to simulate the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of snow depth in the zjk cz from 2021 to 2050 the gbehm model uses a daily temporal resolution for input and output data and a spatial resolution of 25 km 3 2 evaluation indicators for the suitability of venues for the olympic winter games in the context of climate change the leading climatic suitability indicator for assessing the venues for the olympic winter games is a minimum snow depth greater than or equal to 300 mm scott et al 2019 2015 in the post winter olympic era olympic winter games venues will host more winter sports events and even be open to the public studies have found that olympic winter games venues can operate normally and profitably when snow depths are greater than 300 mm for more than 60 days scott et al 2003 steiger 2011 based on the above indicators we forecast the climate risk for the regular operation of the three winter sports venues in the zjk cz of the beijing olympic winter games in the next 30 years and assess whether these venues will be able to hold winter sports generally in the post winter olympic era in this study we defined two evaluation indicators with the following methods the gbehm model calculates the daily snow depth distribution of the zjk cz suppose the daily average snow depth generated by natural snowfall of the venues is greater than or equal to 300 mm in that case the olympic winter games zone is considered suitable for holding winter sports on that day and we define this day as a suitable winter sports day swsd otherwise it is an unsuitable winter sports day uwsd thus the snow depth indicator d d a y for determining the suitability of the olympic winter venues for winter sports can be defined by the following equation 1 d d a y n s w s d s d 300 m m n u w s d s d 300 m m where s d is the average snow depth mm simulated via the gbehm model combined with the nex gddp cmip6 dataset n s w s d is a suitable winter sports day and n u w s d is an unsuitable winter sports day the total swsd in a calendar year for the research region was calculated based on the evaluation indicator determined in eq 1 when the total number of swsd is greater than or equal to 60 days we consider that the olympic winter games zone can operate normally and profitably only by relying on natural snowfall the number of days of olympic winter games zone operations p n can be expressed as 2 p n i 1 n n s w s d n 0 366 n n where n is the days if p n 60 then the olympic winter games zone can operate normally and profitably if p n 60 then the olympic winter games zone is not profitable the average snow depth s d mm in eq 1 can be directly output from the gbehm model 4 results 4 1 accuracy validation of the snow depth simulated by the gbehm model the model was tested separately at snow observation points at different elevations within the competition zone and the simulation results were compared with the measured snow depth the results show that the simulated snow depth at stations b1628 b1629 and b1630 agrees with the observed snow depth fig 2 here the overall rmse root mean square error of the simulated snow depth at the three sites remains around 57 1 mm the nrmse normalized root mean square error is 0 10 the mae mean absolute error is 0 16 mm and the pbias percent bias is only 3 the average values of r pearson s correlation coefficient r¬≤ coefficient of determination and nse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for the three sites reached 0 96 0 93 and 0 89 respectively the model better simulates the snow accumulation and melting process at b1628 b1629 and b1630 fig 2 table 4 including snowfall accumulation new snow compaction and snow sublimation which are essential for further snow forecasting in the competition zone the modeled snow depth and measured snow depth also show many inconsistencies one important reason is that the precipitation data may not match the actual situation one part of this inconsistency is precipitation observation instrument bias the other part of the more significant precipitation inconsistency comes from artificial snowmaking in addition another reason for the error between the modeled snow depth and observed snow depth is that the snowfall data used in the model are derived from snowfall instrument measurements with significant inconsistency between snowfall measurements and snow depth measurements the most likely explanation for this inconsistency is that large scale artificial snowfall occurred in the competition zone at the same time the snow depth observed by the snow observation station was artificially protected or cleared overall the gbehm model has high accuracy in simulating snow depth generated by natural snowfall and can be used to simulate and predict snow depth in the olympic winter games zone 4 2 temporal and spatial variation of predicted snow depth 4 2 1 temporal and spatial variation of snow depth in zjk cz in the next 30 years according to the weather station s measured snow depth data the snow season in the zjk cz is mainly distributed in the four months of january february november and december the simulated snow depth distribution based on the nex gddp cmip6 dataset also shows this characteristic fig 3 using the snow depth forecast of the zjk cz in 2022 we found that the monthly average snow depth in january 2022 is the largest while november has the shallowest snow depth with most areas below 70 mm regarding spatial distribution the interannual snow depth forecast results fig 4 for the zjk cz show that the annual average snow depth is larger in 2031 2035 and 2036 and the snow depth in most regions exceeds 200 mm the annual average snow depth in 2021 2032 2042 and 2046 is the smallest and the annual average snow depth is less than 50 mm based on the time series distribution pattern of snow depth in the next 30 years the snow depth distribution in the zjk cz is highly uneven the annual average snow depth is negligible in most years based on the spatial distribution characteristics of snow depth we find that most years do not meet the conditions for holding winter sports only by relying on natural snowfall 4 2 2 temporal and spatial changes of snow depth in nccsc gsp and nsjc olympic winter games venues in the next 30 years the snow depth generated by natural snowfall at the nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz over the next 30 years has a generally similar pattern of variation i e the snow depth is usually low in most years and generally shows a trend of decreasing fluctuations fig 5 overall the annual average snow depth of gsp is greater than that of nccsc and nsjc while the annual average snow depth and variation characteristics of nccsc and nsjc are the same the annual average snow depth at the nccsc gsp and nsjc is less than 100 mm per year except for fluctuating increases in 2031 and 2035 the annual average snow depth at the gsp exceeds 300 mm only in 2031 and 2035 reaching 319 24 and 404 51 mm respectively while it does not exceed 300 mm in any other calendar year the year 2042 has the smallest annual average snow depth of 32 51 mm the annual average snow depth of nccsc and nsjc does not exceed 300 mm in all years between 2021 and 2050 the nccsc has the largest annual average snow depth of 273 87 mm in 2035 and the smallest annual average snow depth of 20 45 mm in 2042 the nsjc has the largest annual average snow depth of 297 43 mm in 2035 and the smallest annual average snow depth of 22 30 mm in 2042 based on the mann kendall trend test method we analyzed the overall variation trend of annual average snow depth from 2021 to 2050 for the nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz table 5 the changing trend test values of nccsc gsp and nsjc are 2 07 1 96 and 2 11 respectively and the snow depth of the three venues shows a significant decreasing trend in the next 30 years with a continuous reduction of snow cover in the northern hemisphere the snow depth in the zjk cz will also gradually decline as the main venue of winter sports it is impossible to operate normally only by relying on natural snowfall artificial snowfall should be considered the primary auxiliary means 4 3 forecast of suitable winter sports day in zjk cz based on the minimum snow depth criterion of 300 mm for swsd defined in the method section we forecast the days to meet the swsd indicators for the nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz between 2021 and 2050 fig 6 the snow depth predicted by the gbehm model shows that the calendar years with swsd in the nccsc are 2022 2027 2028 2029 2031 2035 2036 2037 and 2041 the years with swsd for the gsp are 2022 2025 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2034 2035 2036 2037 2041 and 2043 the years with swsd in the nsjc are 2022 2027 2028 2029 2031 2035 2036 2037 and 2041 overall the snow depth in nccsc gsp and nsjc did not meet the swsd minimum snow depth standards for most calendar years between 2021 and 2050 for the entire zjk cz the calendar years with the swsd minimum snow depth indicator of 300 mm in most regions are 2022 2027 2028 2029 2031 2035 2036 2037 and 2041 in these calendar years winter sports events can usually be held depending on natural snowfall alone fig 7 in 2025 2030 2034 2043 and 2044 only a tiny portion of the zjk cz meets the swsd minimum snow depth standard of 300 mm in 2021 2023 2024 2026 2032 2033 2038 2039 2040 2042 2045 2046 2047 2048 2049 and 2050 all regions of the zjk cz do not meet the swsd standard and cannot operate winter sports events when only considering natural snowfall in particular between 2044 and 2050 the snow cover in the zjk cz will decrease significantly the entire region cannot meet the snow cover conditions for winter sports events in all calendar years when only natural snowfall is considered overall in the context of climate change the zjk cz will not be able to typically host winter sports events by relying solely on natural snowfall for most of the calendar years in the next 30 years 4 4 forecast of the lowest profitable swsd for the olympic winter games zone the snow depth forecast of the olympic winter games zone is a reference value for the regular operation of venues during the olympic winter games and a significant reference value for whether the olympic winter games can still hold regular winter sports events in the post winter olympic era in the post winter olympic era it remains uncertain whether the olympic winter games zone can be profitable after undertaking various winter sports events and opening them to the public based on the minimum profitability standard for winter sports venues proposed in the methodology section we analyzed the operability and profitability of nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz between 2021 and 2050 fig 8 the analysis results show that with only natural snowfall the nccsc gsp and nsjc will only meet the profitability conditions in 2035 in 2036 only gsp venues meet the requirements for profitability except for 2035 and 2036 in any other years between 2021 and 2050 nccsc gsp and nsjc were not found to meet the profitability conditions when they relied solely on natural snowfall if the zjk cz maintains a minimum profitability standard for winter sports venues over the next 30 years artificial snowfall will be required as a supplement in most calendar years 5 discussion previous studies mainly focused on the use of empirical and numerical models for the evaluation methods of winter sports venues climate risk and operational profitability empirical models focus on assessing the climate risk and operating profitability of winter sports venues using a linear relationship between meteorological observation data and the length of the winter sports season as in this study the risk assessment index used in most studies is snow depth climate risk studies of ski resorts in the european region consider that the criterion for a winter sports venue to operate appropriately and profitably is the number of days in a calendar year when the snow depth exceeds 300 mm for at least 100 days abegg 2007 in this study we used a minimum profitability criterion of 60 or more days of snow depth over 300 mm for assessing the profitability of the nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz over the next 30 years taking into account the snow distribution and population economics characteristics of china another method for evaluating the climatic riskiness of winter sports venues is numerical simulation a more reliable method is the skisim2 model which combines natural snowfall and artificial snowmaking steiger 2010 the results of a study combining cmip5 data and the skisim2 model show that the only places with low climate risk for global winter sports venues under a high emission scenario are calgary canada salt lake city usa albertville france and beijing china scott et al 2019 similarly our results indicate that the zjk cz will remain suitable for winter sports in the next 30 years considering artificially assisted snowmaking snow depth is undoubtedly the most important parameter in the climate risk assessment of winter sports venues and its accuracy directly determines the reliability of the assessment results the station data satellite remote sensing data and reanalysis data commonly used for snow depth measurements are not suitable for forecasting the riskiness of winter sports venues in the context of climate change moreover the accuracy of existing snow depth products on a regional scale is still not satisfactory a study on the accurate evaluation of smmr data found that the maximum percentage bias between smmr snow depth and real snow depth can reach 30 tait and armstrong 1996 while our simulated snow depth percent bias is only 3 there remains great uncertainty in the snow depth measured using reanalysis data with great differences found among the data etchevers et al 2004 rutter et al 2009 combining the land surface process model and the snow process model based on strict physical mechanisms we achieved a more accurate simulation and prediction of snow distribution characteristics thus ensuring the stability of snow depth in the long time series simulation unlike traditional climate risk assessment methods for winter sports venues we introduced an earth system model with a more detailed physical mechanism into the assessment scheme of climate risk and operation planning for winter sports venues the new integrated model assessment scheme has the advantages of clear physical processes high stability and real time forecasting when assessing the climate riskiness of snow and ice sports venues on a regional scale to further explore the importance of snow depth forecasting for climate riskiness and the operational profitability assessment of winter sports venues in the context of climate change we discuss the reference significance of snow depth forecasting for artificial snowfall and analyze the reference significance of swsd forecasting for the regular operation and profitability of winter sports venues respectively 5 1 the reference significance of snow depth forecasting for artificial snowfall the regular operation of winter sports venues is often not entirely dependent on natural snowfall in the context of global warming temperatures are rising snowfall is decreasing in most regions of the world and the snow depth supplemented by natural snowfall cannot support winter sports but needs to be augmented by widespread artificially assisted snowmaking the forecasting of snow depth produced by natural snowfall can also provide a reference for artificially assisted snowmaking in another way based on the minimum snow depth indicator of 300 mm for a suitable winter sports day the minimum snow depth of artificially assisted snowmaking required to supplement the winter sports venues can be expressed as minimum artificial snowmaking snow depth 300 mm natural snowfall snow depth the zjk cz s nccsc gsp and nsjc will properly require artificially assisted snowmaking to host winter sports events for the next 30 years fig 9 in 2035 the least amount of artificially assisted snowmaking is required with an annual average snow depth of 17 mm the largest amount of artificially assisted snowmaking will be needed in 2042 requiring an annual average artificial snowfall snow depth of 275 mm 5 2 the reference significance of swsd forecasting for the profitability assessment of winter sports venues in section 4 4 we found that the regular operation and profitability of the nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz in all calendar years except 2035 will require artificially assisted snowmaking based on the profitable snow depth indicators for the olympic winter games venues defined in the methodology section the minimum number of days requiring artificially assisted snowmaking in each calendar year for the nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz to meet regular operation and profitability standards can be expressed as minimum artificial snowfall days 60 swsd days the forecast results show that for the nccsc gsp and nsjc venues to be in normal operating and profitable condition for each year between 2021 and 2050 an average of at least 49 days of artificially assisted snowmaking per year would be required to make up for the lack of natural snowfall fig 10 nccsc gsp and nsjc need at least 60 days of artificially assisted snowmaking in most calendar years to ensure regular operation and profitability 5 3 limitations and uncertainties this study found that the snow depth in the zjk cz showed a significant decreasing trend in the next 30 years fig 5 and that the decrease in snow depth will cause a significant reduction in swsd the reason for this result is that under the background of global warming the temperature at the regional scale is bound to increase arias et al 2021 and an increase in temperature is one of the critical factors causing the decrease in snow depth guo et al 2021 leading to the reduction of swsd in zjk cz however in the context of future climate change there is also significant uncertainty in the forecast of temperature snowfall and snow depth in the zjk cz as a general rule an increase in snowfall snow cover days and snow depth will increase swsd conversely under global warming the decrease in snowfall snow cover days and snow depth will inevitably lead to a reduction of swsd in this study we did not consider future snow depth forecasts in multiple models so we could not accurately determine the detailed impact of climate change on snow depth and swsd forecasts which is one of the uncertainties in this study another uncertainty is that this study did not calibrate the model driven data nex gddp cmip6 and we did not decomposition methods to deal with data noise which may cause uncertainty in the accuracy of the model simulated snow depth in addition population economy traffic and other factors affect the swsd forecast deng et al 2019 however we did not consider these factors and their sensitivities to swsd forecasts in detail in this study which is an important limitation of this study for future swsd forecasting 6 conclusions in this study we used the gbehm model with a strict snow mass and energy balance mechanism combined with downscaled cmip6 climate model forecast data nex gddp cmip6 dataset to forecast the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of snow depth in the zjk cz of the beijing olympic winter games and analyze the climate risk of the area s regular operation in the context of climate change the validation of snow depth data based on weather station observations shows that the gbehm model has high accuracy in simulating snow depth and is suitable for long time series snow depth forecasting our study indicates that the area will experience a severe shortage of snow depth from natural snowfall over the next 30 years to support winter sports events the three venues of nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz are limited in the number of their swsd days per year when considering only natural snowfall and cannot meet the requirements of standard operation to be profitable the years with swsd for the zjk cz are 2022 2025 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2034 2035 2036 2037 2041 and 2043 during the period 2021 2050 under natural snowfall conditions only 2035 and 2036 meet the minimum normal profitability standards for the zjk cz our research also found that if the zjk cz seeks to achieve regular operation and profitability in the next 30 years it will need at least 49 days of artificially assisted snowmaking per year on average and the annual average artificial snow production cannot be less than 190 mm this study considers the snow hydrological processes and snow mass and energy balance processes that affect snow depth variation in detail making the snow depth forecasting of winter sports venues more accurate and reasonable the research thus has essential reference value in determining the requirements for holding the olympic winter games at the same time the study can provide guiding recommendations for the regular operation of winter sports venues in the post winter olympic era in addition the forecast of snow depth from natural snowfall can also guide and predict the amount of artificial snow production this study is based on a single case swsd simulation analysis so further research is needed for swsd forecasting in other regions in addition the results of this study do not apply to the climate risk assessment of winter sports venues with large scale and multi factor comprehensive effects credit authorship contribution statement donghang

7741,study region zhangjiakou competition zone zjk cz of the beijing olympic winter games study focus under the extreme uncertainty of future climate change scenarios a system solution capable of snow depth forecasting is urgently needed for the sustainable use of olympic winter games venues and the regular organization of winter sports in the post winter olympic era this study predicts the snow depth distribution and changes in the zjk cz of the beijing olympic winter games for the next 30 years utilizing the gbehm geomorphology based ecohydrological model model together with cmip6 climate forecast model data and analyzes the operation and profitability of the zjk cz in the post winter olympic era new hydrological insights for the region this study developed a new integrated simulation methodology for the climate risk assessment of olympic winter games venues in the context of future climate change the percent bias of the snow depth simulated based on the new integrated model was found to be only 3 in the next 30 years the zjk cz will need to be replenished with at least 190 mm of artificial snow annually to meet the minimum standards for suitable winter sports days and requires an average of at least 49 days of artificially assisted snowmaking per year to ensure proper operation and profitability this study is expected to provide a climate risk assessment for the construction and operation of winter sports venues graphical abstract ga1 keywords snow depth olympic winter games winter sports artificial snowmaking data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction natural snow simulation is an essential guide for constructing olympic winter games venues and snow depth is undoubtedly the central natural factor affecting the proper realization of winter sports the climate risk assessment of winter sports venue operations mainly relies on snow distribution and snow depth in the context of climate change the ability of winter sports venues to operate appropriately and profitably requires real time forecasting of snow depth data tervo 2008 in addition climate risk assessment of existing winter sports venues in the future will create higher requirements for the real time forecasting of long time series snow depth hennessy et al 2008 under the climate change scenario of global warming snow cover distribution and snow depth will decrease rapidly thus whether most olympic winter games venues will remain suitable for winter sports in the next 30 years is a hot topic fang et al 2021 snow conditions in olympic winter games zone are often monitored in three ways station monitoring breiling and charamza 1999 remote sensing monitoring de jong and barth 2008 and numerical model monitoring fran√ßois et al 2014 scott et al 2003 steiger 2010 station monitoring can obtain real time temperature precipitation and wind speed data for snow depth forecasting wang et al 2020 but tracking spatial distribution is limited and future long term predictions cannot be realized remote sensing involves monitoring snow conditions at the olympic winter games zone to obtain continuous changes in snow depth at a spatial scale however this type of monitoring is also affected by clouds resulting in missing monitoring data likewise remote monitoring is unavailable for the future forecasting of snow depths in olympic winter games zone the numerical model can assimilate real time station observations and remote sensing observations to simulate the snow depth of the olympic winter games zone on a large spatial scale and perform long term forecasting of the snow depth of the olympic winter games zone together with climate forecast model data there are two general methods used for numerical model monitoring data driven models and process based models data driven models mainly include statistical linear models and non linear models statistical linear models are relatively simple and often based on temperature and precipitation information observed from weather stations to establish a linear regression equation with snow depth thereby predicting snow depth variation breiling and charamza 1999 non linear methods represented by machine learning models or non linear statistical models are also commonly used to estimate snow depth yang et al 2020 2022 yu et al 2022 process based models consider the snow energy balance process and snow accumulation melting process in detail which can more accurately simulate the snow depth changes in the olympic winter games zone gilaberte b√∫rdalo et al 2017 marks et al 1999 however the most commonly used snow melting models and snow energy balance models only consider the snow melting process snow accumulation process and snow energy balance process in detail and lack careful consideration of meteorological conditions and land surface process conditions hendrikx and hreinsson 2012 hendrikx et al 2013 in addition some hybrid models based on deep learning methods such as lstm alo yuan et al 2018 anfis gbo adnan et al 2022b elm psogwo adnan et al 2021 lssvm imvo ikram et al 2022b svr samoa adnan et al 2022a ann empa ikram et al 2022c and elm crfoa ikram et al 2022a have been widely used for time series modeling and forecasting however these models are mostly used for agricultural and environmental forecasting thus forecasting for snow parameters needs to be explored more deeply in the context of climate change most ski resorts normally cannot operate without artificially assisted snowfall earlier studies suggested that a ski area could only work successfully if the snow depth exceeded 300 mm for at least 100 days in a calendar year abegg 1996 2007 with the continuous advancement of artificially assisted snowfall technology the successful operation of winter sports venues has come to depend more on artificial snowfall in addition to natural snowfall artificial snowmaking is not dependent on weather conditions which makes the snowmaking process more flexible and easier to quantify importantly artificially assisted snowfall can significantly reduce the impact of climate change risks on the regular operation of ski resorts currently skisim1 0 scott et al 2003 and skisim2 steiger 2010 are widely used models for assessing the climate risks of ski resorts considering both natural snowfall processes and artificial snowmaking processes in general by simulating and forecasting the snow depths generated by natural snowfall it is possible to quantitatively estimate the amount of artificial snowmaking required for the regular operation of winter sports competition zones from the opposite side however although most current climate risk assessment models for winter sports venues consider the artificially assisted snowfall process simulation of the natural snowfall process is relatively imperfect and the process for defining the parameters is overly complicated which affects the accuracy of the evaluation results for the climate risk of winter sports venues in the context of climate change open questions worthy of further study include whether existing olympic winter games venues can be used sustainably and whether the climate risk assessment method based on a physical snow model can provide a theoretical reference for the sustainable operation of global winter sports venues in this study the gbehm model yang et al 2015 for which our team participated in theory development and key code construction was used as the basic simulation tool this model uses multi source remote sensing data to calibrate its parameters additionally we incorporated a single snowmelt path tracking algorithm and a blowing snow algorithm into the model li et al 2019 which made the model very suitable for snow process simulations in the alpine region in addition the model uses the heat and water balance method to simulate the snow accumulation process which has good accuracy in forecasting snow depth under this background we used the gbehm model combined with the statistical downscaled nex gddp cmip6 dataset to carry out a real time simulation of the snow depth in the zjk cz of the beijing olympic winter games and predict the temporal and spatial variation in the characteristics of snow depth in zjk cz from 2021 to 2050 based on the snow depth and economic indicators for hosting winter sports this paper comprehensively evaluates the climate risk for the zjk cz of the beijing olympic winter games over the next 30 years this study also analyzes the zone s operation and profitability conditions in the post winter olympic era 2 research region and data 2 1 research region the xxiv olympic winter games were held in beijing china this study used the zjk cz one of the venues for the 2022 olympic winter games in beijing as the research region fig 1 the zhangjiakou includes three competition venues the genting snow park gsp national cross country skiing center nccsc and national ski jumping center nsjc the gsp covers an area of 1 192 km¬≤ at an altitude of 2042 m and is the venue for aerials halfpipe moguls slopestyle cross and parallel giant slalom in both snowboard and freestyle skiing the nccsc covers an area of 1 06 km¬≤ at an altitude of 1721 m and mainly hosted the cross country and nordic combined events of the beijing 2022 olympic winter games the nsjc covers an area of 0 024 km¬≤ with an altitude of 1771 5 m and is the venue for ski jumping events the elevation of the research region ranges between 1280 and 2161 m and the snow season encompasses november december january and february 2 2 data 2 2 1 station observation data in this study we obtained detailed meteorological station observations around the three venues of nccsc gsp and nsjc in zjk cz the temporal resolution of the meteorological observation data was 1 h and the period ranged from january 1 2018 to december 31 2021 detailed information about the meteorological observation station is provided in table 1 the station observation data are mainly used for the accuracy evaluation and availability analysis of the gbehm model these data includes explicit longwave radiation flux shortwave radiation flux 2 m wind speed temperature precipitation relative humidity atmospheric pressure and snow depth observed by meteorological stations and automatic weather stations table 2 2 2 2 nex gddp cmip6 dataset the core driving data for snow depth forecast in winter sports venues based on the gbehm model were provided by nex gddp cmip6 nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections thrasher et al 2022 the nex gddp cmip6 dataset was generated via statistical downscaling methods combining cmip6 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 and gcm general circulation model eyring et al 2016 o neill et al 2016 this method provides a global high resolution bias corrected climate forecast dataset suitable for climate change related studies at a regional scale the nex gddp cmip6 was bias corrected using gmfd global meteorological forcing dataset historical data thrasher et al 2022 the nex gddp cmip6 dataset mainly includes surface downwelling shortwave radiation surface downwelling longwave radiation near surface relative humidity near surface specific humidity precipitation near surface air temperature and near surface wind speed data the variables of the nex gddp cmip6 dataset are introduced in table 3 in this study we selected canesm5 canadian earth system model version 5 model data which perform relatively well on the nex gddp cmip6 dataset in the northern hemisphere as driving data for the gbehm model to predict future snow depth changes in the study area jin et al 2022 3 methodology 3 1 construction of a snow depth forecasting model for the olympic winter games zone in this study a modified gbehm li et al 2019 was used to simulate the snow accumulation and melting process and then simulate and predict the snow depth distribution the gbehm model integrates the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm yang et al 2002 the common land model colm dai et al 2003 the community land model clm oleson et al 2004 the wind blowing snow model and the snow ice and aerosol radiative snicar model flanner et al 2021 this model can simulate glaciers melting and freezing processes as well as snow permafrost vegetation growth rivers and stream flow in the gbehm model snow accumulation and melting are based on the snow mass and energy balance principle in addition the wind blowing snow process is creatively coupled in the gbehm model for the snow mass and energy balance which makes the model simulate the snow depth variation of natural snowfall more accurately and credibly in this study we use the nex gddp cmip6 dataset processed by the statistical downscaling method as the base driving data of the gbehm model we also combine dem data soil data and land use data to simulate the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of snow depth in the zjk cz from 2021 to 2050 the gbehm model uses a daily temporal resolution for input and output data and a spatial resolution of 25 km 3 2 evaluation indicators for the suitability of venues for the olympic winter games in the context of climate change the leading climatic suitability indicator for assessing the venues for the olympic winter games is a minimum snow depth greater than or equal to 300 mm scott et al 2019 2015 in the post winter olympic era olympic winter games venues will host more winter sports events and even be open to the public studies have found that olympic winter games venues can operate normally and profitably when snow depths are greater than 300 mm for more than 60 days scott et al 2003 steiger 2011 based on the above indicators we forecast the climate risk for the regular operation of the three winter sports venues in the zjk cz of the beijing olympic winter games in the next 30 years and assess whether these venues will be able to hold winter sports generally in the post winter olympic era in this study we defined two evaluation indicators with the following methods the gbehm model calculates the daily snow depth distribution of the zjk cz suppose the daily average snow depth generated by natural snowfall of the venues is greater than or equal to 300 mm in that case the olympic winter games zone is considered suitable for holding winter sports on that day and we define this day as a suitable winter sports day swsd otherwise it is an unsuitable winter sports day uwsd thus the snow depth indicator d d a y for determining the suitability of the olympic winter venues for winter sports can be defined by the following equation 1 d d a y n s w s d s d 300 m m n u w s d s d 300 m m where s d is the average snow depth mm simulated via the gbehm model combined with the nex gddp cmip6 dataset n s w s d is a suitable winter sports day and n u w s d is an unsuitable winter sports day the total swsd in a calendar year for the research region was calculated based on the evaluation indicator determined in eq 1 when the total number of swsd is greater than or equal to 60 days we consider that the olympic winter games zone can operate normally and profitably only by relying on natural snowfall the number of days of olympic winter games zone operations p n can be expressed as 2 p n i 1 n n s w s d n 0 366 n n where n is the days if p n 60 then the olympic winter games zone can operate normally and profitably if p n 60 then the olympic winter games zone is not profitable the average snow depth s d mm in eq 1 can be directly output from the gbehm model 4 results 4 1 accuracy validation of the snow depth simulated by the gbehm model the model was tested separately at snow observation points at different elevations within the competition zone and the simulation results were compared with the measured snow depth the results show that the simulated snow depth at stations b1628 b1629 and b1630 agrees with the observed snow depth fig 2 here the overall rmse root mean square error of the simulated snow depth at the three sites remains around 57 1 mm the nrmse normalized root mean square error is 0 10 the mae mean absolute error is 0 16 mm and the pbias percent bias is only 3 the average values of r pearson s correlation coefficient r¬≤ coefficient of determination and nse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for the three sites reached 0 96 0 93 and 0 89 respectively the model better simulates the snow accumulation and melting process at b1628 b1629 and b1630 fig 2 table 4 including snowfall accumulation new snow compaction and snow sublimation which are essential for further snow forecasting in the competition zone the modeled snow depth and measured snow depth also show many inconsistencies one important reason is that the precipitation data may not match the actual situation one part of this inconsistency is precipitation observation instrument bias the other part of the more significant precipitation inconsistency comes from artificial snowmaking in addition another reason for the error between the modeled snow depth and observed snow depth is that the snowfall data used in the model are derived from snowfall instrument measurements with significant inconsistency between snowfall measurements and snow depth measurements the most likely explanation for this inconsistency is that large scale artificial snowfall occurred in the competition zone at the same time the snow depth observed by the snow observation station was artificially protected or cleared overall the gbehm model has high accuracy in simulating snow depth generated by natural snowfall and can be used to simulate and predict snow depth in the olympic winter games zone 4 2 temporal and spatial variation of predicted snow depth 4 2 1 temporal and spatial variation of snow depth in zjk cz in the next 30 years according to the weather station s measured snow depth data the snow season in the zjk cz is mainly distributed in the four months of january february november and december the simulated snow depth distribution based on the nex gddp cmip6 dataset also shows this characteristic fig 3 using the snow depth forecast of the zjk cz in 2022 we found that the monthly average snow depth in january 2022 is the largest while november has the shallowest snow depth with most areas below 70 mm regarding spatial distribution the interannual snow depth forecast results fig 4 for the zjk cz show that the annual average snow depth is larger in 2031 2035 and 2036 and the snow depth in most regions exceeds 200 mm the annual average snow depth in 2021 2032 2042 and 2046 is the smallest and the annual average snow depth is less than 50 mm based on the time series distribution pattern of snow depth in the next 30 years the snow depth distribution in the zjk cz is highly uneven the annual average snow depth is negligible in most years based on the spatial distribution characteristics of snow depth we find that most years do not meet the conditions for holding winter sports only by relying on natural snowfall 4 2 2 temporal and spatial changes of snow depth in nccsc gsp and nsjc olympic winter games venues in the next 30 years the snow depth generated by natural snowfall at the nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz over the next 30 years has a generally similar pattern of variation i e the snow depth is usually low in most years and generally shows a trend of decreasing fluctuations fig 5 overall the annual average snow depth of gsp is greater than that of nccsc and nsjc while the annual average snow depth and variation characteristics of nccsc and nsjc are the same the annual average snow depth at the nccsc gsp and nsjc is less than 100 mm per year except for fluctuating increases in 2031 and 2035 the annual average snow depth at the gsp exceeds 300 mm only in 2031 and 2035 reaching 319 24 and 404 51 mm respectively while it does not exceed 300 mm in any other calendar year the year 2042 has the smallest annual average snow depth of 32 51 mm the annual average snow depth of nccsc and nsjc does not exceed 300 mm in all years between 2021 and 2050 the nccsc has the largest annual average snow depth of 273 87 mm in 2035 and the smallest annual average snow depth of 20 45 mm in 2042 the nsjc has the largest annual average snow depth of 297 43 mm in 2035 and the smallest annual average snow depth of 22 30 mm in 2042 based on the mann kendall trend test method we analyzed the overall variation trend of annual average snow depth from 2021 to 2050 for the nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz table 5 the changing trend test values of nccsc gsp and nsjc are 2 07 1 96 and 2 11 respectively and the snow depth of the three venues shows a significant decreasing trend in the next 30 years with a continuous reduction of snow cover in the northern hemisphere the snow depth in the zjk cz will also gradually decline as the main venue of winter sports it is impossible to operate normally only by relying on natural snowfall artificial snowfall should be considered the primary auxiliary means 4 3 forecast of suitable winter sports day in zjk cz based on the minimum snow depth criterion of 300 mm for swsd defined in the method section we forecast the days to meet the swsd indicators for the nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz between 2021 and 2050 fig 6 the snow depth predicted by the gbehm model shows that the calendar years with swsd in the nccsc are 2022 2027 2028 2029 2031 2035 2036 2037 and 2041 the years with swsd for the gsp are 2022 2025 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2034 2035 2036 2037 2041 and 2043 the years with swsd in the nsjc are 2022 2027 2028 2029 2031 2035 2036 2037 and 2041 overall the snow depth in nccsc gsp and nsjc did not meet the swsd minimum snow depth standards for most calendar years between 2021 and 2050 for the entire zjk cz the calendar years with the swsd minimum snow depth indicator of 300 mm in most regions are 2022 2027 2028 2029 2031 2035 2036 2037 and 2041 in these calendar years winter sports events can usually be held depending on natural snowfall alone fig 7 in 2025 2030 2034 2043 and 2044 only a tiny portion of the zjk cz meets the swsd minimum snow depth standard of 300 mm in 2021 2023 2024 2026 2032 2033 2038 2039 2040 2042 2045 2046 2047 2048 2049 and 2050 all regions of the zjk cz do not meet the swsd standard and cannot operate winter sports events when only considering natural snowfall in particular between 2044 and 2050 the snow cover in the zjk cz will decrease significantly the entire region cannot meet the snow cover conditions for winter sports events in all calendar years when only natural snowfall is considered overall in the context of climate change the zjk cz will not be able to typically host winter sports events by relying solely on natural snowfall for most of the calendar years in the next 30 years 4 4 forecast of the lowest profitable swsd for the olympic winter games zone the snow depth forecast of the olympic winter games zone is a reference value for the regular operation of venues during the olympic winter games and a significant reference value for whether the olympic winter games can still hold regular winter sports events in the post winter olympic era in the post winter olympic era it remains uncertain whether the olympic winter games zone can be profitable after undertaking various winter sports events and opening them to the public based on the minimum profitability standard for winter sports venues proposed in the methodology section we analyzed the operability and profitability of nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz between 2021 and 2050 fig 8 the analysis results show that with only natural snowfall the nccsc gsp and nsjc will only meet the profitability conditions in 2035 in 2036 only gsp venues meet the requirements for profitability except for 2035 and 2036 in any other years between 2021 and 2050 nccsc gsp and nsjc were not found to meet the profitability conditions when they relied solely on natural snowfall if the zjk cz maintains a minimum profitability standard for winter sports venues over the next 30 years artificial snowfall will be required as a supplement in most calendar years 5 discussion previous studies mainly focused on the use of empirical and numerical models for the evaluation methods of winter sports venues climate risk and operational profitability empirical models focus on assessing the climate risk and operating profitability of winter sports venues using a linear relationship between meteorological observation data and the length of the winter sports season as in this study the risk assessment index used in most studies is snow depth climate risk studies of ski resorts in the european region consider that the criterion for a winter sports venue to operate appropriately and profitably is the number of days in a calendar year when the snow depth exceeds 300 mm for at least 100 days abegg 2007 in this study we used a minimum profitability criterion of 60 or more days of snow depth over 300 mm for assessing the profitability of the nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz over the next 30 years taking into account the snow distribution and population economics characteristics of china another method for evaluating the climatic riskiness of winter sports venues is numerical simulation a more reliable method is the skisim2 model which combines natural snowfall and artificial snowmaking steiger 2010 the results of a study combining cmip5 data and the skisim2 model show that the only places with low climate risk for global winter sports venues under a high emission scenario are calgary canada salt lake city usa albertville france and beijing china scott et al 2019 similarly our results indicate that the zjk cz will remain suitable for winter sports in the next 30 years considering artificially assisted snowmaking snow depth is undoubtedly the most important parameter in the climate risk assessment of winter sports venues and its accuracy directly determines the reliability of the assessment results the station data satellite remote sensing data and reanalysis data commonly used for snow depth measurements are not suitable for forecasting the riskiness of winter sports venues in the context of climate change moreover the accuracy of existing snow depth products on a regional scale is still not satisfactory a study on the accurate evaluation of smmr data found that the maximum percentage bias between smmr snow depth and real snow depth can reach 30 tait and armstrong 1996 while our simulated snow depth percent bias is only 3 there remains great uncertainty in the snow depth measured using reanalysis data with great differences found among the data etchevers et al 2004 rutter et al 2009 combining the land surface process model and the snow process model based on strict physical mechanisms we achieved a more accurate simulation and prediction of snow distribution characteristics thus ensuring the stability of snow depth in the long time series simulation unlike traditional climate risk assessment methods for winter sports venues we introduced an earth system model with a more detailed physical mechanism into the assessment scheme of climate risk and operation planning for winter sports venues the new integrated model assessment scheme has the advantages of clear physical processes high stability and real time forecasting when assessing the climate riskiness of snow and ice sports venues on a regional scale to further explore the importance of snow depth forecasting for climate riskiness and the operational profitability assessment of winter sports venues in the context of climate change we discuss the reference significance of snow depth forecasting for artificial snowfall and analyze the reference significance of swsd forecasting for the regular operation and profitability of winter sports venues respectively 5 1 the reference significance of snow depth forecasting for artificial snowfall the regular operation of winter sports venues is often not entirely dependent on natural snowfall in the context of global warming temperatures are rising snowfall is decreasing in most regions of the world and the snow depth supplemented by natural snowfall cannot support winter sports but needs to be augmented by widespread artificially assisted snowmaking the forecasting of snow depth produced by natural snowfall can also provide a reference for artificially assisted snowmaking in another way based on the minimum snow depth indicator of 300 mm for a suitable winter sports day the minimum snow depth of artificially assisted snowmaking required to supplement the winter sports venues can be expressed as minimum artificial snowmaking snow depth 300 mm natural snowfall snow depth the zjk cz s nccsc gsp and nsjc will properly require artificially assisted snowmaking to host winter sports events for the next 30 years fig 9 in 2035 the least amount of artificially assisted snowmaking is required with an annual average snow depth of 17 mm the largest amount of artificially assisted snowmaking will be needed in 2042 requiring an annual average artificial snowfall snow depth of 275 mm 5 2 the reference significance of swsd forecasting for the profitability assessment of winter sports venues in section 4 4 we found that the regular operation and profitability of the nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz in all calendar years except 2035 will require artificially assisted snowmaking based on the profitable snow depth indicators for the olympic winter games venues defined in the methodology section the minimum number of days requiring artificially assisted snowmaking in each calendar year for the nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz to meet regular operation and profitability standards can be expressed as minimum artificial snowfall days 60 swsd days the forecast results show that for the nccsc gsp and nsjc venues to be in normal operating and profitable condition for each year between 2021 and 2050 an average of at least 49 days of artificially assisted snowmaking per year would be required to make up for the lack of natural snowfall fig 10 nccsc gsp and nsjc need at least 60 days of artificially assisted snowmaking in most calendar years to ensure regular operation and profitability 5 3 limitations and uncertainties this study found that the snow depth in the zjk cz showed a significant decreasing trend in the next 30 years fig 5 and that the decrease in snow depth will cause a significant reduction in swsd the reason for this result is that under the background of global warming the temperature at the regional scale is bound to increase arias et al 2021 and an increase in temperature is one of the critical factors causing the decrease in snow depth guo et al 2021 leading to the reduction of swsd in zjk cz however in the context of future climate change there is also significant uncertainty in the forecast of temperature snowfall and snow depth in the zjk cz as a general rule an increase in snowfall snow cover days and snow depth will increase swsd conversely under global warming the decrease in snowfall snow cover days and snow depth will inevitably lead to a reduction of swsd in this study we did not consider future snow depth forecasts in multiple models so we could not accurately determine the detailed impact of climate change on snow depth and swsd forecasts which is one of the uncertainties in this study another uncertainty is that this study did not calibrate the model driven data nex gddp cmip6 and we did not decomposition methods to deal with data noise which may cause uncertainty in the accuracy of the model simulated snow depth in addition population economy traffic and other factors affect the swsd forecast deng et al 2019 however we did not consider these factors and their sensitivities to swsd forecasts in detail in this study which is an important limitation of this study for future swsd forecasting 6 conclusions in this study we used the gbehm model with a strict snow mass and energy balance mechanism combined with downscaled cmip6 climate model forecast data nex gddp cmip6 dataset to forecast the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of snow depth in the zjk cz of the beijing olympic winter games and analyze the climate risk of the area s regular operation in the context of climate change the validation of snow depth data based on weather station observations shows that the gbehm model has high accuracy in simulating snow depth and is suitable for long time series snow depth forecasting our study indicates that the area will experience a severe shortage of snow depth from natural snowfall over the next 30 years to support winter sports events the three venues of nccsc gsp and nsjc in the zjk cz are limited in the number of their swsd days per year when considering only natural snowfall and cannot meet the requirements of standard operation to be profitable the years with swsd for the zjk cz are 2022 2025 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2034 2035 2036 2037 2041 and 2043 during the period 2021 2050 under natural snowfall conditions only 2035 and 2036 meet the minimum normal profitability standards for the zjk cz our research also found that if the zjk cz seeks to achieve regular operation and profitability in the next 30 years it will need at least 49 days of artificially assisted snowmaking per year on average and the annual average artificial snow production cannot be less than 190 mm this study considers the snow hydrological processes and snow mass and energy balance processes that affect snow depth variation in detail making the snow depth forecasting of winter sports venues more accurate and reasonable the research thus has essential reference value in determining the requirements for holding the olympic winter games at the same time the study can provide guiding recommendations for the regular operation of winter sports venues in the post winter olympic era in addition the forecast of snow depth from natural snowfall can also guide and predict the amount of artificial snow production this study is based on a single case swsd simulation analysis so further research is needed for swsd forecasting in other regions in addition the results of this study do not apply to the climate risk assessment of winter sports venues with large scale and multi factor comprehensive effects credit authorship contribution statement donghang

7742,study region lower mekong river basin lmrb study focus satellite remote sensing products are widely used for monitoring droughts using nasa satellite sensors of precipitation global measurement mission gpm soil moisture soil moisture active and passive smap and terrestrial water storage gravity recovery and climate experiment grace this study evaluates the historical drought in the lmrb during 2015 16 smap soil moisture was validated against in situ soil moisture and gpm precipitation and smap soil moisture were cross validated with streamflow observations the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture were also examined in different ranges of catchment areas in performing the analysis we used lagged correlations between hydrological variables and the indices of the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized streamflow index ssi new hydrological insights for the regions spatio temporal patterns of drought in 2015 16 were examined from the entire basin to small watersheds a mismatch occurs when using grace data to study droughts in small watersheds many of the small watersheds would be a fraction of the few 100 km2 spatial resolutions of grace pixel in smaller watersheds hydrological drought ssi was closely defined with smap soil moisture downscaled to 1 km rather than the meteorological drought index spi by leveraging satellite based observations across a range of spatial scales this study highlights the utility of earth observations in informing water resources and land management decisions at the regional scale graphical abstract ga1 keywords mekong gpm smap grace downscaled smap spi ssi data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought occurs naturally in any global climatic zone when the weather is warm and dry for an extended period of time tallaksen 2000 droughts can broadly be classified into four types meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic the specific classification of droughts varies based on factors like the causes and consequences of drought location or field of study west et al 2019 wmo and gwp 2016 for example thornthwaite 1947 divided droughts into four categories permanent when water demand exceeds supplied precipitation seasonal with rainy and dry seasons contingent irregular and variable rainfall and invisible can occur at any time conversely wilhite and glantz 1985 classified drought into four groups meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic additionally some studies have proposed different drought types such as ecological drought bradford et al 2020 crausbay et al 2018 and flash drought christian et al 2019 hu et al 2021 practically all drought types are interrelated and it is difficult to determine the start and end of each drought type ha et al 2022 son et al 2021 west et al 2019 for instance a reduction in precipitation over time leads to meteorological drought if this precipitation deficit continues it can lead to reduced stream flow lake levels and groundwater resulting in hydrological drought the lack of rainfall and water supply causes soil moisture deficits which are associated with agricultural droughts finally socioeconomic drought occurs when water demand for social and economic activities exceeds water supply due to weather related shortages including impacts from meteorological agricultural or hydrological droughts elhag and zhang 2018 among natural hazards drought is one of the costliest ones because it reduces water availability which negatively affects agriculture and socioeconomic prosperity wilhite 2000 droughts are increasing in intensity and frequency as water resources are becoming limited across many regions in a warming climate posing detrimental effects on society and our planet gudmundsson et al 2021 v√∂r√∂smarty et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 zhongming et al 2021 drought monitoring has traditionally relied on in situ measurements but advances in earth observation technologies have transformed drought monitoring methods earth observations utilize different satellite missions to remotely sense different hydrological variables around the world precipitation is estimated by using some satellite missions instruments for instance global precipitation measurement gpm huffman et al 2020 mohammed et al 2018a 2018b 2018c and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 le et al 2020b the introduction of satellite based precipitation products can enhance the spatio temporal coverage of meteorological drought mapping and monitoring zhang et al 2017 moreover agricultural drought monitoring research can utilize microwave sensors to acquire soil moisture content for characterizing soil moisture deficits bolten and crow 2012 microwave sensors provide continuous coverage over large geographical areas and do not suffer from limitations associated with daylight availability and cloud coverage lakshmi 2013 surface soil moisture is extracted from various satellite missions equipped with active passive microwave sensors such as soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 or soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 additionally remote sensing have enabled measurement of the earth s total water storage in response to hydrological groundwater droughts via the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission tapley et al 2004 grace observed variations in terrestrial water storage tws at all water storage locations soil moisture surface water and groundwater the grace satellite is unique as it measures below beneath the top five centimeters of the surface without being affected by surface conditions numerous studies have successfully used grace data to monitor hydrological droughts frappart et al 2013 rodell et al 2009 thomas et al 2017 in web of science search drought related publications based on satellite remote sensing have increased from fewer than 5 per year in 1982 to more than 300 per year in 2014 west et al 2019 sheffield et al 2018 discusses that remote sensing technologies have a significant role in improving water management throughout data scarce regions overall earth observations have been increasingly used in recent decades for drought monitoring as their capacity to provide continuous observations over large spatial domains for several key hydrologic variables such as precipitation hou et al 2014 soil moisture bolten et al 2010 bolten and lakshmi 2009 chan et al 2016 and terrestrial water storage syed et al 2008 has been improving over the lower mekong river basin lmrb the agricultural system is sensitive to seasonal uncertainty and droughts are expected to increase in frequency and intensity around 70 of the population in the lmrb engages in agricultural activities abhishek et al 2021 as the majority of agriculture in the region relies on rain seasonality poses uncertainties about agricultural productivity and subsequent livelihood activities jones et al 2003 mrc 2003 the causes of droughts in the mekong region are possibly 1 climate change 2 low rainfall 3 dry weather and high temperatures 4 el ni√±o southern oscillation phenomenon and 5 disagreements on water politics over chinese dam construction and operation basist and williams 2020 keovilignavong et al 2021 in future drought projections thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 demonstrated that drought severity and peak could be elevated significantly in the lmrb as analyzed from outputs from 15 global climate models gcms based on eight of the gcms of cmip6 dong et al 2022 reported that drought conditions will last longer during the dry season in most of the lmrb unfavorable climate conditions are projected in the mekong delta as increasing drought months mondal et al 2022 or drought intensity li et al 2021 remote sensing based drought monitoring in the lmrb is an area of research that requires more attention meteorological and agricultural drought monitoring using satellite observations are among the most impactful topics son et al 2012 tran et al 2019 for more details please see table 1 but there is room for improvement most studies investigated remote sensing based drought monitoring in large scale regions however understanding of local hydrological information would be beneficial to inform local decision makers microwave remote sensing provides a promising way to understand drought condition related to soil moisture deficits entekhabi et al 2010 to date there have been only a few studies assessing microwave remote sensing products over lmrb this is due to the lack of in situ soil moisture network to validate microwave remote sensing of soil moisture there is only one previous study that has attempted to validate c band microwave satellite based soil moisture in the lmrb naeimi et al 2013 however this study used an indirect method through the evapotranspiration variable to validate soil moisture advanced soil moisture measurement using l band microwave was attempted in the lmrb but no in situ validation has been previously discussed dandridge et al 2020 kang et al 2021 this research aims to demonstrate the relevance of nasa satellite observations for drought monitoring over the lmrb by 1 examination of historical drought conditions in 2015 16 using spaceborne data from precipitation soil moisture and terrestrial water storage 2 assessment of high resolution smap soil moisture to track the dynamics of the 2015 16 drought event at the watershed level 3 cross validation of soil moisture and precipitation and streamflow derived drought indices we examined the 2015 16 drought one of the worst natural disasters over the lmrb in recent years causing tremendous impacts of socio economic and livelihood in the region mrc 2019 we used gpm imerg for precipitation smap 9 km and its downscaled 1 km product for soil moisture grace for terrestrial water storage also to gain insights about drought conditions at regional scale we focused on the entire basin as well as the smaller watersheds we obtained in situ monthly streamflow over 16 catchments within lmrb and assessed co variability of precipitation soil moisture and observed streamflow during the water year of 2015 16 there is no in situ soil moisture network within lmrb but in the southeast asia region similar biomass and climate there are two available in situ soil moisture networks therefore we validated smap soil moisture products with these two networks finally we cross validated smap soil moisture products and gpm imerg precipitation with a hydrological drought index derived from observed monthly streamflow 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas the mekong river 795 000 km2 is one of the largest rivers in southeast asia originating from the tibetan plateau of china then flowing through six countries before ending to the east sea of vietnam the mekong is arguably one of the most important rivers in southeast asia as many regional economic sectors including agriculture energy and fishery doan et al 2020 tran et al 2021 heavily depend on water from this basin in the mekong river basin there are two main sub basins the upper mekong river basin and the lower mekong river basin the lower mekong river basin lmrb spans through thailand lao pdr cambodia and vietnam and is made up of the northern highlands the khorat plateau the tonle sap basin and the mekong delta with a total landmass of about 600 000 km2 at the beginning of 2015 there was a severe drought across the lmrb that imposed negative impacts on the agricultural and fishing industries in the basin that led to significant economic losses binh et al 2021 guo et al 2017 mrc 2019 park et al 2022 in thailand the drought of 2015 caused the economic damage worth 1 7 billion usd additionally more than 9 56 million people were affected in the 2015 16 drought making this one of the costliest natural disasters in southeast asia over the past 20 years kang et al 2021 mrc 2019 even over the last 90 years in mekong delta kantoush et al 2017 2 2 in situ datasets 2 2 1 streamflow in this study streamflow records from tributaries of the lower mekong river basin were obtained from the royal irrigation department rid and vietnam meteorological and hydrological administration vmha both the rid and vmha are officially responsible for monitoring river water level and discharge in thailand and vietnam respectively for rid data we downloaded discharge records that are publicly accessible from the agency s website http water rid go th hyd last accessed february 3 2022 for vmha data we obtained data directly from the authority data is not publicly accessible we identified basic metadata i e geographical coordinates and catchment area of each gauge using information available on the rid s website and from station documents provided by vmha officers to support our assessment of the 2015 16 drought event we selected 16 catchments the drainage area ranges from 248 to 10 878 km¬≤ with a median of 992 km¬≤ based on the following criteria a adequate data coverage there are at least 20 values of monthly discharge for each calendar month this ensures that we have sufficient data points to reliably estimate the distributions underlying our standardized streamflow index ssi b there are no missing values during the period of 2015 16 so that we can have a complete drought condition for the event c there are no dams within the catchments we use stimson s mekong infrastructure tracker https www stimson org project mekong infrastructure as the basis to implement this assessment a geographical map of the lmrb and 16 catchments is shown in fig 1 whereas a detailed description of the stream gauges is shown in table 2 2 2 2 soil moisture there are no permanent sites or field campaigns to collect soil moisture in the lmrb however in southeast asia region with a similar climate and biomass as the lmrb the international soil moisture network has maintained two in situ soil moisture networks within this region dorigo et al 2021 these networks include mysmnet network malaysia kang et al 2019 and vds network myanmar the mysmnet has seven stations with data availability from may 2014 to december 2015 while vds has four stations with data availability from june 2016 to february 2021 the major land use in the location of these two networks are savannas woody mysmnet and cropland vds we used ground based soil moisture measurements from these two networks to validate satellite based smap soil moisture products during their overlap period we obtained the in situ soil moisture datasets from the international soil moisture network https ismn earth en 2 3 earth observations datasets 2 3 1 gpm precipitation the gpm global precipitation measurement core observatory was launched on february 27 2014 the satellite has ka and ku bands radar and a 13 channel microwave radiometer and is designed to provide new standard rainfall and snowfall observations globally every half hour the sensors include dual frequency dpr precipitation radar and gmi gpm microwave imager and extend the measurement range of the trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission hou et al 2014 huffman 2016 huffman et al 2020 in this study we obtained half hour 0 1 degree gpm datasets from the latest version of imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm final run v6 https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm ranging from 2001 to 2020 the gpm imerg datasets are then accumulated on a monthly basis 2 3 2 smap soil moisture the soil moisture active passive smap is a soil moisture focused mission that is operating in a near polar sun synchronous orbit and with two overpasses morning 6 a m and afternoon 6 p m and revisits every 2 3 days the soil moisture estimates are retrieved from a 0 5 cm soil layer with a threshold of vegetation water content 5 kg m2 from an l band radiometer at 1 41 ghz chan et al 2016 the smap soil moisture retrievals can be downscaled by correlating the surface temperature difference to the soil moisture as a function of vegetation cover fang et al 2013 for example at the global scale the 9 km smap soil moisture is downscaled to 1 km using gldas global land data assimilation system and modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer land surface temperature and vegetation index this downscaled soil moisture has been validated against field observations as well as aircraft data sets using 1400 in situ observing sites at a global scale fang et al 2022 in this study we obtained 9 km smap level 3 at the national snow and ice data center nsidc https nsidc org data smap and downscaled smap 1 km soil moisture from fang et al 2022 2 3 3 grace terrestrial water storage we use grace rl06 product and grace fo rl06 products for examination of the terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa syed et al 2008a the data are global and are at a spatial resolution of 1 and a temporal repeat of one month for the terrestrial water anomalies these anomalies depict the changes in the total water column of earth which includes surface sub surface and groundwater components syed et al 2008a grace has been used in global basins lakshmi et al 2018 and indian river basins kansara and lakshmi 2021 in this study the anomalies of terrestrial water storage are used twsa obtaining from the physical oceanography distributed active archive center podaac https podaac jpl nasa gov datasetlist search grace 20 2002 2017 2 4 methods 2 4 1 areal value estimates from gridded earth observations datasets spatiotemporal changes of drought signal at a basin are usually monitored by assessing variabilities of precipitation soil moisture and terrestrial water storage derived from gridded satellite observations lakshmi et al 2018 voss et al 2013 wang et al 2020 in this study gridded monthly gpm imerg precipitation smap 9 km soil moisture downscaled smap 1 km soil moisture and grace twsa products were extracted over the lmrb and sixteen watersheds during the water year from october 2015 to september 2016 mean areal value for each variable was estimated to evaluate the ability of earth observing satellites for monitoring drought across the study domain we used thiessen polygon areal weighted value le et al 2022 thiessen 1911 to calculate mean areal value as considering the case that one pixel from earth observations datasets may not be completely located within a target domain 2 4 2 lag time analysis with cross correlation the cross correlation between precipitation and twsa and between soil moisture and twsa were investigated to assess the relationship and lagged time between the variables during the drought event the responsibility of twsa to the changes in precipitation and or reflection in soil moisture changes to the precipitation variability can exhibit the propagation time from the precipitation deficit to the soil water deficit followed by water deficits realized in deeper groundwater 2 4 3 monitoring drought dynamic with high resolution smap soil moisture the spatial resolution of earth observation data has been a key issue in monitoring drought at catchment scale for example spatial resolution of smap soil moisture 9 km is not ideal for detecting the changes in environmental variables and human activities irrigation system over sub basins the recent advancements in downscaling smap soil moisture fang et al 2020 2022 enable us to further explore soil moisture patterns this study analyses the variability of the highest spatial resolution satellite soil moisture products at global coverage to offer a better understanding of changes in soil moisture under drought conditions in several sub basins with different catchment sizes 2 4 4 drought indices from precipitation and streamflow we employed standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standardized streamflow index ssi farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 telesca et al 2012 gringorten 1963 to assess meteorological drought and hydrological drought respectively the spi relies primarily on the probability of precipitation whereas the ssi is based on the probability of streamflow values these indices were both chosen to investigate the drought conditions and explore these two variables in relation to each other and the drought spi and ssi are both normalized to zero mean and one standard deviation these variables can be compared across time and space with other spi ssi values as they are standardized since spi and ssi are calculated separately each month the seasonal cycle should not affect them telesca et al 2012 in each catchment both indices have been calculated at 1 month timescales with areal monthly gpm imerg as input for spi and monthly observed streamflow as input for ssi it must be noted that data length is essential to spi and ssi calculations therefore we used 20 years of gpm imerg data and 20 years of observed streamflow data to calculate spi and ssi respectively then we extracted spi and ssi values for the 2015 16 drought event we used standardized drought analysis toolbox sdat farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 with two parameter gamma distribution and empirical distribution to estimate spi and ssi time series respectively a drought condition occurs when spi ssi is under 1 mckee et al 1993 appendix 1 and appendix 2 contain details regarding drought calculations and thresholds for spi and ssi respectively we assessed drought characteristics in terms of drought duration and drought severity drought durations indicate total months in which drought indices values were under the drought threshold whereas drought severity is based on mean values of drought indices values during the drought duration periods le et al 2020a 2019 a drought episode occurred during the investigated period when at least two consecutive months having values classified as drought condition to this end table 3 summarizes the data used in this study and fig 2 illustrates the overall methodology 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of smap soil moisture in the studied region over our region of interest there is no prior work of validating smap soil moisture using in situ measurements therefore we conducted a validation study before applying smap soil moisture for our drought analysis it is noted that we used two in situ networks in the southeast asia region similar climate and biomass as the lmrb for the purpose of this evaluation the pixel to point approach was used to match satellite based soil moisture products with soil moisture measured from the in situ networks we first evaluated absolute values of smap soil moisture against in situ soil moisture measurements to carry out this task we normalized satellite based soil moisture products smap 9 km sm9 and its downscaled smap 1 km sm1 against the reference dataset in situ measurement using the normalized equation draper et al 2009 kim et al 2015 please see appendix 3 to see this equation in details we observed a good correlation between both smap products and ground measurements as the pairwise points were around the 1 1 line of the scatter plots fig 3 the sm1 product exhibited a slightly higher correlation for both networks spearman correlation coefficient values are 0 903 and 0 865 for mysmnet and vds respectively we further assessed delta changes between satellite based soil moisture and in situ soil moisture in this evaluation we did not apply the normalized equation we used delta changes to cross validate smap soil moisture in monitoring drought with standardized streamflow index ssi see section 3 5 we specifically focus on available data during the period of 2015 16 which overlaps with the investigated historical drought year with this constraint only mysmnet network has been used the delta changes rates between in situ soil moisture and sm9 soil moisture were found to be significantly related cc 0 48 and delta change rates between in situ soil moisture and sm1 soil moisture were found to be significantly related cc 0 57 for more details please see appendix 4 there is concern about the use of smap soil moisture in forest cover regions most microwave satellite based sm data over densely vegetated areas are masked out because biomass saturates the microwave signal resulting in high errors and uncertainties for sm retrievals in two field temperate forest canopy experiments in the northeast united states colliander et al 2020 reported a root mean square difference rmsd of 0 047 0 057 m3 m3 and a pearson correlation range of 0 75 0 85 for a parameterized emission model using the smap morning overpass this study demonstrates the sensitivity of soil moisture under dense forest canopies which had been uncertain due to a lack of representative reference data in a global scale error assessment of soil moisture estimates kim et al 2020 showed that model based sm could provide accurate sm estimates than microwave satellite based sm retrieval in a study within the lmrb microwave based satellite estimates over cropland has more reasonable estimates than forest land naeimi et al 2013 in our study half of the studied watersheds are dominated by cropland and shrubland land cover table 2 smap soil moisture estimates for these land cover types are generally reliable chan et al 2016 colliander et al 2017 in cambodia where is dominated by cropland abhishek et al 2021 used smap soil moisture as a reference for soil moisture outputs from their hydrological model on the other hand the remaining watersheds have no dominant land cover mainly mixed forest and grassland table 2 in these non dominant land cover watersheds dense vegetation coverage can be expected and smap soil moisture estimates may be uncertain to minimize this risk of uncertainties we chose not to use absolute smap soil moisture values but delta changes when cross validating smap soil moisture with other drought indices 3 2 variability of precipitation soil moisture and total water in the lower mekong river basin during 2015 16 the lower mekong river basin has faced a severe drought in 2015 16 fig 4a shows the variability of precipitation soil moisture and total water storage anomalies twsa from october 2015 to september 2016 the patterns of precipitation soil moisture and twsa show a very interesting pattern of correlation though lagged in time the rainfall begins to decrease in the extreme northern and northeastern portions of the basin in october 2015 this is followed by an almost complete drying of the basin albeit the southeastern edge and the vietnam mekong delta in november by december 2015 the entire basin has less than 100 mm of precipitation and this continues into january through march 2016 in this period there are portions of the basin that receive less than 10 mm of precipitation in a month however this changes in april 2016 when the north central portion of the basin receives precipitation more than 100 mm for the month and this continues into may 2016 when the same region receives around 150 mm of precipitation by june 2016 the entire basin has over 150 mm of precipitation except for small regions in the north june 2016 and in the south and east july 2016 south and west august 2016 and extreme north september 2016 it is interesting to observe that soil moisture responds almost immediately to the changes in precipitation but the spatial patterns are not the same the soil moisture is generally always greater than 0 4 in the vietnam mekong delta the southern most portion of the basin and this is true even during periods of low precipitation the reason for this could be due to irrigation and or standing water the vietnam mekong delta is the heart of rice cultivation in the basin if we compare the precipitation and soil moisture to the spatial patterns of the terrestrial water storage anomalies we see a lag of up to 2 3 months for recovery of the groundwater this is expected as the increase in precipitation reflects almost immediately in the soil moisture but there is a time lag for this water to reach the aquifers and register in the twsa in fig 4b we see the basin averaged gpm precipitation black line with circles 9 km smap soil moisture red dashed line with squares and the grace terrestrial water storage are plotted for october 2015 to september 2016 it is very clearly seen that the drop in the precipitation results in a corresponding drop of the soil moisture between october 2015 150 mm and february 2016 nearly zero the precipitation starts to increase from around march 2016 less than 10 mm to june 2016 280 mm and the soil moisture follows 0 37 in october 2015 0 2 in march 2016 the precipitation shows a slight dip between june and july 2016 280 260 mm but the soil moisture continues its increase till july 2016 0 38 following which the soil moisture shows a slight drop to august 2016 and then increases to september 2016 the precipitation on the other hand keeps on increasing between july and september 2016 the total water storage anomalies twsa show a distinct lag with the precipitation and soil moisture whereas precipitation and soil moisture show almost monthly similarities the twsa decreases till may 2016 22 mm and only begins to recover in july and august 2016 5 mm and 6 mm respectively thereby lagging the increase in precipitation by about 4 months march july the correlation coefficients between precipitation and soil moisture are 0 91 between p and twsa is 0 15 no lag 0 6 lag 1 month 0 7 lag 2 months and sm and twsa is 0 5 no lag 0 8 lag 1 month and 0 7 lag 2 months several prior studies confirm similar findings as ours from satellite sensors using diverse approaches according to abhishek et al 2021 persistent dry spells were observed over cambodia from 2015 to mid 2016 based on a modeling framework based on 30 years of reanalysis of precipitation data guo et al 2017 found that 2015 16 were the driest in the lmrb with drought affected areas of up to 75 and serve drought events lasted from april 2015 to july 2016 in a near real time drought monitoring experiment zhang et al 2020 detected significant drought episodes during the 2015 16 dry season november to april 3 3 examination of high spatial soil moisture variability for sub catchments one of the objectives of this work was to use satellite based sensors to help understand the spatial and temporal propagation of the drought signal in small watersheds normally studies of droughts have been limited to larger watersheds due to the low spatial resolution of the satellite observations however with the downscaling of the smap 9 km soil moisture to 1 km and its global availability we are able to study smaller watersheds on the order of a few hundred square kilometers in this sub section we will examine the spatial and temporal propagation of the drought for five watersheds table 2 in the lower mekong river basin with a range of areas on various river systems viz g 9 river system name mae kok area 386 km2 banyen river system nam mua area 638 km2 kh 28 a river system khong area 1271 km2 g 8 river system name mae kok area 2909 km2 and i 14 river system khong area 6266 km2 the choice of these watersheds also spans a range of geographical diversity and the availability of soil moisture datasets fig 1 and table 2 in fig 5 soil moisture for catchment g 9 generally declines between october 2015 and april 2016 due to the decreasing precipitation noted in fig 4b focusing on soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 1 km during this dry out phase we see a sub pixel variability in the smap 9 km soil moisture pixel as a reflection of differential drying this is especially true for february 2016 where some pixels show particular wetness most likely due to irrigation when comparing boxplots of soil moisture at different spatial resolutions we observe a greater range in 1 km soil moisture from december 2015 through april 2016 a slight subsequent decrease in soil moisture can be noted across both datasets in september 2016 due to increased evaporation similar spatial and temporal patterns in the other four watersheds are examined in this section in the case of the banyen watershed fig 6 the soil moisture experiences a decline from january 0 37 to march 0 32 however the variability of soil moisture at the spatial resolution of 1 km shows more detailed information especially in february 2016 with some locations still wet and others much drier we also observe interesting nuance in soil moisture especially in the southern part during the dry spell in april 2016 and localized wetness in september 2016 in the case of kh 28 a fig 7 the decrease in precipitation from october 2015 100 m to march 2016 less than 10 mm is matched by the steady decline in soil moisture especially at 1 km spatial resolution the wetting up is not as obvious in the spatial soil moisture plots at kh 28 a as it was in previous catchments however we see that the soil moisture at 1 km consistently captures a greater range of variability in the boxplots this is especially apparent in the month of july 2016 where the 1 km soil moisture shows a considerably higher range than that of 9 km soil moisture this is possibly because the 1 km spatial resolution can pick up smaller wetter irrigated patches the g 8 fig 8 and i 14 fig 9 catchments exhibit similar patterns the soil moisture at both the 9 and 1 km spatial resolution does not show a consistent watershed wide decrease in fact some areas specifically in the northeast corner of the watershed show wetter areas between october 2015 to february 2016 around 0 35 most likely caused by irrigation once again at these two catchments we see that the soil moisture at 1 km provides a much wider range of information this is true across the whole time series during both the dry and wet periods some hollow spots are visible on the spatial pattern maps of smap 1 km soil moisture e g figs 7 to 9 the modis land surface temperature lst data are contaminated by clouds resulting in incomplete spatial coverage pham et al 2021 2018 since lst is an independent variable in the 1 km downscaling algorithm its limited coverage impacts the smap 1 km coverage 3 4 co variability of precipitation soil moisture and streamflow fig 10 provides the time series of the watershed spatially averaged monthly precipitation runoff soil moisture at 9 and 1 km spatial resolution for the five watersheds that we discussed in the previous section 3 2 viz g 9 banyen kh 28 a g 8 and i 14 in a b c d and e respectively the common thread among all these plots and watersheds is the fact that the watershed precipitation decreases similarly to the decreases in the larger lower mekong river basin between october 2015 and march 2016 between around 100 mm in october 2015 to almost negligible in march 2016 then the precipitation increases peaking at different times to different amounts in the different watersheds in g 9 it is about 300 mm for june 2016 400 m in banyen in august 2016 240 mm in kh 28 a in june 2016 250 mm in june 2016 and 320 mm in i 14 in some of these watersheds the precipitation stays nearly constant after peaking or dropping the largest drop is in banyen fig 10b where the precipitation drops from 400 m in august 2016 150 mm in september 2016 the changes in the precipitation are reflected in the runoff in all the watersheds the runoff remains at very low amounts less than 10 mm till may or june 2016 and then shows an increasing trend for the remainder of the year in g 9 this increase is to about 50 mm in september 2016 in banyen the increase is to 200 mm for august 2016 and then a drop to 120 mm for september 2016 for kh 28 a there is a continual increase to 120 mm in september 2016 there is a slight increase to about 40 mm in g 8 in september 2016 and to 100 m for i 14 in september 2016 the soil moisture exhibits a temporal trend that tracks the precipitation very closely with an initial dry down in all the watersheds between october 2015 to april 2016 followed by an increase to july 2016 followed by a slight decrease mirroring the precipitation the minimum soil moisture in most of these watersheds is reached in march or april 2016 and is close to 0 15 in almost all the watersheds there is a deviation from the negative trend between october 2015 to march april 2016 with a local maximum in january 2016 most likely due to local irrigation in the watersheds this upward bump is not seen in the spatial average over the lower mekong river basin fig 4b where the soil moisture stays constant between december 2015 and january 2016 this increase varies in different watersheds with the largest increase observed in the banyen watershed 0 29 0 4 and a very slight increase in kh 28 a 0 18 and 0 21 there is a very good agreement between the soil moisture at the 9 and 1 km spatial resolutions table 4 lists the watersheds percentage of monthly available soil moisture for the 9 and 1 km spatial resolution and the correlation between the variables precipitation runoff soil moisture at 9 and 1 km spatial resolutions and all the cross correlations this table demonstrates the high correlation between precipitation runoff and soil moisture in almost all the watersheds except for banyen where the correlations are generally low one of the reasons for this could be the fact that there is irrigation and a use of surface water for agricultural activities in this watershed and that disrupts the natural connections between precipitation runoff and soil moisture with that exception it is generally seen that most correlations are greater than 0 7 and many of the correlations such as between precipitation and soil moisture are in the 0 9 range this demonstrates the effective use of satellite data in monitoring the drought and linking it to observed stream flow the high correlation between soil moisture at 9 and 1 km spatial resolutions demonstrates the consistency of the two data sets 3 5 hydrological variability and relation with indices fig 11 presents variations of monthly precipitation anomalies and runoff anomalies along with relationship between spi 1 and ssi 1 at 16 small watersheds during the water year of 2015 16 generally the runoff anomaly did not follow the same pattern as the anomaly in precipitation the monthly averaged precipitation anomalies were greater than the long run precipitation averages between december 2015 to january 2016 20 mm and between june to july 2016 60 mm fig 11a on the other hand the averaged runoff anomalies were lower than long run runoff values for all months especially from october december 2015 30 mm and august september 2016 20 mm fig 11b drought duration and drought severity based on spi and ssi reveal significant difference in drought characteristics obtained by these two drought indices table 5 spi based drought durations across catchments often lasted 2 3 months average of 2 1 months while ssi based drought durations were longer ranging from 2 to 12 months with an average of 5 4 months in some catchments g 9 krongbuk kh 61 kh 72 and g 8 there were more than two hydrological drought events during the period of 2015 16 in contrast no hydrological drought events were observed in the banyen and kh 58 a catchments during this period the reason for this could be due to large water storage in aquifers that can discharge to streamflow in these catchments during drought development phase we also examined the cross correlation between spi 1 and ssi 1 across small watersheds observing the highest correlation coefficient cc varying from the lag of zero lag 0 to the lag of two months lag 2 stream gauges that have the highest correlation between spi and ssi with the lag 0 lag 1 and lag 2 are provided in fig 11 c d and e respectively the highest correlation coefficient values are provided in the supplementary s1 among six stream gauges with lag of zero there was only one gauge having statistically significant correlation located at the northeast of the lmrb fig 11c three of four stream gauges located in the northwest the west and the southeast of the region have statistical significance of correlation with propagation time of one month fig 11d whereas only two gauges in six stream gauges with lagged time of two months distributed in the west of the basin fig 11e the background map of fig 11c e shows the averaged twsa during the water year 2015 16 the region with negative twsa is drier than normal conditions while positive twsa region is wetter than normal conditions the results are quite surprising because it is contrary to what is known about links between catchment water storage capacity and response time of catchment and hence lag time between spi 1 and ssi 1 major water stores positive twsa in catchment create long memory in hydrological system which makes long response time of catchment and long propagation time between meteorological drought and hydrological drought as well however longer lag times between spi and ssi were found at dry catchments fig 11e and fast responding catchments had positive twsa fig 11c in other words our understanding on large scale observation from grace may not be true when we move to small size watersheds in summary the differences in anomalies patterns between precipitation and runoff as well as differences in drought characteristics between meteorological drought spi and hydrological drought ssi suggest us that the impact of precipitation on the severity of drought during 2015 16 was mild also the coarse resolution of grace data seems not truly to reflect the co variability between precipitation and runoff at the small watersheds we introduced delta changes in months to cross validate drought monitoring between ssi spi and soil moisture at 9 km sm9 and 1 km sm1 delta change values have two benefits first catchments have flux memories precipitation soil moisture and streamflow flux changes between months could indicate dryness or wetness signals second we could use short record soil moisture data in detecting dryness wetness signals since satellite based soil moisture is only available for a short period as compared to the data length required for spi and ssi we only need current values to calculate delta changes but not for long term values fig 12 characterizes monthly changes in ssi spi and soil moisture at 9 km sm9 and 1 km sm1 we only examined the co variability of changes in ssi spi sm9 and sm1 at five basins which almost have fully coverage of soil moisture both 9 km and 1 km at a monthly time step during the 2015 16 period fig 12a e fig 12f presents cross correlation between monthly changes in ssi and monthly changes in spi sm9 and sm1 we found out that small catchments g 9 bye and kh 28 a the relationship between monthly changes in ssi could related to the changes in spi and soil moisture datasets with a statistically significant at level 0 1 it is quite possible true as in the small watersheds routing time is short and transfer the loss in precipitation and soil moisture to runoff can occur immediately among the relationships the highest values were observed between monthly changes in sm1 and ssi followed by sm9 and ssi and spi and ssi it can be likely that soil moisture is a land surface parameter which directly relates to runoff rather than precipitation atmospheric parameter the better of sm1 in liking with the changes in runoff also indicates its usefulness in accurately capturing dryness wetness pixels in the small watersheds on the other hand at the large basins g 8 and i 14 the relationship between monthly changes in spi sm9 and sm1 with monthly changes in ssi were weak it may be due to the heterogeneity of land cover and complexity of routing process in the large catchments causing non linear process between the loss of precipitation and soil moisture to runoff 4 conclusions this study aims to assess whether nasa satellite sensors can be useful for monitoring a major drought event with spatially heterogeneous impacts this work builds up on and complements traditional studies of droughts in two ways 1 most studies focus on use of drought metrics computed using precipitation standard precipitation index or evapotranspiration standard precipitation evapotranspiration index but this study uses explicitly precipitation soil moisture and streamflow to track the evolution of the drought 2 most previous studies have focused on large watersheds while smaller watersheds have generally not been studied on an individual basic we investigated various sensors with different spatial resolutions including grace 100 kilometers gpm 10 kilometers smap 10 kilometers and downscaled smap soil moisture 1 kilometer the motivation of this study is to showcase the potential of using remotely sensed data to support water assessment over basins that are not monitored intensively or limited in data sharing our findings show that at the large scale lmrb precipitation soil moisture and total water are well correlated specifically soil moisture and precipitation track each other and total water lags by a few months at the catchment level we observe a strong correlation between precipitation soil moisture and streamflow grace observations however do not reasonably reflect hydrological processes at the smaller catchment scales due to their low spatial resolution for example several dry catchments negative tws observed from grace show longer lag time response between ssi and spi as compared to the wet catchments positive tws from a theoretical perspective less water stored in the catchment results in a short memory in the hydrological system this enables a quick response time of the catchment and quick propagation between meteorological and hydrological droughts the availability of 1 km soil moisture observations highlights the ability to make water resources and land management decisions at the local scale this high spatial resolution information can assist in specific agricultural decisions such as water availability during time of planting and or harvest moreover the benefits gained from devising operational drought monitoring framework with high spatial resolution soil moisture data are seen in strategic preparedness plans to combat droughts and mitigate their effects on the activities in the various sectors of the economy starting from the small scale up to large ones moreover we find that monthly changes in the streamflow standardized index ssi are closely related to downscaled 1 km soil moisture at small catchment scales as compared to the standardized precipitation index spi this opens a possibility of using 1 km soil moisture as a substitution of the hydrological drought ssi as its publicly available and easier to access than the ground runoff data the approach from this study can be further applied in other regions where episodes of drought are occurring at various spatial and temporal resolutions the work presented here can be further refined to include upcoming high resolution surface water satellite products small scale detailed assessments of drought detection are expected to witness a breakthrough through the nasa indian space research organization isro synthetic aperture radar sar mission nisar products are available in 2023 nisar is the first satellite mission that images the earth in both l and s band radar frequencies and will produce surface water extent products over inland and coastal wetlands at least twice every 12 days with spatial resolution of 5 10 m credit authorship contribution

mission gpm soil moisture soil moisture active and passive smap and terrestrial water storage gravity recovery and climate experiment grace this study evaluates the historical drought in the lmrb during 2015 16 smap soil moisture was validated against in situ soil moisture and gpm precipitation and smap soil moisture were cross validated with streamflow observations the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture were also examined in different ranges of catchment areas in performing the analysis we used lagged correlations between hydrological variables and the indices of the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized streamflow index ssi new hydrological insights for the regions spatio temporal patterns of drought in 2015 16 were examined from the entire basin to small watersheds a mismatch occurs when using grace data to study droughts in small watersheds many of the small watersheds would be a fraction of the few 100 km2 spatial resolutions of grace pixel in smaller watersheds hydrological drought ssi was closely defined with smap soil moisture downscaled to 1 km rather than the meteorological drought index spi by leveraging satellite based observations

keywords mekong gpm smap grace downscaled smap spi ssi data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought occurs naturally in any global climatic zone when the weather is warm and dry for an extended period of time tallaksen 2000 droughts can broadly be classified into four types meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic the specific classification of droughts varies based on factors like the causes and consequences of drought location or field of study west et al 2019 wmo and gwp 2016 for example thornthwaite 1947 divided droughts into four categories permanent when water demand exceeds supplied precipitation seasonal with rainy and dry seasons contingent irregular and variable rainfall and invisible can occur at any time conversely wilhite and glantz 1985 classified drought into four groups meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic additionally some studies have proposed different drought types such as ecological drought bradford et al 2020 crausbay et al 2018 and flash drought christian et al 2019 hu et al 2021 practically all drought types are interrelated and it is difficult to determine the start and end of each drought type ha et al 2022 son et al 2021 west et al 2019 for instance a reduction in precipitation over time leads to meteorological drought if this precipitation deficit continues it can lead to reduced stream flow lake levels and groundwater resulting in hydrological drought the lack of rainfall and water supply causes soil moisture deficits which are associated with agricultural droughts finally socioeconomic drought occurs when water demand for social and economic activities exceeds water supply due to weather related shortages including impacts from meteorological agricultural or hydrological droughts elhag and zhang 2018 among natural hazards drought is one of the costliest ones because it reduces water availability which negatively affects agriculture and socioeconomic prosperity wilhite 2000 droughts are increasing in intensity and frequency as water resources are becoming limited across many regions in a warming climate posing detrimental effects on society and our planet gudmundsson et al 2021 v√∂r√∂smarty et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 zhongming et al 2021 drought monitoring has traditionally relied on in situ measurements but advances in earth observation technologies have transformed drought monitoring methods earth observations utilize different satellite missions to remotely sense different hydrological variables around the world precipitation is estimated by using some satellite missions instruments for instance global precipitation measurement gpm huffman et al 2020 mohammed et al 2018a 2018b 2018c and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 le et al 2020b the introduction of satellite based precipitation products can enhance the spatio temporal coverage of meteorological drought mapping and monitoring zhang et al 2017 moreover agricultural drought monitoring research can utilize microwave sensors to acquire soil moisture content for characterizing soil moisture deficits bolten and crow 2012 microwave sensors provide continuous coverage over large geographical areas and do not suffer from limitations associated with daylight availability and cloud coverage lakshmi 2013 surface soil moisture is extracted from various satellite missions equipped with active passive microwave sensors such as soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 or soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 additionally remote sensing have enabled measurement of the earth s total water storage in response to hydrological groundwater droughts via the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission tapley et al 2004 grace observed variations in terrestrial water storage tws at all water storage locations soil moisture surface water and groundwater the grace satellite is unique as it measures below beneath the top five centimeters of the surface without being affected by surface conditions numerous studies have successfully used grace data to monitor hydrological droughts frappart et al 2013 rodell et al 2009 thomas et al 2017 in web of science search drought related publications based on satellite remote sensing have increased from fewer than 5 per year in 1982 to more than 300 per year in 2014 west et al 2019 sheffield et al 2018 discusses that remote sensing technologies have a significant role in improving water management throughout data scarce regions overall earth observations have been increasingly used in recent decades for drought monitoring as their capacity to provide continuous observations over large spatial domains for several key hydrologic variables such as precipitation hou et al 2014 soil moisture bolten et al 2010 bolten and lakshmi 2009 chan et al 2016 and terrestrial water storage syed et al 2008 has been improving over the lower mekong river basin lmrb the agricultural system is sensitive to seasonal uncertainty and droughts are expected to increase in frequency and intensity around 70 of the population in the lmrb engages in agricultural activities abhishek et al 2021 as the majority of agriculture in the region relies on rain seasonality poses uncertainties about agricultural productivity and subsequent livelihood activities jones et al 2003 mrc 2003 the causes of droughts in the mekong region are possibly 1 climate change 2 low rainfall 3 dry weather and high temperatures 4 el ni√±o southern oscillation phenomenon and 5 disagreements on water politics over chinese dam construction and operation basist and williams 2020 keovilignavong et al 2021 in future drought projections thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 demonstrated that drought severity and peak could be elevated significantly in the lmrb as analyzed from outputs from 15 global climate models gcms based on eight of the gcms of cmip6 dong et al 2022 reported that drought conditions will last longer during the dry season in most of the lmrb unfavorable climate conditions are projected in the mekong delta as increasing drought months mondal et al 2022 or drought intensity li et al 2021 remote sensing based drought monitoring in the lmrb is an area of research that requires more attention meteorological and agricultural drought monitoring using satellite observations are among the most impactful topics son et al 2012 tran et al 2019 for more details please see table 1 but there is room for improvement most studies investigated remote sensing based drought monitoring in large scale regions however understanding of local hydrological information would be beneficial to inform local decision makers microwave remote sensing provides a promising way to understand drought condition related to soil moisture deficits entekhabi et al 2010 to date there have been only a few studies assessing microwave remote sensing products over lmrb this is due to the lack of in situ soil moisture network to validate microwave remote sensing of soil moisture there is only one previous study that has attempted to validate c band microwave satellite based soil moisture in the lmrb naeimi et al 2013 however this study used an indirect method through the evapotranspiration variable to validate soil moisture advanced soil moisture measurement using l band microwave was attempted in the lmrb but no in situ validation has been previously discussed dandridge et al 2020 kang et al 2021 this research aims to demonstrate the relevance of nasa satellite observations for drought monitoring over the lmrb by 1 examination of historical drought conditions in 2015 16 using spaceborne data from precipitation soil moisture and terrestrial water storage 2 assessment of high resolution smap soil moisture to track the dynamics of the 2015 16 drought event at the watershed level 3 cross validation of soil moisture and precipitation and streamflow derived drought indices we examined the 2015 16 drought one of the worst natural disasters over the lmrb in recent years causing tremendous impacts of socio economic and livelihood in the region mrc 2019 we used gpm imerg for precipitation smap 9 km and its downscaled 1 km product for soil moisture grace for terrestrial water storage also to gain insights about drought conditions at regional scale we focused on the entire basin as well as the smaller watersheds we obtained in situ monthly streamflow over 16 catchments within lmrb and assessed co variability of precipitation soil moisture and observed streamflow during the water year of 2015 16 there is no in situ soil moisture network within lmrb but in the southeast asia region similar biomass and climate there are two available in situ soil moisture networks therefore we validated smap soil moisture products with these two networks finally we cross validated smap soil moisture products and gpm imerg precipitation with a hydrological drought index derived from observed monthly streamflow 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas the mekong river 795 000 km2 is one of the largest rivers in southeast asia originating from the tibetan plateau of china then flowing through six countries before ending to the east sea of vietnam the mekong is arguably one of the most important rivers in southeast asia as many regional economic sectors including agriculture energy and fishery doan et al 2020 tran et al 2021 heavily depend on water from this basin in the mekong river basin there are two main sub basins the upper mekong river basin and the lower mekong river basin the lower mekong river basin lmrb spans through thailand lao pdr cambodia and vietnam and is made up of the northern highlands the khorat plateau the tonle sap basin and the mekong delta with a total landmass of about 600 000 km2 at the beginning of 2015 there was a severe drought across the lmrb that imposed negative impacts on the agricultural and fishing industries in the basin that led to significant economic losses binh et al 2021 guo et al 2017 mrc 2019 park et al 2022 in thailand the drought of 2015 caused the economic damage worth 1 7 billion usd additionally more than 9 56 million people were affected in the 2015 16 drought making this one of the costliest natural disasters in southeast asia over the past 20 years kang et al 2021 mrc 2019 even over the last 90 years in mekong delta kantoush et al 2017 2 2 in situ datasets 2 2 1 streamflow in this study streamflow records from tributaries of the lower mekong river basin were obtained from the royal irrigation department rid and vietnam meteorological and hydrological administration vmha both the rid and vmha are officially responsible for monitoring river water level and discharge in thailand and vietnam respectively for rid data we downloaded discharge records that are publicly accessible from the agency s website http water rid go th hyd last accessed february 3 2022 for vmha data we obtained data directly from the authority data is not publicly accessible we identified basic metadata i e geographical coordinates and catchment area of each gauge using information available on the rid s website and from station documents provided by vmha officers to support our assessment of the 2015 16 drought event we selected 16 catchments the drainage area ranges from 248 to 10 878 km¬≤ with a median of 992 km¬≤ based on the following criteria a adequate data coverage there are at least 20 values of monthly discharge for each calendar month this ensures that we have sufficient data points to reliably estimate the distributions underlying our standardized streamflow index ssi b there are no missing values during the period of 2015 16 so that we can have a complete drought condition for the event c there are no dams within the catchments we use stimson s mekong infrastructure tracker https www stimson org project mekong infrastructure as the basis to implement this assessment a geographical map of the lmrb and 16 catchments is shown in fig 1 whereas a detailed description of the stream gauges is shown in table 2 2 2 2 soil moisture there are no permanent sites or field campaigns to collect soil moisture in the lmrb however in southeast asia region with a similar climate and biomass as the lmrb the international soil moisture network has maintained two in situ soil moisture networks within this region dorigo et al 2021 these networks include mysmnet network malaysia kang et al 2019 and vds network myanmar the mysmnet has seven stations with data availability from may 2014 to december 2015 while vds has four stations with data availability from june 2016 to february 2021 the major land use in the location of these two networks are savannas woody mysmnet and cropland vds we used ground based soil moisture measurements from these two networks to validate satellite based smap soil moisture products during their overlap period we obtained the in situ soil moisture datasets from the international soil moisture network https ismn earth en 2 3 earth observations datasets 2 3 1 gpm precipitation the gpm global precipitation measurement core observatory was launched on february 27 2014 the satellite has ka and ku bands radar and a 13 channel microwave radiometer and is designed to provide new standard rainfall and snowfall observations globally every half hour the sensors include dual frequency dpr precipitation radar and gmi gpm microwave imager and extend the measurement range of the trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission hou et al 2014 huffman 2016 huffman et al 2020 in this study we obtained half hour 0 1 degree gpm datasets from the latest version of imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm final run v6 https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm ranging from 2001 to 2020 the gpm imerg datasets are then accumulated on a monthly basis 2 3 2 smap soil moisture the soil moisture active passive smap is a soil moisture focused mission that is operating in a near polar sun synchronous orbit and with two overpasses morning 6 a m and afternoon 6 p m and revisits every 2 3 days the soil moisture estimates are retrieved from a 0 5 cm soil layer with a threshold of vegetation water content 5 kg m2 from an l band radiometer at 1 41 ghz chan et al 2016 the smap soil moisture retrievals can be downscaled by correlating the surface temperature difference to the soil moisture as a function of vegetation cover fang et al 2013 for example at the global scale the 9 km smap soil moisture is downscaled to 1 km using gldas global land data assimilation system and modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer land surface temperature and vegetation index this downscaled soil moisture has been validated against field observations as well as aircraft data sets using 1400 in situ observing sites at a global scale fang et al 2022 in this study we obtained 9 km smap level 3 at the national snow and ice data center nsidc https nsidc org data smap and downscaled smap 1 km soil moisture from fang et al 2022 2 3 3 grace terrestrial water storage we use grace rl06 product and grace fo rl06 products for examination of the terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa syed et al 2008a the data are global and are at a spatial resolution of 1 and a temporal repeat of one month for the terrestrial water anomalies these anomalies depict the changes in the total water column of earth which includes surface sub surface and groundwater components syed et al 2008a grace has been used in global basins lakshmi et al 2018 and indian river basins kansara and lakshmi 2021 in this study the anomalies of terrestrial water storage are used twsa obtaining from the physical oceanography distributed active archive center podaac https podaac jpl nasa gov datasetlist search grace 20 2002 2017 2 4 methods 2 4 1 areal value estimates from gridded earth observations datasets spatiotemporal changes of drought signal at a basin are usually monitored by assessing variabilities of precipitation soil moisture and terrestrial water storage derived from gridded satellite observations lakshmi et al 2018 voss et al 2013 wang et al 2020 in this study gridded monthly gpm imerg precipitation smap 9 km soil moisture downscaled smap 1 km soil moisture and grace twsa products were extracted over the lmrb and sixteen watersheds during the water year from october 2015 to september 2016 mean areal value for each variable was estimated to evaluate the ability of earth observing satellites for monitoring drought across the study domain we used thiessen polygon areal weighted value le et al 2022 thiessen 1911 to calculate mean areal value as considering the case that one pixel from earth observations datasets may not be completely located within a target domain 2 4 2 lag time analysis with cross correlation the cross correlation between precipitation and twsa and between soil moisture and twsa were investigated to assess the relationship and lagged time between the variables during the drought event the responsibility of twsa to the changes in precipitation and or reflection in soil moisture changes to the precipitation variability can exhibit the propagation time from the precipitation deficit to the soil water deficit followed by water deficits realized in deeper groundwater 2 4 3 monitoring drought dynamic with high resolution smap soil moisture the spatial resolution of earth observation data has been a key issue in monitoring drought at catchment scale for example spatial resolution of smap soil moisture 9 km is not ideal for detecting the changes in environmental variables and human activities irrigation system over sub basins the recent advancements in downscaling smap soil moisture fang et al 2020 2022 enable us to further explore soil moisture patterns this study analyses the variability of the highest spatial resolution satellite soil moisture products at global coverage to offer a better understanding of changes in soil moisture under drought conditions in several sub basins with different catchment sizes 2 4 4 drought indices from precipitation and streamflow we employed standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standardized streamflow index ssi farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 telesca et al 2012 gringorten 1963 to assess meteorological drought and hydrological drought respectively the spi relies primarily on the probability of precipitation whereas the ssi is based on the probability of streamflow values these indices were both chosen to investigate the drought conditions and explore these two variables in relation to each other and the drought spi and ssi are both normalized to zero mean and one standard deviation these variables can be compared across time and space with other spi ssi values as they are standardized since spi and ssi are calculated separately each month the seasonal cycle should not affect them telesca et al 2012 in each catchment both indices have been calculated at 1 month timescales with areal monthly gpm imerg as input for spi and monthly observed streamflow as input for ssi it must be noted that data length is essential to spi and ssi calculations therefore we used 20 years of gpm imerg data and 20 years of observed streamflow data to calculate spi and ssi respectively then we extracted spi and ssi values for the 2015 16 drought event we used standardized drought analysis toolbox sdat farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 with two parameter gamma distribution and empirical distribution to estimate spi and ssi time series respectively a drought condition occurs when spi ssi is under 1 mckee et al 1993 appendix 1 and appendix 2 contain details regarding drought calculations and thresholds for spi and ssi respectively we assessed drought characteristics in terms of drought duration and drought severity drought durations indicate total months in which drought indices values were under the drought threshold whereas drought severity is based on mean values of drought indices values during the drought duration periods le et al 2020a 2019 a drought episode occurred during the investigated period when at least two consecutive months having values classified as drought condition to this end table 3 summarizes the data used in this study and fig 2 illustrates the overall methodology 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of smap soil moisture in the studied region over our region of interest there is no prior work of validating smap soil moisture using in situ measurements therefore we conducted a validation study before applying smap soil moisture for our drought analysis it is noted that we used two in situ networks in the southeast asia region similar climate and biomass as the lmrb for the purpose of this evaluation the pixel to point approach was used to match satellite based soil moisture products with soil moisture measured from the in situ networks we first evaluated absolute values of smap soil moisture against in situ soil moisture measurements to carry out this task we normalized satellite based soil moisture products smap 9 km sm9 and its downscaled smap 1 km sm1 against the reference dataset in situ measurement using the normalized equation draper et al 2009 kim et al 2015 please see appendix 3 to see this equation in details we observed a good correlation between both smap products and ground measurements as the pairwise points were around the 1 1 line of the scatter plots fig 3 the sm1 product exhibited a slightly higher correlation for both networks spearman correlation coefficient values are 0 903 and 0 865 for mysmnet and vds respectively we further assessed delta changes between satellite based soil moisture and in situ soil moisture in this evaluation we did not apply the normalized equation we used delta changes to cross validate smap soil moisture in monitoring drought with standardized streamflow index ssi see section 3 5 we specifically focus on available data during the period of 2015 16 which overlaps with the investigated historical drought year with this constraint only mysmnet network has been used the delta changes rates between in situ soil moisture and sm9 soil moisture were found to be significantly related cc 0 48 and delta change rates between in situ soil moisture and sm1 soil moisture were found to be significantly related cc 0 57 for more details please see appendix 4 there is concern about the use of smap soil moisture in forest cover regions most microwave satellite based sm data over densely vegetated areas are masked out because biomass saturates the microwave signal resulting in high errors and uncertainties for sm retrievals in two field temperate forest canopy experiments in the northeast united states colliander et al 2020 reported a root mean square difference rmsd of 0 047 0 057 m3 m3 and a pearson correlation range of 0 75 0 85 for a parameterized emission model using the smap morning overpass this study demonstrates the sensitivity of soil moisture under dense forest canopies which had been uncertain due to a lack of representative reference data in a global scale error assessment of soil moisture estimates kim et al 2020 showed that model based sm could provide accurate sm estimates than microwave satellite based sm retrieval in a study within the lmrb microwave based satellite estimates over cropland has more reasonable estimates than forest land naeimi et al 2013 in our study half of the studied watersheds are dominated by cropland and shrubland land cover table 2 smap soil moisture estimates for these land cover types are generally reliable chan et al 2016 colliander et al 2017 in cambodia where is dominated by cropland abhishek et al 2021 used smap soil moisture as a reference for soil moisture outputs from their hydrological model on the other hand the remaining watersheds have no dominant land cover mainly mixed forest and grassland table 2 in these non dominant land cover watersheds dense vegetation coverage can be expected and smap soil moisture estimates may be uncertain to minimize this risk of uncertainties we chose not to use absolute smap soil moisture values but delta changes when cross validating smap soil moisture with other drought indices 3 2 variability of precipitation soil moisture and total water in the lower mekong river basin during 2015 16 the lower mekong river basin has faced a severe drought in 2015 16 fig 4a shows the variability of precipitation soil moisture and total water storage anomalies twsa from october 2015 to september 2016 the patterns of precipitation soil moisture and twsa show a very interesting pattern of correlation though lagged in time the rainfall begins to decrease in the extreme northern and northeastern portions of the basin in october 2015 this is followed by an almost complete drying of the basin albeit the southeastern edge and the vietnam mekong delta in november by december 2015 the entire basin has less than 100 mm of precipitation and this continues into january through march 2016 in this period there are portions of the basin that receive less than 10 mm of precipitation in a month however this changes in april 2016 when the north central portion of the basin receives precipitation more than 100 mm for the month and this continues into may 2016 when the same region receives around 150 mm of precipitation by june 2016 the entire basin has over 150 mm of precipitation except for small regions in the north june 2016 and in the south and east july 2016 south and west august 2016 and extreme north september 2016 it is interesting to observe that soil moisture responds almost immediately to the changes in precipitation but the spatial patterns are not the same the soil moisture is generally always greater than 0 4 in the vietnam mekong delta the southern most portion of the basin and this is true even during periods of low precipitation the reason for this could be due to irrigation and or standing water the vietnam mekong delta is the heart of rice cultivation in the basin if we compare the precipitation and soil moisture to the spatial patterns of the terrestrial water storage anomalies we see a lag of up to 2 3 months for recovery of the groundwater this is expected as the increase in precipitation reflects almost immediately in the soil moisture but there is a time lag for this water to reach the aquifers and register in the twsa in fig 4b we see the basin averaged gpm precipitation black line with circles 9 km smap soil moisture red dashed line with squares and the grace terrestrial water storage are plotted for october 2015 to september 2016 it is very clearly seen that the drop in the precipitation results in a corresponding drop of the soil moisture between october 2015 150 mm and february 2016 nearly zero the precipitation starts to increase from around march 2016 less than 10 mm to june 2016 280 mm and the soil moisture follows 0 37 in october 2015 0 2 in march 2016 the precipitation shows a slight dip between june and july 2016 280 260 mm but the soil moisture continues its increase till july 2016 0 38 following which the soil moisture shows a slight drop to august 2016 and then increases to september 2016 the precipitation on the other hand keeps on increasing between july and september 2016 the total water storage anomalies twsa show a distinct lag with the precipitation and soil moisture whereas precipitation and soil moisture show almost monthly similarities the twsa decreases till may 2016 22 mm and only begins to recover in july and august 2016 5 mm and 6 mm respectively thereby lagging the increase in precipitation by about 4 months march july the correlation coefficients between precipitation and soil moisture are 0 91 between p and twsa is 0 15 no lag 0 6 lag 1 month 0 7 lag 2 months and sm and twsa is 0 5 no lag 0 8 lag 1 month and 0 7 lag 2 months several prior studies confirm similar findings as ours from satellite sensors using diverse approaches according to abhishek et al 2021 persistent dry spells were observed over cambodia from 2015 to mid 2016 based on a modeling framework based on 30 years of reanalysis of precipitation data guo et al 2017 found that 2015 16 were the driest in the lmrb with drought affected areas of up to 75 and serve drought events lasted from april 2015 to july 2016 in a near real time drought monitoring experiment zhang et al 2020 detected significant drought episodes during the 2015 16 dry season november to april 3 3 examination of high spatial soil moisture variability for sub catchments one of the objectives of this work was to use satellite based sensors to help understand the spatial and temporal propagation of the drought signal in small watersheds normally studies of droughts have been limited to larger watersheds due to the low spatial resolution of the satellite observations however with the downscaling of the smap 9 km soil moisture to 1 km and its global availability we are able to study smaller watersheds on the order of a few hundred square kilometers in this sub section we will examine the spatial and temporal propagation of the drought for five watersheds table 2 in the lower mekong river basin with a range of areas on various river systems viz g 9 river system name mae kok area 386 km2 banyen river system nam mua area 638 km2 kh 28 a river system khong area 1271 km2 g 8 river system name mae kok area 2909 km2 and i 14 river system khong area 6266 km2 the choice of these watersheds also spans a range of geographical diversity and the availability of soil moisture datasets fig 1 and table 2 in fig 5 soil moisture for catchment g 9 generally declines between october 2015 and april 2016 due to the decreasing precipitation noted in fig 4b focusing on soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 1 km during this dry out phase we see a sub pixel variability in the smap 9 km soil moisture pixel as a reflection of differential drying this is especially true for february 2016 where some pixels show particular wetness most likely due to irrigation when comparing boxplots of soil moisture at different spatial resolutions we observe a greater range in 1 km soil moisture from december 2015 through april 2016 a slight subsequent decrease in soil moisture can be noted across both datasets in september 2016 due to increased evaporation similar spatial and temporal patterns in the other four watersheds are examined in this section in the case of the banyen watershed fig 6 the soil moisture experiences a decline from january 0 37 to march 0 32 however the variability of soil moisture at the spatial resolution of 1 km shows more detailed information especially in february 2016 with some locations still wet and others much drier we also observe interesting nuance in soil moisture especially in the southern part during the dry spell in april 2016 and localized wetness in september 2016 in the case of kh 28 a fig 7 the decrease in precipitation from october 2015 100 m to march 2016 less than 10 mm is matched by the steady decline in soil moisture especially at 1 km spatial resolution the wetting up is not as obvious in the spatial soil moisture plots at kh 28 a as it was in previous catchments however we see that the soil moisture at 1 km consistently captures a greater range of variability in the boxplots this is especially apparent in the month of july 2016 where the 1 km soil moisture shows a considerably higher range than that of 9 km soil moisture this is possibly because the 1 km spatial resolution can pick up smaller wetter irrigated patches the g 8 fig 8 and i 14 fig 9 catchments exhibit similar patterns the soil moisture at both the 9 and 1 km spatial resolution does not show a consistent watershed wide decrease in fact some areas specifically in the northeast corner of the watershed show wetter areas between october 2015 to february 2016 around 0 35 most likely caused by irrigation once again at these two catchments we see that the soil moisture at 1 km provides a much wider range of information this is true across the whole time series during both the dry and wet periods some hollow spots are visible on the spatial pattern maps of smap 1 km soil moisture e g figs 7 to 9 the modis land surface temperature lst data are contaminated by clouds resulting in incomplete spatial coverage pham et al 2021 2018 since lst is an independent variable in the 1 km downscaling algorithm its limited coverage impacts the smap 1 km coverage 3 4 co variability of precipitation soil moisture and streamflow fig 10 provides the time series of the watershed spatially averaged monthly precipitation runoff soil moisture at 9 and 1 km spatial resolution for the five watersheds that we discussed in the previous section 3 2 viz g 9 banyen kh 28 a g 8 and i 14 in a b c d and e respectively the common thread among all these plots and watersheds is the fact that the watershed precipitation decreases similarly to the decreases in the larger lower mekong river basin between october 2015 and march 2016 between around 100 mm in october 2015 to almost negligible in march 2016 then the precipitation increases peaking at different times to different amounts in the different watersheds in g 9 it is about 300 mm for june 2016 400 m in banyen in august 2016 240 mm in kh 28 a in june 2016 250 mm in june 2016 and 320 mm in i 14 in some of these watersheds the precipitation stays nearly constant after peaking or dropping the largest drop is in banyen fig 10b where the precipitation drops from 400 m in august 2016 150 mm in september 2016 the changes in the precipitation are reflected in the runoff in all the watersheds the runoff remains at very low amounts less than 10 mm till may or june 2016 and then shows an increasing trend for the remainder of the year in g 9 this increase is to about 50 mm in september 2016 in banyen the increase is to 200 mm for august 2016 and then a drop to 120 mm for september 2016 for kh 28 a there is a continual increase to 120 mm in september 2016 there is a slight increase to about 40 mm in g 8 in september 2016 and to 100 m for i 14 in september 2016 the soil moisture exhibits a temporal trend that tracks the precipitation very closely with an initial dry down in all the watersheds between october 2015 to april 2016 followed by an increase to july 2016 followed by a slight decrease mirroring the precipitation the minimum soil moisture in most of these watersheds is reached in march or april 2016 and is close to 0 15 in almost all the watersheds there is a deviation from the negative trend between october 2015 to march april 2016 with a local maximum in january 2016 most likely due to local irrigation in the watersheds this upward bump is not seen in the spatial average over the lower mekong river basin fig 4b where the soil moisture stays constant between december 2015 and january 2016 this increase varies in different watersheds with the largest increase observed in the banyen watershed 0 29 0 4 and a very slight increase in kh 28 a 0 18 and 0 21 there is a very good agreement between the soil moisture at the 9 and 1 km spatial resolutions table 4 lists the watersheds percentage of monthly available soil moisture for the 9 and 1 km spatial resolution and the correlation between the variables precipitation runoff soil moisture at 9 and 1 km spatial resolutions and all the cross correlations this table demonstrates the high correlation between precipitation runoff and soil moisture in almost all the watersheds except for banyen where the correlations are generally low one of the reasons for this could be the fact that there is irrigation and a use of surface water for agricultural activities in this watershed and that disrupts the natural connections between precipitation runoff and soil moisture with that exception it is generally seen that most correlations are greater than 0 7 and many of the correlations such as between precipitation and soil moisture are in the 0 9 range this demonstrates the effective use of satellite data in monitoring the drought and linking it to observed stream flow the high correlation between soil moisture at 9 and 1 km spatial resolutions demonstrates the consistency of the two data sets 3 5 hydrological variability and relation with indices fig 11 presents variations of monthly precipitation anomalies and runoff anomalies along with relationship between spi 1 and ssi 1 at 16 small watersheds during the water year of 2015 16 generally the runoff anomaly did not follow the same pattern as the anomaly in precipitation the monthly averaged precipitation anomalies were greater than the long run precipitation averages between december 2015 to january 2016 20 mm and between june to july 2016 60 mm fig 11a on the other hand the averaged runoff anomalies were lower than long run runoff values for all months especially from october december 2015 30 mm and august september 2016 20 mm fig 11b drought duration and drought severity based on spi and ssi reveal significant difference in drought characteristics obtained by these two drought indices table 5 spi based drought durations across catchments often lasted 2 3 months average of 2 1 months while ssi based drought durations were longer ranging from 2 to 12 months with an average of 5 4 months in some catchments g 9 krongbuk kh 61 kh 72 and g 8 there were more than two hydrological drought events during the period of 2015 16 in contrast no hydrological drought events were observed in the banyen and kh 58 a catchments during this period the reason for this could be due to large water storage in aquifers that can discharge to streamflow in these catchments during drought development phase we also examined the cross correlation between spi 1 and ssi 1 across small watersheds observing the highest correlation coefficient cc varying from the lag of zero lag 0 to the lag of two months lag 2 stream gauges that have the highest correlation between spi and ssi with the lag 0 lag 1 and lag 2 are provided in fig 11 c d and e respectively the highest correlation coefficient values are provided in the supplementary s1 among six stream gauges with lag of zero there was only one gauge having statistically significant correlation located at the northeast of the lmrb fig 11c three of four stream gauges located in the northwest the west and the southeast of the region have statistical significance of correlation with propagation time of one month fig 11d whereas only two gauges in six stream gauges with lagged time of two months distributed in the west of the basin fig 11e the background map of fig 11c e shows the averaged twsa during the water year 2015 16 the region with negative twsa is drier than normal conditions while positive twsa region is wetter than normal conditions the results are quite surprising because it is contrary to what is known about links between catchment water storage capacity and response time of catchment and hence lag time between spi 1 and ssi 1 major water stores positive twsa in catchment create long memory in hydrological system which makes long response time of catchment and long propagation time between meteorological drought and hydrological drought as well however longer lag times between spi and ssi were found at dry catchments fig 11e and fast responding catchments had positive twsa fig 11c in other words our understanding on large scale observation from grace may not be true when we move to small size watersheds in summary the differences in anomalies patterns between precipitation and runoff as well as differences in drought characteristics between meteorological drought spi and hydrological drought ssi suggest us that the impact of precipitation on the severity of drought during 2015 16 was mild also the coarse resolution of grace data seems not truly to reflect the co variability between precipitation and runoff at the small watersheds we introduced delta changes in months to cross validate drought monitoring between ssi spi and soil moisture at 9 km sm9 and 1 km sm1 delta change values have two benefits first catchments have flux memories precipitation soil moisture and streamflow flux changes between months could indicate dryness or wetness signals second we could use short record soil moisture data in detecting dryness wetness signals since satellite based soil moisture is only available for a short period as compared to the data length required for spi and ssi we only need current values to calculate delta changes but not for long term values fig 12 characterizes monthly changes in ssi spi and soil moisture at 9 km sm9 and 1 km sm1 we only examined the co variability of changes in ssi spi sm9 and sm1 at five basins which almost have fully coverage of soil moisture both 9 km and 1 km at a monthly time step during the 2015 16 period fig 12a e fig 12f presents cross correlation between monthly changes in ssi and monthly changes in spi sm9 and sm1 we found out that small catchments g 9 bye and kh 28 a the relationship between monthly changes in ssi could related to the changes in spi and soil moisture datasets with a statistically significant at level 0 1 it is quite possible true as in the small watersheds routing time is short and transfer the loss in precipitation and soil moisture to runoff can occur immediately among the relationships the highest values were observed between monthly changes in sm1 and ssi followed by sm9 and ssi and spi and ssi it can be likely that soil moisture is a land surface parameter which directly relates to runoff rather than precipitation atmospheric parameter the better of sm1 in liking with the changes in runoff also indicates its usefulness in accurately capturing dryness wetness pixels in the small watersheds on the other hand at the large basins g 8 and i 14 the relationship between monthly changes in spi sm9 and sm1 with monthly changes in ssi were weak it may be due to the heterogeneity of land cover and complexity of routing process in the large catchments causing non linear process between the loss of precipitation and soil moisture to runoff 4 conclusions this study aims to assess whether nasa satellite sensors can be useful for monitoring a major drought event with spatially heterogeneous impacts this work builds up on and complements traditional studies of droughts in two ways 1 most studies focus on use of drought metrics computed using precipitation standard precipitation index or evapotranspiration standard precipitation evapotranspiration index but this study uses explicitly precipitation soil moisture and streamflow to track the evolution of the drought 2 most previous studies have focused on large watersheds while smaller watersheds have generally not been studied on an individual basic we investigated various sensors with different spatial resolutions including grace 100 kilometers gpm 10 kilometers smap 10 kilometers and downscaled smap soil moisture 1 kilometer the motivation of this study is to showcase the potential of using remotely sensed data to support water assessment over basins that are not monitored intensively or limited in data sharing our findings show that at the large scale lmrb precipitation soil moisture and total water are well correlated specifically soil moisture and precipitation track each other and total water lags by a few months at the catchment level we observe a strong correlation between precipitation soil moisture and streamflow grace observations however do not reasonably reflect hydrological processes at the smaller catchment scales due to their low spatial resolution for example several dry catchments negative tws observed from grace show longer lag time response between ssi and spi as compared to the wet catchments positive tws from a theoretical perspective less water stored in the catchment results in a short memory in the hydrological system this enables a quick response time of the catchment and quick propagation between meteorological and hydrological droughts the availability of 1 km soil moisture observations highlights the ability to make water resources and land management decisions at the local scale this high spatial resolution information can assist in specific agricultural decisions such as water availability during time of planting and or harvest moreover the benefits gained from devising operational drought monitoring framework with high spatial resolution soil moisture data are seen in strategic preparedness plans to combat droughts and mitigate their effects on the activities in the various sectors of the economy starting from the small scale up to large ones moreover we find that monthly changes in the streamflow standardized index ssi are closely related to downscaled 1 km soil moisture at small catchment scales as compared to the standardized precipitation index spi this opens a possibility of using 1 km soil moisture as a substitution of the hydrological drought ssi as its publicly available and easier to access than the ground runoff data the approach from this study can be further applied in other regions where episodes of drought are occurring at various spatial and temporal resolutions the work presented here can be further refined to include upcoming high resolution surface water satellite products small scale detailed assessments of drought detection are expected to witness a breakthrough through the

7743,study region the damodar river basin india study focus water resource assessment at the river basin scale is crucial for human well being and ecosystem health and it can be performed quantitatively through green water gw and blue water bw flow evaluation however the quantification of bw and gw through land surface models lsms is significantly influenced by the accuracy of precipitation datasets in this present study the spatiotemporal variation of blue and green water resources under the influence of six secondary precipitation products spps aphrodite imdaa wfdei princeton chirps persiann cdr are investigated using jules lsm considering india meteorological department imd precipitation product as an observed precipitation dataset this will help in examining the dependencies of precipitation datasets on partitioning between bw and gw distribution in a tropical river basin new hydrological insights for the study region the results suggest significant differences in bw and gw simulation with the use of six aforementioned spps in comparison to the reference imd based jules model simulation the annual average bw and gw estimates varied significantly from 9 05 to 40 and 15 24 to 11 79 respectively due to changes in the spps furthermore the higher correlation between bw and precipitation datasets r2 0 84 0 96 suggested that bw is more sensitive to precipitation changes in comparison to gw overall our study emphasizes the importance of carefully considering the specification of precipitation databases for estimating bw and gw in a tropical river basin graphical abstract ga1 keywords land surface model jules precipitation uncertainty blue water green water damodar river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the 21st century water scarcity has become a global issue due to increasing population agricultural expansion urbanization rapid industrialization and economic development which is making an influence on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems mall et al 2006 therefore it is necessary to appraise the freshwater availability for better water resources management as well as to make this world resilient to water scarcity in changing environment mao et al 2020 rockstr√∂m et al 2009 the most appropriate method for freshwater availability assessment as suggested by falkenmark 1995 is a classification of freshwater resources into blue and green water resources bgw conversely the quantification of bgw is still a challenging task worldwide with the declining in situ gauging stations sahoo et al 2020 2022 emphasizing the component analysis of bgw blue water bw resources include groundwater and the surface water from rivers lakes aquifers and manmade infrastructure whereas green water gw resources are the water available in vegetation canopy and soil water profile the quantification of bw plays a crucial role in water security assessment in a given region as it is directly associated with human needs such as domestic water requirement irrigation water requirement industrial production and power generation while the gw is essential for plant growth rainfed agriculture and terrestrial ecosystem services approximately two third of the global water resources are stored as gw according to the existing literature hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 siebert and d√∂ll 2010 more than 87 of water is used for worldwide agricultural production which is supported by the gw hence the proper assessment of bgw resources is essential for the socioeconomic development food production and sustainability of the terrestrial ecosystem numerous researchers have estimated bgw through various hydrological models across the world lee and bae 2015 mao et al 2020 veettil and mishra 2018 for instance with the implication of the soil and water assessment tool swat model xie et al 2020 quantified the bgw in the yellow river basin china similarly veettil and mishra 2016 quantified the same under the influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities in the savannah river basin usa in india dey and remesan 2022 have also focused on the multimodel quantification of bgw by using two hydrological models hysim and swat which are different concerning their structures applied over the damodar river basin drb although the hydrological models have been extensively used for the quantification of bgw the recent modifications inclusion of river flow routing module and runoff generation schemes modules in land surface models lsms have gained adequate attention among the scientific community for the same yassin et al 2019 lsms are the comprehensive appliance that represents the exchange of energy water and carbon fluxes between the land surface and atmosphere tsarouchi et al 2014 one of the strengths of lsms is the consideration of feedback mechanisms between the land surface and atmosphere which provide an opportunity for the hydrologists to identify the response of the atmosphere against the changes in hydrology and land surface properties as well as repercussions of ignoring the atmospheric feedback in hydrological scenario simulations overgaard et al 2006 in addition lsms are also robust for the computation of evapotranspiration by directly solving the energy and mass balance equation for the realistic representation of bw and gw resources there is a need to diagnose the processes involved during photosynthesis and crop growth e g biophysical consistency between energy water carbon and nutrient processes which could be well represented through lsm zulkafli et al 2013 the runoff generation and river routing processes are very crucial components in lsm as they control the accuracy of water flux heat flux and soil moisture simulation in land surface processes sheng et al 2017 which eventually impact the quantification of bgw various runoff generation and river routing schemes have been introduced in lsms to improve runoff representation and streamflow simulation respectively campoy et al 2013 lawrence et al 2011 many researchers have evaluated the runoff and river routing scheme for streamflow simulation at the river basin scale and found that these schemes can vary based on the physical properties of a given river basin such as soil characteristics topography and so on for instance mackellar et al 2013 evaluated two runoff generation schemes in jules lsm for streamflow simulation at three catchments in south africa and concluded that no single runoff generation scheme is best for all catchments for streamflow simulation similarly the sensitivity of the runoff production scheme of jules lsm was also investigated by mart√≠nez de la torre et al 2019 in 13 catchments of great britain therefore it is important to evaluate the performance of river routing and runoff generation schemes for streamflow simulation at regional and basin scales rather than global scales and also to select the suitable scheme for a given river basin apart from the runoff generation and river routing schemes the accuracy of lsm simulation also suffers from several uncertainties viz meteorological forcing data model parameters and model physics dumedah and walker 2014 nair and indu 2017 nearing et al 2016 previous studies on uncertainty in lsm simulations suggested that precipitation is by far the most crucial component in the overall uncertainty of these models gottschalck et al 2005 shrestha et al 2020 zhou et al 2012 as its spatiotemporal variability has a substantial impact on the hydrological behavior of any given river basin panda et al 2022 pang et al 2020 generally rain gauges are operated to measure the precipitation in situ however the rain gauge measurement can be significantly affected due to several issues viz data gaps sensor failure sparse rain gauge networks in mountainous and remote locations darand et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 musie et al 2019 which can lead to poor representation of precipitation variability in recent years many satellite based remote sensing and reanalysis datasets hereafter also named as secondary precipitation products spps have been developed to solve the aforementioned issues associated with rain gauge measurement these spps are particularly beneficial for studies related to climatic research and hydrological modeling ashouri et al 2015 conti et al 2014 xue et al 2013 yong et al 2014 there are several freely accessible spps available worldwide with varying temporal 3 hourly to daily and spatial resolutions 0 05¬∫ to 0 5¬∫ which can be broadly classified as gauge based asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation aphrodite yatagai et al 2012 reanalysis indian monsoon data assimilation and analysis imdaa rani et al 2021 princeton sheffield et al 2006 satellite climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 and merged watch forcing data era interim wfdei weedon et al 2014 precipitation product among these spps imdaa is the recently developed regional reanalysis precipitation products available over the indian subcontinent which is developed by the collaboration among met office uk national centre for medium range weather forecasting india ncmwrf and india meteorological department imd see rani et al 2021 despite the widespread usage of the spps the accuracy of the spps is dependent on several factors including terrain climate and distribution of precipitation in a given region seyyedi et al 2014 demaria et al 2011 hence performance evaluation of precipitation datasets is essential for regional scale studies to select suitable datasets that can be further used for hydrological modeling and water resources decision making studies gebremicael et al 2022 guo et al 2015 yan and gebremichael 2009 numerous studies have evaluated the accuracy of spps in comparison to the observed precipitation dataset and also investigated the impact of spps in the simulation of streamflow using hydrological models for example shah and mishra 2016 evaluated the uncertainty and bias in four spps concerning imd observed dataset and also explore the influence of precipitation uncertainty in streamflow simulation in the mahanadi basin india similarly kolluru et al 2020 evaluated two spps in five contrasting river basins in india taking imd as an observed precipitation dataset and assessed the impact of two spps on streamflow simulation using the swat hydrological model a comprehensive evaluation has also been conducted by bhattacharyya et al 2022 for the evaluation of 12 spps in india although previous studies have evaluated the ability of spps in streamflow simulation using hydrological models their capability to assess the bgw dynamics at the river basin scale is rare from all these proceeding reviews the specific research gaps are summarized as follows i very few studies exist on the evaluation of the recently developed imdaa dataset over the indian subcontinental region ii limited studies investigated the impact of runoff generation and river routing scheme on streamflow simulation using lsm in tropical river basin ii a few studies has evaluated the performance of recently developed jules lsm in indian tropical river basin and iv limited studies exist which have investigated impacts of input data uncertainty on bwf dynamics through proper parameterization of lsm despite of their widespread usage in catchment scale hydrological modeling thus considering the aforementioned research gaps the objective of the present study is to explore the research questions given as follows a how does the choice of runoff generation and river routing scheme influence the streamflow simulation in lsm in a tropical river basin b how well do the spps perform in river basin scale studies when compared to the observed precipitation dataset and c how well does the lsm perform for the computation of fluxes involved in bgw with the choice of different spps to address the above mentioned research question the present study developed a framework to investigate the dependencies of precipitation datasets on bgw dynamics using a physically based distributed lsm jules at the drb situated in eastern india the river plays a key role in providing irrigation water drinking water domestic water and industrial water supply to 25 million populations residing within the damodar river basin biswas 2014 in recent times due to the continuous increase in population growth urban area expansion and rising industrialization the damodar river is experiencing immense pressure which severely affected the terrestrial and riparian ecosystem of the river ghosh et al 2022 hence proper quantification of bw and gw resources is a prerequisite for water allocation and sustainable basin management in drb under the context of growing water demand 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the proposed study was planned to carry out over the upper part of the damodar river basin which is situated in the eastern part of india and extends over the state of west bengal and jharkhand denoting the geographical location the basin lies between 22 15 n to 24 30 n latitude and 84 30 e to 88 15 e longitude and covers an area of approximately 23 380 km2 fig 1 the entire river basin is under a tropical climate zone and there is a considerable difference in temperature between summer and winter seasons the variation in temperature ranges from 40¬∫ c 42¬∫ c and 20¬∫ c 28 ¬∫ c during the summer and winter seasons respectively the annual average rainfall occurring over the drb is approximately 1300 mm where most of the rainfall happens in the month of june october monsoon season 2 2 datasets in this present study the gauge based imd dataset pai et al 2014 source http imd gov in has been considered as the observed dataset while the six spps have been selected for investigating the influence of spps on hydrological component simulated by jules lsm the spps are i aphrodite source https

spatial resolution spatial datasets i e land cover vegetated and non vegetated soil parameter thermal and hydraulic parameter and the gridded flow accumulated areas and flow direction values zulkafli et al 2014 are the required ancillary datasets for the jules lsm all the input ancillary datasets required by the jules lsm were acquired from the met office jules repository the daily time series dataset of in situ streamflow at the durgapur barrage was procured from the irrigation and water department govt of west bengal india 3 methodology the present study developed a framework for the evaluation and application of spps using physically based distributed model jules to estimate the bgw in the damodar river basin first two runoff and river routing scheme presented in jules lsm was evaluated followed by the parameterization of the selected runoff generation scheme for streamflow simulation from 1994 to 2010 then the reliability of six spps viz imdaa aphrodite wfdei chirps princeton persiann cdr was evaluated concerning the imd observed precipitation dataset subsequently we performed the jules lsm simulations conducted with the above mentioned precipitation datasets with a focus on analyzing the spatiotemporal variability of bgw over the study domain in this present study the imd dataset has been chosen as the standard reference dataset as most of the past studies preferred imd as an observed dataset for the evaluation of the spps in india bhattacharyya et al 2022 shah and mishra 2016 the comprehensive layout of the proposed methodological framework used herein was demonstrated in fig 2 3 1 jules lsm jules is a recently developed physically based third generation community lsm developed from the met office surface exchange scheme moses that simulates energy water and carbon flux exchanges best et al 2011 between land surface and atmosphere as well as represents some other additional gasses like methane and ozone the time series of precipitation air temperature downward longwave radiation downward shortwave radiation surface pressure specific humidity and wind speed are required by the jules lsm as the input meteorological dataset which is being used in an energy balance equation consisting of latent heat sensible heat ground surface heat canopy heat and radiation tsarouchi et al 2014 the land surface in jules lsm is divided into grid boxes where each grid box is comprised of five vegetated viz c4 grass c3 grass shrubs broadleaf tree needleleaf tree and four non vegetated surfaces inland water bare soil land ice urban each type of surface is represented by a tile approach where a separate energy balance equation rahman and rosolem 2017 is estimated for each tile in the standard configuration of jules lsm four layers of soil column are used having a varying thickness of 0 1 0 25 0 65 and 2 m the amount of water remaining after any precipitation events that reach the surface after throughfall and canopy interception is partitioned into saturation excess and infiltration excess runoff the saturation excess has two components i e i saturation excess surface runoff and ii saturation excess sub surface runoff which is estimated by two runoff generation schemes introduced in jules lsm mart√≠nez de la torre et al 2019 similarly the infiltration excess runoff is calculated based on soil hydraulic characteristics out of two runoff generation schemes introduced in jules lsm one scheme is based on probability distributed model pdm moore 1985 and the other one is the topography based hydrological model topmodel gedney and cox 2003 the pdm runoff generation scheme in jules lsm determines the percentage of saturated fraction in each grid box by the following equation moore 1985 1 f sat 1 1 s s 0 s max s 0 b b 1 where s 0 represents the minimal amount of storage below which there is no surface saturation s max represents the maximum amount of gridbox storage at saturated condition and b is the shape parameter the topmodel method also calculates surface runoff from the saturated fraction of the model gridbox gedney and cox 2003 however f sat is determined using the grid box distribution of the topographic index Œª which is derived using subgrid topographic data the baseflow component i e lateral sub surface runoff is estimated by the following eqn 2 r b t z w exp Œª i where t z w represents the vertical transmissivity from the bottom of the soil column to the z w the saturation excess runoff from the gridbox is given by 3 r s e f s a t w 0 where f s a t is the fraction of gridbox represents the saturated soil f s a t a s exp c s f Œª i c where a s is snow albedo c s is areal heat capacity associated with the surface material f is the decay constant Œª i c is the critical value of topographic index and w 0 is the rate at which water reaches the soil surface from precipitation and snowmelt after the generation of grid box runoff jules uses river flow model rfm bell et al 2007 or total runoff integrating pathway trip oki and sud 1998 to route both sub surface and surface runoff from each grid box throughout the river network 3 2 model experiment the jules lsm was configured at 0 25 spatial resolution over the damodar river basin for the period 1991 2010 at the time of initiation a spin up run was executed for three years 1991 1993 to stabilize the model s internal state several runs were trialed to test various model configurations and explore parameter sensitivity for streamflow simulation first the jules lsm was simulated across six different model settings to select the best runoff and river routing scheme namely i jules base basic jules lsm with trip river routing scheme jules base trip ii jules base with rfm river routing scheme jules base rfm iii jules topmodel with trip river routing scheme jules top trip iv jules topmodel with rfm river routing scheme jules top rfm v jules pdm with trip river routing scheme jules pdm trip vi jules pdm with rfm river routing scheme jules pdm rfm subsequently further test runs were again conducted to find the optimal model parameters parameterization of the selected runoff generation scheme the performance of the jules lsm with the aforementioned six configurations for the simulation of the streamflow was evaluated by three commonly used statistical indices viz coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias as presented in table 1 3 3 evaluation of spps the accuracy of six spps at a daily time scale against imd observed precipitation datasets was evaluated by two statistical verification methods i continuous statistical indices and ii categorical statistical indices the continuous statistical indices are mainly used to evaluate the accuracy of the precipitation datasets by measuring the difference between the spps and corresponding observed precipitation dataset while the detection ability i e the number of precipitation events detected or missed by the spps with respect to observed data assessed with the help of categorical statistical indices the continuous statistical indices include correlation coefficient cc mean error me root mean square error rmse and percentage bias pbias whereas the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical success index csi and equitable threat score ets were used as categorical statistical indices the details of these statistical indices are enlisted in table 1 3 4 scenario simulation with spps for bw and gw estimation after the evaluation of six spps against the imd observed precipitation dataset the parameter transferability approach dey and remesan 2022 was adopted to explore the influence of spps on streamflow simulation bw and gw estimation the parameter transferability approach refers to the capability of a model with respect to one location time or standard reference dataset to produce a reasonable result at another location time or other meteorological dataset a study conducted by dey and remesan 2022 suggested that the parameter transferability approach is useful to examine the impact of input data uncertainties on hydrological flux simulation without recalibrating the input parameter of a given hydrological model in the present study six user defined scenarios were performed by transferring parameters calibrated at the imd observed precipitation dataset to the selected spps i e the model was parameterized with imd observed precipitation data and rerunning lsm with selected spps the details of these scenarios are enlisted in table 2 in addition the uncertainty exists during the streamflow simulation by considering the user defined scenarios were also quantified using the quantile regression technique a stochastic approach that has been extensively employed in recent literature dash et al 2020 koenker 2005 swain et al 2020 sahoo and sahoo 2019 in this study the 90 confidence interval ci was estimated for each user defined scenario and subsequently the p factor a widely used index was also estimated to characterize the streamflow simulation uncertainty the p factor signifies the percentage of the observed data that falls within the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu band eq 4 the value of p factor varies between 0 and 1 where a value close to 1 represents the better outcomes 4 p n 95 n total where n 95 is the number of observed data points that falls within the 95 ppu band and n total is the number of total data points 3 5 computation of blue and green water flow in this study the bw for each grid is computed by combining the jules simulated surface runoff and sub surface runoff the surface runoff was computed based on the parameterized runoff generation scheme following the steps explained in section 3 2 while the subsurface runoff is estimated by considering the free drainage condition from the deepest soil layer best et al 2011 the gw for each grid is comprised of actual evapotranspiration estimated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 and the water content available in the soil column prescribed following the van genuchten approach van genuchten 1980 4 results 4 1 comparative evaluation of precipitation datasets the comparison of six spps against imd observed dataset could help to determine the consistency and discrepancies that exist between them focusing on the spatial heterogeneity in the annual average precipitation of six spps and imd observed dataset revealed that all six spps showed comparable spatial patterns of annual average precipitation and the trends of precipitation values also showed an increasing pattern toward the southeast direction of the drb fig 3 the imdaa dataset exhibited higher annual average precipitation in comparison to imd observed dataset and other five spps to further understand the differences between spps the comparison of six spps with imd observed dataset has been done using continuous and categorical statistical indices fig 4 represents the scatter plot of six spps against imd observed precipitation dataset with four continuous statistical indices which revealed that the aphrodite wfdei and imdaa datasets showed good correlation with imd observed precipitation dataset compared to chirps princeton and persiann cdr datasets to evaluate the ability of spps in replicating the light and heavy precipitation events with respect to imd observed dataset four categorical statistical indices viz pod far csi ets were derived for six rainfall classes table 3 as illustrated in fig 5 the rainfall values and their respective intensity ranges were categorized based on the definition given by imd barde et al 2020 when the daily precipitation value is between 0 1 and 2 4 mm all six spps exhibited the highest pod csi ets and lower far values revealing the better prediction ability of spps in case of detecting very low rainfall events subsequently all six spps revealed a decreasing trend in pod values in case of heavy precipitation events 35 6 64 5 mm 65 5 mm the pod and far values indicated that imdaa and aphrodite datasets can detect heavy rainfall events with smaller pod and larger far values whereas wfdei chirps princeton and persann cdr followed no detection in high rainfall occurrences in case of ets values all the spps exhibited a declining trend when the precipitation values are shifted towards the heavy rainfall occurrences overall the aphrodite wfdei and imdaa datasets outperformed the other three spps with a better correlation against imd observed dataset in terms of both continuous and categorical statistical measures therefore it can be surmised that a considerable difference exists between the spps in comparison to imd observed precipitation dataset as a result when any of these datasets will be used for hydrological applications the differences related to the spps will also propagate to the simulated hydrological results 4 2 selection of runoff generation scheme and river routing scheme to select the appropriate runoff generation and river routing scheme for streamflow simulation the jules lsm was simulated across six different model configurations the comparison between the monthly time series of observed and jules simulated streamflow across six model settings fig 6 revealed that jules pdm trip can produce better results in capturing temporal variations of streamflow hydrograph compared to the other five model configurations furthermore the statistical indices between observed and jules simulated streamflow were also calculated to assess the performance of each model setting table 4 which revealed that the models with the trip river routing scheme performed well in comparison to the rfm river routing scheme overall it can be observed that jules lsm with pdm runoff generation scheme and trip river routing scheme gives a better fit to observed streamflow at catchment outlet location for the period of 1994 2010 with nse 0 71 r2 0 76 and pbias 25 01 4 3 optimization of pdm parameters after the selection of the best runoff generation scheme the parameterization of the jules lsm for streamflow simulation was conducted by varying the value of the most sensitive parameter shape parameter b clark and gedney 2008 mackellar et al 2013 of the pdm runoff generation scheme several test runs were conducted with different b values ranging from 0 to 5 5 at an interval of 0 25 and four statistical indices viz nse r2 rmse and pbias were estimated to determine the optimal value of b as demonstrated in fig 7 the figure revealed that the optimum performance in streamflow simulation was found at the higher range of b value b 4 5 with nse 0 74 r2 0 78 rmse 196 33 m3 s and pbias 21 43 4 4 comparative evaluation of bw and gw due to variation of spps with respect to the reference scenario 4 4 1 bw and gw computation in the reference scenario after the parameterization of jules lsm the model was simulated with reference to imd observed precipitation dataset using the best set of parameters which is considered as the reference jules lsm simulation referred to as jules imd in this present study the temporal variation of streamflow simulation for the jules imd model with respect to observed streamflow during the period of 1994 2010 at the catchment outlet location is represented in fig 8 subsequently the spatial heterogeneity of annual average bw and gw were estimated for the jules imd model setting as represented in fig 9 similar to the spatial distribution of imd precipitation dataset bw also follows an increasing trend from northeast to southeast direction with a value ranging from 450 to 724 mm year conversely the spatial distribution of gw shows a higher value at the southwest part of the drb with a value ranging from 449 17 to 587 72 mm year the similarity in spatial trends between the bw of the jules imd model and imd precipitation dataset revealed that the amount of bw resources for a given river basin is directly related to the precipitation dataset 4 4 2 scenario simulations and streamflow comparison with reference jules imd model following the methodological framework as mentioned in section 3 4 the scenario simulation table 5 has been done for studying the impact of different spps in streamflow simulation as well as in bw and gw estimation the statistical indices nse r2 pbias in table 5 indicates that in the case of streamflow simulation the performance of jules lsm was better for the ja scenario followed by ji and jw scenario compared to jc jp and jpr scenarios further to study the impact of spps on the flow duration curve the coefficient of variation cv was computed for five flow segments table 6 as demonstrated in fig 10 the values of cv indicate that the variability in streamflow due to change in spps is following an increasing trend from high flow 0 21 0 36 to medium flow segment 0 73 0 89 and then decreased towards the low flow segment 0 52 0 74 overall the inter comparison of streamflow for six user defined scenarios signifies how the choice of different spps impacts the streamflow simulation in an lsm during the historical baseline period 4 4 3 impact of spps on streamflow uncertainty to further investigate the dominant effect of spps on streamflow uncertainty the qr technique was adopted in this study as described above in section 3 5 the uncertainty analysis in streamflow simulation for each user defined scenario was estimated by incorporating the maximum and minimum limits of 95 ci and p factor fig 11 it is evident from fig 11 that majority of observed streamflow falls inside the 90 ci which further demonstrates that variation in spps has a significant impact on streamflow simulation in addition the variation of p factor values also indicates the same where a higher value was observed in the case of ji ja and jw scenarios compared to jc jp and jpr scenarios based on the p factor value it can be summarized that the predicted uncertainty in streamflow simulation decreased in the order from ja to jw to ji to jpr to jc to finally jp 4 4 4 scenario simulations and impact of spps on bwf and gwf dynamics to analyze the impact of spps on the bw and gw dynamics the percentage change in bw and gw for all six user defined scenarios against jules imd was computed as demonstrated in figs 12 and 13 the result reflects the impact of spps on the spatial distribution of bw and gw resources throughout the river basin a mixed distribution both underestimation and overestimation of bw was noticed in the case of ji 41 32 24 54 jw 33 23 7 15 and jpr 9 29 26 44 scenarios whereas ja 29 5 47 72 jc 9 16 to 29 65 and jp 7 32 37 02 scenarios always exhibited underestimation in bw for the entire river basin area all scenarios except ja and jw have demonstrated both underestimation and overestimation in gw distribution throughout the whole river basin the ja scenario always showed underestimation 17 to 6 in gw whereas an overestimation 9 25 is noticed in the case jw scenario fig 14a illustrates the percentage change in annual average bw and gw for all six user defined scenarios interestingly it was noticed that the variability in percentage change of bw 40 to 10 is more than gw 11 to 17 due to changes in spps therefore to analyze the sensitivity of bw and gw concerning spps the correlation coefficient r2 between precipitation and bw and gw was computed as shown in fig 14b the results denote that bw always exhibited by higher r2 value compared to gw for all user defined scenarios for instance the r2 values range between 0 84 and 0 96 for bw while gw always showed lower r2 values ranging from 0 11 to 0 42 for all six user defined scenarios the difference in r2 values for bw and gw reflects more sensitivity of bw to the precipitation dataset than gw overall the results of this present study identified how the dynamics of bw and gw change with the choice of different spps in an lsm simulation 5 discussion the present study examined the impact of six spps on bw and gw computations at the upstream of durgapur barrage in drb india the damodar river is regarded as the lifeline to millions of people in jharkhand and west bengal state for providing agricultural industrial domestic and drinking water supply but recent studies have highlighted biswas 2014 verma et al 2012 that the water demand is increasing in drb due to the increase in population and large scale growth of industrial and agricultural areas which are also responsible for deteriorating the ecological health of the river additionally the investigation in the drb conducted by dey et al 2022 has reported that the basin is also vulnerable to changing climate indicating probable drier conditions in some parts of the river basin under the future time slices hence the quantification of water resources is necessary in terms of bw and gw to meet the growing need for water demand in the drb under this changing environment in this context dey and remesan 2022 proposed the framework for multimodel quantification of the bw and gw resources and analyzed the impact of precipitation datasets on bw and gw resources using two structurally distinct hydrological models at the drb india several other studies have also identified precipitation as a major source of uncertainty in streamflow simulation sirisena et al 2018 in applications of hydrological models tang et al 2019 the current study explored the impact of precipitation datasets on the computation of streamflow as well as bw and gw estimation by using a physically based distributed lsm which is a suitable tool for the robust quantification of hydrological fluxes as it explicitly considers the spatial information of input datasets including meteorological variables and physical properties of the river basin yassin et al 2019 to examine the reliability of spps for bw and gw computation first the statistical evaluation of six spps have been carried out concerning imd observed precipitation datasets and then the efficacy of the datasets for computation of hydrological fluxes streamflow bw and gw was evaluated through jules lsm simulation in terms of both continuous and categorical statistical indices aphrodite performed well followed by imdaa and wfdei datasets in comparison to other datasets for detecting the imd observed rain events the pod and csi values indicate that the prediction capability of precipitation datasets decreases with the increase of the rainfall intensity light and moderate rainfall and showed negligible and no detection performance in case of heavy precipitation events except the aphrodite dataset similar findings were suggested by musie et al 2019 wherein the authors concluded that reanalysis and satellite precipitation products fail to predict the magnitude of intense precipitation events the better performance of aphrodite may be attributed to the dense rain gauge network over asia moreover the better prediction capability of aphrodite dataset was also observed in previous studies rana et al 2015 bhattacharyya and sreekesh 2022 for the indian subcontinental region among six precipitation datasets the performance of princeton product showed poor prediction capability in terms of both continuous and categorical statistical indices which may be due to the use of coarse resolution ncep ncar dataset 2¬∫ 2¬∫ for the derivation of princeton precipitation product wong et al 2017 furthermore a study conducted by bhattacharyya et al 2022 also mentioned the poor performance of princeton dataset while capturing the spatiotemporal characteristics of rainfall events over india after evaluating the spps first the suitable runoff and river routing scheme was selected based on streamflow simulation and then the parameterization of jules lsm was done using imd observed precipitation dataset for building the reference jules model among the six jules configurations mentioned in section 3 2 the jules pdm trip model exhibited better skill for the simulation of daily streamflow indicating the better performance of the pdm runoff generation scheme compared to the topmodel scheme the pdm scheme is best suitable for the rainfall dominated catchments which show very flash response to rainfall whereas the topmodel scheme is more appropriate for the base flow dominated catchment our result corroborates with the morphological characteristics of the river basin as the upper part of the drb is characterized by steep topography fig 1 and also the river is having a wide shallow and flashy runoff regime in nature similar findings were further noticed in a study by mackellar et al 2013 in which they concluded the suitability of the pdm runoff generation scheme for flashy catchments rather than base flow dominated catchments according to the study by zulkafli et al 2014 the major difference between topmodel and pdm schemes is in the partitioning of surface subsurface runoff where pdm generates more amount of surface runoff compared to the topmodel scheme the performance of the pdm scheme for streamflow simulation was further improved by varying the b parameter as this is the sensitive parameter for the generation of peak flow where a higher value of b represents the lower storage capacity and vice versa moore 1985 the results of this study further indicated that the pdm scheme is performing best with a higher value of b 4 5 this finding is realistic because of the steep slope of the upper damodar river basin which requires higher values of b parameter furthermore our results are also similar to the previous literature where higher values of b parameter were observed for flashy response steep slope catchments mackellar et al 2013 zulkafli et 2013 after parameterization of the pdm runoff generation scheme the reference jules model was built considering imd observed precipitation datasets jules imd model and subsequently six user defined scenarios table 2 were explored to investigate the impact of spps for streamflow simulation along with the bw and gw computations for the period of 1994 2010 the statistical indices of streamflow simulation demonstrate that despite having a good correlation coefficient with imd observed data aphrodite dataset is not able to perform satisfactorily in the case of streamflow simulation this could be due to the relatively higher bias and me 18 6 and 0 69 that exist in the case of the aphrodite precipitation dataset this result is in line with the findings of musie et al 2019 and zhu et al 2016 who have concluded the streamflow simulation by a hydrological model is substantially influenced by relative errors bias and me in driving precipitation datasets additionally the statistical indices table 6 also demonstrated that the streamflow simulation by other precipitation products has resulted in unsatisfactory r2 nse and pbias values the propagation of smaller pbias of precipitation datasets into larger pbias of streamflow simulation can be elucidated by the non linearity existing in hydrological processes which is also supported by the study of su et al 2008 in the last part of this study we investigated the impact of spps on the spatial and temporal distribution of the bw and gw on the drb previous studies aghakhani afshar et al 2018 singh and kumar 2021 have highlighted that the computation of bw and gw fluxes is one of the suitable approaches for the assessment of water security for a given region for instance veettil and mishra 2016 computed water security indicators using the concept of bw and gw resources considering both climate change and anthropogenic impact in the savannah river basin usa similarly afshar et al 2018 investigated the influence of climate change on bw and gw resources of an iranian watershed using the swat hydrological model although the previous literature has focused on the estimation of bw and gw resources by considering both climatic and lulc changes till now the spatiotemporal distribution in bw and gw resources due to the change in spps using lsm distributed model has been unexplored the findings of the current study demonstrate that the distribution of bw and gw is substantially affected by the choice of input datasets used for establishing the lsm simulation however higher variability in the bw resources due to changes in spps indicates more sensitivity of bw to input precipitation datasets compared to gw this can be due to the direct impact of precipitation on bw in comparison to gw notwithstanding the results for gw estimation depending on precipitation datasets and several other meteorological variables viz air temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity also influence the gw distribution in a given region interestingly the high sensitivity of bw to the precipitation dataset was also supported by the study carried out at the erhai lake basin of southwest china by yuan et al 2019 6 conclusion based on the results obtained from the present study the following conclusions can be drawn i there is a significant impact of runoff generation and river routing scheme in jules lsm for streamflow simulation where the pdm runoff generation and trip river routing scheme is a better choice for replicating the observed streamflow at drb the best result was found by calibrating the shape parameter of the pdm runoff generation scheme because it represents the shallow soil water stores with more volume of surface runoff resulting in streamflow peaks ii the results of continuous and categorical statistical indices revealed that aphrodite product furnished very good results followed by imdaa and wfdei datasets in detecting rainfall when compared with imd observed precipitation dataset however wfdei dataset showed very negligible capability for moderate rainfall while zero prediction capability for depicting heavy rainfall events iii the accuracy of precipitation datasets has a significant impact on streamflow simulation as well as bw and gw computation the jules lsm can represent the spatial heterogeneity of bw and gw across the river basin where the annual average bw and gw vary from 9 05 to 40 and 15 24 to 11 79 due to changes in precipitation datasets the sensitivity of bw is more in comparison to gw due to the change in the precipitation dataset with higher coefficient of determination between bw and spps 0 84 0 96 the framework of this present study provides insights into bw and gw responses due to the variability in precipitation datasets this will further help hydrological modelers with an improved understanding of how input precipitation datasets affect the water redistribution in an lsm additionally the findings of the study also demonstrate how to select optimal model configurations by choosing the proper runoff generation and river routing scheme of an lsm for a given river basin however it will be an interesting study to investigate the precipitation error propagation to hydrological variables in the lsm simulation which could be the future scope of the present work additionally the representation of bw and gw resources with the incorporation of anthropogenic influences based on the domestic and agricultural water demand could potentially be an intriguing aspect for the future

7743,study region the damodar river basin india study focus water resource assessment at the river basin scale is crucial for human well being and ecosystem health and it can be performed quantitatively through green water gw and blue water bw flow evaluation however the quantification of bw and gw through land surface models lsms is significantly influenced by the accuracy of precipitation datasets in this present study the spatiotemporal variation of blue and green water resources under the influence of six secondary precipitation products spps aphrodite imdaa wfdei princeton chirps persiann cdr are investigated using jules lsm considering india meteorological department imd precipitation product as an observed precipitation dataset this will help in examining the dependencies of precipitation datasets on partitioning between bw and gw distribution in a tropical river basin new hydrological insights for the study region the results suggest significant differences in bw and gw simulation with the use of six aforementioned spps in comparison to the reference imd based jules model simulation the annual average bw and gw estimates varied significantly from 9 05 to 40 and 15 24 to 11 79 respectively due to changes in the spps furthermore the higher correlation between bw and precipitation datasets r2 0 84 0 96 suggested that bw is more sensitive to precipitation changes in comparison to gw overall our study emphasizes the importance of carefully considering the specification of precipitation databases for estimating bw and gw in a tropical river basin graphical abstract ga1 keywords land surface model jules precipitation uncertainty blue water green water damodar river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the 21st century water scarcity has become a global issue due to increasing population agricultural expansion urbanization rapid industrialization and economic development which is making an influence on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems mall et al 2006 therefore it is necessary to appraise the freshwater availability for better water resources management as well as to make this world resilient to water scarcity in changing environment mao et al 2020 rockstr√∂m et al 2009 the most appropriate method for freshwater availability assessment as suggested by falkenmark 1995 is a classification of freshwater resources into blue and green water resources bgw conversely the quantification of bgw is still a challenging task worldwide with the declining in situ gauging stations sahoo et al 2020 2022 emphasizing the component analysis of bgw blue water bw resources include groundwater and the surface water from rivers lakes aquifers and manmade infrastructure whereas green water gw resources are the water available in vegetation canopy and soil water profile the quantification of bw plays a crucial role in water security assessment in a given region as it is directly associated with human needs such as domestic water requirement irrigation water requirement industrial production and power generation while the gw is essential for plant growth rainfed agriculture and terrestrial ecosystem services approximately two third of the global water resources are stored as gw according to the existing literature hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 siebert and d√∂ll 2010 more than 87 of water is used for worldwide agricultural production which is supported by the gw hence the proper assessment of bgw resources is essential for the socioeconomic development food production and sustainability of the terrestrial ecosystem numerous researchers have estimated bgw through various hydrological models across the world lee and bae 2015 mao et al 2020 veettil and mishra 2018 for instance with the implication of the soil and water assessment tool swat model xie et al 2020 quantified the bgw in the yellow river basin china similarly veettil and mishra 2016 quantified the same under the influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities in the savannah river basin usa in india dey and remesan 2022 have also focused on the multimodel quantification of bgw by using two hydrological models hysim and swat which are different concerning their structures applied over the damodar river basin drb although the hydrological models have been extensively used for the quantification of bgw the recent modifications inclusion of river flow routing module and runoff generation schemes modules in land surface models lsms have gained adequate attention among the scientific community for the same yassin et al 2019 lsms are the comprehensive appliance that represents the exchange of energy water and carbon fluxes between the land surface and atmosphere tsarouchi et al 2014 one of the strengths of lsms is the consideration of feedback mechanisms between the land surface and atmosphere which provide an opportunity for the hydrologists to identify the response of the atmosphere against the changes in hydrology and land surface properties as well as repercussions of ignoring the atmospheric feedback in hydrological scenario simulations overgaard et al 2006 in addition lsms are also robust for the computation of evapotranspiration by directly solving the energy and mass balance equation for the realistic representation of bw and gw resources there is a need to diagnose the processes involved during photosynthesis and crop growth e g biophysical consistency between energy water carbon and nutrient processes which could be well represented through lsm zulkafli et al 2013 the runoff generation and river routing processes are very crucial components in lsm as they control the accuracy of water flux heat flux and soil moisture simulation in land surface processes sheng et al 2017 which eventually impact the quantification of bgw various runoff generation and river routing schemes have been introduced in lsms to improve runoff representation and streamflow simulation respectively campoy et al 2013 lawrence et al 2011 many researchers have evaluated the runoff and river routing scheme for streamflow simulation at the river basin scale and found that these schemes can vary based on the physical properties of a given river basin such as soil characteristics topography and so on for instance mackellar et al 2013 evaluated two runoff generation schemes in jules lsm for streamflow simulation at three catchments in south africa and concluded that no single runoff generation scheme is best for all catchments for streamflow simulation similarly the sensitivity of the runoff production scheme of jules lsm was also investigated by mart√≠nez de la torre et al 2019 in 13 catchments of great britain therefore it is important to evaluate the performance of river routing and runoff generation schemes for streamflow simulation at regional and basin scales rather than global scales and also to select the suitable scheme for a given river basin apart from the runoff generation and river routing schemes the accuracy of lsm simulation also suffers from several uncertainties viz meteorological forcing data model parameters and model physics dumedah and walker 2014 nair and indu 2017 nearing et al 2016 previous studies on uncertainty in lsm simulations suggested that precipitation is by far the most crucial component in the overall uncertainty of these models gottschalck et al 2005 shrestha et al 2020 zhou et al 2012 as its spatiotemporal variability has a substantial impact on the hydrological behavior of any given river basin panda et al 2022 pang et al 2020 generally rain gauges are operated to measure the precipitation in situ however the rain gauge measurement can be significantly affected due to several issues viz data gaps sensor failure sparse rain gauge networks in mountainous and remote locations darand et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 musie et al 2019 which can lead to poor representation of precipitation variability in recent years many satellite based remote sensing and reanalysis datasets hereafter also named as secondary precipitation products spps have been developed to solve the aforementioned issues associated with rain gauge measurement these spps are particularly beneficial for studies related to climatic research and hydrological modeling ashouri et al 2015 conti et al 2014 xue et al 2013 yong et al 2014 there are several freely accessible spps available worldwide with varying temporal 3 hourly to daily and spatial resolutions 0 05¬∫ to 0 5¬∫ which can be broadly classified as gauge based asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation aphrodite yatagai et al 2012 reanalysis indian monsoon data assimilation and analysis imdaa rani et al 2021 princeton sheffield et al 2006 satellite climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 and merged watch forcing data era interim wfdei weedon et al 2014 precipitation product among these spps imdaa is the recently developed regional reanalysis precipitation products available over the indian subcontinent which is developed by the collaboration among met office uk national centre for medium range weather forecasting india ncmwrf and india meteorological department imd see rani et al 2021 despite the widespread usage of the spps the accuracy of the spps is dependent on several factors including terrain climate and distribution of precipitation in a given region seyyedi et al 2014 demaria et al 2011 hence performance evaluation of precipitation datasets is essential for regional scale studies to select suitable datasets that can be further used for hydrological modeling and water resources decision making studies gebremicael et al 2022 guo et al 2015 yan and gebremichael 2009 numerous studies have evaluated the accuracy of spps in comparison to the observed precipitation dataset and also investigated the impact of spps in the simulation of streamflow using hydrological models for example shah and mishra 2016 evaluated the uncertainty and bias in four spps concerning imd observed dataset and also explore the influence of precipitation uncertainty in streamflow simulation in the mahanadi basin india similarly kolluru et al 2020 evaluated two spps in five contrasting river basins in india taking imd as an observed precipitation dataset and assessed the impact of two spps on streamflow simulation using the swat hydrological model a comprehensive evaluation has also been conducted by bhattacharyya et al 2022 for the evaluation of 12 spps in india although previous studies have evaluated the ability of spps in streamflow simulation using hydrological models their capability to assess the bgw dynamics at the river basin scale is rare from all these proceeding reviews the specific research gaps are summarized as follows i very few studies exist on the evaluation of the recently developed imdaa dataset over the indian subcontinental region ii limited studies investigated the impact of runoff generation and river routing scheme on streamflow simulation using lsm in tropical river basin ii a few studies has evaluated the performance of recently developed jules lsm in indian tropical river basin and iv limited studies exist which have investigated impacts of input data uncertainty on bwf dynamics through proper parameterization of lsm despite of their widespread usage in catchment scale hydrological modeling thus considering the aforementioned research gaps the objective of the present study is to explore the research questions given as follows a how does the choice of runoff generation and river routing scheme influence the streamflow simulation in lsm in a tropical river basin b how well do the spps perform in river basin scale studies when compared to the observed precipitation dataset and c how well does the lsm perform for the computation of fluxes involved in bgw with the choice of different spps to address the above mentioned research question the present study developed a framework to investigate the dependencies of precipitation datasets on bgw dynamics using a physically based distributed lsm jules at the drb situated in eastern india the river plays a key role in providing irrigation water drinking water domestic water and industrial water supply to 25 million populations residing within the damodar river basin biswas 2014 in recent times due to the continuous increase in population growth urban area expansion and rising industrialization the damodar river is experiencing immense pressure which severely affected the terrestrial and riparian ecosystem of the river ghosh et al 2022 hence proper quantification of bw and gw resources is a prerequisite for water allocation and sustainable basin management in drb under the context of growing water demand 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the proposed study was planned to carry out over the upper part of the damodar river basin which is situated in the eastern part of india and extends over the state of west bengal and jharkhand denoting the geographical location the basin lies between 22 15 n to 24 30 n latitude and 84 30 e to 88 15 e longitude and covers an area of approximately 23 380 km2 fig 1 the entire river basin is under a tropical climate zone and there is a considerable difference in temperature between summer and winter seasons the variation in temperature ranges from 40¬∫ c 42¬∫ c and 20¬∫ c 28 ¬∫ c during the summer and winter seasons respectively the annual average rainfall occurring over the drb is approximately 1300 mm where most of the rainfall happens in the month of june october monsoon season 2 2 datasets in this present study the gauge based imd dataset pai et al 2014 source http imd gov in has been considered as the observed dataset while the six spps have been selected for investigating the influence of spps on hydrological component simulated by jules lsm the spps are i aphrodite source https

spatial resolution spatial datasets i e land cover vegetated and non vegetated soil parameter thermal and hydraulic parameter and the gridded flow accumulated areas and flow direction values zulkafli et al 2014 are the required ancillary datasets for the jules lsm all the input ancillary datasets required by the jules lsm were acquired from the met office jules repository the daily time series dataset of in situ streamflow at the durgapur barrage was procured from the irrigation and water department govt of west bengal india 3 methodology the present study developed a framework for the evaluation and application of spps using physically based distributed model jules to estimate the bgw in the damodar river basin first two runoff and river routing scheme presented in jules lsm was evaluated followed by the parameterization of the selected runoff generation scheme for streamflow simulation from 1994 to 2010 then the reliability of six spps viz imdaa aphrodite wfdei chirps princeton persiann cdr was evaluated concerning the imd observed precipitation dataset subsequently we performed the jules lsm simulations conducted with the above mentioned precipitation datasets with a focus on analyzing the spatiotemporal variability of bgw over the study domain in this present study the imd dataset has been chosen as the standard reference dataset as most of the past studies preferred imd as an observed dataset for the evaluation of the spps in india bhattacharyya et al 2022 shah and mishra 2016 the comprehensive layout of the proposed methodological framework used herein was demonstrated in fig 2 3 1 jules lsm jules is a recently developed physically based third generation community lsm developed from the met office surface exchange scheme moses that simulates energy water and carbon flux exchanges best et al 2011 between land surface and atmosphere as well as represents some other additional gasses like methane and ozone the time series of precipitation air temperature downward longwave radiation downward shortwave radiation surface pressure specific humidity and wind speed are required by the jules lsm as the input meteorological dataset which is being used in an energy balance equation consisting of latent heat sensible heat ground surface heat canopy heat and radiation tsarouchi et al 2014 the land surface in jules lsm is divided into grid boxes where each grid box is comprised of five vegetated viz c4 grass c3 grass shrubs broadleaf tree needleleaf tree and four non vegetated surfaces inland water bare soil land ice urban each type of surface is represented by a tile approach where a separate energy balance equation rahman and rosolem 2017 is estimated for each tile in the standard configuration of jules lsm four layers of soil column are used having a varying thickness of 0 1 0 25 0 65 and 2 m the amount of water remaining after any precipitation events that reach the surface after throughfall and canopy interception is partitioned into saturation excess and infiltration excess runoff the saturation excess has two components i e i saturation excess surface runoff and ii saturation excess sub surface runoff which is estimated by two runoff generation schemes introduced in jules lsm mart√≠nez de la torre et al 2019 similarly the infiltration excess runoff is calculated based on soil hydraulic characteristics out of two runoff generation schemes introduced in jules lsm one scheme is based on probability distributed model pdm moore 1985 and the other one is the topography based hydrological model topmodel gedney and cox 2003 the pdm runoff generation scheme in jules lsm determines the percentage of saturated fraction in each grid box by the following equation moore 1985 1 f sat 1 1 s s 0 s max s 0 b b 1 where s 0 represents the minimal amount of storage below which there is no surface saturation s max represents the maximum amount of gridbox storage at saturated condition and b is the shape parameter the topmodel method also calculates surface runoff from the saturated fraction of the model gridbox gedney and cox 2003 however f sat is determined using the grid box distribution of the topographic index Œª which is derived using subgrid topographic data the baseflow component i e lateral sub surface runoff is estimated by the following eqn 2 r b t z w exp Œª i where t z w represents the vertical transmissivity from the bottom of the soil column to the z w the saturation excess runoff from the gridbox is given by 3 r s e f s a t w 0 where f s a t is the fraction of gridbox represents the saturated soil f s a t a s exp c s f Œª i c where a s is snow albedo c s is areal heat capacity associated with the surface material f is the decay constant Œª i c is the critical value of topographic index and w 0 is the rate at which water reaches the soil surface from precipitation and snowmelt after the generation of grid box runoff jules uses river flow model rfm bell et al 2007 or total runoff integrating pathway trip oki and sud 1998 to route both sub surface and surface runoff from each grid box throughout the river network 3 2 model experiment the jules lsm was configured at 0 25 spatial resolution over the damodar river basin for the period 1991 2010 at the time of initiation a spin up run was executed for three years 1991 1993 to stabilize the model s internal state several runs were trialed to test various model configurations and explore parameter sensitivity for streamflow simulation first the jules lsm was simulated across six different model settings to select the best runoff and river routing scheme namely i jules base basic jules lsm with trip river routing scheme jules base trip ii jules base with rfm river routing scheme jules base rfm iii jules topmodel with trip river routing scheme jules top trip iv jules topmodel with rfm river routing scheme jules top rfm v jules pdm with trip river routing scheme jules pdm trip vi jules pdm with rfm river routing scheme jules pdm rfm subsequently further test runs were again conducted to find the optimal model parameters parameterization of the selected runoff generation scheme the performance of the jules lsm with the aforementioned six configurations for the simulation of the streamflow was evaluated by three commonly used statistical indices viz coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias as presented in table 1 3 3 evaluation of spps the accuracy of six spps at a daily time scale against imd observed precipitation datasets was evaluated by two statistical verification methods i continuous statistical indices and ii categorical statistical indices the continuous statistical indices are mainly used to evaluate the accuracy of the precipitation datasets by measuring the difference between the spps and corresponding observed precipitation dataset while the detection ability i e the number of precipitation events detected or missed by the spps with respect to observed data assessed with the help of categorical statistical indices the continuous statistical indices include correlation coefficient cc mean error me root mean square error rmse and percentage bias pbias whereas the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical success index csi and equitable threat score ets were used as categorical statistical indices the details of these statistical indices are enlisted in table 1 3 4 scenario simulation with spps for bw and gw estimation after the evaluation of six spps against the imd observed precipitation dataset the parameter transferability approach dey and remesan 2022 was adopted to explore the influence of spps on streamflow simulation bw and gw estimation the parameter transferability approach refers to the capability of a model with respect to one location time or standard reference dataset to produce a reasonable result at another location time or other meteorological dataset a study conducted by dey and remesan 2022 suggested that the parameter transferability approach is useful to examine the impact of input data uncertainties on hydrological flux simulation without recalibrating the input parameter of a given hydrological model in the present study six user defined scenarios were performed by transferring parameters calibrated at the imd observed precipitation dataset to the selected spps i e the model was parameterized with imd observed precipitation data and rerunning lsm with selected spps the details of these scenarios are enlisted in table 2 in addition the uncertainty exists during the streamflow simulation by considering the user defined scenarios were also quantified using the quantile regression technique a stochastic approach that has been extensively employed in recent literature dash et al 2020 koenker 2005 swain et al 2020 sahoo and sahoo 2019 in this study the 90 confidence interval ci was estimated for each user defined scenario and subsequently the p factor a widely used index was also estimated to characterize the streamflow simulation uncertainty the p factor signifies the percentage of the observed data that falls within the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu band eq 4 the value of p factor varies between 0 and 1 where a value close to 1 represents the better outcomes 4 p n 95 n total where n 95 is the number of observed data points that falls within the 95 ppu band and n total is the number of total data points 3 5 computation of blue and green water flow in this study the bw for each grid is computed by combining the jules simulated surface runoff and sub surface runoff the surface runoff was computed based on the parameterized runoff generation scheme following the steps explained in section 3 2 while the subsurface runoff is estimated by considering the free drainage condition from the deepest soil layer best et al 2011 the gw for each grid is comprised of actual evapotranspiration estimated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 and the water content available in the soil column prescribed following the van genuchten approach van genuchten 1980 4 results 4 1 comparative evaluation of precipitation datasets the comparison of six spps against imd observed dataset could help to determine the consistency and discrepancies that exist between them focusing on the spatial heterogeneity in the annual average precipitation of six spps and imd observed dataset revealed that all six spps showed comparable spatial patterns of annual average precipitation and the trends of precipitation values also showed an increasing pattern toward the southeast direction of the drb fig 3 the imdaa dataset exhibited higher annual average precipitation in comparison to imd observed dataset and other five spps to further understand the differences between spps the comparison of six spps with imd observed dataset has been done using continuous and categorical statistical indices fig 4 represents the scatter plot of six spps against imd observed precipitation dataset with four continuous statistical indices which revealed that the aphrodite wfdei and imdaa datasets showed good correlation with imd observed precipitation dataset compared to chirps princeton and persiann cdr datasets to evaluate the ability of spps in replicating the light and heavy precipitation events with respect to imd observed dataset four categorical statistical indices viz pod far csi ets were derived for six rainfall classes table 3 as illustrated in fig 5 the rainfall values and their respective intensity ranges were categorized based on the definition given by imd barde et al 2020 when the daily precipitation value is between 0 1 and 2 4 mm all six spps exhibited the highest pod csi ets and lower far values revealing the better prediction ability of spps in case of detecting very low rainfall events subsequently all six spps revealed a decreasing trend in pod values in case of heavy precipitation events 35 6 64 5 mm 65 5 mm the pod and far values indicated that imdaa and aphrodite datasets can detect heavy rainfall events with smaller pod and larger far values whereas wfdei chirps princeton and persann cdr followed no detection in high rainfall occurrences in case of ets values all the spps exhibited a declining trend when the precipitation values are shifted towards the heavy rainfall occurrences overall the aphrodite wfdei and imdaa datasets outperformed the other three spps with a better correlation against imd observed dataset in terms of both continuous and categorical statistical measures therefore it can be surmised that a considerable difference exists between the spps in comparison to imd observed precipitation dataset as a result when any of these datasets will be used for hydrological applications the differences related to the spps will also propagate to the simulated hydrological results 4 2 selection of runoff generation scheme and river routing scheme to select the appropriate runoff generation and river routing scheme for streamflow simulation the jules lsm was simulated across six different model configurations the comparison between the monthly time series of observed and jules simulated streamflow across six model settings fig 6 revealed that jules pdm trip can produce better results in capturing temporal variations of streamflow hydrograph compared to the other five model configurations furthermore the statistical indices between observed and jules simulated streamflow were also calculated to assess the performance of each model setting table 4 which revealed that the models with the trip river routing scheme performed well in comparison to the rfm river routing scheme overall it can be observed that jules lsm with pdm runoff generation scheme and trip river routing scheme gives a better fit to observed streamflow at catchment outlet location for the period of 1994 2010 with nse 0 71 r2 0 76 and pbias 25 01 4 3 optimization of pdm parameters after the selection of the best runoff generation scheme the parameterization of the jules lsm for streamflow simulation was conducted by varying the value of the most sensitive parameter shape parameter b clark and gedney 2008 mackellar et al 2013 of the pdm runoff generation scheme several test runs were conducted with different b values ranging from 0 to 5 5 at an interval of 0 25 and four statistical indices viz nse r2 rmse and pbias were estimated to determine the optimal value of b as demonstrated in fig 7 the figure revealed that the optimum performance in streamflow simulation was found at the higher range of b value b 4 5 with nse 0 74 r2 0 78 rmse 196 33 m3 s and pbias 21 43 4 4 comparative evaluation of bw and gw due to variation of spps with respect to the reference scenario 4 4 1 bw and gw computation in the reference scenario after the parameterization of jules lsm the model was simulated with reference to imd observed precipitation dataset using the best set of parameters which is considered as the reference jules lsm simulation referred to as jules imd in this present study the temporal variation of streamflow simulation for the jules imd model with respect to observed streamflow during the period of 1994 2010 at the catchment outlet location is represented in fig 8 subsequently the spatial heterogeneity of annual average bw and gw were estimated for the jules imd model setting as represented in fig 9 similar to the spatial distribution of imd precipitation dataset bw also follows an increasing trend from northeast to southeast direction with a value ranging from 450 to 724 mm year conversely the spatial distribution of gw shows a higher value at the southwest part of the drb with a value ranging from 449 17 to 587 72 mm year the similarity in spatial trends between the bw of the jules imd model and imd precipitation dataset revealed that the amount of bw resources for a given river basin is directly related to the precipitation dataset 4 4 2 scenario simulations and streamflow comparison with reference jules imd model following the methodological framework as mentioned in section 3 4 the scenario simulation table 5 has been done for studying the impact of different spps in streamflow simulation as well as in bw and gw estimation the statistical indices nse r2 pbias in table 5 indicates that in the case of streamflow simulation the performance of jules lsm was better for the ja scenario followed by ji and jw scenario compared to jc jp and jpr scenarios further to study the impact of spps on the flow duration curve the coefficient of variation cv was computed for five flow segments table 6 as demonstrated in fig 10 the values of cv indicate that the variability in streamflow due to change in spps is following an increasing trend from high flow 0 21 0 36 to medium flow segment 0 73 0 89 and then decreased towards the low flow segment 0 52 0 74 overall the inter comparison of streamflow for six user defined scenarios signifies how the choice of different spps impacts the streamflow simulation in an lsm during the historical baseline period 4 4 3 impact of spps on streamflow uncertainty to further investigate the dominant effect of spps on streamflow uncertainty the qr technique was adopted in this study as described above in section 3 5 the uncertainty analysis in streamflow simulation for each user defined scenario was estimated by incorporating the maximum and minimum limits of 95 ci and p factor fig 11 it is evident from fig 11 that majority of observed streamflow falls inside the 90 ci which further demonstrates that variation in spps has a significant impact on streamflow simulation in addition the variation of p factor values also indicates the same where a higher value was observed in the case of ji ja and jw scenarios compared to jc jp and jpr scenarios based on the p factor value it can be summarized that the predicted uncertainty in streamflow simulation decreased in the order from ja to jw to ji to jpr to jc to finally jp 4 4 4 scenario simulations and impact of spps on bwf and gwf dynamics to analyze the impact of spps on the bw and gw dynamics the percentage change in bw and gw for all six user defined scenarios against jules imd was computed as demonstrated in figs 12 and 13 the result reflects the impact of spps on the spatial distribution of bw and gw resources throughout the river basin a mixed distribution both underestimation and overestimation of bw was noticed in the case of ji 41 32 24 54 jw 33 23 7 15 and jpr 9 29 26 44 scenarios whereas ja 29 5 47 72 jc 9 16 to 29 65 and jp 7 32 37 02 scenarios always exhibited underestimation in bw for the entire river basin area all scenarios except ja and jw have demonstrated both underestimation and overestimation in gw distribution throughout the whole river basin the ja scenario always showed underestimation 17 to 6 in gw whereas an overestimation 9 25 is noticed in the case jw scenario fig 14a illustrates the percentage change in annual average bw and gw for all six user defined scenarios interestingly it was noticed that the variability in percentage change of bw 40 to 10 is more than gw 11 to 17 due to changes in spps therefore to analyze the sensitivity of bw and gw concerning spps the correlation coefficient r2 between precipitation and bw and gw was computed as shown in fig 14b the results denote that bw always exhibited by higher r2 value compared to gw for all user defined scenarios for instance the r2 values range between 0 84 and 0 96 for bw while gw always showed lower r2 values ranging from 0 11 to 0 42 for all six user defined scenarios the difference in r2 values for bw and gw reflects more sensitivity of bw to the precipitation dataset than gw overall the results of this present study identified how the dynamics of bw and gw change with the choice of different spps in an lsm simulation 5 discussion the present study examined the impact of six spps on bw and gw computations at the upstream of durgapur barrage in drb india the damodar river is regarded as the lifeline to millions of people in jharkhand and west bengal state for providing agricultural industrial domestic and drinking water supply but recent studies have highlighted biswas 2014 verma et al 2012 that the water demand is increasing in drb due to the increase in population and large scale growth of industrial and agricultural areas which are also responsible for deteriorating the ecological health of the river additionally the investigation in the drb conducted by dey et al 2022 has reported that the basin is also vulnerable to changing climate indicating probable drier conditions in some parts of the river basin under the future time slices hence the quantification of water resources is necessary in terms of bw and gw to meet the growing need for water demand in the drb under this changing environment in this context dey and remesan 2022 proposed the framework for multimodel quantification of the bw and gw resources and analyzed the impact of precipitation datasets on bw and gw resources using two structurally distinct hydrological models at the drb india several other studies have also identified precipitation as a major source of uncertainty in streamflow simulation sirisena et al 2018 in applications of hydrological models tang et al 2019 the current study explored the impact of precipitation datasets on the computation of streamflow as well as bw and gw estimation by using a physically based distributed lsm which is a suitable tool for the robust quantification of hydrological fluxes as it explicitly considers the spatial information of input datasets including meteorological variables and physical properties of the river basin yassin et al 2019 to examine the reliability of spps for bw and gw computation first the statistical evaluation of six spps have been carried out concerning imd observed precipitation datasets and then the efficacy of the datasets for computation of hydrological fluxes streamflow bw and gw was evaluated through jules lsm simulation in terms of both continuous and categorical statistical indices aphrodite performed well followed by imdaa and wfdei datasets in comparison to other datasets for detecting the imd observed rain events the pod and csi values indicate that the prediction capability of precipitation datasets decreases with the increase of the rainfall intensity light and moderate rainfall and showed negligible and no detection performance in case of heavy precipitation events except the aphrodite dataset similar findings were suggested by musie et al 2019 wherein the authors concluded that reanalysis and satellite precipitation products fail to predict the magnitude of intense precipitation events the better performance of aphrodite may be attributed to the dense rain gauge network over asia moreover the better prediction capability of aphrodite dataset was also observed in previous studies rana et al 2015 bhattacharyya and sreekesh 2022 for the indian subcontinental region among six precipitation datasets the performance of princeton product showed poor prediction capability in terms of both continuous and categorical statistical indices which may be due to the use of coarse resolution ncep ncar dataset 2¬∫ 2¬∫ for the derivation of princeton precipitation product wong et al 2017 furthermore a study conducted by bhattacharyya et al 2022 also mentioned the poor performance of princeton dataset while capturing the spatiotemporal characteristics of rainfall events over india after evaluating the spps first the suitable runoff and river routing scheme was selected based on streamflow simulation and then the parameterization of jules lsm was done using imd observed precipitation dataset for building the reference jules model among the six jules configurations mentioned in section 3 2 the jules pdm trip model exhibited better skill for the simulation of daily streamflow indicating the better performance of the pdm runoff generation scheme compared to the topmodel scheme the pdm scheme is best suitable for the rainfall dominated catchments which show very flash response to rainfall whereas the topmodel scheme is more appropriate for the base flow dominated catchment our result corroborates with the morphological characteristics of the river basin as the upper part of the drb is characterized by steep topography fig 1 and also the river is having a wide shallow and flashy runoff regime in nature similar findings were further noticed in a study by mackellar et al 2013 in which they concluded the suitability of the pdm runoff generation scheme for flashy catchments rather than base flow dominated catchments according to the study by zulkafli et al 2014 the major difference between topmodel and pdm schemes is in the partitioning of surface subsurface runoff where pdm generates more amount of surface runoff compared to the topmodel scheme the performance of the pdm scheme for streamflow simulation was further improved by varying the b parameter as this is the sensitive parameter for the generation of peak flow where a higher value of b represents the lower storage capacity and vice versa moore 1985 the results of this study further indicated that the pdm scheme is performing best with a higher value of b 4 5 this finding is realistic because of the steep slope of the upper damodar river basin which requires higher values of b parameter furthermore our results are also similar to the previous literature where higher values of b parameter were observed for flashy response steep slope catchments mackellar et al 2013 zulkafli et 2013 after parameterization of the pdm runoff generation scheme the reference jules model was built considering imd observed precipitation datasets jules imd model and subsequently six user defined scenarios table 2 were explored to investigate the impact of spps for streamflow simulation along with the bw and gw computations for the period of 1994 2010 the statistical indices of streamflow simulation demonstrate that despite having a good correlation coefficient with imd observed data aphrodite dataset is not able to perform satisfactorily in the case of streamflow simulation this could be due to the relatively higher bias and me 18 6 and 0 69 that exist in the case of the aphrodite precipitation dataset this result is in line with the findings of musie et al 2019 and zhu et al 2016 who have concluded the streamflow simulation by a hydrological model is substantially influenced by relative errors bias and me in driving precipitation datasets additionally the statistical indices table 6 also demonstrated that the streamflow simulation by other precipitation products has resulted in unsatisfactory r2 nse and pbias values the propagation of smaller pbias of precipitation datasets into larger pbias of streamflow simulation can be elucidated by the non linearity existing in hydrological processes which is also supported by the study of su et al 2008 in the last part of this study we investigated the impact of spps on the spatial and temporal distribution of the bw and gw on the drb previous studies aghakhani afshar et al 2018 singh and kumar 2021 have highlighted that the computation of bw and gw fluxes is one of the suitable approaches for the assessment of water security for a given region for instance veettil and mishra 2016 computed water security indicators using the concept of bw and gw resources considering both climate change and anthropogenic impact in the savannah river basin usa similarly afshar et al 2018 investigated the influence of climate change on bw and gw resources of an iranian watershed using the swat hydrological model although the previous literature has focused on the estimation of bw and gw resources by considering both climatic and lulc changes till now the spatiotemporal distribution in bw and gw resources due to the change in spps using lsm distributed model has been unexplored the findings of the current study demonstrate that the distribution of bw and gw is substantially affected by the choice of input datasets used for establishing the lsm simulation however higher variability in the bw resources due to changes in spps indicates more sensitivity of bw to input precipitation datasets compared to gw this can be due to the direct impact of precipitation on bw in comparison to gw notwithstanding the results for gw estimation depending on precipitation datasets and several other meteorological variables viz air temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity also influence the gw distribution in a given region interestingly the high sensitivity of bw to the precipitation dataset was also supported by the study carried out at the erhai lake basin of southwest china by yuan et al 2019 6 conclusion based on the results obtained from the present study the following conclusions can be drawn i there is a significant impact of runoff generation and river routing scheme in jules lsm for streamflow simulation where the pdm runoff generation and trip river routing scheme is a better choice for replicating the observed streamflow at drb the best result was found by calibrating the shape parameter of the pdm runoff generation scheme because it represents the shallow soil water stores with more volume of surface runoff resulting in streamflow peaks ii the results of continuous and categorical statistical indices revealed that aphrodite product furnished very good results followed by imdaa and wfdei datasets in detecting rainfall when compared with imd observed precipitation dataset however wfdei dataset showed very negligible capability for moderate rainfall while zero prediction capability for depicting heavy rainfall events iii the accuracy of precipitation datasets has a significant impact on streamflow simulation as well as bw and gw computation the jules lsm can represent the spatial heterogeneity of bw and gw across the river basin where the annual average bw and gw vary from 9 05 to 40 and 15 24 to 11 79 due to changes in precipitation datasets the sensitivity of bw is more in comparison to gw due to the change in the precipitation dataset with higher coefficient of determination between bw and spps 0 84 0 96 the framework of this present study provides insights into bw and gw responses due to the variability in precipitation datasets this will further help hydrological modelers with an improved understanding of how input precipitation datasets affect the water redistribution in an lsm additionally the findings of the study also demonstrate how to select optimal model configurations by choosing the proper runoff generation and river routing scheme of an lsm for a given river basin however it will be an interesting study to investigate the precipitation error propagation to hydrological variables in the lsm simulation which could be the future scope of the present work additionally the representation of bw and gw resources with the incorporation of anthropogenic influences based on the domestic and agricultural water demand could potentially be an intriguing aspect for the future

7744,study region hulun lake the fifth largest lake in china study focus the notable decline in water level wl caused by climate change is the primary challenge faced by hulun lake however the contribution of climate to water loss and its driving mechanisms remain unclear the impact of climate on wl change was investigated using wavelet analysis and structural equation models new hydrological insights for the region in the past 60 years the increasing potential evapotranspiration et p caused by warming climate was the main reason for the wl decline r 0 67 for period i 1961 1997 reduced runoff due to increasing et p caused an overall decrease in wl r 0 41 during the mid 1980s the increase in rainfall driven by enso r 0 66 caused a slight increase in wl r 0 31 for period ii 1998 2020 deforestation farmland and urban area expansion were the main drivers behind the significant increase of et p in the watershed r 0 22 which leads to reduced runoff and consequently a significant decrease in wl the influence of climate on wl change weakened compared with that in the first period due to land use change r 1 08 graphical abstract keywords lake water resources climate change sem landuse data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lakes respond rapidly to climate change especially in arid and semi arid regions woolway et al 2020 woolway and merchant 2019 some manifested consequences include decline in water volumes increased water temperature ecosystem degradation etc yang et al 2019 2020 as a sentinel to climate change water level wl regime is also an intuitive indicator of lake water resources kraemer et al 2020 which can comprehensively reflect hydrological processes e g runoff generation evapotranspiration and rainfall of the basin and the abundance of lake water storage in the past decades global warming and anthropogenic activities have caused a sharp decrease in wl in closed inland lakes in northern china the number of lakes larger than 1 km 2 in inner mongolia decreased by 159 between 1991 and 2009 zhou et al 2019 there is an impending need to investigate the impact of climate change on lake wls in semi arid and arid regions for watershed management and lake water conservation among all drivers climate change has shown a widespread impact on lake wls in arid regions due to the complexity and nonlinearity of climate factors their impact on wl typically manifests across different time spans rezaei and gurdak 2020 with the gradual strengthening of human activities the dual influences on the evolution of watershed environment and on wl requires a more thorough and discreet verification cooley et al 2021 climate impact on lake wl has drawn great attention in recent years where researchers applied different approaches to reveal the response and driving mechanism of lake wls against various changing climatic factors those methods include statistical models such as the least squares regression model and bayesian network conceptual models such as the budyko hypothesis and scs cn models wang 2018 zhang et al 2015 and process based models such as swat delft3d chen et al 2018 mccombs et al 2014 these methods tend to focus on the impact of individual variables e g precipitation air temperature and runoff on wl however lake wl variation often results from complex interactions between meteorological factors such as evaporation and precipitation as well as from watershed hydrological factors such as inflow kundu et al 2017 how to disentangle such interaction in the context of changing conditions remains a challenge by considering the interaction between independent variables sem can effectively quantify the combined effect of multiple influencing factors on target variables jia et al 2020 song et al 2021 it can be used to distinguish the direct and indirect effects of hydrometeorological factors on wl change and is thus considered a powerful method for better wl attribution analysis hulun lake is the largest lake in northern china and plays a substantial role in water conservation biodiversity maintenance and climate regulation cao et al 2021a since it is located in the middle and high latitudes of the marginal area affected by the southeast monsoon the regional hydrological cycle is relatively sensitive to climate change in recent decades the wl of hulun lake has shown a significant downward trend liu and yue 2017 with prominent ecological and environmental problems such as wetland shrinking and water quality deterioration fang et al 2019 although many studies have applied machine learning algorithms water balance models and other approaches to analyze the attribution of wl decline under climate change cai et al 2016 fan et al 2021 few of them considered the interactions of multiple factors when explaining the driving mechanism in addition with increasing droughts in the basin the intensification of human activities and significant land use changes in recent years zhang et al 2019 it still remains unclear how the contribution of climate to wl changes over time and the underlying driving mechanism requires further clarification to improve the management strategy of hulun lake wl this study aims to explore the influence of climate on wl change in hulun lake from 1961 to 2020 based on wavelet analysis and the sem the purpose of this study is to 1 analyze the characteristics of regional climate and lake level change 2 quantify the contribution of climate change to wl variation and 3 explore the driving mechanism of wl changes in hulun lake during different periods the results can provide a scientific basis for the management of hulun lake and water resource protection in the basin and also provide important information for revealing the driving mechanisms of lake wl changes in other cold and arid regions under changing climate 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area hulun lake 48 30 49 20 n 117 117 41 e is located in the western part of the hulun buir grassland in inner mongolia wu et al 2015 close to the borders of china mongolia and russia fig 1 the lake area is approximately 2134 05 km 2 with an average depth of 4 71 m the lake basin features a typical temperate continental climate with 90 of the area covered by grasslands xiao et al 2009 rainfall is concentrated in summer accounting for about 72 2 of the annual total amount and the average temperature is around 1 36 c winter lasts from mid october to early may which is also the glacial period of the lake there are over 60 rivers and streams in the basin of which kherlen and urshen are the largest the kherlen river located southwest of hulun lake originates from the eastern foot of the khentii mountains in the people s republic of mongolia it flows from west to east before entering hulun lake with an average annual runoff of 4 6 10 8 m 3 the urshen river originates from the greater khingan mountains southeast to hulun lake with an average annual runoff of 6 11 10 8 m 3 runoff precipitation and evapotranspiration are the main components of the multi year water balance of hulun lake fu et al 2021 since 2000 hulun lake did not discharge any outflow due to the wl decline to remediate the situation in 2010 the local government excavated an artificial channel in the northeast of the lake to divert hailar river into hulun lake during flood season li et al 2021 2 2 datasets monthly wl data of 1992 2020 was obtained from hydroweb http hydroweb theia land fr developed by the laboratoire d √©tudes en g√®o physique et oc√©anographie spatiales legos which has been proven a reliable dataset by multiple scholars e g cretaux et al 2011 liu and yue 2017 annual in situ wl observations for 1961 to 2011 were obtained from the dalai gauge 49 08 117 22 the overlapping period 1992 2011 between the legos altimetry and the in situ measurements showed a high correlation r 2 0 99 see fig s1 then the two datasets were merged together to construct a long time series 1961 2020 to be used in this study the meteorological data were obtained from climatic research unit cru which provides interpolated grid datasets for 4000 gauging stations worldwide across a long time scale harris et al 2020 in this study four climate variables namely precipitation pre potential evapotranspiration et p surface temperature tmp and vapor pressure vap were downloaded from cru ts version 4 05 product https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg cru ts 4 05 for 1961 to 2020 sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the ni√±o 3 4 regions were

urban land and others the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei downloaded from the institutional repository of the spanish national research council http digital csic es was used to indicate the droughts in the watershed 2 3 methods 2 3 1 abrupt change point detection the mann kendall m k significance test and moving t test were performed to identify abrupt change points of wl variation during 1961 2020 the m k test is a non parametric statistical test that is widely used to evaluate the trends of hydrological time series guclu 2018 a positive value of the forward curve uf indicates an increasing trend of a time series while a negative value indicates a decreasing trend the intersection of the uf and backward curve ub within 5 confidence interval is identified as a change point the moving t test can detect whether the mean values of the two sub samples change significantly zhao et al 2015 both methods are widely applied in the field of hydrology the m k test and moving t test were implemented in matlab r2020b 2 3 2 wavelet analysis the wavelet analysis can reveal the local characteristics of a time series in time frequency domain making it suitable for studying hydrometeorological time series with multiple time scales and nonstationary characteristics labat 2005 labat et al 2005 a wavelet is a wave like oscillation with an amplitude that begins at zero increases or decreases and then returns to zero the wavelet function should satisfy the following conditions 1 œà t d t 0 where œà t is the basic wavelet function the continuous wavelet transformation of signal f t l 2 r can be expressed as 2 w f a b f t œà a b t d t œà a b t 1 a œà t b a a b r a 0 w f a b is the wavelet transform coefficient œà t is the complex conjugate function of œà t a is the scale factor that reflects the period length of the wavelet and b is the shift factor which is the shift in reaction time wavelet coherence wtc was applied to identify the frequency bands within which two time series co varied and can be defined as 3 r n 2 a b 1 w f x y a 2 s a 1 w f x a 2 s a 1 w f y a 2 where r n 2 a presents wavelet coherence and s is a smoothing operator for both scale and time domain which is defined as 4 s w s s c a l e s t i m e w n s s where s s c a l e smooths along the scale axis and s t i m e smooths along the time axis the wavelet coherence spectrum quantitatively measures the cross correlation of two factors in multiple temporal scales 2 3 3 wl influence factor quantifications two coherence indicators namely single scale coherence rate scr and percentage area significant coherence pasc are defined to assess the influence of individual factors on wl at different scales and to quantify the coherence relationship between wl and climate factors 5 scr c n c s n t s pasc c a s a t 100 where n c s represents the number of years in which the wl coherence index is larger than 0 5 at scale s n t s refers to the total number of years at scale s which equals 60 in this case scr c was used to quantify the coherence relationship between wl and the climate factor c at the scale s the higher the scr c the more years the influencing factor f is significantly coherent with wl at scale s for climate factor c a high value of scr c also indicates strong multi scale stability of coherence relationship between wl and climate factor c a s is the area of significant coherence patches a t is the total area of coherence which is the same for all climate factors pasc c reflects the significant extent of coherence between climate factor c and wl across all years and scales the larger the value of pasc c the more significant coherence between climate factor c and wl 2 3 4 structure equation model sem sem has now been widely used in different disciplines grace et al 2014 hao et al 2020 yang et al 2021 compared with other models sem can effectively quantify the combined effects of multiple influencing factors on target variables by considering the interactions between independent variables in a complete sem analysis a set of hypotheses between several variables based on the results of theoretical basis or prior research should first be constructed the fitting indicators must then be modified until they meet statistical requirements henseler et al 2015 typically sem includes observed and latent variables the observed variables can be directly measured and are represented by squares or rectangles latent variables are used to describe unobserved variables that can be explained by observed variables and are expressed as circles or ellipses sem adopts a maximum likelihood estimation using goodness of fit indicators such as the comparative fit index root mean square error of approximation and standardized root mean square residual the standardized regression coefficient r represents the influence of two factors where a positive value indicates a positive influence in this study we considered flow enso nao and four climate factors as the observed variables while land use change as the latent variable 3 results 3 1 characteristics of wl variation the wl of hulun lake fluctuated significantly over the past 60 years with an average level of 543 9 m and a decreasing trend of 0 41 m a see fig 2a as shown in fig 2b d the intersection of the positive and inverse sequence lines of the m k test is in 1972 1990 and 1997 whereas only 1997 is within the 5 significance level among positive peaks of the t test curves for the 5 year and 15 year sliding windows the 1997 s peak exceeded the confidence interval therefore 1997 was one abrupt change point of wl based on abrupt point detection changes of the wl can be divided into two periods a slow declining period 1961 1997 and a drastic fluctuating period 1998 2020 in the first period 1961 1997 the wl decreased slightly by 7 mm a during 1961 1983 the wl dropped by 1 8 m from 544 9 m to 543 1 m after which wl experienced successive increases in years 1984 1985 and 1986 rising from 543 8 m to 545 m and then fluctuated at approximately 544 8 m in the second period 1998 2020 the wl declined dramatically with an overall declining rate of 37 6 mm a during 1998 2011 the wl dropped sharply by 3 47 m from 544 52 m to 540 97 m at a rate of 330 mm a then wl experienced a recovery period after 2012 rising from 540 96 m to 543 84 m in 2020 which is consistent with the observed records by jason satellite data li et al 2019 3 2 variation of hydrometeorological factors climate change is known as an important driver in altering hydrological processes in this study et p pre tmp and vap were selected to investigate the impact of climate change on hulun basin over the past 60 years fig 3a d depict the temporal trends of meteorological factors in hulun basin results show that although the annual pre in the basin barely shows an upward trend 0 1 mm a a transition from dry to wet years is evident during 1978 2000 and the turning point occurred approximately in 1986 meanwhile the wl rose from 543 8 m to 545 m during 1984 1986 therefore the change of pre is well correlated with the wl variation during this period vap also showed an upward trend 0 7 hpa 10 a a climate transition from wet to dry during mid 1990s was detected from the lowess curve and the turning point was approximately in 1997 subsequently vap decreased at a rate of 0 16 hpa 10 a the decrease of vap might be explained by the slight decrease in summer pre during this period fig s2a causing less water to evaporate into the atmosphere li et al 2022 as shown in fig 3d during 1961 1997 the et p is relatively stable with an increasing trend of 0 16 mm a after 1997 however the annual et p increased significantly at a rate of 0 9 mm a with the annual and monthly averages significantly improved during this period see fig s2b tmp in hulun basin showed a significant upward trend 0 3 c 10a and increased by approximately 1 8 c in the past 60 years in addition an upward trend occurred in both ice covered and none ice covered periods fig s2c with rates of 0 31 c and 0 32 c 10a respectively overall hulun basin is undergoing a warming and drying transition over the past 60 years with an intensified trend in the 21st century due to the increase of et p the pattern of the wavelet coefficient of vap is similar to that of pre while the pattern of et p is roughly the opposite of pre and vap indicating strong correlations among the three variables there are two high value centers on 45 and 55 year scales for strong et p years 1975 and 2010 and one low value center for weak et p year 1992 tmp showed multiscale characteristics with multiple warm and cold centers overall the patterns among pre vap and et p were consistent with the wl variation 3 3 relationships between water level and climatic variables to better understand the impact of climate change on wl variation the correlation between each climate factor and wl was analyzed as shown in table 1 the correlation coefficients between wl and et p reached 0 57 followed by pre with r being 0 37 the correlations between wl tmp and vap were relatively low and none significant p 0 1 overall et p was significantly correlated with wl changes to further investigate the influence of climate factors on the wl at different time scales wtc was calculated to quantify the linearity between wl and climate factors in time frequency domain according to the results wl showed a high response to et p and tmp followed by vap and pre during 1966 1974 and 1984 1994 wl showed a lag of six month behind concurrent precipitation see fig 4e similar to pre wl lagged behind vap by six months during 1961 1985 fig 4g while wl showed in phase correlations with vap around 2000 during this period the basin showed an overall drying trend vap decreased gradually as did wl the wtc characteristic of tmp was similar to that of et p where during 1970 1990 wl showed a significant negative correlation with tmp and et p fig 4f and h indicating a decrease of wl with respect to the increasing tmp and et p notably the synchronization relationship among tmp et p and wl changed during 2004 2020 and 1990 2010 specifically the wl series was ahead of tmp and et p by approximately 45 however the increase in tmp during 2004 2020 could not explain the variation in wl in addition the positive correlation between et p and wl from 1990 to 2010 is inconsistent with the observed increase of et p thus one might infer that factors other than climate change such as human activities may have played a leading role in the drastic change of wl in hulun lake in the late 1990s the cumulative scr of climate factors was calculated to quantify the coherence relationship between each climate factor and wl at different scales according to the results shown in fig 5a the scr of pre and vap were mainly concentrated on medium and small time scales scr p was concentrated within 9 years while scr v within 6 years scr e was mainly concentrated on medium and long term scales greater than 6 years while scr t spanned across all years indicating multiple time scale impacts on wl notably all climate factors have significant coherence with wl within a 4 year scale which is a typical scale of enso 2 7 years on the scales of 11 to 12 year that are typical for the nao 11 years the scr of each climate factor reaches the maximum the scr results highlighted the potential relationship between atmospheric circulation and climate change in hulun basin fig 5b shows the contribution of each climate factor to the wl variation at different periods et p contributed the most in the past 60 years where pasc e 9 6 followed by tmp pasc t 8 8 vap and pre have less influence on wl with pasc 5 9 and 2 7 respectively the pasc of pre and vap were larger during the first period indicating that the impacts of the two variables on wl were mainly concentrated during 1961 1997 instead the pasc values of et p and tmp for the two periods were similar implying that et p and tmp contribute almost the same in both periods to wl variation it is worth noting that the average pasc of all climate factors during 1961 1997 denoted as pasci was greater than that during 1998 2020 pasci 4 43 pascii 2 34 which infers a weakening impact of changing climate on wl variation towards late 20th century according to the results wl variation highly correlates with et p followed by tmp the impact of vap and pre on wl weakened after the end of the 20th century except for et p and tmp 4 discussions 4 1 underlying mechanisms of water level variation in different periods hulun lake is located at the junction of the monsoon and non monsoon regions and its hydrological cycle is greatly influenced by global atmospheric circulation li et al 2020 sun and lotz 2020 figure s3d shows that there is a significant correlation between the enso index and lake inflow on a 0 5 year scale highlighting the impact of el ni√±o events on runoff in hulun basin wtc results fig s3e show that nao has a strong positive correlation with flow during the 1980s and the 1990s the strong nao introduced more precipitation in the basin siderius et al 2018 which may be the reason why hulun lake maintained high wls during this period overall results show that large scale climate patterns can significantly regulate precipitation in the basin and affect the runoff thereby indirectly affecting the lake wl the direct and indirect effects of climatic factors on wl changes during different periods were explored using the sem as shown in fig 6a there is a direct pathway between et p and wl since the increasing trend of et p was notably larger than that of pre and tmp fig 3 its impact on wl was more significant r 0 67 in the past 60 years tmp had the greatest impact on et p r 0 44 indicating that the rise in et p caused by climate warming was the main driving force leading to the decline of hulun lake wl since it increases lake surface evaporation which plays the largest role of the multi year water cycle in hulun lake fu et al 2021 moreover the increasing trend of et p was notably larger than that of pre and tmp thus its impact on wl was more significant considering both tmp and et p increases may incur drought the spei was used to analyze drought in hulun basin drought years were often accompanied by a decline in wl such as in 1977 1983 and 1998 2012 see fig 7 after 2000 the drought became even more severe in terms of intensity and duration wtc fig s4 showed that long term drought in the watershed affected the wl throughout the study period the effect of pre on flow is not significant which is attributed to the high spatial heterogeneity of hulun basin this can cause inconsistent responses of the hydrological cycle to the underlying surface in different regions bai et al 2021 resulting in asynchronous rainfall runoff confluence zhang et al 2022 wtc results also verified that there was a time lag between the flow and pre fig s5 the total coefficients of et p pre tmp flow and vap on wl variation were 0 66 0 3 0 29 0 21 and 0 04 respectively in the first period flow had the greatest impact on wl r 0 41 fig 6b indicating that the decrease in runoff 0 1 billion m 3 a was the main reason for the drop in wl during 1961 1997 the direct effect of et p on wl was small r 0 08 however a pathway between et p and flow was observed due to the existence of a large water deficient steppe in hulun basin cao et al 2021b the increase in et p weakens the runoff in the watershed chi et al 2018 indirectly affecting wl by cutting lake inflow r 0 24 previous studies have shown that although rainfall is an important component of the hydrological cycle in hulun basin runoff is the main source for the water balance of the lake haghighi and klove 2015 in addition the strong el ni√±o greatly enhanced the possibility of summer extreme precipitation r 0 66 making the runoff high in the mid 1980s fig s3a and wl also increased significantly which is consistent with the increasing trend of extreme precipitation events in inner mongolia over the past 50 years fu et al 2013 the effect of nao on pre was smaller r 0 12 compared to the enso the total coefficients of flow pre enso et p tmp and nao on wl variation were 0 41 0 29 0 19 0 18 0 07 and 0 01 respectively in the second period et p had the greatest impact on wl r 0 58 fig 6c the rising temperature was a reason for the increase in et p r 0 32 in addition rising tmp facilitates the decline in wl r 0 21 this is because the areas of permafrost in the upper reaches of the ursun and kherlen rivers have been decreasing and the snow melt in mountainous areas has accelerated since the 1980s which to a certain extent replenished the river flow and maintained high wl however around 2000 as tmp continued to rise the permafrost layer completely disappeared sun and lotz 2020 and the insufficient supply of snow thawed permafrost to the rivers caused lake inflow to decline rapidly thus wl also dropped the total coefficients of et p tmp pre and flow on the wl variation were 0 58 0 4 0 19 and 0 17 respectively 4 2 implication from increased et p in addition to climate change strong human activities such as deforestation and the expansion of cropland and urbanization are other reasons for the shrinking lake areas in the mongolia xinjiang plateau after the 1990s tao et al 2015 cropland increased by 3919 km 2 from 1992 to 2020 the significant expansion of cropland altered the properties of land surface such as surface albedo and leaf area index glenn et al 2010 thereby greatly increasing et p in the central watershed and agricultural areas urban areas are also expanding the construction of urban reservoirs ponds and roads will intercept surface runoff thus reducing the amount of water entering the lake shirmohammadi et al 2020 in addition large areas of forest and vegetation in the upper reaches were replaced by bare land weakening the retention ability of soil to conserve water the sediment content of rivers increased in flood season and discharge decreased significantly in dry season thus threatening water resources and lake wls acosta martinez et al 2010 the sem was adjusted in the second period after considering the impact of land use change fig 8 vegetation coverage loss had the most significant impact on wl r 1 09 followed by the expansion of cultivated land and urban areas r 1 04 r 0 95 land use change had the most significant impact on the increase in et p r 0 78 the total coefficients of lc flow et p and tmp on wl variation were 0 86 0 26 0 2 and 0 02 respectively overall the decline in the wl of hulun lake in the late 1990s was the result of the combined effects of climate warming vegetation degradation and urban and cropland expansion notably hulun basin experienced severe drought during 2013 2020 fig 7 however the wl began to rise at a rate of 312 mm a since 2012 correlation analysis table 2 showed that from 2012 to 2020 the correlation between the inflow and wl was 0 75 exceeding the correlations of natural inflow and meteorological factors with wl the rapid recovery of the wl can be explained by the implementation of the river diversion project which was introduced in 2010 cai et al 2016 from 1961 to 1997 hulun basin was less disturbed and the wl was mainly affected by climate change reduction in runoff caused the slight wl decrease which is consistent with the results found by cao et al 2021a and fu et al 2021 during this time the wl generally fluctuated within a certain range however the wl underwent drastic changes after 1998 at the beginning of the 21st century et p of the basin increased significantly due to the rising temperature which is considered to be the main reason for wl drop fan et al 2021 while in our work we found that the landuse of hulun basin has changed a lot since the late 20st century as a consequence vegetation degradation and human activities further increased the et p resulting in a decrease in the water yield of the basin the increasing warming and drying trends and drought events in the hulun basin have seriously threatened the water yield here and a reasonable land use pattern can promote surface runoff yield by conserving water resources thus ensuring lake inflow sun et al 2017 forest land can better reduce the fluctuation of water production in the basin caused by climate change feng et al 2012 and protect the regional environment from extreme events lloret et al 2012 in the future while ensuring ecological water replenishment the focus should be further strengthened by performing ecological restoration based on forest land and shrubs that are conducive to runoff in order to preserve soil water storage and canopy interception capacity thus ultimately to improve inflow to maintain a suitable ecological wl for hulun lake 5 conclusions this study applied wavelet analysis to explore the characteristics of hulun lake wl and the changing climate factors in the basin results showed that in the past 60 years hulun basin has shown a warming trend while the wl has shown an overall downward trend 41 2 mm a which can be further divided into two periods namely a slow declining period from 1961 to 1997 where the wl decreased with a trend of 7 4 mm a and a transitional period towards recovery from 1998 to 2020 where wl dropped by 3 47 m and began to rise in 2012 with an overall decrease of 37 6 mm a using sem method the contribution of climatic factors to wl was quantified and the driving mechanism of wl change was revealed which showed that the increasing et p caused by warming temperature was the main reason for wl decline r 0 66 from 1961 to 1997 increasing et p led to reduced runoff which directly caused a decrease in wl r 0 41 in the mid 1980s the enso drove the increasing rainfall and incurred a slight increase in wl r 0 31 from 1998 to 2020 land use change became the main reason for the decline in lake wl r 1 08 because the basin experienced significant deforestation farmland expansion and urbanization which significantly enhanced et p r 0 22 and further reduced runoff leading to a wl drop with a mandate of ecological water protection from the government future efforts should focus on implementing ecological restoration by recovering forests grasses and shrubs lands that are conducive to runoff in order to increase lake inflow and maintain a suitable wl still some limitations of this work should be noted first the proposed method does not describe lake level dynamics as physics based models do and it cannot capture all nonlinear relationships among possible driving factors and wl thus further studies are still needed to investigate such non linear relationships in addition a longer water diversion data may help to better elaborate the driving mechanism of wl variation credit authorship contribution statement yuqi huang conceptualization methodology software bo

7744,study region hulun lake the fifth largest lake in china study focus the notable decline in water level wl caused by climate change is the primary challenge faced by hulun lake however the contribution of climate to water loss and its driving mechanisms remain unclear the impact of climate on wl change was investigated using wavelet analysis and structural equation models new hydrological insights for the region in the past 60 years the increasing potential evapotranspiration et p caused by warming climate was the main reason for the wl decline r 0 67 for period i 1961 1997 reduced runoff due to increasing et p caused an overall decrease in wl r 0 41 during the mid 1980s the increase in rainfall driven by enso r 0 66 caused a slight increase in wl r 0 31 for period ii 1998 2020 deforestation farmland and urban area expansion were the main drivers behind the significant increase of et p in the watershed r 0 22 which leads to reduced runoff and consequently a significant decrease in wl the influence of climate on wl change weakened compared with that in the first period due to land use change r 1 08 graphical abstract keywords lake water resources climate change sem landuse data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lakes respond rapidly to climate change especially in arid and semi arid regions woolway et al 2020 woolway and merchant 2019 some manifested consequences include decline in water volumes increased water temperature ecosystem degradation etc yang et al 2019 2020 as a sentinel to climate change water level wl regime is also an intuitive indicator of lake water resources kraemer et al 2020 which can comprehensively reflect hydrological processes e g runoff generation evapotranspiration and rainfall of the basin and the abundance of lake water storage in the past decades global warming and anthropogenic activities have caused a sharp decrease in wl in closed inland lakes in northern china the number of lakes larger than 1 km 2 in inner mongolia decreased by 159 between 1991 and 2009 zhou et al 2019 there is an impending need to investigate the impact of climate change on lake wls in semi arid and arid regions for watershed management and lake water conservation among all drivers climate change has shown a widespread impact on lake wls in arid regions due to the complexity and nonlinearity of climate factors their impact on wl typically manifests across different time spans rezaei and gurdak 2020 with the gradual strengthening of human activities the dual influences on the evolution of watershed environment and on wl requires a more thorough and discreet verification cooley et al 2021 climate impact on lake wl has drawn great attention in recent years where researchers applied different approaches to reveal the response and driving mechanism of lake wls against various changing climatic factors those methods include statistical models such as the least squares regression model and bayesian network conceptual models such as the budyko hypothesis and scs cn models wang 2018 zhang et al 2015 and process based models such as swat delft3d chen et al 2018 mccombs et al 2014 these methods tend to focus on the impact of individual variables e g precipitation air temperature and runoff on wl however lake wl variation often results from complex interactions between meteorological factors such as evaporation and precipitation as well as from watershed hydrological factors such as inflow kundu et al 2017 how to disentangle such interaction in the context of changing conditions remains a challenge by considering the interaction between independent variables sem can effectively quantify the combined effect of multiple influencing factors on target variables jia et al 2020 song et al 2021 it can be used to distinguish the direct and indirect effects of hydrometeorological factors on wl change and is thus considered a powerful method for better wl attribution analysis hulun lake is the largest lake in northern china and plays a substantial role in water conservation biodiversity maintenance and climate regulation cao et al 2021a since it is located in the middle and high latitudes of the marginal area affected by the southeast monsoon the regional hydrological cycle is relatively sensitive to climate change in recent decades the wl of hulun lake has shown a significant downward trend liu and yue 2017 with prominent ecological and environmental problems such as wetland shrinking and water quality deterioration fang et al 2019 although many studies have applied machine learning algorithms water balance models and other approaches to analyze the attribution of wl decline under climate change cai et al 2016 fan et al 2021 few of them considered the interactions of multiple factors when explaining the driving mechanism in addition with increasing droughts in the basin the intensification of human activities and significant land use changes in recent years zhang et al 2019 it still remains unclear how the contribution of climate to wl changes over time and the underlying driving mechanism requires further clarification to improve the management strategy of hulun lake wl this study aims to explore the influence of climate on wl change in hulun lake from 1961 to 2020 based on wavelet analysis and the sem the purpose of this study is to 1 analyze the characteristics of regional climate and lake level change 2 quantify the contribution of climate change to wl variation and 3 explore the driving mechanism of wl changes in hulun lake during different periods the results can provide a scientific basis for the management of hulun lake and water resource protection in the basin and also provide important information for revealing the driving mechanisms of lake wl changes in other cold and arid regions under changing climate 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area hulun lake 48 30 49 20 n 117 117 41 e is located in the western part of the hulun buir grassland in inner mongolia wu et al 2015 close to the borders of china mongolia and russia fig 1 the lake area is approximately 2134 05 km 2 with an average depth of 4 71 m the lake basin features a typical temperate continental climate with 90 of the area covered by grasslands xiao et al 2009 rainfall is concentrated in summer accounting for about 72 2 of the annual total amount and the average temperature is around 1 36 c winter lasts from mid october to early may which is also the glacial period of the lake there are over 60 rivers and streams in the basin of which kherlen and urshen are the largest the kherlen river located southwest of hulun lake originates from the eastern foot of the khentii mountains in the people s republic of mongolia it flows from west to east before entering hulun lake with an average annual runoff of 4 6 10 8 m 3 the urshen river originates from the greater khingan mountains southeast to hulun lake with an average annual runoff of 6 11 10 8 m 3 runoff precipitation and evapotranspiration are the main components of the multi year water balance of hulun lake fu et al 2021 since 2000 hulun lake did not discharge any outflow due to the wl decline to remediate the situation in 2010 the local government excavated an artificial channel in the northeast of the lake to divert hailar river into hulun lake during flood season li et al 2021 2 2 datasets monthly wl data of 1992 2020 was obtained from hydroweb http hydroweb theia land fr developed by the laboratoire d √©tudes en g√®o physique et oc√©anographie spatiales legos which has been proven a reliable dataset by multiple scholars e g cretaux et al 2011 liu and yue 2017 annual in situ wl observations for 1961 to 2011 were obtained from the dalai gauge 49 08 117 22 the overlapping period 1992 2011 between the legos altimetry and the in situ measurements showed a high correlation r 2 0 99 see fig s1 then the two datasets were merged together to construct a long time series 1961 2020 to be used in this study the meteorological data were obtained from climatic research unit cru which provides interpolated grid datasets for 4000 gauging stations worldwide across a long time scale harris et al 2020 in this study four climate variables namely precipitation pre potential evapotranspiration et p surface temperature tmp and vapor pressure vap were downloaded from cru ts version 4 05 product https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg cru ts 4 05 for 1961 to 2020 sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the ni√±o 3 4 regions were

february and the nao north atlantic oscillation index for november to march landcover data from 1992 to 2020 were obtained from the european space agency climate change initiative the dataset has a spatial resolution of 300 300 m and includes 37 landuse types hollmann et al 2013 which were then reclassified into 8 categories i e cropland land forest grassland bare land vegetation water body urban land and others the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei downloaded from the institutional repository of the spanish national research council http digital csic es was used to indicate the droughts in the watershed 2 3 methods 2 3 1 abrupt change point detection the mann kendall m k significance test and moving t test were performed to identify abrupt change points of wl variation during 1961 2020 the m k test is a non parametric statistical test that is widely used to evaluate the trends of hydrological time series guclu 2018 a positive value of the forward curve uf indicates an increasing trend of a time series while a negative value indicates a decreasing trend the intersection of the uf and backward curve ub within 5 confidence interval is identified as a change point the moving t test can detect whether the mean values of the two sub samples change significantly zhao et al 2015 both methods are widely applied in the field of hydrology the m k test and moving t test were implemented in matlab r2020b 2 3 2 wavelet analysis the wavelet analysis can reveal the local characteristics of a time series in time frequency domain making it suitable for studying hydrometeorological time series with multiple time scales and nonstationary characteristics labat 2005 labat et al 2005 a wavelet is a wave like oscillation with an amplitude that begins at zero increases or decreases and then returns to zero the wavelet function should satisfy the following conditions 1 œà t d t 0 where œà t is the basic wavelet function the continuous wavelet transformation of signal f t l 2 r can be expressed as 2 w f a b f t œà a b t d t œà a b t 1 a œà t b a a b r a 0 w f a b is the wavelet transform coefficient œà t is the complex conjugate function of œà t a is the scale factor that reflects the period length of the wavelet and b is the shift factor which is the shift in reaction time wavelet coherence wtc was applied to identify the frequency bands within which two time series co varied and can be defined as 3 r n 2 a b 1 w f x y a 2 s a 1 w f x a 2 s a 1 w f y a 2 where r n 2 a presents wavelet coherence and s is a smoothing operator for both scale and time domain which is defined as 4 s w s s c a l e s t i m e w n s s where s s c a l e smooths along the scale axis and s t i m e smooths along the time axis the wavelet coherence spectrum quantitatively measures the cross correlation of two factors in multiple temporal scales 2 3 3 wl influence factor quantifications two coherence indicators namely single scale coherence rate scr and percentage area significant coherence pasc are defined to assess the influence of individual factors on wl at different scales and to quantify the coherence relationship between wl and climate factors 5 scr c n c s n t s pasc c a s a t 100 where n c s represents the number of years in which the wl coherence index is larger than 0 5 at scale s n t s refers to the total number of years at scale s which equals 60 in this case scr c was used to quantify the coherence relationship between wl and the climate factor c at the scale s the higher the scr c the more years the influencing factor f is significantly coherent with wl at scale s for climate factor c a high value of scr c also indicates strong multi scale stability of coherence relationship between wl and climate factor c a s is the area of significant coherence patches a t is the total area of coherence which is the same for all climate factors pasc c reflects the significant extent of coherence between climate factor c and wl across all years and scales the larger the value of pasc c the more significant coherence between climate factor c and wl 2 3 4 structure equation model sem sem has now been widely used in different disciplines grace et al 2014 hao et al 2020 yang et al 2021 compared with other models sem can effectively quantify the combined effects of multiple influencing factors on target variables by considering the interactions between independent variables in a complete sem analysis a set of hypotheses between several variables based on the results of theoretical basis or prior research should first be constructed the fitting indicators must then be modified until they meet statistical requirements henseler et al 2015 typically sem includes observed and latent variables the observed variables can be directly measured and are represented by squares or rectangles latent variables are used to describe unobserved variables that can be explained by observed variables and are expressed as circles or ellipses sem adopts a maximum likelihood estimation using goodness of fit indicators such as the comparative fit index root mean square error of approximation and standardized root mean square residual the standardized regression coefficient r represents the influence of two factors where a positive value indicates a positive influence in this study we considered flow enso nao and four climate factors as the observed variables while land use change as the latent variable 3 results 3 1 characteristics of wl variation the wl of hulun lake fluctuated significantly over the past 60 years with an average level of 543 9 m and a decreasing trend of 0 41 m a see fig 2a as shown in fig 2b d the intersection of the positive and inverse sequence lines of the m k test is in 1972 1990 and 1997 whereas only 1997 is within the 5 significance level among positive peaks of the t test curves for the 5 year and 15 year sliding windows the 1997 s peak exceeded the confidence interval therefore 1997 was one abrupt change point of wl based on abrupt point detection changes of the wl can be divided into two periods a slow declining period 1961 1997 and a drastic fluctuating period 1998 2020 in the first period 1961 1997 the wl decreased slightly by 7 mm a during 1961 1983 the wl dropped by 1 8 m from 544 9 m to 543 1 m after which wl experienced successive increases in years 1984 1985 and 1986 rising from 543 8 m to 545 m and then fluctuated at approximately 544 8 m in the second period 1998 2020 the wl declined dramatically with an overall declining rate of 37 6 mm a during 1998 2011 the wl dropped sharply by 3 47 m from 544 52 m to 540 97 m at a rate of 330 mm a then wl experienced a recovery period after 2012 rising from 540 96 m to 543 84 m in 2020 which is consistent with the observed records by jason satellite data li et al 2019 3 2 variation of hydrometeorological factors climate change is known as an important driver in altering hydrological processes in this study et p pre tmp and vap were selected to investigate the impact of climate change on hulun basin over the past 60 years fig 3a d depict the temporal trends of meteorological factors in hulun basin results show that although the annual pre in the basin barely shows an upward trend 0 1 mm a a transition from dry to wet years is evident during 1978 2000 and the turning point occurred approximately in 1986 meanwhile the wl rose from 543 8 m to 545 m during 1984 1986 therefore the change of pre is well correlated with the wl variation during this period vap also showed an upward trend 0 7 hpa 10 a a climate transition from wet to dry during mid 1990s was detected from the lowess curve and the turning point was approximately in 1997 subsequently vap decreased at a rate of 0 16 hpa 10 a the decrease of vap might be explained by the slight decrease in summer pre during this period fig s2a causing less water to evaporate into the atmosphere li et al 2022 as shown in fig 3d during 1961 1997 the et p is relatively stable with an increasing trend of 0 16 mm a after 1997 however the annual et p increased significantly at a rate of 0 9 mm a with the annual and monthly averages significantly improved during this period see fig s2b tmp in hulun basin showed a significant upward trend 0 3 c 10a and increased by approximately 1 8 c in the past 60 years in addition an upward trend occurred in both ice covered and none ice covered periods fig s2c with rates of 0 31 c and 0 32 c 10a respectively overall hulun basin is undergoing a warming and drying transition over the past 60 years with an intensified trend in the 21st century due to the increase of et p the pattern of the wavelet coefficient of vap is similar to that of pre while the pattern of et p is roughly the opposite of pre and vap indicating strong correlations among the three variables there are two high value centers on 45 and 55 year scales for strong et p years 1975 and 2010 and one low value center for weak et p year 1992 tmp showed multiscale characteristics with multiple warm and cold centers overall the patterns among pre vap and et p were consistent with the wl variation 3 3 relationships between water level and climatic variables to better understand the impact of climate change on wl variation the correlation between each climate factor and wl was analyzed as shown in table 1 the correlation coefficients between wl and et p reached 0 57 followed by pre with r being 0 37 the correlations between wl tmp and vap were relatively low and none significant p 0 1 overall et p was significantly correlated with wl changes to further investigate the influence of climate factors on the wl at different time scales wtc was calculated to quantify the linearity between wl and climate factors in time frequency domain according to the results wl showed a high response to et p and tmp followed by vap and pre during 1966 1974 and 1984 1994 wl showed a lag of six month behind concurrent precipitation see fig 4e similar to pre wl lagged behind vap by six months during 1961 1985 fig 4g while wl showed in phase correlations with vap around 2000 during this period the basin showed an overall drying trend vap decreased gradually as did wl the wtc characteristic of tmp was similar to that of et p where during 1970 1990 wl showed a significant negative correlation with tmp and et p fig 4f and h indicating a decrease of wl with respect to the increasing tmp and et p notably the synchronization relationship among tmp et p and wl changed during 2004 2020 and 1990 2010 specifically the wl series was ahead of tmp and et p by approximately 45 however the increase in tmp during 2004 2020 could not explain the variation in wl in addition the positive correlation between et p and wl from 1990 to 2010 is inconsistent with the observed increase of et p thus one might infer that factors other than climate change such as human activities may have played a leading role in the drastic change of wl in hulun lake in the late 1990s the cumulative scr of climate factors was calculated to quantify the coherence relationship between each climate factor and wl at different scales according to the results shown in fig 5a the scr of pre and vap were mainly concentrated on medium and small time scales scr p was concentrated within 9 years while scr v within 6 years scr e was mainly concentrated on medium and long term scales greater than 6 years while scr t spanned across all years indicating multiple time scale impacts on wl notably all climate factors have significant coherence with wl within a 4 year scale which is a typical scale of enso 2 7 years on the scales of 11 to 12 year that are typical for the nao 11 years the scr of each climate factor reaches the maximum the scr results highlighted the potential relationship between atmospheric circulation and climate change in hulun basin fig 5b shows the contribution of each climate factor to the wl variation at different periods et p contributed the most in the past 60 years where pasc e 9 6 followed by tmp pasc t 8 8 vap and pre have less influence on wl with pasc 5 9 and 2 7 respectively the pasc of pre and vap were larger during the first period indicating that the impacts of the two variables on wl were mainly concentrated during 1961 1997 instead the pasc values of et p and tmp for the two periods were similar implying that et p and tmp contribute almost the same in both periods to wl variation it is worth noting that the average pasc of all climate factors during 1961 1997 denoted as pasci was greater than that during 1998 2020 pasci 4 43 pascii 2 34 which infers a weakening impact of changing climate on wl variation towards late 20th century according to the results wl variation highly correlates with et p followed by tmp the impact of vap and pre on wl weakened after the end of the 20th century except for et p and tmp 4 discussions 4 1 underlying mechanisms of water level variation in different periods hulun lake is located at the junction of the monsoon and non monsoon regions and its hydrological cycle is greatly influenced by global atmospheric circulation li et al 2020 sun and lotz 2020 figure s3d shows that there is a significant correlation between the enso index and lake inflow on a 0 5 year scale highlighting the impact of el ni√±o events on runoff in hulun basin wtc results fig s3e show that nao has a strong positive correlation with flow during the 1980s and the 1990s the strong nao introduced more precipitation in the basin siderius et al 2018 which may be the reason why hulun lake maintained high wls during this period overall results show that large scale climate patterns can significantly regulate precipitation in the basin and affect the runoff thereby indirectly affecting the lake wl the direct and indirect effects of climatic factors on wl changes during different periods were explored using the sem as shown in fig 6a there is a direct pathway between et p and wl since the increasing trend of et p was notably larger than that of pre and tmp fig 3 its impact on wl was more significant r 0 67 in the past 60 years tmp had the greatest impact on et p r 0 44 indicating that the rise in et p caused by climate warming was the main driving force leading to the decline of hulun lake wl since it increases lake surface evaporation which plays the largest role of the multi year water cycle in hulun lake fu et al 2021 moreover the increasing trend of et p was notably larger than that of pre and tmp thus its impact on wl was more significant considering both tmp and et p increases may incur drought the spei was used to analyze drought in hulun basin drought years were often accompanied by a decline in wl such as in 1977 1983 and 1998 2012 see fig 7 after 2000 the drought became even more severe in terms of intensity and duration wtc fig s4 showed that long term drought in the watershed affected the wl throughout the study period the effect of pre on flow is not significant which is attributed to the high spatial heterogeneity of hulun basin this can cause inconsistent responses of the hydrological cycle to the underlying surface in different regions bai et al 2021 resulting in asynchronous rainfall runoff confluence zhang et al 2022 wtc results also verified that there was a time lag between the flow and pre fig s5 the total coefficients of et p pre tmp flow and vap on wl variation were 0 66 0 3 0 29 0 21 and 0 04 respectively in the first period flow had the greatest impact on wl r 0 41 fig 6b indicating that the decrease in runoff 0 1 billion m 3 a was the main reason for the drop in wl during 1961 1997 the direct effect of et p on wl was small r 0 08 however a pathway between et p and flow was observed due to the existence of a large water deficient steppe in hulun basin cao et al 2021b the increase in et p weakens the runoff in the watershed chi et al 2018 indirectly affecting wl by cutting lake inflow r 0 24 previous studies have shown that although rainfall is an important component of the hydrological cycle in hulun basin runoff is the main source for the water balance of the lake haghighi and klove 2015 in addition the strong el ni√±o greatly enhanced the possibility of summer extreme precipitation r 0 66 making the runoff high in the mid 1980s fig s3a and wl also increased significantly which is consistent with the increasing trend of extreme precipitation events in inner mongolia over the past 50 years fu et al 2013 the effect of nao on pre was smaller r 0 12 compared to the enso the total coefficients of flow pre enso et p tmp and nao on wl variation were 0 41 0 29 0 19 0 18 0 07 and 0 01 respectively in the second period et p had the greatest impact on wl r 0 58 fig 6c the rising temperature was a reason for the increase in et p r 0 32 in addition rising tmp facilitates the decline in wl r 0 21 this is because the areas of permafrost in the upper reaches of the ursun and kherlen rivers have been decreasing and the snow melt in mountainous areas has accelerated since the 1980s which to a certain extent replenished the river flow and maintained high wl however around 2000 as tmp continued to rise the permafrost layer completely disappeared sun and lotz 2020 and the insufficient supply of snow thawed permafrost to the rivers caused lake inflow to decline rapidly thus wl also dropped the total coefficients of et p tmp pre and flow on the wl variation were 0 58 0 4 0 19 and 0 17 respectively 4 2 implication from increased et p in addition to climate change strong human activities such as deforestation and the expansion of cropland and urbanization are other reasons for the shrinking lake areas in the mongolia xinjiang plateau after the 1990s tao et al 2015 cropland increased by 3919 km 2 from 1992 to 2020 the significant expansion of cropland altered the properties of land surface such as surface albedo and leaf area index glenn et al 2010 thereby greatly increasing et p in the central watershed and agricultural areas urban areas are also expanding the construction of urban reservoirs ponds and roads will intercept surface runoff thus reducing the amount of water entering the lake shirmohammadi et al 2020 in addition large areas of forest and vegetation in the upper reaches were replaced by bare land weakening the retention ability of soil to conserve water the sediment content of rivers increased in flood season and discharge decreased significantly in dry season thus threatening water resources and lake wls acosta martinez et al 2010 the sem was adjusted in the second period after considering the impact of land use change fig 8 vegetation coverage loss had the most significant impact on wl r 1 09 followed by the expansion of cultivated land and urban areas r 1 04 r 0 95 land use change had the most significant impact on the increase in et p r 0 78 the total coefficients of lc flow et p and tmp on wl variation were 0 86 0 26 0 2 and 0 02 respectively overall the decline in the wl of hulun lake in the late 1990s was the result of the combined effects of climate warming vegetation degradation and urban and cropland expansion notably hulun basin experienced severe drought during 2013 2020 fig 7 however the wl began to rise at a rate of 312 mm a since 2012 correlation analysis table 2 showed that from 2012 to 2020 the correlation between the inflow and wl was 0 75 exceeding the correlations of natural inflow and meteorological factors with wl the rapid recovery of the wl can be explained by the implementation of the river diversion project which was introduced in 2010 cai et al 2016 from 1961 to 1997 hulun basin was less disturbed and the wl was mainly affected by climate change reduction in runoff caused the slight wl decrease which is consistent with the results found by cao et al 2021a and fu et al 2021 during this time the wl generally fluctuated within a certain range however the wl underwent drastic changes after 1998 at the beginning of the 21st century et p of the basin increased significantly due to the rising temperature which is considered to be the main reason for wl drop fan et al 2021 while in our work we found that the landuse of hulun basin has changed a lot since the late 20st century as a consequence vegetation degradation and human activities further increased the et p resulting in a decrease in the water yield of the basin the increasing warming and drying trends and drought events in the hulun basin have seriously threatened the water yield here and a reasonable land use pattern can promote surface runoff yield by conserving water resources thus ensuring lake inflow sun et al 2017 forest land can better reduce the fluctuation of water production in the basin caused by climate change feng et al 2012 and protect the regional environment from extreme events lloret et al 2012 in the future while ensuring ecological water replenishment the focus should be further strengthened by performing ecological restoration based on forest land and shrubs that are conducive to runoff in order to preserve soil water storage and canopy interception capacity thus ultimately to improve inflow to maintain a suitable ecological wl for hulun lake 5 conclusions this study applied wavelet analysis to explore the characteristics of hulun lake wl and the changing climate factors in the basin results showed that in the past 60 years hulun basin has shown a warming trend while the wl has shown an overall downward trend 41 2 mm a which can be further divided into two periods namely a slow declining period from 1961 to 1997 where the wl decreased with a trend of 7 4 mm a and a transitional period towards recovery from 1998 to 2020 where wl dropped by 3 47 m and began to rise in 2012 with an overall decrease of 37 6 mm a using sem method the contribution of climatic factors to wl was quantified and the driving mechanism of wl change was revealed which showed that the increasing et p caused by warming temperature was the main reason for wl decline r 0 66 from 1961 to 1997 increasing et p led to reduced runoff which directly caused a decrease in wl r 0 41 in the mid 1980s the enso drove the increasing rainfall and incurred a slight increase in wl r 0 31 from 1998 to 2020 land use change became the main reason for the decline in lake wl r 1 08 because the basin experienced significant deforestation farmland expansion and urbanization which significantly enhanced et p r 0 22 and further reduced runoff leading to a wl drop with a mandate of ecological water protection from the government future efforts should focus on implementing ecological restoration by recovering forests grasses and shrubs lands that are conducive to runoff in order to increase lake inflow and maintain a suitable wl still some limitations of this work should be noted first the proposed method does not describe lake level dynamics as physics based models do and it cannot capture all nonlinear relationships among possible driving factors and wl thus further studies are still needed to investigate such non linear relationships in addition a longer water diversion data may help to better elaborate the driving mechanism of wl variation credit authorship contribution statement yuqi huang conceptualization methodology software bo
