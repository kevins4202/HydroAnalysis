4715,soil is the largest organic carbon pool in the terrestrial biosphere and a small variation of soil organic carbon soc can substantially affect the global carbon cycle and climate climate change is a major driver affecting the dynamics of soc however our understanding about the responses of soc in alpine ecosystems to climate change is quite limited in particular the differences of soc dynamics at different depths were rarely reported in this study we investigated the impacts of precipitation variations and warming on soc dynamics at both top and deep soils in the qilian mountains in northwestern china using a machine learning approach and climate sensitivity experiments our simulation revealed the temporal inconsistency between topsoil soc in the top 20 cm denoted as soc20 and deeper soil soc dynamics soc20 showed a decreasing trend since 2009 which is earlier than that 2012 in the top 100 cm soil soc100 we also found that soc100 may be more sensitive to warming due to the strengthened microbial decomposition rate and additional carbon source through deepened active layer on the contrary soc20 presented more intense responses to precipitation than soc100 which was mainly attributed to the different responses of upland and lowland soc to precipitation variations our projection indicated that soc20 may not substantially change under future climate trajectories because the enriched soc induced by increased precipitation may offset the carbon loss via warming however soc100 was projected to decrease significantly due to the enhanced carbon emissions via warming induced strengthened decomposition rate additional carbon source from the deepened active layer and exposed soil carbon to the atmosphere caused by ground subsidence and disrupted soil horizons resulting from thawed frozen soil in brief this study deepened our understanding of the mechanism of climate effect on soc dynamics and can be helpful for regional soil ecological security assessment and risk projection keywords climate change random forest sensitivity analysis carbon cycle projection 1 introduction soil stores the largest organic carbon in the terrestrial biosphere with approximately 1500 pg c stored in the top 1 m batjes 1996 scharlemann et al 2014 which is more than double of that in atmosphere or three times in vegetation bradford et al 2016 ciais et al 2014 davidson et al 2000 karhu et al 2014 rossel et al 2019 hence a small change in soc pool may substantially alter the greenhouse gas concentration in atmosphere and affect the current climate bradford et al 2016 paustian et al 2019 wu et al 2015a as one of the most important components in global carbon pool soc is also well known to tightly related to soil fertility food security and water quality dignac et al 2017 fang et al 2012 lal 2004 luo et al 2019 ramesh et al 2019 consequently it is crucial to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of soc at regional and even global scales in addition it is because chemical and biochemical processes related to the soil carbon input and loss are dependent on soil temperature and water soc dynamics are regarded to be sensitive to temperature and precipitation variation davidson and janssens 2006 knapp et al 2008 suseela et al 2012 thus it is essential to detect the response of soc to temperature and precipitation alterations and its potential trends under future climate trajectories considering its critical role in the global carbon cycle and its vital feedback to climate bradford et al 2016 davidson and janssens 2006 soc dynamics are affected by many drivers such as environmental constraints climate change vegetation growth and even human activities gaitan et al 2019 ramesh et al 2019 and it is not easy to obtain accurate spatiotemporal soc storage at large scale dignac et al 2017 liu et al 2011 hence most studies concerning about the dynamics of soc mainly focused on the site scale via field investigation within a specific time interval prietzel et al 2016 xie et al 2007 zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2019b although some research mapped the spatial patterns of soc at different scales de anta et al 2020 fao and itps 2018 gomes et al 2019 hengl et al 2017 li et al 2017 understanding of the soc dynamics at both spatial and temporal scales are quite limited due to the data availability issue at the regional scale to solve this issue ecosystem process models such as denitrification and decompositio dndc li et al 1992 erosion deposition carbon model edcm liu et al 2003 and century parton 1996 were developed to investigate the soc evolution for example the united states geological survey usgs land carbon team investigated the soc dynamics across the conterminous united states based on the edcm model liu et al 2014 2012a 2011 2012b tan et al 2015 wu et al 2015b which is very useful for policy makers to initiate soil restoration policies with geographical differences due to the strong coupling between carbon and water cycle a fusion of the hydrological process model and ecosystem process model has also become a hotspot because it can better describe this carbon water coupling cycle wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 2020 long term observations and the calibration of key parameters in these process models are the major challenges for accurate simulations hu et al 2021 hui et al 2020 huo et al 2021 stockmann et al 2013 sun et al 2019 different models usually generate diverse simulations due to distinct hypothesis model structures and drivers zhang et al 2017 recently a growing number of studies adopted the state of the art machine learning approaches to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of soc and obtained satisfactory results padarian et al 2020 for instance the popular global soil organic carbon map gsocmap developed by the food and agriculture organization fao was generated based on ensemble models combining random forest support vector machine neural networks regression trees bayesian trees and other digital soil mapping techniques fao and itps 2018 until now the soc map with the highest spatial resolution 250 m 250 m on global scale provided by the international soil reference information centre isric was also generated by a machine learning approach hengl et al 2017 in addition wang et al 2020 estimated the spatiotemporal dynamics of soc over the tibetan plateau using the random forest model and projected its future trend under potential climate trajectories these studies suggested that the machine learning approach is an effective method in investigating the regional soc stocks and dynamics the qilian mountain range is an important ecological security barrier in northwestern china supplying runoff for several key inland rivers in china chen et al 2016b hence the mountain range is critical to the ecological security of northwestern china simultaneously it is also a typical vulnerable ecological region in china yao et al 2016 and ecological environment in this mountain range is very sensitive to climate change chen et al 2016a the ecological security of the qilian mountains has long been concerned by the chinese government and a national nature reserve has been established since 1988 hence understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of soc and its responses to climate change along with the potential trends under future climate are helpful to formulate the ecological protection policy of the mountain range however due to the lack of spatiotemporal continuous soc data with high spatial resolution in this region our knowledge about the dynamics of soc and its responses in different regions to climate change are vague especially most previous studies mainly focused on the responses of soc to warming davidson and janssens 2006 karhu et al 2014 kirschbaum 2000 prietzel et al 2016 schindlbacher et al 2011 2009 making that to precipitation alteration is scarcely understood a large number of studies have investigated the responses of soc to warming considering rising temperature is the climate normality in future davidson and janssens 2006 karhu et al 2014 kirschbaum 2000 prietzel et al 2016 schindlbacher et al 2009 it is suggested that warming would generally increase carbon input through enhancing the plant productivity and also strengthen the microbial activity leading to carbon loss in regions without water and nutrition limitations plante and conant 2014 hence the final response of soc to warming depended on the differences between the fluctuations of carbon input and loss in the context of geographical and environmental constraints as for the impact of precipitation on soc dynamics controversy exists among different studies zhou et al 2019a suggested that soc may linearly decrease with the increase of precipitation in the xiying river basin situated in the northeastern qilian mountains while chen et al 2016a indicated that soc was linearly positively correlated to precipitation in the pailugou watershed a region nearby in addition the nonlinear relationship between soil microorganism mediated carbon emission and precipitation or soil water content suseela et al 2012 yan et al 2018 implied that the response of soc to precipitation may not be simply positively or negatively linearly correlated the qilian mountains have many landforms including the lowlands in the southeast and the highlands and desert in the northwest it is certain that the impact of precipitation variation on soc may vary among regions however our knowledge about the responses of soc at different soil depths in distinct landforms to climate change in the qilian mountains has not been available yet it is necessary to assess the responses of soc in different regions of the qilian mountains to the variation of temperature and precipitation and future climate trajectories which can be helpful to develop the soil protection policies for adapting to climate change the objective of this study was to investigate the responses of soc at different depths to climate change in the qilian mountains we first investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of soc in this mountain range using a machine learning approach and further detected the responses of soc in the topsoil and deeper soil to temperature and precipitation alteration based on climate sensitivity experiments in addition we projected the potential responses of soc to the climate through the end of the 21st century using the spatially downscaled and calibrated climate projections from five general circulation models under three greenhouse gas concentration trajectories 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qilian mountain range is located at the border of qinghai and gansu provinces in west central china fig 1 a the mountain range is an important ecological security barrier in western china and a key ecological functional area of the country it plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of the qinghai tibet plateau and preventing the southern invasion and confluence of the four major deserts in western china fig 1a in addition it maintains the stability of hexi corridor and guarantees the runoff supply of a few inland rivers in china the study area covers an area of 193 154 km2 with an elevation ranging from about 1743 to 5799 m fig 1b according to the high spatial resolution 1 km 1 km gridded climate data peng et al 2019 the annual precipitation was about 312 mm with the annual mean temperature being approximate 3 7 c during 1982 through 2017 the southeastern mountain range is mainly lowlands with higher vegetation coverage precipitation and temperature while the northwestern range is mainly highlands desert and bare lands with lower vegetation coverage precipitation and temperature fig 1c 2 2 materials the spatiotemporally continuous soc map which was required for detecting the soc dynamics was generated based on a machine learning approach forced by in situ soc observations gridded soil properties climate data vegetation growth data land use and fertilization table a1 in appendix a the in situ soc observations from 2004 to 2014 fig 1c were gathered from the publicly available database of xu et al 2018 the nine major soil properties table a1 affecting the soc distribution were generated from the world soil information service wosis database batjes et al 2017 the china dataset of soil properties for land surface modeling csdl shangguan et al 2013 the global soil dataset for use in earth system models gsde shangguan et al 2014 and the resource and environment data cloud platform redcp www resdc cn gridded climate data including precipitation temperature soil moisture and soil temperature high resolution 1 km 1 km precipitation and temperature data were provided by peng et al 2019 soil temperature and moisture in different soil layers with a spatial resolution of 0 1 were extracted from the noah land surface model l4 outputs in the famine early warning systems network fews net land data assimilation system fldas dataset mcnally and nasa gsfc hsl 2018 we comprehensively considered the multiple features of vegetation growth and utilized the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi leaf area index lai fraction of vegetation cover fvc gross primary productivity gpp and net primary productivity npp the lai fvc and ndvi data with a resolution of 1 112 were provided by the copernicus global land service cgls baret et al 2013 tote et al 2017 verger et al 2014 the gpp data were extracted from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod17 annual gpp product 1 km 1 km zhao et al 2006 2005 zhao and running 2010 and the no data regions were replaced by an improved gpp product 0 05 based on a revised light use efficiency model zheng et al 2019 because of the blank regions no data in the modis npp dataset and the lack of other available npp dataset in the study area we estimated the gridded npp data based on the carnegie ames stanford casa biosphere model monthly ndvi solar radiation temperature evapotranspiration et and potential evapotranspiration pet are the major input for the casa model solar radiation data were provided by the terraclimate dataset with a resolution of 1 24 4 km abatzoglou et al 2018 monthly et with a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 was extracted from the fldas dataset and the monthly pet with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 was obtained from the nasa global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 0 and version 2 1 datasets beaudoing and rodell 2015 2016 the vegetation map with a scale of 1 1 000 000 was provided by editorial board of vegetation map of china 2007 the land use with a spatial resolution of 300 m 300 m was generated from the climate change initiative cci land cover cci lc project esa 2017 all data were then resampled to a 1 1 km spatial resolution using the nearest neighbor method we compared our estimates with two other widely used gridded soc datasets including the wosis hengl et al 2017 and global soil organic carbon map gsocmap fao and itps 2018 soc datasets wosis datasets provided the global static soc density maps at multiple depths with the highest resolution 250 m 250 m until now gsocmap only provided global static topsoil soc density map that produced by the food and agriculture organization fao with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km these two soc maps can only reflect the spatial heterogeneity of soc distribution but not the temporal dynamics of soc stocks which limits our understanding about the responses of soc to climate change 2 3 soc estimation 2 3 1 soc estimation based on random forest we used a machine learning approach the random forest rf model breiman 2001 to produce the spatiotemporally continuous soc map in the qilian mountains our generated gridded soc datasets provide carbon stocks in the top 20 cm soc20 and top 1 m soc100 soil layers from 2000 to 2015 with a resolution of 1 km 1 km the rf model was constructed based on 4536 soil samples in the top 20 cm soil layer and 3147 soil samples in top 1 m soil layer respectively xu et al 2018 the rf model for soc20 was trained by 22 main drivers table a1 covering the categories of climate change vegetation growth land use and fertilization the estimated soc20 then acted as a new driver for the rf model for the estimation of soc100 precipitation and temperature are the two major climatic drivers with npp being an important vegetation growth driver determining the carbon input to soil norby et al 2010 plante and conant 2014 the rf model was built at the site scale and then extended to the whole study area by the following equation 1 s o c k 1 n i n h i x k f i where soc k is the estimation of the kth feature set i e a set of all drivers at cell k hi represents the estimation of the ith regression tree n is the total number of regression tree xk is the kth input feature set and fi is the trained regression function of the ith regression tree regions in desert with rock exposed and covered with ice and snow were removed from our estimates 2 3 2 the casa model for npp estimation as npp is an important driver determining the carbon input to soil we utilized the carnegie ames stanford casa biosphere model potter et al 1993 to estimate the npp with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km over the qilian mountains the casa model defined the npp on region i and in month t as a function of plant absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar and light utilization efficiency ε potter et al 1993 2 n p p i t a p a r i t ε i t where apar is determined by the total solar radiation sol and the fraction of the incoming par fpar intercepted by vegetation on region i in month t 3 a p a r i t s o l i t f p a r i t 0 5 the fpar can be a function of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi or the simple ratio sr and here we calculated the fpar as the mean of ndvi derived fparndvi and sr derived fparsr 4 f p a r i t 1 2 f p a r n d v i i t f p a r sr i t 5 f p a r n d v i i t n d v i i t n d v i j m i n n d v i j m a x n d v i j m i n f p a r max f p a r min f p a r min 6 f p a r sr i t s r i

the ndvi for vegetation j respectively fpar max and fpar min are 0 95 and 0 001 respectively sr is a function of ndvi 7 s r i t 1 n d v i i t 1 n d v i i t the light utilization efficiency ε is calculated by the following equation 8 ε i t ε max i t t ε 1 i t ε 2 i t w ε i t where ε max is the maximum light utilization efficiency which is decided by the vegetation types and the parameters are

temperature on grid cell i representing the average temperature of month t i t when ndvi reaches the peak level for the year if the topt i is lower than 10 c tε1 equals to 0 if t i t is 10 c higher or 13 c lower than topt i tε2 of month t is half of the original value 2 4 climate sensitivity scenarios in this study we designed a sensitivity analysis experiment to evaluate the responses of soc to the variation of precipitation and air temperature through altering the magnitude of one driver while keeping another constant table 1 following the approach of wu et al 2012 it is suggested that topsoil is more sensitive to the alteration of precipitation due to the highest microbial abundance and diversity in topsoil liebner et al 2008 hence we set a more complex precipitation sensitivity experiment for the top 20 cm soil layer when setting scenarios the precipitation variation range was from 40 to 40 for topsoil and 20 to 20 for the top 1 m soil layer the increment of air temperature input to the models for the two layers were the same 1 c 2 c and 4 c details of scenarios we set can be found in table 1 2 5 projected future climate change to evaluate the potential impacts of future climate regimes on soc dynamics we forced the rf models with future climate trajectories precipitation and air temperature of five global circulation models gcms including csiro mk3 6 collier et al 2011 gfdl esm2m dunne et al 2012 2013 ipsl cm5a lr dufresne et al 2013 miroc esm chem watanabe et al 2011 and mri cgcm3 yukimoto et al 2012 table 2 these gcm datasets were generated from the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 under different greenhouse gas concentration trajectories taylor et al 2012 we gathered future climate data under representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 low emission pathway rcp4 5 low to moderate emission pathway and rcp8 5 high emission pathway meinshausen et al 2011 van vuuren et al 2011 to assess the response of soc to future climate trajectories in the qilian mountains the weather simulated by these global climate models depended in part on the assumed atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gasses and a series of distinct assumptions and thus the outcomes of different gcms usually vary a lot at the same time due to the complex numerical simulation of atmosphere their weather simulations usually present a coarse spatial resolution although these models performed well at the large scale collier et al 2011 dufresne et al 2013 dunne et al 2012 2013 watanabe et al 2011 yukimoto et al 2012 and have been widely used in previous studies sun and mu 2017 zhao et al 2020 their simulations at regional scale still need to be improved mcsweeney et al 2015 consequently when assessing the future climate change impacts on soc dynamics at regional scale it is necessary to calibrate and spatially downscale the gcm data wu et al 2012 zhao et al 2020 we adopted a similar calibration and downscaling approach of the world climate worldclim dataset with the assumption that the change in climate is relatively stable over space i e high spatial autocorrelation fig a1 fick and hijmans 2017 firstly we simply downscaled the initial gcm outputs during the historical period i e baseline condition during 2006 through 2017 based on the bilinear interpolation algorithm to match the resolution 1 km 1 km of the high resolution climate data then we calculated the differences between the historical 2006 2017 annual mean precipitation and air temperature of the five gcms under the three rcp scenarios and that of the baseline condition respectively based on the assumption of high spatial autocorrelation these differences between gcm outputs and baseline conditions are regarded as the spatial downscaling and calibration references for different gcms finally the spatial downscaling and calibration references were used to downscale and calibrate the gcm outputs through the whole study period 2006 2100 validation of the downscaled and calibrated gcm precipitation and temperature under the three rcp scenarios against the baseline conditions fig s1 s2 indicated that the calibrated gcm climate data kept good consistency with the baseline climate conditions 2 6 data analysis we adopted three criteria to assess the performance of the rf model against in situ observations and other soc datasets including the percentage bias pb root mean square error rmse and r2 the pb and rmse were used to estimate the average difference between the rf simulations and currently available comparative soc datasets e g in situ observations and published gridded soc datasets the low magnitude values of absolute pb and rmse indicate high consistence of model simulations with other datasets the r2 evaluates the ability of the model tracking the variation of other soc datasets 12 pb 1 n i 1 n y i s i m y i c o m y i c o m 100 13 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i s i m y i c o m 2 14 r 2 i 1 n y i s i m y i s i m y i c o m y i c o m 2 i 1 n y i s i m

simulations and comparative data during the estimation period we adopted the theil sen median trend analysis method sokal and rohlf 1995 and the mann kendall trend detection method kendall 1938 mann 1945 to assess the spatiotemporal evolution of the soc 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the soc estimations the estimated soc20 and soc100 showed an overall similar spatial pattern with high values in the eastern qilian mountains lowlands regions in low elevation fig 2 soc20 in most of the western mountain range highlands regions in high elevation presented a low level fig 2a whereas soc100 showed a relatively high value in some areas of the western highlands fig 2b compared with the in situ observations our estimated soc20 showed a good consistency with observations r2 0 5 p 0 01 fig 2c however soc100 was substantially underestimated for high levels of soc and clearly overestimated for low levels of soc with overall pb being 3 34 fig 2d we further compared our estimates with other two primary gridded soc datasets indicating a generally good consistence with them fig 2e h considering the different definitions of the topsoil in divergent datasets i e the top 15 cm soil was regarded to be topsoil in wosis the top 30 cm soil for gsocmap and the top 20 cm soil was identified as topsoil in our study it seems reasonable that our estimated soc20 in most regions were slightly larger than wosis soc15 fig 2e and a little lower than gsocmap soc30 fig 2f the scatter plots indicate that overall our estimated soc in topsoil showed good consistency with wosis soc15 r2 0 66 p 0 001 fig 2g and gsocmap soc30 r2 0 51 p 0 001 fig 2h as well 3 2 spatiotemporal dynamics of soc the mean soc density in the top 20 cm soil in the study area was estimated to be 5 2 kg c m 2 with that in the top 1 m soil being 13 5 kg c m 2 the total soc storage in top 1 m soil was about 1 8 pg c with 0 7 pg c stocking in the top 20 cm soil about 39 of that in top 1 m soil from 2000 to 2015 the top 1 m soil in the qilian mountains played a role of carbon sink fixing about 3 34 tg c yr 1 with about 22 0 74 tg c yr 1 being fixed by topsoil soc20 increased from 5 05 kg c m 2 in 2000 to 5 3 kg c m 2 in 2009 with a significantly increasing trend of 0 02 kg c m 2 yr 1 p 0 05 after that soc20 presented a decreasing trend with a slope of 0 02 kg c m 2 yr 1 fig 3 a similarly soc100 significantly increased from 13 43 kg c m 2 yr 1 in 2000 to 14 18 kg c m 2 yr 1 in 2012 with a slope of 0 05 kg c m 2 yr 1 p 0 05 fig 3b after 2012 soc100 illustrated a decreasing trend with a slope of 0 19 kg c m 2 yr 1 the temporal inconsistency between topsoil and deeper soil soc dynamics implied the different responses of topsoil and deeper soil to climate change as shown in fig 3c d most regions in lowlands i e eastern mountain range generally presented a slightly increasing trend while that in uplands i e western mountain range showed a decreasing trend 3 3 sensitivity of soc to precipitation and temperature scenarios 1 to 8 listed in table 1 illustrate the precipitation variations an increase by 10 to 40 and a decrease by 10 to 40 while keeping temperature constant fig 4 a d present the spatial responses of soc20 to the decreased precipitation the responses of soc20 to precipitation variations showed substantial spatial heterogeneity decreases in precipitation mainly led to soc20 decrease in lowlands in the eastern mountain range while it resulted in an increase of soc20 in uplands in the western mountain range fig 4e h reflect the responses of soc20 to increased precipitation it is clear that the spatial responses of soc20 to the increased precipitation are contrary to that to the decreased precipitation soc20 in most lowlands increased while that in uplands decreased it is noteworthy that stronger variation intensity of precipitation generally result in stronger responses of soc20 as for soc100 fig 4i l the spatial responses of soc100 to decreased precipitation showed a much weaker pattern when compared to soc20 slightly increased in uplands in the western mountain range while slightly decreased in lowlands in the eastern mountain range fig 4i j among the precipitation increase scenarios fig 4k l soc100 in lowlands in the eastern mountain range substantially increased only as shown in fig 5 a regional average soc20 in the whole qilian mountains showed the lowest level just decreased by 0 6 compared to the baseline or 4 2 tg c in total table 3 when precipitation decreased by 10 then soc20 increased with the decrease of precipitation and reached its highest value increased by 4 compared to the baseline or 27 8 tg c in total table 3 when precipitation decreased by 40 on the other hand soc20 generally increased with the increase of precipitation but the responses of soc100 to precipitation variation are relatively stable fig 5c similarly soc100 increased with the rise of precipitation however the variation magnitudes were relatively small for instance soc100 increased slightly by 0 6 under the scenario of 20 increase in precipitation while it was 1 4 for the soc20 under the same precipitation increasing scenario table 3 the above model simulations indicate that topsoil soc dynamics in the qilian mountains are strongly affected by precipitation and the responses of soc20 to precipitation variation are non linear however no such relationship was found for soc100 fig 6 illustrated the spatial responses of soc20 and soc100 to the increases of 1 2 and 4 c for annual average air temperature respectively the responses of soc20 and soc100 to the increased temperature showed substantial spatial heterogeneity soc20 in most areas in uplands in the western mountain range showed a stable or slightly increasing trend under the three warming scenarios fig 6a c whereas soc100 substantially decreased fig 6d f in most areas of this region for lowlands in the eastern qilian mountains soc20 and soc100 both decreased under the three warming scenarios overall as for the whole qilian mountains both soc20 and soc100 presented a decreasing trend under the three warming scenarios fig 5b d especially for the soc100 it was estimated that about 6 5 or 117 tg c table 3 of soc in the top 1 m soil may lose under the warming scenario of 4 c the response of soc20 was relatively milder than that of soc100 model estimates showed a max magnitude of about 1 3 or 9 tg c table 3 may lose in the top 20 cm soil under the warming scenario of 4 c to sum up soc in the topsoil of the qilian mountains was strongly affected by precipitation and soc in deeper soil was more sensitive to warming 3 4 projected future climate change effects fig 7 presented the historical and projected ensemble annual air temperature and precipitation dynamics under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios compared to the historical climate the calibrated and spatially downscaled gcm data showed good consistency with the historical precipitation and temperature during the baseline period 2000 2015 fig s1 s2 during the near future period 2020 2060 the annual mean temperature was projected to rise by 0 94 1 21 and 1 55 c under the rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 7a the annual mean temperature during the far future period 2060 2100 was projected to increase by 1 05 2 19 and 4 37 c respectively in particular the annual mean air temperature may reach 2 6 1 4 c under the rcp8 5 at the end of the 21st century fig 7a annual precipitation in the qilian mountains was also projected to increase under all three rcp scenarios in the future fig 7b during the near future period the annual precipitation is likely to increase by 12 rcp2 6 9 rcp4 5 15 rcp8 5 respectively precipitation under rcp2 6 during the far future period was projected to be close to the amount in the near future period only 1 increase fig 7b compared to the near future period however annual precipitation was projected to continue to increase by 9 and 18 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively for example the annual precipitation would reach 414 68 mm under rcp8 5 at the end of the 21st century the estimated soc20 and soc100 in the qilian mountains under the three rcp scenarios during the future period ware shown in fig 8 under rcp2 6 the top 20 cm soil in the qilian mountains was projected to fix 0 41 tg c during the near future period fig 8a however most of it about 0 36 tg c may lose from the topsoil during the far future period soc20 under rcp4 5 was projected to barely change may only fix about 0 01 tg c during the near future period however there may be a loss of about 0 65 tg c in upper 20 cm soil during the far future period under rcp4 5 as for rcp8 5 the topsoil was projected to lose carbon during the whole future period a loss of 0 51 tg c for the near future period and another 0 2 tg c loss for the far future period soc20 was projected to be quite close 5 19 0 14 5 19 0 07 and 5 17 0 07 kg c m 2 at the end of the 21st century under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 respectively soc in the top 1 m soil would decrease along the whole future period under all rcp scenarios fig 8b under rcp2 6 the top 1 m soil in the qilian mountains was expected to lose about 37 5 tg c during the near future period and another 5 9 tg c loss for the far future period during the near future period the top 1 m soil may lose an amount of 49 5 tg c under rcp4 5 and continue to lose about 33 6 tg c for the far future period the largest soc loss was expected to occur under rcp8 5 at both near and far future periods a loss of 113 5 tg c about 6 3 of the soc storage in the top 1 m soil during 2020 through 2100 with 54 of that loss occurring before 2060 at the end of the 21st century 3 4 and 8 of the soc storage in the top 1 m soil may lose under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 8b 4 discussion 4 1 model performance the soc reversion model took into account 22 major factors that may affect the dynamics of soc hobley et al 2015 wiesmeier et al 2019 and the visual and numeric evaluations suggest a good performance in estimating the soc dynamics in the topsoil through comparing with the in situ observations fig 2b however we identified a substantial underestimation of soc100 especially for regions with high level of soc100 20 kg c m 2 fig 2b this may be attributed to the limited number of observations in the top 1 m soil in the plateau region of china xu et al 2018 nevertheless our estimated soc100 also showed a significant linear correlation with the in situ observations fig 2b suggesting a good capture of the temporal pattern of soc100 dynamics in the qilian mountains by comparing our simulations fig 2c d and currently available two gridded soc datasets with the in situ observations fig 9 a b respectively we can see our estimates are closer to the in situ observations at both soil layers at the grid cell scale our estimates presented good consistency with other two gridded soc datasets for the top 20 cm soil fig 2g h for the top 1 m soil our estimated soc100 also kept consistent with the wosis soc dataset r2 0 54 p 0 001 fig 9c in addition the current two available comparative datasets only provided static spatial distribution of soc and we produced a spatiotemporal series of soc dataset 1 km 1 km in the qilian mountains which is important for understanding the soc dynamics and their possible responses to climate change moreover comparing with other empirical soc inversion methods which usually include just a couple of factors e g ndvi liu et al 2019 yang et al 2009 our machine learning approach involved most of the major drivers and can provide an opportunity to detect the responses of soc to climate variation i e precipitation and temperature alteration 4 2 intense response of topsoil soc to precipitation variation the analysis of soc sensitivity to precipitation in the qilian mountains illustrated different responses of the topsoil soc and deeper soil soc to precipitation variations we found that topsoil soc in this region was more intensely affected by precipitation and showed a nonlinear relationship with precipitation while there is no such nonlinear relationship for soc in the 1 m soil fig 5a c it was estimated that soc20 and soc100 would both increase with the rise of precipitation however the response of soc20 to the increased precipitation was substantially more intense than that of soc100 under the precipitation decrease scenario the corresponding responses of soc20 and soc100 are substantially different it seems no change for soc100 when precipitation decreased while soc20 firstly decreased when precipitation decreased by 10 and then substantially increased with the decrease of precipitation we further analyzed the potential reasons for soc changes at different soil depths when responding to precipitation variation from the perspective of space as presented below soc20 in uplands in western qilian mountains with relatively low precipitation and vegetation coverage was expected to increase with the decreased precipitation fig 4a d this is mainly because the decrease of precipitation may cause water deficit in these regions considering most biological mediated processes take place in the shallow soil knapp et al 2008 the limited water availability can decrease intracellular water potential of microorganism and thus reduce hydration and activity of enzymes resulting in inhibited microbial metabolism dutta and dutta 2016 stark and firestone 1995 according to meng et al 2017 sparse plant species inhabiting this highland exhibited strong drought tolerance implying that the decreased precipitation mainly reduced the microbial mediated decomposition of organic carbon rather than substantially reduced carbon input to soil this could explain the increase of soc with the decrease of precipitation in these areas fig 10 a on the contrary topsoil soc in lowlands in eastern mountain range with relatively high precipitation and vegetation coverage was expected to reduce with the decrease of precipitation vegetation are the main source of organic matter to soil through the net primary production i e aboveground litter or root exudate plante and conant 2014 substantially reduced water availability for humid or semi humid regions can inhibit plant growth and lead to the decrease of vegetation productivity li et al 2020 2021 stocker et al 2019 resulting in reduced input of organic matter to soil that is why reduced precipitation caused the decrease of soc in the topsoil of these lowlands fig 10a as for the scenarios of increased precipitation soc20 in most lowlands in eastern mountain range may increase fig 4e h precipitation was one of the major drivers for plant productivity in this region yao et al 2018 the increased water availability can promote the vegetation growth and thus can increase the input of organic matter to soil fig 10b as for uplands in western mountain range soc20 decreased with the increase of precipitation this may be because the carbon loss due to promoted microbial mediated decomposition rate and leaching mu et al 2016 was greater than the carbon gain due to enhanced plant growth and carbon input as for deeper soil the annual air temperature in uplands was below 0 c suggesting the deep soil could be permafrost wang et al 2020 and thus soc in deep soil in these uplands may be barely affected by precipitation variation that is why we see the responses of soc100 to precipitation were much milder than topsoil fig 4i l fig 5c as for soc100 in lowlands in eastern mountain range where we can see relatively higher and denser vegetation coverage and higher temperature the increased precipitation could enrich the carbon input to deep soil by promoting root exudate vegetation root is also the major source of organic matter in deep soil dominating the dynamics of deep soil soc nepstad et al 1994 4 3 temperature variation impacts and the projected trends of soc our sensitivity analysis suggested that soc20 and soc100 in the qilian mountains would decrease under all warming scenarios fig 5b d soc dynamics are determined by the long term balance between inputs through the vegetation net primary production and turnover or removals via decomposition and mineralization hydrologic leaching and other biochemical and physical processes davidson and janssens 2006 plante and conant 2014 temperature substantially affects both input and loss of soil carbon because the related physiological chemical and biochemical processes are temperature dependent davidson and janssens 2006 davidson et al 2000 meyer et al 2018 the rising temperature is expected to promote the vegetation productivity piao et al 2019 and also strengthen the microbial metabolic activity dutta and dutta 2016 schindlbacher et al 2011 the enhanced vegetation productivity can enrich the input of organic matter to soil kirschbaum 1999 paul 2016 while the strengthened microbial activity could enhance the decomposition of soil organic matter karhu et al 2014 schindlbacher et al 2009 and result in soil carbon loss generally soil organic matter is prone to be decomposed by microorganisms fungi and bacteria leading to the loss of soc when temperature increases on the premise of sufficient available soil moisture davidson and janssens 2006 prietzel et al 2016 reichstein et al 2013 a previous study based on a water carbon coupling model also suggested that soc in a typical loess watershed in the semi humid and semi arid transitional zone in china may decrease under future warming scenarios zhao et al 2020 as for the topsoil soc20 exhibited a notable decrease mainly in lowlands in eastern mountain range when air temperature increased by 4 c fig 6c under sufficient water supply the increased decomposition rate of microorganism induced by warming was the major cause for the carbon loss in topsoil soc in the lowlands fig 10c however we also realized that a slight increase of soc20 occurred in uplands in the western mountain range under warming scenarios this may be because the increased plant net primary production and the resulting increased carbon input to topsoil under a higher temperature fig 10c which may be greater than a potential decrease in soc due to enhanced microbial activities as for deeper soil soc100 substantially decreased with warming fig 5d fig 6d f which may be a consequence of the thawed permafrost and strengthened microbial activity fig 10c it was suggested that the active layer may deepen under warming and the newly thawed soc may act as an additional carbon source then participate in the carbon cycle wang et al 2020 the exposed substantial amount of organic carbon by the thawed permafrost can be easily decomposed by soil microorganism schuur et al 2015 on the other hand the thickness of the active layer increases with the thawed permafrost and can lead to ground subsidence increased bulk density and disrupted soil horizons causing a substantial amount of carbon loss in the form of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere plaza et al 2019 schaefer et al 2014 schuur et al 2015 the gcm outputs in the historical period presented a large bias compared to the historical observations then we calibrated and spatially downscaled precipitation and temperature with good consistency compared to observations fig s1 s2 and reasonable distribution range during the historical period fig 7 it should be noted that our calibration and spatial downscaling method are based on the assumption that the changes in climate are relatively stable over space i e the future spatial patterns of climate are the same as those of the historical period which is a widely adopted strategy for data downscaling fick and hijmans 2017 peng et al 2019 wu et al 2012 although huge uncertainties can still be found among the calibrated gcm data gcms offered a valuable opportunity to glimpse the future potential climate the average results of the five gcms suggested that precipitation and temperature in the qilian mountains are likely to increase under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 the largest increase of temperature and precipitation would occur under rcp8 5 fig 7 soc20 was projected to barely change 1 tg c during the future period under all rcp scenarios compared to the baseline period fig 8a this is because the positive impact of precipitation on topsoil soc may offset the negative effect of warming on topsoil carbon storage however as for deeper soil the increased precipitation failed to promote the soil carbon sequestration substantially compared to topsoil warming on the contrary significantly promoted soil carbon release through the enhanced microbial activity additional carbon source from the deepened active layer and exposed soil carbon to the atmosphere due to the ground subsidence and disrupted soil horizons plaza et al 2019 schaefer et al 2014 schuur et al 2015 wang et al 2020 that could be the reason why soc100 would substantially decrease under the future warming fig 8b 4 4 uncertainties and limitations there are some uncertainties and limitations in our study first of all although we took into account 22 important drivers plante and conant 2014 ramesh et al 2019 wiesmeier et al 2019 in building the rf model table a1 there may be some other factors we omitted such as the rising co2 concentration enriched nitrogen deposition a series of agricultural management and environmental protection practices tipping et al 2017 wu et al 2015a and even some extreme hydrological and meteorological events such as floods and droughts canarini et al 2017 luo et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 the rising co2 concentration may promote the carbon input to soil by advancing the plant production the responses of soc to the enriched nitrogen deposition generally rely on the balance between the increased carbon input through the enhanced vegetation production and the strengthened nitrogen deposition induced carbon loss by influencing the soil carbon decomposition respiration and mineralization although controversies exist regarding the effects of nitrogen deposition on soc dynamics reay et al 2008 the majority of recent studies hold the view that enriched nitrogen deposition may inhibit soil carbon loss chen et al 2012a 2012b huang et al 2020 agricultural practices such as residue treatments e g straw stover return to soils irrigation tillage methods cover crops and agroforestry practices may lead to profound impacts could be both positive or negative on soc dynamics in addition environmental protections such as reforestation and grazing prohibition can also substantially affect soc dynamics however the aim of this study was to detect the sensitivity of soc dynamics to climate change i e precipitation and temperature variation and to project the potential trends of soc under future climate trajectories hence we did not fully consider drivers such as co2 nitrogen deposition agricultural management and environmental protection practices in our study design and analysis and this may lead to some uncertainties our estimates in the top 20 cm soil showed good consistency with in situ observations however our model underestimated the magnitude of soc in top 1 m soil compared to the observations especially at sites with a high level of soc100 20 kg c m 2 nevertheless our model still performed better than the wosis and gsocmap datasets across those sites at the grid scale our estimates for the top 20 cm soil and top 1 m soil presented good consistency with these two gridded datasets wosis and gsocmap we believe if there are more observations available our modeling uncertainty would become lower in future secondly our sensitivity analysis aimed to quantify the responses of soc to the variation of precipitation and temperature and we did not consider the dynamic responses of vegetation soil temperature and soil moisture which may also bring about some uncertainties in addition in our projection of soc under future climate change scenarios we kept the magnitude of other drivers except for precipitation and temperature at the level of those in year 2015 and this assumption may also lead to some uncertainties if we omit the interactions between different drivers however that could be another important subject and deserves intensive investigation in future 5 conclusions in this study we detected the spatiotemporal dynamics of soc at different depths in the qilian mountains using a machine learning approach our sensitivity analysis can help improve our understanding of soc responses to potential changes in precipitation and air temperature in addition our estimated soc under projected climate trajectories illustrated the potential level of the future soc in the qilian mountains although uncertainties exist our results indicated that the random forest rf model can reasonably capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of soc in the top 20 cm soil in spite of underestimation of soc in the top 1 m soil when compared to in situ observations comparisons with currently available two gridded soc datasets presented good consistency of our estimations in spatial pattern for both soil layers the sensitivity analysis indicated topsoil soc was more sensitive to precipitation variations whereas soc in the top 1 m soil showed a more intense response to warming in the qilian mountains the responses of soc to precipitation variations and warming were spatially heterogenic between uplands and lowlands in the qilian mountains our simulation suggested that although lowland soc may reduce due to the weakened plant productivity under decreased precipitation the reduced carbon loss in uplands caused by the restrained microbial activity may offset the lowland soc loss and lead to an increase in topsoil soc in the qilian mountains on the other hand the enriched carbon input by the enhanced vegetation productivity under increased precipitation may offset the carbon loss in uplands due to strengthened microbial activity and result in soc increase in the qilian mountains as for the deeper soil soc100 in uplands were slightly affected by precipitation which may be because that permafrost inhibited the decomposition of soc in lowlands the enhanced precipitation may promote the carbon sequestration in deep soil due to the increased carbon input via enhanced plant productivity as for the responses to warming soc in the top 1 m soil seemed to be more sensitive to the rising temperature due to the substantially increased carbon loss via strengthened microbial activity and additional carbon source participated into carbon cycle emission through the deepened active layer the climate projections suggested that temperature and precipitation in the qilian mountains would increase in the future under the three rcp scenarios based on five gcms our projection results suggested that soc20 in the qilian mountains may not substantially change under all rcp scenarios because the precipitation increase induced topsoil soc increase may offset the soc loss caused by warming however soc in the top 1 m soil may significantly decrease under all rcp scenarios especially rcp8 5 due to the negative impact of warming on soc100 our modeling assessments can provide new knowledge for our understanding of the warming impact on soil carbon pool and this study emphasized the potential risk of soil carbon pool in this important ecological barrier when facing the on going climate change credit authorship contribution

4715,soil is the largest organic carbon pool in the terrestrial biosphere and a small variation of soil organic carbon soc can substantially affect the global carbon cycle and climate climate change is a major driver affecting the dynamics of soc however our understanding about the responses of soc in alpine ecosystems to climate change is quite limited in particular the differences of soc dynamics at different depths were rarely reported in this study we investigated the impacts of precipitation variations and warming on soc dynamics at both top and deep soils in the qilian mountains in northwestern china using a machine learning approach and climate sensitivity experiments our simulation revealed the temporal inconsistency between topsoil soc in the top 20 cm denoted as soc20 and deeper soil soc dynamics soc20 showed a decreasing trend since 2009 which is earlier than that 2012 in the top 100 cm soil soc100 we also found that soc100 may be more sensitive to warming due to the strengthened microbial decomposition rate and additional carbon source through deepened active layer on the contrary soc20 presented more intense responses to precipitation than soc100 which was mainly attributed to the different responses of upland and lowland soc to precipitation variations our projection indicated that soc20 may not substantially change under future climate trajectories because the enriched soc induced by increased precipitation may offset the carbon loss via warming however soc100 was projected to decrease significantly due to the enhanced carbon emissions via warming induced strengthened decomposition rate additional carbon source from the deepened active layer and exposed soil carbon to the atmosphere caused by ground subsidence and disrupted soil horizons resulting from thawed frozen soil in brief this study deepened our understanding of the mechanism of climate effect on soc dynamics and can be helpful for regional soil ecological security assessment and risk projection keywords climate change random forest sensitivity analysis carbon cycle projection 1 introduction soil stores the largest organic carbon in the terrestrial biosphere with approximately 1500 pg c stored in the top 1 m batjes 1996 scharlemann et al 2014 which is more than double of that in atmosphere or three times in vegetation bradford et al 2016 ciais et al 2014 davidson et al 2000 karhu et al 2014 rossel et al 2019 hence a small change in soc pool may substantially alter the greenhouse gas concentration in atmosphere and affect the current climate bradford et al 2016 paustian et al 2019 wu et al 2015a as one of the most important components in global carbon pool soc is also well known to tightly related to soil fertility food security and water quality dignac et al 2017 fang et al 2012 lal 2004 luo et al 2019 ramesh et al 2019 consequently it is crucial to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of soc at regional and even global scales in addition it is because chemical and biochemical processes related to the soil carbon input and loss are dependent on soil temperature and water soc dynamics are regarded to be sensitive to temperature and precipitation variation davidson and janssens 2006 knapp et al 2008 suseela et al 2012 thus it is essential to detect the response of soc to temperature and precipitation alterations and its potential trends under future climate trajectories considering its critical role in the global carbon cycle and its vital feedback to climate bradford et al 2016 davidson and janssens 2006 soc dynamics are affected by many drivers such as environmental constraints climate change vegetation growth and even human activities gaitan et al 2019 ramesh et al 2019 and it is not easy to obtain accurate spatiotemporal soc storage at large scale dignac et al 2017 liu et al 2011 hence most studies concerning about the dynamics of soc mainly focused on the site scale via field investigation within a specific time interval prietzel et al 2016 xie et al 2007 zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2019b although some research mapped the spatial patterns of soc at different scales de anta et al 2020 fao and itps 2018 gomes et al 2019 hengl et al 2017 li et al 2017 understanding of the soc dynamics at both spatial and temporal scales are quite limited due to the data availability issue at the regional scale to solve this issue ecosystem process models such as denitrification and decompositio dndc li et al 1992 erosion deposition carbon model edcm liu et al 2003 and century parton 1996 were developed to investigate the soc evolution for example the united states geological survey usgs land carbon team investigated the soc dynamics across the conterminous united states based on the edcm model liu et al 2014 2012a 2011 2012b tan et al 2015 wu et al 2015b which is very useful for policy makers to initiate soil restoration policies with geographical differences due to the strong coupling between carbon and water cycle a fusion of the hydrological process model and ecosystem process model has also become a hotspot because it can better describe this carbon water coupling cycle wu et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 2020 long term observations and the calibration of key parameters in these process models are the major challenges for accurate simulations hu et al 2021 hui et al 2020 huo et al 2021 stockmann et al 2013 sun et al 2019 different models usually generate diverse simulations due to distinct hypothesis model structures and drivers zhang et al 2017 recently a growing number of studies adopted the state of the art machine learning approaches to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of soc and obtained satisfactory results padarian et al 2020 for instance the popular global soil organic carbon map gsocmap developed by the food and agriculture organization fao was generated based on ensemble models combining random forest support vector machine neural networks regression trees bayesian trees and other digital soil mapping techniques fao and itps 2018 until now the soc map with the highest spatial resolution 250 m 250 m on global scale provided by the international soil reference information centre isric was also generated by a machine learning approach hengl et al 2017 in addition wang et al 2020 estimated the spatiotemporal dynamics of soc over the tibetan plateau using the random forest model and projected its future trend under potential climate trajectories these studies suggested that the machine learning approach is an effective method in investigating the regional soc stocks and dynamics the qilian mountain range is an important ecological security barrier in northwestern china supplying runoff for several key inland rivers in china chen et al 2016b hence the mountain range is critical to the ecological security of northwestern china simultaneously it is also a typical vulnerable ecological region in china yao et al 2016 and ecological environment in this mountain range is very sensitive to climate change chen et al 2016a the ecological security of the qilian mountains has long been concerned by the chinese government and a national nature reserve has been established since 1988 hence understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of soc and its responses to climate change along with the potential trends under future climate are helpful to formulate the ecological protection policy of the mountain range however due to the lack of spatiotemporal continuous soc data with high spatial resolution in this region our knowledge about the dynamics of soc and its responses in different regions to climate change are vague especially most previous studies mainly focused on the responses of soc to warming davidson and janssens 2006 karhu et al 2014 kirschbaum 2000 prietzel et al 2016 schindlbacher et al 2011 2009 making that to precipitation alteration is scarcely understood a large number of studies have investigated the responses of soc to warming considering rising temperature is the climate normality in future davidson and janssens 2006 karhu et al 2014 kirschbaum 2000 prietzel et al 2016 schindlbacher et al 2009 it is suggested that warming would generally increase carbon input through enhancing the plant productivity and also strengthen the microbial activity leading to carbon loss in regions without water and nutrition limitations plante and conant 2014 hence the final response of soc to warming depended on the differences between the fluctuations of carbon input and loss in the context of geographical and environmental constraints as for the impact of precipitation on soc dynamics controversy exists among different studies zhou et al 2019a suggested that soc may linearly decrease with the increase of precipitation in the xiying river basin situated in the northeastern qilian mountains while chen et al 2016a indicated that soc was linearly positively correlated to precipitation in the pailugou watershed a region nearby in addition the nonlinear relationship between soil microorganism mediated carbon emission and precipitation or soil water content suseela et al 2012 yan et al 2018 implied that the response of soc to precipitation may not be simply positively or negatively linearly correlated the qilian mountains have many landforms including the lowlands in the southeast and the highlands and desert in the northwest it is certain that the impact of precipitation variation on soc may vary among regions however our knowledge about the responses of soc at different soil depths in distinct landforms to climate change in the qilian mountains has not been available yet it is necessary to assess the responses of soc in different regions of the qilian mountains to the variation of temperature and precipitation and future climate trajectories which can be helpful to develop the soil protection policies for adapting to climate change the objective of this study was to investigate the responses of soc at different depths to climate change in the qilian mountains we first investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of soc in this mountain range using a machine learning approach and further detected the responses of soc in the topsoil and deeper soil to temperature and precipitation alteration based on climate sensitivity experiments in addition we projected the potential responses of soc to the climate through the end of the 21st century using the spatially downscaled and calibrated climate projections from five general circulation models under three greenhouse gas concentration trajectories 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qilian mountain range is located at the border of qinghai and gansu provinces in west central china fig 1 a the mountain range is an important ecological security barrier in western china and a key ecological functional area of the country it plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of the qinghai tibet plateau and preventing the southern invasion and confluence of the four major deserts in western china fig 1a in addition it maintains the stability of hexi corridor and guarantees the runoff supply of a few inland rivers in china the study area covers an area of 193 154 km2 with an elevation ranging from about 1743 to 5799 m fig 1b according to the high spatial resolution 1 km 1 km gridded climate data peng et al 2019 the annual precipitation was about 312 mm with the annual mean temperature being approximate 3 7 c during 1982 through 2017 the southeastern mountain range is mainly lowlands with higher vegetation coverage precipitation and temperature while the northwestern range is mainly highlands desert and bare lands with lower vegetation coverage precipitation and temperature fig 1c 2 2 materials the spatiotemporally continuous soc map which was required for detecting the soc dynamics was generated based on a machine learning approach forced by in situ soc observations gridded soil properties climate data vegetation growth data land use and fertilization table a1 in appendix a the in situ soc observations from 2004 to 2014 fig 1c were gathered from the publicly available database of xu et al 2018 the nine major soil properties table a1 affecting the soc distribution were generated from the world soil information service wosis database batjes et al 2017 the china dataset of soil properties for land surface modeling csdl shangguan et al 2013 the global soil dataset for use in earth system models gsde shangguan et al 2014 and the resource and environment data cloud platform redcp www resdc cn gridded climate data including precipitation temperature soil moisture and soil temperature high resolution 1 km 1 km precipitation and temperature

initiative cci land cover cci lc project esa 2017 all data were then resampled to a 1 1 km spatial resolution using the nearest neighbor method we compared our estimates with two other widely used gridded soc datasets including the wosis hengl et al 2017 and global soil organic carbon map gsocmap fao and itps 2018 soc datasets wosis datasets provided the global static soc density maps at multiple depths with the highest resolution 250 m 250 m until now gsocmap only provided global static topsoil soc density map that produced by the food and agriculture organization fao with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km these two soc maps can only reflect the spatial heterogeneity of soc distribution but not the temporal dynamics of soc stocks which limits our understanding about the responses of soc to climate change 2 3 soc estimation 2 3 1 soc estimation based on random forest we used a machine learning approach the random forest rf model breiman 2001 to produce the spatiotemporally continuous soc map in the qilian mountains our generated gridded soc datasets provide carbon stocks in the top 20 cm soc20 and top 1 m soc100 soil layers from 2000 to 2015 with a resolution of 1 km 1 km the rf model was constructed based on 4536 soil samples in the top 20 cm soil layer and 3147 soil samples in top 1 m soil layer respectively xu et al 2018 the rf model for soc20 was trained by 22 main drivers table a1 covering the categories of climate change vegetation growth land use and fertilization the estimated soc20 then acted as a new driver for the rf model for the estimation of soc100 precipitation and temperature are the two major climatic drivers with npp being an important vegetation growth driver determining the carbon input to soil norby et al 2010 plante and conant 2014 the rf model was built at the site scale and then extended to the whole study area by the following equation 1 s o c k 1 n i n h i x k f i where soc k is the estimation of the kth feature set i e a set of all drivers at cell k hi represents the estimation of the ith regression tree n is the total number of regression tree xk is the kth input feature set and fi is the trained regression function of the ith regression tree regions in desert with rock exposed and covered with ice and snow were removed from our estimates 2 3 2 the casa model for npp estimation as npp is an important driver determining the carbon input to soil we utilized the carnegie ames stanford casa biosphere model potter et al 1993 to estimate the npp with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km over the qilian mountains the casa model defined the npp on region i and in month t as a function of plant absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar and light utilization efficiency ε potter et al 1993 2 n p

the variation of precipitation and air temperature through altering the magnitude of one driver while keeping another constant table 1 following the approach of wu et al 2012 it is suggested that topsoil is more sensitive to the alteration of precipitation due to the highest microbial abundance and diversity in topsoil liebner et al 2008 hence we set a more complex precipitation sensitivity experiment for the top 20 cm soil layer when setting scenarios the precipitation variation range was from 40 to 40 for topsoil and 20 to 20 for the top 1 m soil layer the increment of air temperature input to the models for the two layers were the same 1 c 2 c and 4 c details of scenarios we set can be found in table 1 2 5 projected future climate change to evaluate the potential impacts of future climate regimes on soc dynamics we forced the rf models with future climate trajectories precipitation and air temperature of five global circulation models gcms including csiro mk3 6 collier et al 2011 gfdl esm2m dunne et al 2012 2013 ipsl cm5a lr dufresne et al 2013 miroc esm chem watanabe et al 2011 and mri cgcm3 yukimoto et al 2012 table 2 these gcm datasets were generated from the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 under different greenhouse gas concentration trajectories taylor et al 2012 we gathered future climate data under representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 low emission pathway rcp4 5 low to moderate emission pathway and rcp8 5 high emission pathway meinshausen et al 2011 van vuuren et al 2011 to assess the response of soc to future climate trajectories in the qilian mountains the weather simulated by these global climate models depended in part on the assumed atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gasses and a series of distinct assumptions and thus the outcomes of different gcms usually vary a lot at the same time due to the complex numerical simulation of atmosphere their weather simulations usually present a coarse spatial resolution although these models performed well at the large scale collier et al 2011 dufresne et al 2013 dunne et al 2012 2013 watanabe et al 2011 yukimoto et al 2012 and have been widely used in previous studies sun and mu 2017 zhao et al 2020 their simulations at regional scale still need to be improved mcsweeney et al 2015 consequently when assessing the future climate change impacts on soc dynamics at regional scale it is necessary to calibrate and spatially downscale the gcm data wu et al 2012 zhao et al 2020 we adopted a similar calibration and downscaling approach of the world climate worldclim dataset with the assumption that the change in climate is relatively stable over space i e high spatial autocorrelation fig a1 fick and hijmans 2017 firstly we simply downscaled the initial gcm outputs during the historical period i e baseline condition during 2006 through 2017 based on the bilinear interpolation algorithm to match the resolution 1 km 1 km of the high resolution climate data then we calculated the differences between the historical 2006 2017 annual mean precipitation and air temperature of the five gcms under the three rcp scenarios and that of the baseline condition respectively based on the assumption of high spatial autocorrelation these differences between gcm outputs and baseline conditions are regarded as the spatial downscaling and calibration references for different gcms finally the spatial downscaling and calibration references were used to downscale and calibrate the gcm outputs through the whole study period 2006 2100 validation of the downscaled and calibrated gcm precipitation and temperature under the three rcp scenarios against the baseline conditions fig s1 s2 indicated that the calibrated gcm climate data kept good consistency with the baseline climate conditions 2 6 data analysis we adopted three criteria to assess the performance of the rf model against in situ observations and other soc datasets including the percentage bias pb root mean square error rmse and r2 the pb and rmse were used to estimate the average difference between the rf simulations and currently available comparative soc datasets e g in situ observations and published gridded soc datasets the low magnitude values of absolute pb and rmse indicate high consistence of model simulations with other datasets the r2 evaluates the ability of the model tracking the variation of other soc datasets 12 pb 1 n i 1 n y i s i m y i c o m y i c o m 100 13 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i s i m y i c o m 2 14 r 2 i 1 n y i s i m y i s i m y i c o m y i c o m 2 i 1 n y i s i m

simulations and comparative data during the estimation period we adopted the theil sen median trend analysis method sokal and rohlf 1995 and the mann kendall trend detection method kendall 1938 mann 1945 to assess the spatiotemporal evolution of the soc 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the soc estimations the estimated soc20 and soc100 showed an overall similar spatial pattern with high values in the eastern qilian mountains lowlands regions in low elevation fig 2 soc20 in most of the western mountain range highlands regions in high elevation presented a low level fig 2a whereas soc100 showed a relatively high value in some areas of the western highlands fig 2b compared with the in situ observations our estimated soc20 showed a good consistency with observations r2 0 5 p 0 01 fig 2c however soc100 was substantially underestimated for high levels of soc and clearly overestimated for low levels of soc with overall pb being 3 34 fig 2d we further compared our estimates with other two primary gridded soc datasets indicating a generally good consistence with them fig 2e h considering the different definitions of the topsoil in divergent datasets i e the top 15 cm soil was regarded to be topsoil in wosis the top 30 cm soil for gsocmap and the top 20 cm soil was identified as topsoil in our study it seems reasonable that our estimated soc20 in most regions were slightly larger than wosis soc15 fig 2e and a little lower than gsocmap soc30 fig 2f the scatter plots indicate that overall our estimated soc in topsoil showed good consistency with wosis soc15 r2 0 66 p 0 001 fig 2g and gsocmap soc30 r2 0 51 p 0 001 fig 2h as well 3 2 spatiotemporal dynamics of soc the mean soc density in the top 20 cm soil in the study area was estimated to be 5 2 kg c m 2 with that in the top 1 m soil being 13 5 kg c m 2 the total soc storage in top 1 m soil was about 1 8 pg c with 0 7 pg c stocking in the top 20 cm soil about 39 of that in top 1 m soil from 2000 to 2015 the top 1 m soil in the qilian mountains played a role of carbon sink fixing about 3 34 tg c yr 1 with about 22 0 74 tg c yr 1 being fixed by topsoil soc20 increased from 5 05 kg c m 2 in 2000 to 5 3 kg c m 2 in 2009 with a significantly increasing trend of 0 02 kg c m 2 yr 1 p 0 05 after that soc20 presented a decreasing trend with a slope of 0 02 kg c m 2 yr 1 fig 3 a similarly soc100 significantly increased from 13 43 kg c m 2 yr 1 in 2000 to 14 18 kg c m 2 yr 1 in 2012 with a slope of 0 05 kg c m 2 yr 1 p 0 05 fig 3b after 2012 soc100 illustrated a decreasing trend with a slope of 0 19 kg c m 2 yr 1 the temporal inconsistency between topsoil and deeper soil soc dynamics implied the different responses of topsoil and deeper soil to climate change as shown in fig 3c d most regions in lowlands i e eastern mountain range generally presented a slightly increasing trend while that in uplands i e western mountain range showed a decreasing trend 3 3 sensitivity of soc to precipitation and temperature scenarios 1 to 8 listed in table 1 illustrate the precipitation variations an increase by 10 to 40 and a decrease by 10 to 40 while keeping temperature constant fig 4 a d present the spatial responses of soc20 to the decreased precipitation the responses of soc20 to precipitation variations showed substantial spatial heterogeneity decreases in precipitation mainly led to soc20 decrease in lowlands in the eastern mountain range while it resulted in an increase of soc20 in uplands in the western mountain range fig 4e h reflect the responses of soc20 to increased precipitation it is clear that the spatial responses of soc20 to the increased precipitation are contrary to that to the decreased precipitation soc20 in most lowlands increased while that in uplands decreased it is noteworthy that stronger variation intensity of precipitation generally result in stronger responses of soc20 as for soc100 fig 4i l the spatial responses of soc100 to decreased precipitation showed a much weaker pattern when compared to soc20 slightly increased in uplands in the western mountain range while slightly decreased in lowlands in the eastern mountain range fig 4i j among the precipitation increase scenarios fig 4k l soc100 in lowlands in the eastern mountain range substantially increased only as shown in fig 5 a regional average soc20 in the whole qilian mountains showed the lowest level just decreased by 0 6 compared to the baseline or 4 2 tg c in total table 3 when precipitation decreased by 10 then soc20 increased with the decrease of precipitation and reached its highest value increased by 4 compared to the baseline or 27 8 tg c in total table 3 when precipitation decreased by 40 on the other hand soc20 generally increased with the increase of precipitation but the responses of soc100 to precipitation variation are relatively stable fig 5c similarly soc100 increased with the rise of precipitation however the variation magnitudes were relatively small for instance soc100 increased slightly by 0 6 under the scenario of 20 increase in precipitation while it was 1 4 for the soc20 under the same precipitation increasing scenario table 3 the above model simulations indicate that topsoil soc dynamics in the qilian mountains are strongly affected by precipitation and the responses of soc20 to precipitation variation are non linear however no such relationship was found for soc100 fig 6 illustrated the spatial responses of soc20 and soc100 to the increases of 1 2 and 4 c for annual average air temperature respectively the responses of soc20 and soc100 to the increased temperature showed substantial spatial heterogeneity soc20 in most areas in uplands in the western mountain range showed a stable or slightly increasing trend under the three warming scenarios fig 6a c whereas soc100 substantially decreased fig 6d f in most areas of this region for lowlands in the eastern qilian mountains soc20 and soc100 both decreased under the three warming scenarios overall as for the whole qilian mountains both soc20 and soc100 presented a decreasing trend under the three warming scenarios fig 5b d especially for the soc100 it was estimated that about 6 5 or 117 tg c table 3 of soc in the top 1 m soil may lose under the warming scenario of 4 c the response of soc20 was relatively milder than that of soc100 model estimates showed a max magnitude of about 1 3 or 9 tg c table 3 may lose in the top 20 cm soil under the warming scenario of 4 c to sum up soc in the topsoil of the qilian mountains was strongly affected by precipitation and soc in deeper soil was more sensitive to warming 3 4 projected future climate change effects fig 7 presented the historical and projected ensemble annual air temperature and precipitation dynamics under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios compared to the historical climate the calibrated and spatially downscaled gcm data showed good consistency with the historical precipitation and temperature during the baseline period 2000 2015 fig s1 s2 during the near future period 2020 2060 the annual mean temperature was projected to rise by 0 94 1 21 and 1 55 c under the rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 7a the annual mean temperature during the far future period 2060 2100 was projected to increase by 1 05 2 19 and 4 37 c respectively in particular the annual mean air temperature may reach 2 6 1 4 c under the rcp8 5 at the end of the 21st century fig 7a annual precipitation in the qilian mountains was also projected to increase under all three rcp scenarios in the future fig 7b during the near future period the annual precipitation is likely to increase by 12 rcp2 6 9 rcp4 5 15 rcp8 5 respectively precipitation under rcp2 6 during the far future period was projected to be close to the amount in the near future period only 1 increase fig 7b compared to the near future period however annual precipitation was projected to continue to increase by 9 and 18 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively for example the annual precipitation would reach 414 68 mm under rcp8 5 at the end of the 21st century the estimated soc20 and soc100 in the qilian mountains under the three rcp scenarios during the future period ware shown in fig 8 under rcp2 6 the top 20 cm soil in the qilian mountains was projected to fix 0 41 tg c during the near future period fig 8a however most of it about 0 36 tg c may lose from the topsoil during the far future period soc20 under rcp4 5 was projected to barely change may only fix about 0 01 tg c during the near future period however there may be a loss of about 0 65 tg c in upper 20 cm soil during the far future period under rcp4 5 as for rcp8 5 the topsoil was projected to lose carbon during the whole future period a loss of 0 51 tg c for the near future period and another 0 2 tg c loss for the far future period soc20 was projected to be quite close 5 19 0 14 5 19 0 07 and 5 17 0 07 kg c m 2 at the end of the 21st century under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 respectively soc in the top 1 m soil would decrease along the whole future period under all rcp scenarios fig 8b under rcp2 6 the top 1 m soil in the qilian mountains was expected to lose about 37 5 tg c during the near future period and another 5 9 tg c loss for the far future period during the near future period the top 1 m soil may lose an amount of 49 5 tg c under rcp4 5 and continue to lose about 33 6 tg c for the far future period the largest soc loss was expected to occur under rcp8 5 at both near and far future periods a loss of 113 5 tg c about 6 3 of the soc storage in the top 1 m soil during 2020 through 2100 with 54 of that loss occurring before 2060 at the end of the 21st century 3 4 and 8 of the soc storage in the top 1 m soil may lose under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 respectively fig 8b 4 discussion 4 1 model performance the soc reversion model took into account 22 major factors that may affect the dynamics of soc hobley et al 2015 wiesmeier et al 2019 and the visual and numeric evaluations suggest a good performance in estimating the soc dynamics in the topsoil through comparing with the in situ observations fig 2b however we identified a substantial underestimation of soc100 especially for regions with high level of soc100 20 kg c m 2 fig 2b this may be attributed to the limited number of observations in the top 1 m soil in the plateau region of china xu et al 2018 nevertheless our estimated soc100 also showed a significant linear correlation with the in situ observations fig 2b suggesting a good capture of the temporal pattern of soc100 dynamics in the qilian mountains by comparing our simulations fig 2c d and currently available two gridded soc datasets with the in situ observations fig 9 a b respectively we can see our estimates are closer to the in situ observations at both soil layers at the grid cell scale our estimates presented good consistency with other two gridded soc datasets for the top 20 cm soil fig 2g h for the top 1 m soil our estimated soc100 also kept consistent with the wosis soc dataset r2 0 54 p 0 001 fig 9c in addition the current two available comparative datasets only provided static spatial distribution of soc and we produced a spatiotemporal series of soc dataset 1 km 1 km in the qilian mountains which is important for understanding the soc dynamics and their possible responses to climate change moreover comparing with other empirical soc inversion methods which usually include just a couple of factors e g ndvi liu et al 2019 yang et al 2009 our machine learning approach involved most of the major drivers and can provide an opportunity to detect the responses of soc to climate variation i e precipitation and temperature alteration 4 2 intense response of topsoil soc to precipitation variation the analysis of soc sensitivity to precipitation in the qilian mountains illustrated different responses of the topsoil soc and deeper soil soc to precipitation variations we found that topsoil soc in this region was more intensely affected by precipitation and showed a nonlinear relationship with precipitation while there is no such nonlinear relationship for soc in the 1 m soil fig 5a c it was estimated that soc20 and soc100 would both increase with the rise of precipitation however the response of soc20 to the increased precipitation was substantially more intense than that of soc100 under the precipitation decrease scenario the corresponding responses of soc20 and soc100 are substantially different it seems no change for soc100 when precipitation decreased while soc20 firstly decreased when precipitation decreased by 10 and then substantially increased with the decrease of precipitation we further analyzed the potential reasons for soc changes at different soil depths when responding to precipitation variation from the perspective of space as presented below soc20 in uplands in western qilian mountains with relatively low precipitation and vegetation coverage was expected to increase with the decreased precipitation fig 4a d this is mainly because the decrease of precipitation may cause water deficit in these regions considering most biological mediated processes take place in the shallow soil knapp et al 2008 the limited water availability can decrease intracellular water potential of microorganism and thus reduce hydration and activity of enzymes resulting in inhibited microbial metabolism dutta and dutta 2016 stark and firestone 1995 according to meng et al 2017 sparse plant species inhabiting this highland exhibited strong drought tolerance implying that the decreased precipitation mainly reduced the microbial mediated decomposition of organic carbon rather than substantially reduced carbon input to soil this could explain the increase of soc with the decrease of precipitation in these areas fig 10 a on the contrary topsoil soc in lowlands in eastern mountain range with relatively high precipitation and vegetation coverage was expected to reduce with the decrease of precipitation vegetation are the main source of organic matter to soil through the net primary production i e aboveground litter or root exudate plante and conant 2014 substantially reduced water availability for humid or semi humid regions can inhibit plant growth and lead to the decrease of vegetation productivity li et al 2020 2021 stocker et al 2019 resulting in reduced input of organic matter to soil that is why reduced precipitation caused the decrease of soc in the topsoil of these lowlands fig 10a as for the scenarios of increased precipitation soc20 in most lowlands in eastern mountain range may increase fig 4e h precipitation was one of the major drivers for plant productivity in this region yao et al 2018 the increased water availability can promote the vegetation growth and thus can increase the input of organic matter to soil fig 10b as for uplands in western mountain range soc20 decreased with the increase of precipitation this may be because the carbon loss due to promoted microbial mediated decomposition rate and leaching mu et al 2016 was greater than the carbon gain due to enhanced plant growth and carbon input as for deeper soil the annual air temperature in uplands was below 0 c suggesting the deep soil could be permafrost wang et al 2020 and thus soc in deep soil in these uplands may be barely affected by precipitation variation that is why we see the responses of soc100 to precipitation were much milder than topsoil fig 4i l fig 5c as for soc100 in lowlands in eastern mountain range where we can see relatively higher and denser vegetation coverage and higher temperature the increased precipitation could enrich the carbon input to deep soil by promoting root exudate vegetation root is also the major source of organic matter in deep soil dominating the dynamics of deep soil soc nepstad et al 1994 4 3 temperature variation impacts and the projected trends of soc our sensitivity analysis suggested that soc20 and soc100 in the qilian mountains would decrease under all warming scenarios fig 5b d soc dynamics are determined by the long term balance between inputs through the vegetation net primary production and turnover or removals via decomposition and mineralization hydrologic leaching and other biochemical and physical processes davidson and janssens 2006 plante and conant 2014 temperature substantially affects both input and loss of soil carbon because the related physiological chemical and biochemical processes are temperature dependent davidson and janssens 2006 davidson et al 2000 meyer et al 2018 the rising temperature is expected to promote the vegetation productivity piao et al 2019 and also strengthen the microbial metabolic activity dutta and dutta 2016 schindlbacher et al 2011 the enhanced vegetation productivity can enrich the input of organic matter to soil kirschbaum 1999 paul 2016 while the strengthened microbial activity could enhance the decomposition of soil organic matter karhu et al 2014 schindlbacher et al 2009 and result in soil carbon loss generally soil organic matter is prone to be decomposed by microorganisms fungi and bacteria leading to the loss of soc when temperature increases on the premise of sufficient available soil moisture davidson and janssens 2006 prietzel et al 2016 reichstein et al 2013 a previous study based on a water carbon coupling model also suggested that soc in a typical loess watershed in the semi humid and semi arid transitional zone in china may decrease under future warming scenarios zhao et al 2020 as for the topsoil soc20 exhibited a notable decrease mainly in lowlands in eastern mountain range when air temperature increased by 4 c fig 6c under sufficient water supply the increased decomposition rate of microorganism induced by warming was the major cause for the carbon loss in topsoil soc in the lowlands fig 10c however we also realized that a slight increase of soc20 occurred in uplands in the western mountain range under warming scenarios this may be because the increased plant net primary production and the resulting increased carbon input to topsoil under a higher temperature fig 10c which may be greater than a potential decrease in soc due to enhanced microbial activities as for deeper soil soc100 substantially decreased with warming fig 5d fig 6d f which may be a consequence of the thawed permafrost and strengthened microbial activity fig 10c it was suggested that the active layer may deepen under warming and the newly thawed soc may act as an additional carbon source then participate in the carbon cycle wang et al 2020 the exposed substantial amount of organic carbon by the thawed permafrost can be easily decomposed by soil microorganism schuur et al 2015 on the other hand the thickness of the active layer increases with the thawed permafrost and can lead to ground subsidence increased bulk density and disrupted soil horizons causing a substantial amount of carbon loss in the form of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere plaza et al 2019 schaefer et al 2014 schuur et al 2015 the gcm outputs in the historical period presented a large bias compared to the historical observations then we calibrated and spatially downscaled precipitation and temperature with good consistency compared to observations fig s1 s2 and reasonable distribution range during the historical period fig 7 it should be noted that our calibration and spatial downscaling method are based on the assumption that the changes in climate are relatively stable over space i e the future spatial patterns of climate are the same as those of the historical period which is a widely adopted strategy for data downscaling fick and hijmans 2017 peng et al 2019 wu et al 2012 although huge uncertainties can still be found among the calibrated gcm data gcms offered a valuable opportunity to glimpse the future potential climate the average results of the five gcms suggested that precipitation and temperature in the qilian mountains are likely to increase under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 the largest increase of temperature and precipitation would occur under rcp8 5 fig 7 soc20 was projected to barely change 1 tg c during the future period under all rcp scenarios compared to the baseline period fig 8a this is because the positive impact of precipitation on topsoil soc may offset the negative effect of warming on topsoil carbon storage however as for deeper soil the increased precipitation failed to promote the soil carbon sequestration substantially compared to topsoil warming on the contrary significantly promoted soil carbon release through the enhanced microbial activity additional carbon source from the deepened active layer and exposed soil carbon to the atmosphere due to the ground subsidence and disrupted soil horizons plaza et al 2019 schaefer et al 2014 schuur et al 2015 wang et al 2020 that could be the reason why soc100 would substantially decrease under the future warming fig 8b 4 4 uncertainties and limitations there are some uncertainties and limitations in our study first of all although we took into account 22 important drivers plante and conant 2014 ramesh et al 2019 wiesmeier et al 2019 in building the rf model table a1 there may be some other factors we omitted such as the rising co2 concentration enriched nitrogen deposition a series of agricultural management and environmental protection practices tipping et al 2017 wu et al 2015a and even some extreme hydrological and meteorological events such as floods and droughts canarini et al 2017 luo et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 the rising co2 concentration may promote the carbon input to soil by advancing the plant production the responses of soc to the enriched nitrogen deposition generally rely on the balance between the increased carbon input through the enhanced vegetation production and the strengthened nitrogen deposition induced carbon loss by influencing the soil carbon decomposition respiration and mineralization although controversies exist regarding the effects of nitrogen deposition on soc dynamics reay et al 2008 the majority of recent studies hold the view that enriched nitrogen deposition may inhibit soil carbon loss chen et al 2012a 2012b huang et al 2020 agricultural practices such as residue treatments e g straw stover return to soils irrigation tillage methods cover crops and agroforestry practices may lead to profound impacts could be both positive or negative on soc dynamics in addition environmental protections such as reforestation and grazing prohibition can also substantially affect soc dynamics however the aim of this study was to detect the sensitivity of soc dynamics to climate change i e precipitation and temperature variation and to project the potential trends of soc under future climate trajectories hence we did not fully consider drivers such as co2 nitrogen deposition agricultural management and environmental protection practices in our study design and analysis and this may lead to some uncertainties our estimates in the top 20 cm soil showed good consistency with in situ observations however our model underestimated the magnitude of soc in top 1 m soil compared to the observations especially at sites with a high level of soc100 20 kg c m 2 nevertheless our model still performed better than the wosis and gsocmap datasets across those sites at the grid scale our estimates for the top 20 cm soil and top 1 m soil presented good consistency with these two gridded datasets wosis and gsocmap we believe if there are more observations available our modeling uncertainty would become lower in future secondly our sensitivity analysis aimed to quantify the responses of soc to the variation of precipitation and temperature and we did not consider the dynamic responses of vegetation soil temperature and soil moisture which may also bring about some uncertainties in addition in our projection of soc under future climate change scenarios we kept the magnitude of other drivers except for precipitation and temperature at the level of those in year 2015 and this assumption may also lead to some uncertainties if we omit the interactions between different drivers however that could be another important subject and deserves intensive investigation in future 5 conclusions in this study we detected the spatiotemporal dynamics of soc at different depths in the qilian mountains using a machine learning approach our sensitivity analysis can help improve our understanding of soc responses to potential changes in precipitation and air temperature in addition our estimated soc under projected climate trajectories illustrated the potential level of the future soc in the qilian mountains although uncertainties exist our results indicated that the random forest rf model can reasonably capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of soc in the top 20 cm soil in spite of underestimation of soc in the top 1 m soil when compared to in situ observations comparisons with currently available two gridded soc datasets presented good consistency of our estimations in spatial pattern for both soil layers the sensitivity analysis indicated topsoil soc was more sensitive to precipitation variations whereas soc in the top 1 m soil showed a more intense response to warming in the qilian mountains the responses of soc to precipitation variations and warming were spatially heterogenic between uplands and lowlands in the qilian mountains our simulation suggested that although lowland soc may reduce due to the weakened plant productivity under decreased precipitation the reduced carbon loss in uplands caused by the restrained microbial activity may offset the lowland soc loss and lead to an increase in topsoil soc in the qilian mountains on the other hand the enriched carbon input by the enhanced vegetation productivity under increased precipitation may offset the carbon loss in uplands due to strengthened microbial activity and result in soc increase in the qilian mountains as for the deeper soil soc100 in uplands were slightly affected by precipitation which may be because that permafrost inhibited the decomposition of soc in lowlands the enhanced precipitation may promote the carbon sequestration in deep soil due to the increased carbon input via enhanced plant productivity as for the responses to warming soc in the top 1 m soil seemed to be more sensitive to the rising temperature due to the substantially increased carbon loss via strengthened microbial activity and additional carbon source participated into carbon cycle emission through the deepened active layer the climate projections suggested that temperature and precipitation in the qilian mountains would increase in the future under the three rcp scenarios based on five gcms our projection results suggested that soc20 in the qilian mountains may not substantially change under all rcp scenarios because the precipitation increase induced topsoil soc increase may offset the soc loss caused by warming however soc in the top 1 m soil may significantly decrease under all rcp scenarios especially rcp8 5 due to the negative impact of warming on soc100 our modeling assessments can provide new knowledge for our understanding of the warming impact on soil carbon pool and this study emphasized the potential risk of soil carbon pool in this important ecological barrier when facing the on going climate change credit authorship contribution

4716,during the investigation of aged hydrocarbon contaminated sites using electrical resistivity tomography ert the low resistivity anomalies in the detection profile have been widely considered to be caused by the hydrocarbon degradation by products however these low resistivity anomalies are a comprehensive reflection of the formation s electrical characteristics in this study we used ert and geochemical methods to investigate a hydrocarbon contaminated site that has been abandoned for more than 30 years there are several obvious low resistivity anomalies in the site which are related to hydrocarbon mineralization based on the law of waxman and smits a petrophysical relationship formula suitable for this specific site was fitted and the true resistivity after inversion was input into the formula to calculate the pore water resistivity the electrolytic conduction contribution of the pore water was isolated and the distribution of the by product plume was determined based on the electrolytic conduction contribution of the pore water based on mineralogical identification and geochemical data analysis the biogeochemical model of hydrocarbon mineralization was clarified the degradation by products fe2 and h are the controlling factors that lead to changes in the groundwater resistivity based on electrochemical experiments and titration analysis experiments the quantitative relationship between the low resistivity anomalies of the pore water and the degradation by products fe2 and h was established and the biodegradation model was used to calculate the hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the by product plume the results show that the hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the by product plume determined from the ert detection results in the selected study area is approximately 2 8 of the total hydrocarbon content although this is a rough estimate based on a small amount of discrete geochemical data and ert detection results it improves our understanding of the natural attenuation state of hydrocarbon contaminated sites and provides convincing data to support future estimations of the site s natural attenuation time keywords ert geochemistry hydrocarbons by product plume quantitative evaluation 1 introduction aged hydrocarbon contaminated sites continuously release harmful substances into the underground environment the key to the management and remediation of contaminated sites is to obtain information about the underground spatial distribution and concentration of the pollutants nyári et al 2010 monitored natural attenuation fully relies on natural purification capabilities so it has been widely used to evaluate the feasibility and cost effectiveness of management and remediation plans ossai et al 2020 mathematical models in situ column technology microscopic studies and pollutant concentration analysis are commonly used to assess the occurrence and rate of natural attenuation fernández et al 2016 kao and prosser 2001 the above techniques require knowledge of the pollutant transmission mass transfer data and environmental parameters mulligan and yong 2004 to study the effects of soil hydrogeological parameters on pollutant migration hyun et al 2008 however the impact of the biodegradation process on the natural attenuation rate is more complicated the factors related to substrate concentration nutrient utilization electron acceptor utilization and microbial growth need to be considered schirmer and butler 2004 and these factors vary in time and space this also makes the evaluation more difficult electrical resistivity tomography ert is a geophysical method that is sensitive to the pore fluid and porosity characteristics and it can obtain continuous information about underground properties in real time aal et al 2004 arato et al 2014 caterina et al 2017 ravi et al 2012 simyrdanis et al 2018 combining geophysical data with traditional hydrogeochemical data has the advantage of generating information about the entire polluted area at a lower cost chambers et al 2010 however finding a way to establish a quantitative relationship between the geophysical data and pollutant concentration has become the key to understanding the natural attenuation state of aged hydrocarbon contaminated sites a site contaminated by hydrocarbons is not a fixed target these sites are in the process of spatial and temporal evolution which is affected by factors such as the hydrogeological conditions climatic characteristics and microbial effects atekwana and atekwana 2010 ert can provide information related to the natural attenuation processes of the site the electrical characteristics of polluted areas can differ significantly due to the different evolution stages of the polluted areas koroma et al 2015 in the early post contamination period due to the high resistivity characteristics of hydrocarbons olhoeft 1985 contaminated sites often exhibit high resistivity characteristics buselli and lu 2001 rosales et al 2013 2014 owing to the movement of the groundwater and the light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl the saturation of the lnapl in the polluted area gradually decreases the increased amount of pore water in the polluted area provides conductive pathways the existence of even a few conductive pathways will cause the bulk resistivity to be much lower than the hydrocarbon resistivity heenan et al 2015 the characteristics of the resistance signal in the hydrocarbon contaminated area gradually weakens and even in the newly formed pollution source area the resistivity is lower than that of the clean formation shao et al 2019b after long term evolution the lnapl produces a complex biophysical and chemical environment under the action of microorganisms abbas et al 2018 for example owing to the organic acids and carbonic acid released by bacteria mineral weathering is enhanced the porosity changes and the total dissolved solids tds increase atekwana et al 2004 2000 werkema et al 2003 conductive biomasses grow and accumulate on the lnapl materials and act as electrical conductors aal et al 2004 albrecht et al 2011 atekwana and atekwana 2010 these changes in hydrocarbon contaminated sites cause the electrical characteristics of the formation to change from resistive to conductive amélie et al 2014 che alota et al 2015 in aquifers contaminated by hydrocarbons the environmental changes usually depend on the presence of microorganisms that degrade hydrocarbons the terminal electron acceptor tea and the byproducts of hydrocarbon degradation bekins et al 2013 cozzarelli et al 2001 the ph of the pore fluid decreases as carbon dioxide dissolves to form carbonic acid and with the production of organic acids which can enhance the dissolution of sedimentary minerals bennett et al 1996 processes related to biodegradation often exhibit low resistivity characteristics on the ert detection profiles and these low resistivity characteristics are related to the distribution of the degradation by product plumes ert can provide continuous real time monitoring of contaminated sites and can be used to comprehensively characterize changes in underground media however it is difficult to use ert to quantitatively evaluate contaminated sites in situ the reason for this is that the acquired resistivity data is the bulk resistivity and the current flowing through the soil depends on the electrolytic conduction kemna 2000 and the interface conduction vinegar and waxman 1984 waxman and smits 1968 the complexity of electrical conductivity at the micro scale leads to a high degree of uncertainty and an incomplete understanding of the interaction between physical processes sahimi 2011 and chemical processes revil and glover 1997 telford et al 1990 quantifying the contribution of electrolytic conduction and surface conduction requires a clear understanding of the specific site s conductive properties friedman 2005 the construction of the conductivity model of porous media is related to mineral composition pore structure chemical composition of pore water saturation etc cai et al 2017 hunt 2004 pan and connell 2012 archie 1942 revil and glover 1998 the conductivity model of the clay rich formation has been improved on the basis of archie s law to adapt to the complexity of conductivity caused by surface conduction and porous media structure bernabé et al 2011 revil 2013 applying an effective conductivity model on site is conducive to establishing a quantitative relationship between resistivity data and geochemical data in previous studies we have confirmed that the low resistivity characteristics of the site are related to biogeochemical processes and the distribution range of the hydrocarbon plumes was delineated based on the low resistivity and low permeability characteristics of the formation shao et al 2019a strictly speaking in areas where the groundwater level changes the permeability will change gao et al 2020 so the migration rate of the hydrocarbons is not consistent with that of the by product solute to further study the quantitative relationship between the ert detection results and the hydrocarbons in this study a biogeochemical model of hydrocarbon mineralization based on geochemical data and mineralogical identification was established and the mechanism by which the pore water s resistivity changes during hydrocarbon degradation was further clarified based on the law of waxman and smits 1968 a petrophysical relationship formula suitable for this specific site was fitted and the true resistivity after inversion was input into the formula to calculate the pore water resistivity the contribution of the electrolytic conduction of the pore water was isolated and the by product plume s distribution was determined based on the electrolytic conduction contribution of the pore water based on this the quantitative relationship between the change in the pore water s resistivity and the concentration of the degradation by products was established through electrochemical experiments finally the relationship between the change in the pore water s resistivity and the amount of hydrocarbon degradation was calculated based on the biogeochemical model this study proposes a method for understanding the natural attenuation state of hydrocarbon contaminated sites based on a small amount of discrete geochemical data and ert data 2 material and methods 2 1 field survey the study area which was once the site of a petroleum solvent plant is located in the southeastern part of jiangsu province china fig 1 in the past production processes a trench was set up at the site to discharge organic wastes underground since the solvent plant was relocated the site has been abandoned for more than 30 years during the long period of abandonment the sewage area has been replaced by soil since then the hydrocarbon contaminated area has undergone a natural attenuation according to the results of on site surveys and indoor geotechnical experiments the stratum up to a depth of 28 m can be divided into artificial filling layers and quaternary sedimentary layers continuous silty clay is distributed in the surface layer artificial filling layer of the study area with a thickness of 5 6 m the thickness of the quaternary sedimentary layers is about 17 23 m the upper part is mainly composed of silty sand and clay and is between 2 60 and 6 50 m thick the lower part is a 15 m thick silt layer the groundwater level is 1 6 1 9 m below the surface according to the groundwater level measurements the overall flow direction of the groundwater in the study area is from north to south which is basically consistent with the flow direction of the river on the eastern side of the site the hydraulic gradient of the groundwater is relatively small between 0 27 and 0 76 2 1 1 resistivity data 1 electrical resistivity tomography the purpose of ert conducting measurements is to obtain the bulk resistivity ρb or its inverse i e bulk conductivity σb of the formation and its tomography the analysis of the formation s resistivity is usually based on the rock s physical properties following the model proposed by revil 2013 1 σ b 1 f σ f s w n 1 f ϕ σ s s w n 1 where f is the formation factor σ f is the fluid conductivity sw is the water saturation ϕ is the aquifer porosity σs is the surface conductivity and n is the empirical value of the saturation exponent according to archie 1942 the formation factor f can be expressed as 2 f a ϕ m where m is the cementation index and a is a proportionality constant in saturated porous media current transmission occurs through two mechanisms electrolytic conduction and surface conduction electrolytic conduction mainly depends on the fluid s properties e g the ion concentration saturation and the pore space morphology that affects the state of the fluid e g pore network interconnection tortuosity binley and kemna 2005 cai et al 2017 while surface conduction is a complex electrical property that is mainly controlled by the surface area and grains of the material kimak et al 2019 weller et al 2013 seven ert lines were laid in the field area lines df1 df6 lines were laid from east to west in the study area with a line spacing of 6 m line df7 line was lain longitudinally in the middle of the study area ert measuring line df8 was lain at a distance of 60 m from the study area to obtain the electrical characteristics of the uncontaminated area for use as a reference model fig 1 the schlumberger electrode configuration protocol was used the selected inner probe spacing was 1 or 1 5 m depending on the total length of the measurement line and the required spatial and depth resolution as is shown in table 1 the equipment used was the e60dn system produced by geopen its technical specifications can be found at http www qdgeopen com the 12v direct current dc power supply was used to establish a dc electric field the maximum current applied for each measurement was 1000 ma and the power supply time was set to 1 s in the measurement of the eight ert lines each line was repeated at least twice for the data analysis of each independent dataset we eliminated the outliers which were defined as being 5 times greater than or less than 1 5 of both adjacent data points the quantitative interpretation of the imaging results requires the data inversion of the pseudosections to obtain profiles with true resistivity values and depths in this study the inversion data were calculated using the standard least squares inversion method and the res2dinv software loke and barker 1996 these inversion routines involve cell based inversion techniques which subdivide the underground medium into a number of rectangular cells and then the resistivity of the cells is determined to provide a model response consistent with the observed data loke 2000 2004 minimize the difference between the observed and calculated cells to obtain acceptable consistency in the fitting process loke and barker 1996 the root mean square error rms shows the measure of this difference for all profiles the inversion converged in less than 5 iterations to small rms misfits between 3 5 and 6 5 highlighting the good agreement between the measured data and the inversion resistivity models 2 in situ columnar soil sample resistivity measurements the ground stratum was rich in clay with a high water content and a generally good electrical conductivity we collected undisturbed soil samples for the resistivity measurement and then we compared the results with the inversion resistivity the purpose of this comparison was to determine if the true resistivity of the inversion profile was valid collecting undisturbed soil samples on site and then transporting them to the laboratory for resistivity testing e g two pole method quadrupole method is a commonly used method of site resistivity survey zhang et al 2014 the samples may undergo changes in moisture content and porosity during transportation which will cause experimental errors fodor et al 2011 so the test was carried out in situ to reduce the error during the in situ sampling process we used the following methods to reduce the disturbance to the samples i use a thin wall soil extractor to reduce the disturbance to the soil layer ii keep the drill vertical and the drilling process stable in order to directly measure the true resistivity of the soil at different depths round copper plates were used at the end of the cylindrical sample collected in situ to realize the function of the current electrodes fig 2 a good electrical contact between the electrode and the sample can establish a horizontal electric field flow making the measured value closer to the true resistivity value of the soil telford et al 1990 it is not very reliable to press or scratch the wire terminal on the sample surface the quadrupole method was used to measure the resistivity of the columnar soil samples in situ four thin copper sheets were inserted into the soil sample at equal intervals of 5 cm as the measuring electrodes electrodes a and b on both sides of the soil sample were current electrodes the middle two electrodes m and n were potential electrodes and the radius of the column sample was 3 cm the equipment used was the e60dn system produced by geopen when using the quadrupole method to measure the resistivity the current between a and b was iab the voltage between m and n was umn and the resistivity ρt of the soil sample to be measured was calculated using eq 3 3 ρ t π r 2 u mn l mn i ab the three in situ resistivity measurements w1 w3 and s5 and the inversion resistivity were normalized for deviation d analysis the in situ measured resistivity ρt and the actual ert measured value ρi at that point were the normalized deviation d 4 d ρ t ρ i 2 ρ t 2 2 1 2 geochemical characterization based on the geophysical data soil sampling points and groundwater monitoring wells were deployed throughout the site soil and groundwater samples were collected using a geoprobe 7822dt and the monitoring wells respectively during the collection process all of the soil and groundwater samples were refrigerated in situ in an ice box they were sent to a commercial laboratory for analysis the soil s total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs tds and groundwater ph values were tested the sample analysis results show that there are typical petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil and groundwater including benzene toluene xylene and naphthalene the detected tphs at each location in the contaminated site s1 s5 w1 w4 were less than 35 mg kg fig 3 is a scatter plot of tph measurements at different depths in the vertical direction they are mainly distributed in the area where the water level fluctuates throughout the year and the soil interface the distribution range is mainly within 7 5 m the tph values of samples with a depth greater than 8m are all less than 1 mg kg the source area s value was not appear to be higher than that of the other locations the detection values of boreholes s6 and s7 which were located outside of the site were less than 0 1 mg kg the tphs were mainly distributed near the pollution source area and moved in the direction of the hydraulic slope s descent the tphs were most widely diffused in the water level fluctuation area the weathering of hydrocarbons led to a significant increase in the tds in the groundwater and a decrease in its ph most of the tds values in the contaminated site were 100 300 mg l which is also higher than the values measured at locations s6 and s7 i e outside of the site shao et al 2019a 2 1 3 cpt method the cone penetration test cpt method is generally considered to be a minimally invasive technique for obtaining the soil profile tillmann et al 2008 in this survey the cpt was conducted after the resistivity measurements and the cpt results were compared with the electrical stratification based on the resistivity detection results which further confirmed that the low resistivity anomaly area in the site was caused by strong electrolytic conduction shao et al 2019a 2 2 petrophysical relationship the borehole data show that the strata in the study area are evenly distributed and the stratification is clear fig 1c the groundwater level in the area does not vary significantly and it is mostly 1 8 to 2 m below the surface eq 1 described the relationship between the bulk conductivity the electrolytic conductivity and the surface conductivity however the difficulty in field investigations is determining a way to quantify the contributions of the electrolytic conduction and the surface conduction archie s law describes the empirical relationship between the bulk conductivity σb and the pore solution conductivity σw 5 σ b ϕ m a σ w s w n the stratum above the groundwater level in the site have a saturation of over 0 90 the pore water is connected to form a large number of conductive pathways and its contribution to the bulk conductivity is not significantly different from that of the saturated soil in this study the stratum of the site is regarded as the saturated area sw 1 to study the contribution of the pore water conductivity the validity of archie s law depends on the contribution of the electrical surface conduction to the bulk conductivity the formation is rich in clay particles and archie s law must be modified to account for this effect waxman and smits 1968 6 σ b σ w f σ surf σ w where σ surf is the surface conduction term related to the conductivity of the pore water revil and glover 1998 since in practice this dependency is difficult to separate from the first term on the right hand side of eq 6 it can also be written as nguyen et al 2009 7 σ b σ w f b where f corresponds to an effective formation factor which includes both the dependence of the pore water related bulk electrical conductivity and that of the electrical surface conduction on the water conductivity and b corresponds to the contribution of the surface conductivity independent of the water conductivity in this study we used the specific petrophysical relationship of the contaminated site to obtain specific f and b values by fitting the measured conductivity values of the groundwater samples at different locations to the corresponding bulk conductivity values fig 4 shows the relationship between the pore water conductivity and the measured bulk conductivity of the ert in the silty sand and silty clay layers according to the low resistivity anomaly area at a depth of 2m underground in the ert results groundwater sample collection points were set up at the boundary w1 w4 and the middle w2 w3 of the low resistivity anomaly area in addition groundwater sample collection points were set up in the middle of the pollution source area s2 s3 the bailer tube sampler was used to collect groundwater samples of different depths puls and barcelona 1996 the electrical conductivity of soil pore fluids was measured using an electrical conductivity apparatus developed by thermo electron corporation the conductivity of the pore water is the measured value from the in situ sampling but there is still the possibility of disturbance so it may only partially represent the site s conditions equation 7 was fit to the data shown in fig 4 to determine the effective formation factors and surface conduction terms the effective formation factors of the two formations are similar the fitted formula describing the relationship between the pore water conductivity and the bulk conductivity was used to calculate the groundwater conductivity of the site the bulk conductivity was derived from the inversion of the ert results and the conductivity of the pore water in the site was calculated 2 3 geochemical conceptual model development of a geochemistry conceptual model that will interpret chemical speciation data related to hydrocarbon biodegradation teramoto and chang 2019 the mineralogical characteristics of sediments play an important role in the microbial degradation of hydrocarbons ng et al 2014 the laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 was used to determine the clay content in the soil after separating and purifying clay minerals in the soil electron probe microanalyzer jeol jxa 8230 and x ray powder diffractometer bruker d8 advance were used to characterize the chemical composition and mineralogical identification testing work was done by commercial laboratories the average clay content of the silt sand layer is 49 3 and the average clay content of the silt sand layer is 47 8 the non clay mineral phase is mainly quartz sio2 and the clay mineral phases are mainly polysilicon lepidolite k alfeli si3al o10 oh f and clinochlorite mg fe 6 si al 4o10 oh 8 the chemical formula of clinochlorite shows that it is a chlorite mineral containing iron and magnesium and it is a common chlorite mineral in the formation hey 1954 table 2 shows the electron probe microanalyzer analysis results of the chemical composition the content of each chemical component is the average of the sample test results it should be noted that since the electron probe cannot distinguish fe2 and fe3 the total iron oxide tfeo content is given in table 2 the electron probe microanalyzer analysis results show that the total iron oxide content in the clay is about 20 iron oxide is an important component of the natural environment it is widely found in soil sediments and rocks its source may come from the release of fe containing minerals such as ferrous silicate and ferrous sulfide schwertmann 1958 different iron minerals can be transformed into each other such as the accompanying phenomenon of goethite and hematite cornell and schwertmann 2003 due to the abundance of iron oxides biodegradation under dissimilatory iron reduction is the main mechanism of hydrocarbon metabolism esther et al 2015 klueglein et al 2013 based on the collected mineralogical information the groundwater investigation results and the chemical reactions related to the biodegradation of the hydrocarbons a conceptual model was established for the research site the main purpose of this conceptual model was to clarify the biodegradation process of the hydrocarbons the degradation products and the mechanism by which the pore water resistivity of the site changes 2 4 establishing a quantitative relationship between the geochemical and geophysical data the calculated pore water resistivity was converted into the pore water conductivity the increase in the conductivity of pore water is related to the increase in its electrolyte concentration this is the change in the pore water conductivity caused by the biodegradation by products of the hydrocarbons which can be obtained using the method described in section 2 3 to confirm the relationship between the change in the conductivity and the ion concentration clean groundwater samples from the study area were collected in situ for titration tests a titration experiment was conducted and the concentration of the degradation product ions was taken as the abscissa and the conductivity was taken as the ordinate to determine the function curve 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the electrical resistivity the normalized deviation analysis of the ert results and the in situ column sample resistivity measurement results shows that the deviations between different depths are small within 0 4 fig 5 that is the ground ert measurements reflect the true resistivity of the formation better the stratum within 8 m of the surface in the study area is dominated by clay and silty clay this stratum has a high water content and the water saturation of the unsaturated zone exceeds 0 9 the stratum is uniform and conductive and the ground ert results are closer to the true resistivity after inversion the results of the ert detection are shown in fig 6 as can be seen from reference line df8 located 60 m away from the contaminated site the electrical stratification is uniform and an obvious electrical stratification interface exists at 6 7 m below the surface there are several low resistivity anomalies within 8 m of the surface in the study area the resistivity near the pollution source area was significantly lower than that of the surrounding area and the low resistivity distribution area was relatively deeper the distribution of the low resistivity area is consistent with the hydraulic slope and the resistivity of the southern area is lower than that of the northern area the northernmost survey line df6 shows that there is no obvious low resistivity anomaly in the stratum within 8 m of the surface the geochemical data demonstrates that the low resistivity anomaly zone is due to the hydrocarbon degradation by products however the by product plume is not consistent with the low resistivity distribution zone on the ert profile so further exploration is needed to obtain more information on the plume of hydrocarbons and by products contained in the ert results 3 2 electrolytic conduction contribution 3 2 1 stratum equivalent model the borehole sampling data fig 1c and cpt data fig 7 a show that the stratum of the site is evenly distributed the cpt data show that there are soil interfaces at about 1 5m and 5m underground which are consistent with the geological interface moreover the cone tip resistance at the same depth is almost the same and it can be concluded that the structure of the soil is similar fig 7a in saturated soil pore water resistivity is an important factor affecting bulk resistivity the ert detection results for line df8 line in the uncontaminated area exhibit obvious electrical stratification however the ert detection results in the study area show obvious low resistivity characteristics which are caused by the difference in the pore water resistivity that is the contributions of the electrolytic conduction are different according to the particle size information for the soil samples from the boreholes and the cpt data within the effective depth measured by the ert there are two main types of formations with different f and b values the effective formation factors of the two formations are similar the effective formation factor is related to clay content pore structure and pore water conductivity nguyen et al 2009 the sample particle size analysis results show that the average clay content difference of the two formations is less than 2 the pore structure affects the state of pore water but the saturated condition makes the conductive path fully connected and the presence of by product ions increases the conductivity of the pore water reducing the influence of the pore structure on the bulk conductivity the stratum is represented by the model shown in fig 7b within 11 5 m of the surface it is mainly divided into two layers and the interface between the two layers is located at a depth of 5 m based on the fitted relationship between the bulk conductivity and the pore water conductivity the pore water conductivity of the two formations was calculated fig 7b the resistivity of the pore water is the reciprocal of its conductivity value 3 2 2 pore water resistivity calculation results and by product plume distribution the pore water resistivity reflects the contribution of the electrolytic conduction and the abnormally low pore water resistivity area delimits the distribution of the degradation by product plume however to isolate the contribution of the electrolytic conduction it is necessary to discuss the contribution of the interface conduction due to the accumulation of conductive biomass atekwana and atekwana 2010 the growth activity and biofilm development of microorganisms affect the conductivity of geological media albrecht et al 2011 the main ways to affect the conductivity of geological media include the following i pore fluid resistivity changes atekwana et al 2004 ii sulfide mineral precipitation williams et al 2005 iii microorganisms attach to particles and increase the surface area aal et al 2004 these microbial transformations in underground media are usually coupled and occur on a wide range of time and space so it is difficult to assess the degree of changes induced by these dynamic microorganisms the dc resistivity method is sensitive to both electrolyte and solid fluid interface chemical reactions and cannot distinguish the relative contribution of electrolyte conductivity and interface conductivity to the increase in bulk conductivity of hydrocarbon contaminated sediments it is worth noting that the combination of conductivity data and geochemical methods e g tds ph facilitates the analysis of the contribution of interface conductivity atekwana et al 2004 found that in the study area the bulk conductivity has increased substantially without a significant increase in tds and they concluded that the presence of surface conduction contributes to the bulk conductivity this is related to the accumulation of conductive biomass the statistics at all points show that there is no point where the bulk conductivity is abnormally high and the tds values and ph values are consistent with the background level shao et al 2019a it is inferred that the interface conductivity has not changed significantly due to conductive sulfide minerals and microbial attachment the reason for this may be that the entire field has reached the late stage of degradation with fewer carbon sources insufficient stimulation of microorganisms and fewer microorganisms there may be a small amount of biofilm which would increase the surface conduction but since the background soil layer is silty clay and silty sand the increase is not clearly reflected by the bulk conductivity the results of mineralogical appraisal show that there are no conditions for generating conductive sulfide minerals the almost completely saturated state of the deposit also makes it difficult to reflect the increase in surface electrical conduction therefore the contribution of surface conduction due to microorganisms can be ignored in the calculation changes in wettability also significantly change the conductivity of soils revil et al 2011 shao et al 2019b the increase in the oil content of the soil is the main reason for the increase in oil wettability travis et al 2008 when the water content of oil contaminated soil exceeds a certain critical value the contaminated soil can become water wettable again quyum et al 2002 the measured tph values of the research site are all less than 50 mg kg and the water saturation is greater than0 90 thus the influence of the changes in wettability on the soil conductivity can be ignored in this study fig 8 shows the calculated values for the pore water resistivity profile compared with the measured ert profile the distribution range of the by product plume is larger than that of the pollution area delineated in fig 6 i e the area where the resistivity is lower than 16 ω m it conforms to the rule that the diffusion range of the by product plume is greater than the diffusion range of the hydrocarbons the calculated pore water resistivity values are negative in some areas which are whitened during the contour processing some of the calculated pore water resistivity values are 20 40 ω m while the measured resistivity values of the water samples from multiple uncontaminated points are relatively close within the range of 15 17 ω m with average value of 16 54 ω m therefore the area where the resistivity values are lower than 16 ω m is regarded as the distribution range of the byproduct plume during the calculation process the calculated pore water resistivity values for the high resistivity area were not accurate and negative values and values higher than the clean water s resistivity appear this is due to the fact that the effective formation factor obtained through fitting does not completely match the high resistivity area the distribution and number of sampling points are not sufficient to fully characterize the particularities of the entire contaminated site the sampling points do not completely cover the high resistivity area the existing sampling points are densely distributed in the source area and the fitted petrophysical relationship is more accurate for the distribution of the by product plume near the source area the area with calculated pore water resistivity values of greater than 16 ω m is considered to be the non byproduct plume distribution area 3 3 rough estimate of the amount of hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the by product plume the conductivity characteristics of the hydrocarbon contaminated area gradually weaken as the degradation process progresses and finally they return to the original electrical state therefore evaluating the hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the low resistivity characteristics of the by product plume and comparing it with the total mass of hydrocarbons can provide a better understanding of the state of the polluted field area and the natural attenuation stage it is in 3 3 1 geochemical conceptual model of hydrocarbon biodegradation the borehole data cpt data and ert results provide clearer background formation information which confirms that the low resistivity anomaly in the field area is directly related to the pore water resistivity the main reason for this decrease in pore water resistivity is the increase in the pore water tds value and the decrease in its ph value caused by biogeochemical processes shao et al 2019a microorganisms obtain energy and carbon for new cell growth through biochemical redox reactions in which electrons are transferred from the organic pollutants to the terminal electron acceptor tea in systems without tea biochemical redox reaction is limited under aerobic conditions oxygen is the most effective tea however due to the low solubility of oxygen the dissolved oxygen in groundwater is quickly depleted in addition the groundwater level of the site is high and the soil permeability is poor which is conducive to the existence of an anaerobic environment subsequently the biochemical oxidation of organic compounds will also occur under anaerobic conditions hutchins et al 1998 the sequential order of the tea utilization under anaerobic conditions is nitrate manganese ferric iron fe iii sulfate and carbon dioxide co2 fe and mn species are the main sources of solid teas in the formation but the mn species usually only account for 2 5 of the transferable electrons heron et al 1994 based on the xrd results the abundant fe in the formation provides sufficient solid teas for biodegradation the hydraulic gradient is small and the movement and renewal of groundwater is slow the nitrate in the background stratum is consumed in the initial stage of degradation due to its limited content in this analysis only a solid phase fe iii tea is considered the ferrous ions fe2 in the aquifer are by products of fe iii and can be used as a general indicator of anaerobic biodegradation huling et al 2002 the fe2 concentrations of the samples near the water level in the 6 monitoring wells are listed in table 3 as can be seen from the measured data the fe2 concentrations at most points exhibit a good correlation with the bulk resistivity and the fe2 concentrations are relatively high in the regions with lower bulk resistivities therefore it is feasible to use fe iii as the main tea to explore the biodegradation process based on the collected mineralogical information and the results of the groundwater surveys an attempt was made to create a conceptual model for the research site including the effects of environmental related features on the hydrocarbon weathering patterns the mineralogy and the fe2 distribution characteristics of the groundwater show that iron reduction is the main reaction in the microorganism mediated hydrocarbon degradation in the case of complex chemical mixtures e g petroleum derivatives considering all of the contaminants in the mixture may be impossible and or time consuming therefore a simplified method can be used custance et al 1992 the indicator chemistry method involves selecting a subset of chemical substances that represent the worst case mobility and toxicity of the mixture benzene has a strong mobility and a tenacious effect berlin et al 2015 so it can be used as an indicator of complex organic mixtures and to describe the mechanism of mineral weathering by petroleum derivatives the main chemical and physical processes controlling the biodegradation and the related reactions of the hydrocarbons are described as follows the study area is located in southeastern china the temperature of the groundwater is above 17 c year round which is suitable for the degradation of hydrocarbons by microorganisms the cumulative annual rainfall exceeds 1100 mm year and the amount of groundwater recharge is large which causes large fluctuations in the groundwater level moreover it results in the lnapl being permanently retained within the saturated pores teramoto and chang 2017 owing to the existence of trap conditions the most important mechanism in the hydrocarbon depletion process is mass transfer to the groundwater the research site is mainly composed of clay and silty clay a smaller average soil particle size leads to smaller lnapl spaces and a larger water contact surface which ultimately leads to increased dissolution essaid et al 2015 our investigation revealed that the concentration of the tphs in the pollution source area was not significantly higher than in other locations the long term natural attenuation and the concentration and scale of the pollution source indicate that it cannot provide additional organic pollutants for the spread of the pollution plume shao et al 2019a the fluctuating water level is also more conducive to microbial activity lee et al 2001 tea and nutrients from seasonal replenishment stimulate microbial activity and make strata with fluctuating groundwater levels the most active strongly biodegradable area atekwana and atekwana 2010 the geochemical conceptual model reveals that the biodegradation of hydrocarbons which are represented by benzene occurs in the aquifers rich in iron bearing minerals mineral weathering by benzene uses fe iii as the tea the chemical equation is as follows 8 c 6 h 6 30 fe 3 12 h 2 o 6 co 2 30 h 30 fe 2 3 3 2 quantitative relationship between the geophysical and geochemical data according to equation 8 the increase in the pore water conductivity is related to the increase in the fe2 and h contents standard solutions of fe2 0 1 m feso4 and h 0 2 m h2so4 were prepared and clean groundwater samples were collected in situ for titration tests a titration experiment was conducted to determine the function curve with the concentration of fe2 and h as the abscissa and conductivity as the ordinate owing to the strong oxidizing properties of sulfuric acid and the reducing properties of ferrous ions some of the fe2 was oxidized to fe3 during the experiment and the oxidation of fe2 also occurred in the real formation the chemical reaction is a dynamic equilibrium process therefore in this study the fe2 and h ions produced by biodegradation were used to quantify the increase in the pore water conductivity and to roughly estimate the quality of degraded benzene which has a certain reference value the actual mass of benzene degraded should be greater than the calculated value the working curve of the relationship between the concentration of h and fe2 and the conductivity of the solution is shown in fig 9 when the concentration of h and fe2 is greater than 0 6 mmol l the conductivity exhibits a very good linear correlation with the concentration of h and fe2 fitting formula y 0 063x 0 0321 where x is the concentration of h and fe2 and y is the conductivity of the solution the significance of the working curve shown in fig 9 is that it allows us to calculate the increase in the h and fe2 concentration of the pore water based on the increase in the pore water conductivity 3 3 3 hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the by product plume the boreholes near the pollution source area are densely spaced and the geochemical data are relatively abundant the area with obvious low resistivity anomalies near the source area was selected to estimate the amount of hydrocarbon degradation and the total amount of tphs the area is 39 m long and 16 m wide it is located 50 89 m from lines df3 and df4 and 19 35 m from line df7 and it has a depth of 5 m 1 estimation of the measured tph content the size of the selected area is 39 16 5 m and its total volume is 3120 m3 the average density of the silty clay in this 5 m deep interval is 1840 kg m3 the average value of the 21 measured tphs within this 5 m deep interval in the study area was 22 005 mg kg based on the above data the total amount of tphs in the area is estimated to be 126 326 kg 2 the amount of benzene degradation corresponding to the increase in pore water conductivity the groundwater conductivity of several unpolluted points around the site is 0 056 0 067 s m with an average value of 0 060 s m the contour map of the pore water conductivity is shown in fig 10 the area where the conductivity of the pore water is lower than 0 060 s m is considered that the conductivity has not changed due to the biodegradation process in the calculation process the conductivity values of pore water in these areas were treated as 0 060 s m its significance is that it illustrates the increase in the pore water conductivity due to degradation the selected study area was divided into four model boxes a d to calculate the amount of degradation the position of each area is shown by the yellow dotted line in the figure the widths of a and b are 11 m located within 19 30 m of line df7 and the widths of c and d are 5 m located within 30 35 m of line df7 the specific parameters and calculation results are shown in table 4 3 contamination area assessment in the selected study area the total amount of tph estimated from the multiple measured tph values was 126 326 kg the pore water conductivity in the selected study area was calculated and it was estimated that the by product plume observed using ert was produced by the degradation of 3 572 kg of benzene furthermore the hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the by product plume accounted for about 2 8 of the hydrocarbon content of the selected study area however the actual amount of degradation should be higher because the degradation process involving liquid phase tea was ignored in this calculation in addition the small scale of the fe2 was not sufficient to generate the high conductivity characteristics observed using ert which will also lead to an underestimation of the amount of degradation the geochemical conceptual model of contaminated sites should cover the complex overlap of multiple biogeochemical processes related to hydrocarbon mineralization this study is based on a conceptual model of the special characteristics and geochemical constraints to reproduce the hydrocarbon mineralization during iron reduction in the field it is characterized in that the groundwater level is less than 2m from the surface the clay content exceeds 45 the permeability is low and an anaerobic environment is easy to form the contaminated site is rich in chlorite minerals high in iron oxides and limited availability of other teas the high concentration of fe2 in the source area and the large amount of iron oxide in the aquifer indicate that iron reduction is the main reaction related to the degradation of hydrocarbons mediated by microorganisms therefore the hydrocarbon mineralization involved in oxygen and other solid phase teas has been simplified and ignored in the quantitative study of this site volatilization is one of the important ways for the natural attenuation of hydrocarbons the volatilization rate of hydrocarbons depends on its thermodynamic state and physical properties such as solubility in water vapor pressure henry s law constant and diffusion coefficient etc lee et al 2004 voutsas et al 2005 the greater the concentration of the solute in the aqueous solution the greater the volatility when the concentration of the solute decreases the volatilization will become slower pankow et al 1996 in addition most of the hydrocarbons are collected below the groundwater level and the evaporation of hydrocarbons can be ignored under trapped conditions chao et al 2005 when studying the natural attenuation process of hydrocarbons in contaminated sites the impact of evaporation should be considered and the remaining part of hydrocarbons in the soil can be consumed by reduced iron however in this study the ert data and geochemical data acquired the contaminated site s information in a transient state and the quantitative relationship between by product plume and resistivity distribution will not be affected by the evaporation of hydrocarbons evaluating the status of an aged polluted area requires a variety of parameters such as the source of the lnapls the source of the tea whether the tea will be exhausted and information related to the microorganisms the collection of these data and information requires a variety of technical collaborations and a large amount of time and money which may not be achieved in field investigations however in this study a rough estimate was attained based on a small amount of discrete geochemical data and ert measurement results the results of this study demonstrate the clear geochemical significance of low resistivity anomalies in the survey of aged hydrocarbon contaminated sites and they establish a quantitative relationship between the solute concentration of the by product plume and the electrical conductivity based on the ert surveys of aged hydrocarbon contaminated sites the three dimensional spatial distribution and quantitative solute concentration of underground by product plumes can be obtained the quantitative information about the by product plume contains information related to the biodegradation these research results convert the parameters related to the biodegradation assessment into hydrological issues multiple ert measurements can greatly reduce the workload and cost of assessing information related to microbial degradation and assessments of natural attenuation rates will be more accurate 4 conclusion in this study a small amount of discrete geochemical data and ert detection results for the study area were used to describe the distribution of the hydrocarbon degradation by product plumes a biogeochemical model of hydrocarbon weathering was proposed and the relationship between the pore water resistivity and hydrocarbon degradation was established based on the fitting of the groundwater resistivity data collected in situ and the bulk resistivity measured using ert a suitable petrophysical relationship was determined for the study area the pore water resistivity was calculated using the fitted formula to characterize the contribution of the electrolytic conduction the abnormally low pore water resistivity area was the distribution area of the byproduct plume the geochemical conceptual model established based on contaminated site with special characteristics and geochemical constraints is that iron reduction is the main reaction related to microbial mediated hydrocarbon degradation the conceptual model of geochemistry is based on the limited conditions of other electron acceptors iron oxides are abundant in aquifers and are preferentially used by microorganisms in an anaerobic environment these factors make it reasonable and effective to ignore the biodegradation process involved in other electron acceptors although it will cause the calculated benzene degradation to be slightly underestimated the mineralogy and fe2 distribution characteristics of the groundwater indicate that iron reduction was the main reaction in the microbial mediated hydrocarbon degradation the main reason for the decrease in pore water resistivity was the by products fe2 and h produced by the hydrocarbon degradation the results of the electrochemical experiments revealed that the concentration of fe2 and h in the groundwater exhibits a linear correlation with the conductivity the part of the study area near the source area was selected to estimate the hydrocarbon degradation that produced the by product plume the calculation results indicate that the hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the by product plume is about 2 8 of the hydrocarbon content of the study area the comparison between the two improves our understanding of the natural attenuation state of hydrocarbon contaminated sites understanding the natural attenuation status of hydrocarbon contaminated sites can be helpful in assessing the feasibility and cost effectiveness of future remediation options based on the ert results and the soil physical model the water content water conductivity porosity clay content and hydraulic conductivity can be quantitatively predicted providing the full spatial parameter information required to construct a quantitative analysis model which makes predicting the natural attenuation of

4716,during the investigation of aged hydrocarbon contaminated sites using electrical resistivity tomography ert the low resistivity anomalies in the detection profile have been widely considered to be caused by the hydrocarbon degradation by products however these low resistivity anomalies are a comprehensive reflection of the formation s electrical characteristics in this study we used ert and geochemical methods to investigate a hydrocarbon contaminated site that has been abandoned for more than 30 years there are several obvious low resistivity anomalies in the site which are related to hydrocarbon mineralization based on the law of waxman and smits a petrophysical relationship formula suitable for this specific site was fitted and the true resistivity after inversion was input into the formula to calculate the pore water resistivity the electrolytic conduction contribution of the pore water was isolated and the distribution of the by product plume was determined based on the electrolytic conduction contribution of the pore water based on mineralogical identification and geochemical data analysis the biogeochemical model of hydrocarbon mineralization was clarified the degradation by products fe2 and h are the controlling factors that lead to changes in the groundwater resistivity based on electrochemical experiments and titration analysis experiments the quantitative relationship between the low resistivity anomalies of the pore water and the degradation by products fe2 and h was established and the biodegradation model was used to calculate the hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the by product plume the results show that the hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the by product plume determined from the ert detection results in the selected study area is approximately 2 8 of the total hydrocarbon content although this is a rough estimate based on a small amount of discrete geochemical data and ert detection results it improves our understanding of the natural attenuation state of hydrocarbon contaminated sites and provides convincing data to support future estimations of the site s natural attenuation time keywords ert geochemistry hydrocarbons by product plume quantitative evaluation 1 introduction aged hydrocarbon contaminated sites continuously release harmful substances into the underground environment the key to the management and remediation of contaminated sites is to obtain information about the underground spatial distribution and concentration of the pollutants nyári et al 2010 monitored natural attenuation fully relies on natural purification capabilities so it has been widely used to evaluate the feasibility and cost effectiveness of management and remediation plans ossai et al 2020 mathematical models in situ column technology microscopic studies and pollutant concentration analysis are commonly used to assess the occurrence and rate of natural attenuation fernández et al 2016 kao and prosser 2001 the above techniques require knowledge of the pollutant transmission mass transfer data and environmental parameters mulligan and yong 2004 to study the effects of soil hydrogeological parameters on pollutant migration hyun et al 2008 however the impact of the biodegradation process on the natural attenuation rate is more complicated the factors related to substrate concentration nutrient utilization electron acceptor utilization and microbial growth need to be considered schirmer and butler 2004 and these factors vary in time and space this also makes the evaluation more difficult electrical resistivity tomography ert is a geophysical method that is sensitive to the pore fluid and porosity characteristics and it can obtain continuous information about underground properties in real time aal et al 2004 arato et al 2014 caterina et al 2017 ravi et al 2012 simyrdanis et al 2018 combining geophysical data with traditional hydrogeochemical data has the advantage of generating information about the entire polluted area at a lower cost chambers et al 2010 however finding a way to establish a quantitative relationship between the geophysical data and pollutant concentration has become the key to understanding the natural attenuation state of aged hydrocarbon contaminated sites a site contaminated by hydrocarbons is not a fixed target these sites are in the process of spatial and temporal evolution which is affected by factors such as the hydrogeological conditions climatic characteristics and microbial effects atekwana and atekwana 2010 ert can provide information related to the natural attenuation processes of the site the electrical characteristics of polluted areas can differ significantly due to the different evolution stages of the polluted areas koroma et al 2015 in the early post contamination period due to the high resistivity characteristics of hydrocarbons olhoeft 1985 contaminated sites often exhibit high resistivity characteristics buselli and lu 2001 rosales et al 2013 2014 owing to the movement of the groundwater and the light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl the saturation of the lnapl in the polluted area gradually decreases the increased amount of pore water in the polluted area provides conductive pathways the existence of even a few conductive pathways will cause the bulk resistivity to be much lower than the hydrocarbon resistivity heenan et al 2015 the characteristics of the resistance signal in the hydrocarbon contaminated area gradually weakens and even in the newly formed pollution source area the resistivity is lower than that of the clean formation shao et al 2019b after long term evolution the lnapl produces a complex biophysical and chemical environment under the action of microorganisms abbas et al 2018 for example owing to the organic acids and carbonic acid released by bacteria mineral weathering is enhanced the porosity changes and the total dissolved solids tds increase atekwana et al 2004 2000 werkema et al 2003 conductive biomasses grow and accumulate on the lnapl materials and act as electrical conductors aal et al 2004 albrecht et al 2011 atekwana and atekwana 2010 these changes in hydrocarbon contaminated sites cause the electrical characteristics of the formation to change from resistive to conductive amélie et al 2014 che alota et al 2015 in aquifers contaminated by hydrocarbons the environmental changes usually depend on the presence of microorganisms that degrade hydrocarbons the terminal electron acceptor tea and the byproducts of hydrocarbon degradation bekins et al 2013 cozzarelli et al 2001 the ph of the pore fluid decreases as carbon dioxide dissolves to form carbonic acid and with the production of organic acids which can enhance the dissolution of sedimentary minerals bennett et al 1996 processes related to biodegradation often exhibit low resistivity characteristics on the ert detection profiles and these low resistivity characteristics are related to the distribution of the degradation by product plumes ert can provide continuous real time monitoring of contaminated sites and can be used to comprehensively characterize changes in underground media however it is difficult to use ert to quantitatively evaluate contaminated sites in situ the reason for this is that the acquired resistivity data is the bulk resistivity and the current flowing through the soil depends on the electrolytic conduction kemna 2000 and the interface conduction vinegar and waxman 1984 waxman and smits 1968 the complexity of electrical conductivity at the micro scale leads to a high degree of uncertainty and an incomplete understanding of the interaction between physical processes sahimi 2011 and chemical processes revil and glover 1997 telford et al 1990 quantifying the contribution of electrolytic conduction and surface conduction requires a clear understanding of the specific site s conductive properties friedman 2005 the construction of the conductivity model of porous media is related to mineral composition pore structure chemical composition of pore water saturation etc cai et al 2017 hunt 2004 pan and connell 2012 archie 1942 revil and glover 1998 the conductivity model of the clay rich formation has been improved on the basis of archie s law to adapt to the complexity of conductivity caused by surface conduction and porous media structure bernabé et al 2011 revil 2013 applying an effective conductivity model on site is conducive to establishing a quantitative relationship between resistivity data and geochemical data in previous studies we have confirmed that the low resistivity characteristics of the site are related to biogeochemical processes and the distribution range of the hydrocarbon plumes was delineated based on the low resistivity and low permeability characteristics of the formation shao et al 2019a strictly speaking in areas where the groundwater level changes the permeability will change gao et al 2020 so the migration rate of the hydrocarbons is not consistent with that of the by product solute to further study the quantitative relationship between the ert detection results and the hydrocarbons in this study a biogeochemical model of hydrocarbon mineralization based on geochemical data and mineralogical identification was established and the mechanism by which the pore water s resistivity changes during hydrocarbon degradation was further clarified based on the law of waxman and smits 1968 a petrophysical relationship formula suitable for this specific site was fitted and the true resistivity after inversion was input into the formula to calculate the pore water resistivity the contribution of the electrolytic conduction of the pore water was isolated and the by product plume s distribution was determined based on the electrolytic conduction contribution of the pore water based on this the quantitative relationship between the change in the pore water s resistivity and the concentration of the degradation by products was established through electrochemical experiments finally the relationship between the change in the pore water s resistivity and the amount of hydrocarbon degradation was calculated based on the biogeochemical model this study proposes a method for understanding the natural attenuation state of hydrocarbon contaminated sites based on a small amount of discrete geochemical data and ert data 2 material and methods 2 1 field survey the study area which was once the site of a petroleum solvent plant is located in the southeastern part of jiangsu province china fig 1 in the past production processes a trench was set up at the site to discharge organic wastes underground since the solvent plant was relocated the site has been abandoned for more than 30 years during the long period of abandonment the sewage area has been replaced by soil since then the hydrocarbon contaminated area has undergone a natural attenuation according to the results of on site surveys and indoor geotechnical experiments the stratum up to a depth of 28 m can be divided into artificial filling layers and quaternary sedimentary layers continuous silty clay is distributed in the surface layer artificial filling layer of the study area with a thickness of 5 6 m the thickness of the quaternary sedimentary layers is about 17 23 m the upper part is mainly composed of silty sand and clay and is between 2 60 and 6 50 m thick the lower part is a 15 m thick silt layer the groundwater level is 1 6 1 9 m below the surface according to the groundwater level measurements the overall flow direction of the groundwater in the study area is from north to south which is basically consistent with the flow direction of the river on the eastern side of the site the hydraulic gradient of the groundwater is relatively small between 0 27 and 0 76 2 1 1 resistivity data 1 electrical resistivity tomography the purpose of ert conducting measurements is to obtain the bulk resistivity ρb or its inverse i e bulk conductivity σb of the formation and its tomography the analysis of the formation s resistivity is usually based on the rock s physical properties following the model proposed by revil 2013 1 σ b 1 f σ f s w n 1 f ϕ σ s s w n 1 where f is the formation factor σ f is the fluid conductivity sw is the water saturation ϕ is the aquifer porosity σs is the surface conductivity and n is the empirical value of the saturation exponent according to archie 1942 the formation factor f can be expressed as 2 f a ϕ m where m is the cementation index and a is a proportionality constant in saturated porous media current transmission occurs through two mechanisms electrolytic conduction and surface conduction electrolytic conduction mainly depends on the fluid s properties e g the ion concentration saturation and the pore space morphology that affects the state of the fluid e g pore network interconnection tortuosity binley and kemna 2005 cai et al 2017 while surface conduction is a complex electrical property that is mainly controlled by the surface area and grains of the material kimak et al 2019 weller et al 2013 seven ert lines were laid in the field area lines df1 df6 lines were laid from east to west in the study area with a line spacing of 6 m line df7 line was lain longitudinally in the middle of the study area ert measuring line df8 was lain at a distance of 60 m from the study area to obtain the electrical characteristics of the uncontaminated area for use as a reference model fig 1 the schlumberger electrode configuration protocol was used the selected inner probe spacing was 1 or 1 5 m depending on the total length of the measurement line and the required spatial and depth resolution as is shown in table 1 the equipment used was the e60dn system produced by geopen its technical specifications can be found at http www qdgeopen com the 12v direct current dc power supply was used to establish a dc electric field the maximum current applied for each measurement was 1000 ma and the power supply time was set to 1 s in the measurement of the eight ert lines each line was repeated at least twice for the data analysis of each independent dataset we eliminated the outliers which were defined as being 5 times greater than or less than 1 5 of both adjacent data points the quantitative interpretation of the imaging results requires the data inversion of the pseudosections to obtain profiles with true resistivity values and depths in this study the inversion data were calculated using the standard least squares inversion method and the res2dinv software loke and barker 1996 these inversion routines involve cell based inversion techniques which subdivide the underground medium into a number of rectangular cells and then the resistivity of the cells is determined to provide a model response consistent with the observed data loke 2000 2004 minimize the difference between the observed and calculated cells to obtain acceptable consistency in the fitting process loke and barker 1996 the root mean square error rms shows the measure of this difference for all profiles the inversion converged in less than 5 iterations to small rms misfits between 3 5 and 6 5 highlighting the good agreement between the measured data and the inversion resistivity models 2 in situ columnar soil sample resistivity measurements the ground stratum was rich in clay with a high water content and a generally good electrical conductivity we collected undisturbed soil samples for the resistivity measurement and then we compared the results with the inversion resistivity the purpose of this comparison was to determine if the true resistivity of the inversion profile was valid collecting undisturbed soil samples on site and then transporting them to the laboratory for resistivity testing e g two pole method quadrupole method is a commonly used method of site resistivity survey zhang et al 2014 the samples may undergo changes in moisture content and porosity during transportation which will cause experimental errors fodor et al 2011 so the test was carried out in situ to reduce the error during the in situ sampling process we used the following methods to reduce the disturbance to the samples i use a thin wall soil extractor to reduce the disturbance to the soil layer ii keep the drill vertical and the drilling process stable in order to directly measure the true resistivity of the soil at different depths round copper plates were used at the end of the cylindrical sample collected in situ to realize the function of the current electrodes fig 2 a good electrical contact between the electrode and the sample can establish a horizontal electric field flow making the measured value closer to the true resistivity value of the soil telford et al 1990 it is not very reliable to press or scratch the wire terminal on the sample surface the quadrupole method was used to measure the resistivity of the columnar soil samples in situ four thin copper sheets were inserted into the soil sample at equal intervals of 5 cm as the measuring electrodes electrodes a and b on both sides of the soil sample were current electrodes the middle two electrodes m and n were potential electrodes and the radius of the column sample was 3 cm the equipment used was the e60dn system produced by geopen when using the quadrupole method to measure the resistivity the current between a and b was iab the voltage between m and n was umn and the resistivity ρt of the soil sample to be measured was calculated using eq 3 3 ρ t π r 2 u mn l mn i ab the three in situ resistivity measurements w1 w3 and s5 and the inversion resistivity were normalized for deviation d analysis the in situ measured resistivity ρt and the actual ert measured value ρi at that point were the normalized deviation d 4 d ρ t ρ i 2 ρ t 2 2 1 2 geochemical characterization based on the geophysical data soil sampling points and groundwater monitoring wells were deployed throughout the site soil and groundwater samples were collected using a geoprobe 7822dt and the monitoring wells respectively during the collection process all of the soil and groundwater samples were refrigerated in situ in an ice box they were sent to a commercial laboratory for analysis the soil s total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs tds and groundwater ph values were tested the sample analysis results show that there are typical petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil and groundwater including benzene toluene xylene and naphthalene the detected tphs at each location in the contaminated site s1 s5 w1 w4 were less than 35 mg kg fig 3 is a scatter plot of tph measurements at different depths in the vertical direction they are mainly distributed in the area where the water level fluctuates throughout the year and the soil interface the distribution range is mainly within 7 5 m the tph values of samples with a depth greater than 8m are all less than 1 mg kg the source area s value was not appear to be higher than that of the other locations the detection values of boreholes s6 and s7 which were located outside of the site were less than 0 1 mg kg the tphs were mainly distributed near the pollution source area and moved in the direction of the hydraulic slope s descent the tphs were most widely diffused in the water level fluctuation area the weathering of hydrocarbons led to a significant increase in the tds in the groundwater and a decrease in its ph most of the tds values in the contaminated site were 100 300 mg l which is also higher than the values measured at locations s6 and s7 i e outside of the site shao et al 2019a 2 1 3 cpt method the cone penetration test cpt method is generally considered to be a minimally invasive technique for obtaining the soil profile tillmann et al 2008 in this survey the cpt was conducted after the resistivity measurements and the cpt results were compared with the electrical stratification based on the resistivity detection results which further confirmed that the low resistivity anomaly area in the site was caused by strong electrolytic conduction shao et al 2019a 2 2 petrophysical relationship the borehole data show that the strata in the study area are evenly distributed and the stratification is clear fig 1c the groundwater level in the area does not vary significantly and it is mostly 1 8 to 2 m below the surface eq 1 described the relationship between the bulk conductivity the electrolytic conductivity and the surface conductivity however the difficulty in field investigations is determining a way to quantify the contributions of the electrolytic conduction and the surface conduction archie s law describes the empirical relationship between the bulk conductivity σb and the pore solution conductivity σw 5 σ b ϕ m a σ w s w n the stratum above the groundwater level in the site have a saturation of over 0 90 the pore water is connected to form a large number of conductive pathways and its contribution to the bulk conductivity is not significantly different from that of the saturated soil in this study the stratum of the site is regarded as the saturated area sw 1 to study the contribution of the pore water conductivity the validity of archie s law depends on the contribution of the electrical surface conduction to the bulk conductivity the formation is rich in clay particles and archie s law must be modified to account for this effect waxman and smits 1968 6 σ b σ w f σ surf σ w where σ surf is the surface conduction term related to the conductivity of the pore water revil and glover 1998 since in practice this dependency is difficult to separate from the first term on the right hand side of eq 6 it can also be written as nguyen et al 2009 7 σ b σ w f b where f corresponds to an effective formation factor which includes both the dependence of the pore water related bulk electrical conductivity and that of the electrical surface conduction on the water conductivity and b corresponds to the contribution of the surface conductivity independent of the water conductivity in this study we used the specific petrophysical relationship of the contaminated site to obtain specific f and b values by fitting the measured conductivity values of the groundwater samples at different locations to the corresponding bulk conductivity values fig 4 shows the relationship between the pore water conductivity and the measured bulk conductivity of the ert in the silty sand and silty clay layers according to the low resistivity anomaly area at a depth of 2m underground in the ert results groundwater sample collection points were set up at the boundary w1 w4 and the middle w2 w3 of the low resistivity anomaly area in addition groundwater sample collection points were set up in the middle of the pollution source area s2 s3 the bailer tube sampler was used to collect groundwater samples of different depths puls and barcelona 1996 the electrical conductivity of soil pore fluids was measured using an electrical conductivity apparatus developed by thermo electron corporation the conductivity of the pore water is the measured value from the in situ sampling but there is still the possibility of disturbance so it may only partially represent the site s conditions equation 7 was fit to the data shown in fig 4 to determine the effective formation factors and surface conduction terms the effective formation factors of the two formations are similar the fitted formula describing the relationship between the pore water conductivity and the bulk conductivity was used to calculate the groundwater conductivity of the site the bulk conductivity was derived from the inversion of the ert results and the conductivity of the pore water in the site was calculated 2 3 geochemical conceptual model development of a geochemistry conceptual model that will interpret chemical speciation data related to hydrocarbon biodegradation teramoto and chang 2019 the mineralogical characteristics of sediments play an important role in the microbial degradation of hydrocarbons ng et al 2014 the laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 was used to determine the clay content in the soil after separating and purifying clay minerals in the soil electron probe microanalyzer jeol jxa 8230 and x ray powder diffractometer bruker d8 advance were used to characterize the chemical composition and mineralogical identification testing work was done by commercial laboratories the average clay content of the silt sand layer is 49 3 and the average clay content of the silt sand layer is 47 8 the non clay mineral phase is mainly quartz sio2 and the clay mineral phases are mainly polysilicon lepidolite k alfeli si3al o10 oh f and clinochlorite mg fe 6 si al 4o10 oh 8 the chemical formula of clinochlorite shows that it is a chlorite mineral containing iron and magnesium and it is a common chlorite mineral in the formation hey 1954 table 2 shows the electron probe microanalyzer analysis results of the chemical composition the content of each chemical component is the average of the sample test results it should be noted that since the electron probe cannot distinguish fe2 and fe3 the total iron oxide tfeo content is given in table 2 the electron probe microanalyzer analysis results show that the total iron oxide content in the clay is about 20 iron oxide is an important component of the natural environment it is widely found in soil sediments and rocks its source may come from the release of fe containing minerals such as ferrous silicate and ferrous sulfide schwertmann 1958 different iron minerals can be transformed into each other such as the accompanying phenomenon of goethite and hematite cornell and schwertmann 2003 due to the abundance of iron oxides biodegradation under dissimilatory iron reduction is the main mechanism of hydrocarbon metabolism esther et al 2015 klueglein et al 2013 based on the collected mineralogical information the groundwater investigation results and the chemical reactions related to the biodegradation of the hydrocarbons a conceptual model was established for the research site the main purpose of this conceptual model was to clarify the biodegradation process of the hydrocarbons the degradation products and the mechanism by which the pore water resistivity of the site changes 2 4 establishing a quantitative relationship between the geochemical and geophysical data the calculated pore water resistivity was converted into the pore water conductivity the increase in the conductivity of pore water is related to the increase in its electrolyte concentration this is the change in the pore water conductivity caused by the biodegradation by products of the hydrocarbons which can be obtained using the method described in section 2 3 to confirm the relationship between the change in the conductivity and the ion concentration clean groundwater samples from the study area were collected in situ for titration tests a titration experiment was conducted and the concentration of the degradation product ions was taken as the abscissa and the conductivity was taken as the ordinate to determine the function curve 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the electrical resistivity the normalized deviation analysis of the ert results and the in situ column sample resistivity measurement results shows that the deviations between different depths are small within 0 4 fig 5 that is the ground ert measurements reflect the true resistivity of the formation better the stratum within 8 m of the surface in the study area is dominated by clay and silty clay this stratum has a high water content and the water saturation of the unsaturated zone exceeds 0 9 the stratum is uniform and conductive and the ground ert results are closer to the true resistivity after inversion the results of the ert detection are shown in fig 6 as can be seen from reference line df8 located 60 m away from the contaminated site the electrical stratification is uniform and an obvious electrical stratification interface exists at 6 7 m below the surface there are several low resistivity anomalies within 8 m of the surface in the study area the resistivity near the pollution source area was significantly lower than that of the surrounding area and the low resistivity distribution area was relatively deeper the distribution of the low resistivity area is consistent with the hydraulic slope and the resistivity of the southern area is lower than that of the northern area the northernmost survey line df6 shows that there is no obvious low resistivity anomaly in the stratum within 8 m of the surface the geochemical data demonstrates that the low resistivity anomaly zone is due to the hydrocarbon degradation by products however the by product plume is not consistent with the low resistivity distribution zone on the ert profile so further exploration is needed to obtain more information on the plume of hydrocarbons and by products contained in the ert results 3 2 electrolytic conduction contribution 3 2 1 stratum equivalent model the borehole sampling data fig 1c and cpt data fig 7 a show that the stratum of the site is evenly distributed the cpt data show that there are soil interfaces at about 1 5m and 5m underground which are consistent with the geological interface moreover the cone tip resistance at the same depth is almost the same and it can be concluded that the structure of the soil is similar fig 7a in saturated soil pore water resistivity is an important factor affecting bulk resistivity the ert detection results for line df8 line in the uncontaminated area exhibit obvious electrical stratification however the ert detection results in the study area show obvious low resistivity characteristics which are caused by the difference in the pore water resistivity that is the contributions of the electrolytic conduction are different according to the particle size information for the soil samples from the boreholes and the cpt data within the effective depth measured by the ert there are two main types of formations with different f and b values the effective formation factors of the two formations are similar the effective formation factor is related to clay content pore structure and pore water conductivity nguyen et al 2009 the sample particle size analysis results show that the average clay content difference of the two formations is less than 2 the pore structure affects the state of pore water but the saturated condition makes the conductive path fully connected and the presence of by product ions increases the conductivity of the pore water reducing the influence of the pore structure on the bulk conductivity the stratum is represented by the model shown in fig 7b within 11 5 m of the surface it is mainly divided into two layers and the interface between the two layers is located at a depth of 5 m based on the fitted relationship between the bulk conductivity and the pore water conductivity the pore water conductivity of the two formations was calculated fig 7b the resistivity of the pore water is the reciprocal of its conductivity value 3 2 2 pore water resistivity calculation results and by product plume distribution the pore water resistivity reflects the contribution of the electrolytic conduction and the abnormally low pore water resistivity area delimits the distribution of the degradation by product plume however to isolate the contribution of the electrolytic conduction it is necessary to discuss the contribution of the interface conduction due to the accumulation of conductive biomass atekwana and atekwana 2010 the growth activity and biofilm development of microorganisms affect the conductivity of geological media albrecht et al 2011 the main ways to affect the conductivity of geological media include the following i pore fluid resistivity changes atekwana et al 2004 ii sulfide mineral precipitation williams et al 2005 iii microorganisms attach to particles and increase the surface area aal et al 2004 these microbial transformations in underground media are usually coupled and occur on a wide range of time and space so it is difficult to assess the degree of changes induced by these dynamic microorganisms the dc resistivity method is sensitive to both electrolyte and solid fluid interface chemical reactions and cannot distinguish the relative contribution of electrolyte conductivity and interface conductivity to the increase in bulk conductivity of hydrocarbon contaminated sediments it is worth noting that the combination of conductivity data and geochemical methods e g tds ph facilitates the analysis of the contribution of interface conductivity atekwana et al 2004 found that in the study area the bulk conductivity has increased substantially without a significant increase in tds and they concluded that the presence of surface conduction contributes to the bulk conductivity this is related to the accumulation of conductive biomass the statistics at all points show that there is no point where the bulk conductivity is abnormally high and the tds values and ph values are consistent with the background level shao et al 2019a it is inferred that the interface conductivity has not changed significantly due to conductive sulfide minerals and microbial attachment the reason for this may be that the entire field has reached the late stage of degradation with fewer carbon sources insufficient stimulation of microorganisms and fewer microorganisms there may be a small amount of biofilm which would increase the surface conduction but since the background soil layer is silty clay and silty sand the increase is not clearly reflected by the bulk conductivity the results of mineralogical appraisal show that there are no conditions for generating conductive sulfide minerals the almost completely saturated state of the deposit also makes it difficult to reflect the increase in surface electrical conduction therefore the contribution of surface conduction due to microorganisms can be ignored in the calculation changes in wettability also significantly change the conductivity of soils revil et al 2011 shao et al 2019b the increase in the oil content of the soil is the main reason for the increase in oil wettability travis et al 2008 when the water content of oil contaminated soil exceeds a certain critical value the contaminated soil can become water wettable again quyum et al 2002 the measured tph values of the research site are all less than 50 mg kg and the water saturation is greater than0 90 thus the influence of the changes in wettability on the soil conductivity can be ignored in this study fig 8 shows the calculated values for the pore water resistivity profile compared with the measured ert profile the distribution range of the by product plume is larger than that of the pollution area delineated in fig 6 i e the area where the resistivity is lower than 16 ω m it conforms to the rule that the diffusion range of the by product plume is greater than the diffusion range of the hydrocarbons the calculated pore water resistivity values are negative in some areas which are whitened during the contour processing some of the calculated pore water resistivity values are 20 40 ω m while the measured resistivity values of the water samples from multiple uncontaminated points are relatively close within the range of 15 17 ω m with average value of 16 54 ω m therefore the area where the resistivity values are lower than 16 ω m is regarded as the distribution range of the byproduct plume during the calculation process the calculated pore water resistivity values for the high resistivity area were not accurate and negative values and values higher than the clean water s resistivity appear this is due to the fact that the effective formation factor obtained through fitting does not completely match the high resistivity area the distribution and number of sampling points are not sufficient to fully characterize the particularities of the entire contaminated site the sampling points do not completely cover the high resistivity area the existing sampling points are densely distributed in the source area and the fitted petrophysical relationship is more accurate for the distribution of the by product plume near the source area the area with calculated pore water resistivity values of greater than 16 ω m is considered to be the non byproduct plume distribution area 3 3 rough estimate of the amount of hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the by product plume the conductivity characteristics of the hydrocarbon contaminated area gradually weaken as the degradation process progresses and finally they return to the original electrical state therefore evaluating the hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the low resistivity characteristics of the by product plume and comparing it with the total mass of hydrocarbons can provide a better understanding of the state of the polluted field area and the natural attenuation stage it is in 3 3 1 geochemical conceptual model of hydrocarbon biodegradation the borehole data cpt data and ert results provide clearer background formation information which confirms that the low resistivity anomaly in the field area is directly related to the pore water resistivity the main reason for this decrease in pore water resistivity is the increase in the pore water tds value and the decrease in its ph value caused by biogeochemical processes shao et al 2019a microorganisms obtain energy and carbon for new cell growth through biochemical redox reactions in which electrons are transferred from the organic pollutants to the terminal electron acceptor tea in systems without tea biochemical redox reaction is limited under aerobic conditions oxygen is the most effective tea however due to the low solubility of oxygen the dissolved oxygen in groundwater is quickly depleted in addition the groundwater level of the site is high and the soil permeability is poor which is conducive to the existence of an anaerobic environment subsequently the biochemical oxidation of organic compounds will also occur under anaerobic conditions hutchins et al 1998 the sequential order of the tea utilization under anaerobic conditions is nitrate manganese ferric iron fe iii sulfate and carbon dioxide co2 fe and mn species are the main sources of solid teas in the formation but the mn species usually only account for 2 5 of the transferable electrons heron et al 1994 based on the xrd results the abundant fe in the formation provides sufficient solid teas for biodegradation the hydraulic gradient is small and the movement and renewal of groundwater is slow the nitrate in the background stratum is consumed in the initial stage of degradation due to its limited content in this analysis only a solid phase fe iii tea is considered the ferrous ions fe2 in the aquifer are by products of fe iii and can be used as a general indicator of anaerobic biodegradation huling et al 2002 the fe2 concentrations of the samples near the water level in the 6 monitoring wells are listed in table 3 as can be seen from the measured data the fe2 concentrations at most points exhibit a good correlation with the bulk resistivity and the fe2 concentrations are relatively high in the regions with lower bulk resistivities therefore it is feasible to use fe iii as the main tea to explore the biodegradation process based on the collected mineralogical information and the results of the groundwater surveys an attempt was made to create a conceptual model for the research site including the effects of environmental related features on the hydrocarbon weathering patterns the mineralogy and the fe2 distribution characteristics of the groundwater show that iron reduction is the main reaction in the microorganism mediated hydrocarbon degradation in the case of complex chemical mixtures e g petroleum derivatives considering all of the contaminants in the mixture may be impossible and or time consuming therefore a simplified method can be used custance et al 1992 the indicator chemistry method involves selecting a subset of chemical substances that represent the worst case mobility and toxicity of the mixture benzene has a strong mobility and a tenacious effect berlin et al 2015 so it can be used as an indicator of complex organic mixtures and to describe the mechanism of mineral weathering by petroleum derivatives the main chemical and physical processes controlling the biodegradation and the related reactions of the hydrocarbons are described as follows the study area is located in southeastern china the temperature of the groundwater is above 17 c year round which is suitable for the degradation of hydrocarbons by microorganisms the cumulative annual rainfall exceeds 1100 mm year and the amount of groundwater recharge is large which causes large fluctuations in the groundwater level moreover it results in the lnapl being permanently retained within the saturated pores teramoto and chang 2017 owing to the existence of trap conditions the most important mechanism in the hydrocarbon depletion process is mass transfer to the groundwater the research site is mainly composed of clay and silty clay a smaller average soil particle size leads to smaller lnapl spaces and a larger water contact surface which ultimately leads to increased dissolution essaid et al 2015 our investigation revealed that the concentration of the tphs in the pollution source area was not significantly higher than in other locations the long term natural attenuation and the concentration and scale of the pollution source indicate that it cannot provide additional organic pollutants for the spread of the pollution plume shao et al 2019a the fluctuating water level is also more conducive to microbial activity lee et al 2001 tea and nutrients from seasonal replenishment stimulate microbial activity and make strata with fluctuating groundwater levels the most active strongly biodegradable area atekwana and atekwana 2010 the geochemical conceptual model reveals that the biodegradation of hydrocarbons which are represented by benzene occurs in the aquifers rich in iron bearing minerals mineral weathering by benzene uses fe iii as the tea the chemical equation is as follows 8 c 6 h 6 30 fe 3 12 h 2 o 6 co 2 30 h 30 fe 2 3 3 2 quantitative relationship between the geophysical and geochemical data according to equation 8 the increase in the pore water conductivity is related to the increase in the fe2 and h contents standard solutions of fe2 0 1 m feso4 and h 0 2 m h2so4 were prepared and clean groundwater samples were collected in situ for titration tests a titration experiment was conducted to determine the function curve with the concentration of fe2 and h as the abscissa and conductivity as the ordinate owing to the strong oxidizing properties of sulfuric acid and the reducing properties of ferrous ions some of the fe2 was oxidized to fe3 during the experiment and the oxidation of fe2 also occurred in the real formation the chemical reaction is a dynamic equilibrium process therefore in this study the fe2 and h ions produced by biodegradation were used to quantify the increase in the pore water conductivity and to roughly estimate the quality of degraded benzene which has a certain reference value the actual mass of benzene degraded should be greater than the calculated value the working curve of the relationship between the concentration of h and fe2 and the conductivity of the solution is shown in fig 9 when the concentration of h and fe2 is greater than 0 6 mmol l the conductivity exhibits a very good linear correlation with the concentration of h and fe2 fitting formula y 0 063x 0 0321 where x is the concentration of h and fe2 and y is the conductivity of the solution the significance of the working curve shown in fig 9 is that it allows us to calculate the increase in the h and fe2 concentration of the pore water based on the increase in the pore water conductivity 3 3 3 hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the by product plume the boreholes near the pollution source area are densely spaced and the geochemical data are relatively abundant the area with obvious low resistivity anomalies near the source area was selected to estimate the amount of hydrocarbon degradation and the total amount of tphs the area is 39 m long and 16 m wide it is located 50 89 m from lines df3 and df4 and 19 35 m from line df7 and it has a depth of 5 m 1 estimation of the measured tph content the size of the selected area is 39 16 5 m and its total volume is 3120 m3 the average density of the silty clay in this 5 m deep interval is 1840 kg m3 the average value of the 21 measured tphs within this 5 m deep interval in the study area was 22 005 mg kg based on the above data the total amount of tphs in the area is estimated to be 126 326 kg 2 the amount of benzene degradation corresponding to the increase in pore water conductivity the groundwater conductivity of several unpolluted points around the site is 0 056 0 067 s m with an average value of 0 060 s m the contour map of the pore water conductivity is shown in fig 10 the area where the conductivity of the pore water is lower than 0 060 s m is considered that the conductivity has not changed due to the biodegradation process in the calculation process the conductivity values of pore water in these areas were treated as 0 060 s m its significance is that it illustrates the increase in the pore water conductivity due to degradation the selected study area was divided into four model boxes a d to calculate the amount of degradation the position of each area is shown by the yellow dotted line in the figure the widths of a and b are 11 m located within 19 30 m of line df7 and the widths of c and d are 5 m located within 30 35 m of line df7 the specific parameters and calculation results are shown in table 4 3 contamination area assessment in the selected study area the total amount of tph estimated from the multiple measured tph values was 126 326 kg the pore water conductivity in the selected study area was calculated and it was estimated that the by product plume observed using ert was produced by the degradation of 3 572 kg of benzene furthermore the hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the by product plume accounted for about 2 8 of the hydrocarbon content of the selected study area however the actual amount of degradation should be higher because the degradation process involving liquid phase tea was ignored in this calculation in addition the small scale of the fe2 was not sufficient to generate the high conductivity characteristics observed using ert which will also lead to an underestimation of the amount of degradation the geochemical conceptual model of contaminated sites should cover the complex overlap of multiple biogeochemical processes related to hydrocarbon mineralization this study is based on a conceptual model of the special characteristics and geochemical constraints to reproduce the hydrocarbon mineralization during iron reduction in the field it is characterized in that the groundwater level is less than 2m from the surface the clay content exceeds 45 the permeability is low and an anaerobic environment is easy to form the contaminated site is rich in chlorite minerals high in iron oxides and limited availability of other teas the high concentration of fe2 in the source area and the large amount of iron oxide in the aquifer indicate that iron reduction is the main reaction related to the degradation of hydrocarbons mediated by microorganisms therefore the hydrocarbon mineralization involved in oxygen and other solid phase teas has been simplified and ignored in the quantitative study of this site volatilization is one of the important ways for the natural attenuation of hydrocarbons the volatilization rate of hydrocarbons depends on its thermodynamic state and physical properties such as solubility in water vapor pressure henry s law constant and diffusion coefficient etc lee et al 2004 voutsas et al 2005 the greater the concentration of the solute in the aqueous solution the greater the volatility when the concentration of the solute decreases the volatilization will become slower pankow et al 1996 in addition most of the hydrocarbons are collected below the groundwater level and the evaporation of hydrocarbons can be ignored under trapped conditions chao et al 2005 when studying the natural attenuation process of hydrocarbons in contaminated sites the impact of evaporation should be considered and the remaining part of hydrocarbons in the soil can be consumed by reduced iron however in this study the ert data and geochemical data acquired the contaminated site s information in a transient state and the quantitative relationship between by product plume and resistivity distribution will not be affected by the evaporation of hydrocarbons evaluating the status of an aged polluted area requires a variety of parameters such as the source of the lnapls the source of the tea whether the tea will be exhausted and information related to the microorganisms the collection of these data and information requires a variety of technical collaborations and a large amount of time and money which may not be achieved in field investigations however in this study a rough estimate was attained based on a small amount of discrete geochemical data and ert measurement results the results of this study demonstrate the clear geochemical significance of low resistivity anomalies in the survey of aged hydrocarbon contaminated sites and they establish a quantitative relationship between the solute concentration of the by product plume and the electrical conductivity based on the ert surveys of aged hydrocarbon contaminated sites the three dimensional spatial distribution and quantitative solute concentration of underground by product plumes can be obtained the quantitative information about the by product plume contains information related to the biodegradation these research results convert the parameters related to the biodegradation assessment into hydrological issues multiple ert measurements can greatly reduce the workload and cost of assessing information related to microbial degradation and assessments of natural attenuation rates will be more accurate 4 conclusion in this study a small amount of discrete geochemical data and ert detection results for the study area were used to describe the distribution of the hydrocarbon degradation by product plumes a biogeochemical model of hydrocarbon weathering was proposed and the relationship between the pore water resistivity and hydrocarbon degradation was established based on the fitting of the groundwater resistivity data collected in situ and the bulk resistivity measured using ert a suitable petrophysical relationship was determined for the study area the pore water resistivity was calculated using the fitted formula to characterize the contribution of the electrolytic conduction the abnormally low pore water resistivity area was the distribution area of the byproduct plume the geochemical conceptual model established based on contaminated site with special characteristics and geochemical constraints is that iron reduction is the main reaction related to microbial mediated hydrocarbon degradation the conceptual model of geochemistry is based on the limited conditions of other electron acceptors iron oxides are abundant in aquifers and are preferentially used by microorganisms in an anaerobic environment these factors make it reasonable and effective to ignore the biodegradation process involved in other electron acceptors although it will cause the calculated benzene degradation to be slightly underestimated the mineralogy and fe2 distribution characteristics of the groundwater indicate that iron reduction was the main reaction in the microbial mediated hydrocarbon degradation the main reason for the decrease in pore water resistivity was the by products fe2 and h produced by the hydrocarbon degradation the results of the electrochemical experiments revealed that the concentration of fe2 and h in the groundwater exhibits a linear correlation with the conductivity the part of the study area near the source area was selected to estimate the hydrocarbon degradation that produced the by product plume the calculation results indicate that the hydrocarbon degradation corresponding to the by product plume is about 2 8 of the hydrocarbon content of the study area the comparison between the two improves our understanding of the natural attenuation state of hydrocarbon contaminated sites understanding the natural attenuation status of hydrocarbon contaminated sites can be helpful in assessing the feasibility and cost effectiveness of future remediation options based on the ert results and the soil physical model the water content water conductivity porosity clay content and hydraulic conductivity can be quantitatively predicted providing the full spatial parameter information required to construct a quantitative analysis model which makes predicting the natural attenuation of hydrocarbon contaminated sites more accurate credit authorship contribution statement shuai shao conceptualization methodology writing original draft funding acquisition xiujun guo supervision project

4717,the geochemical compositions of cave drip water and speleothems such as mg sr mg ca sr ca and 87sr 86sr are considered to be responsive to changes in the local climate and hydrological conditions systematic monitoring was performed on the mg and sr contents mg sr ratio and 87sr 86sr of soil soil water cave drip water and the active speleothems as in furong cave in chongqing southwest china during 2009 2018 a d the results were interpreted in conjunction with the changes in the 87sr 86sr ratios to explore the main sources and controlling factors of sr and other trace elements in drip water 1 due to the decrease in winter and spring rainfall the residence time of water in the soil was prolonged which resulted in increasing of mg and sr concentrations and 87sr 86sr ratios in soil water it indicates that the trace element contents of soil water reflect seasonal changes of the rainfall 2 the mg and sr contents were higher in drip water than in the soil water as well as the 87sr 86sr ratios of the cave drip water was closer to that of the bedrock which indicated that the overlying bedrock was the main source of the trace elements in the drip water and the speleothems in furong cave 3 mg contents and mg sr ratios in drip water and as showed decreasing trend which may be affected by the shorter water rock contact time due to the increasing annual rainfall in the monitoring period 4 the sr contents in as might be affected by the growth rate of as because of the similar increasing trend 5 the mg and sr contents and the mg sr ratios of the drip water and as did not exhibit seasonal variations due to the mixing of the fissure water and complex hydrology condition of the overlying bedrock however the geochemical indexes mg and mg sr ratio showed an opposite trend to the annual rainfall variation in short this study highlights the responses of the changes of mg sr contents and mg sr ratios of drip water and as to the rainfall on the multi year timescale which contributes critical insights into the paleoclimate interpretation of proxies of speleothems in the cave with hundreds of meters thick bedrock keywords karst hydrology soil water drip water active speleothems mg sr 87sr 86sr 1 introduction when rainfall permeates through the soil it dissolves co2 to form carbonic acid which in turn dissolves the carbonate in the soil and bedrock drip

et al 1996 or in caves with large entrances and the cave environment sensitive response to seasonal changes of temperature and humidity outside johnson et al 2006 the element ratios mg ca and sr ca of drip water and speleothems can respond to seasonal variations of local temperature and rainfall however with regard to the caves covered by the bedrock hundreds of meters thick a large amount of old water is stored in the complex bedrock fissures of the epikarst over the cave the surface water is mixed in the process of infiltration or due to the long flow path the precipitation cannot form drip water in time it has been assumed that water geochemistry variations due to seasonal changes in rainfall are unlikely to occur karmann et al 2007 nevertheless in order to use element ratios in speleothems from relatively deep caves to reconstruct paleoclimate and paleoenvironment it is concerned to know whether a climate signal exists in the trace elements of drip water how trace element concentrations vary in soil water drip water and active speleothem as well as what the time scale of climate information change is recorded cave monitoring is an important method to investigate the deposition mechanisms and factors influencing the trace elements in drip water and speleothems fairchild and treble 2009 previous studies have suggested that factors such as the external environment outside cave air temperature and rainfall the residence time of seepage water in the host rocks pcp prior calcite precipitation along seepage water flow paths and the chemical composition of soil and

variations of the contents of mg and sr and the ratios of mg sr of soil soil water drip water and active speleothems have been systematically analyzed in the paper the main sources of the trace elements in speleothems are explored according to the changes of 87sr 86sr values from soil to drip water which is helpful to analyze the response mechanism of 87sr 86sr values of soil water and drip water to meteoric precipitation we focus on discussing the relationship between the precipitation soil epikarst hydrology and variations of the contents of mg sr and mg sr ratios in soil water drip water and as and exploring the indexes response mechanisms to the changes of the surface environment at the multi year time scale decades of monitoring data will help us to clarify the climate and

located in the wulong district chongqing city southwest china fig 1 a the cave entrance is 480 m above sea level the main hall is about 2700 m long and is 30 50 m wide and high furong cave was developed in middle cambrian limestone and dolomite formations the region has a subtropical humid monsoon climate with the annual mean temperature and rainfall of 17 8 c and 1 064 mm from 2009 to 2018 respectively about 70 80 of the precipitation is concentrated between may and october li et al 2011 in summer the temperature is often high maximum temperature 40 c due to subtropical high over the western pacific the surface soil overlying the cave is yellow subtropical mountain soil which is 20 100 cm thick the vegetation covering the cave are dominated by trees and shrubs li et al 2012 3 sample collection and analysis 3 1 sample collection on both sides of the valley above the main hall of furong cave five soil profiles sa se fig 1b were chosen to collect soil samples from top to bottom at 5 cm intervals except for intervals of 10 cm in the sc profile a total of 8 bedrock samples were collected at the bottom of the sa se profiles a water collection tray made of pe was placed at the bottom of the soil profile to collect the soil water the detailed methods of the soil water collection were described in li et al 2013 the soil water was collected in may october i e the period in which the regional rainfall is concentrated li et al 2013 drip water in the main hall of furong cave was collected each month below six drip sites mp1 mp5 mp9 as shown in fig 1c li et al 2011 li and li 2018 pe polyethylene bottles 50 ml were immersed in 1 1 hcl for 24 h washed with deionized water and then dried before collecting soil water the soil water samples were acidized with 0 1 ml of

showed that the mean values 1σ of mg and sr contents and the mg sr ratios were rainfall soil water drip water but the maximum content of mg and the mg sr ratios are in rock then in soil and the minimum is in as although the maximum content of sr is in rock but the minimum is in soil the reasons were analyzed in section 5 1 there were no seasonal variations of mg and sr contents in the soil water fig 2 a and 2b as well as the mg sr ratios fig 2c nevertheless the mg and sr contents of the soil water are significantly positively correlated r 0 72 n 173 p 0 01 fig 4a indicating that the dissolution of soil mg and sr may have been affected by the same factors from 2009 to 2018 the mg sr contents and the mg sr ratios of drip water exhibited similar trends at different drip sites respectively fig 2d 2e and 2f the range of mg was 6 66 47 65 mg l table 1 and the monthly mean mg contents showed an overall decrease trend fig 3 a as well as the monthly mean of mg sr ratios fig 3c during the whole monitoring period the variation range of sr concentration was between 0 021 0 077 mg l table 1 and the trend line of the monthly mean sr contents remained stable fig 3b it is worth noting that the precipitation in the same period showed increasing trend fig 2g the mg and sr contents of the as in furong cave underwent a two stage change 1 from 2009 to 2013 the mg contents gradually decreased mean content of 6162 1081 μg g while the sr contents continuously increased mean content of 45 57 15 98 μg g 2 from 2014 to 2016 both the mg and sr contents remained relatively stable mean mg content of 7327 1314 μg g and mean sr content of 58 17 12 29 μg g fig 5 a 5b the mg sr ratios decreased during 2009 2013 mean ratio of 166 26 61 98 while the ratios were relatively stable around a mean of 134 44 36 68 during 2014 2016 fig 5c 5 discussion 5 1 main factors affecting the contents of mg and sr in soil water the overlying bedrock of furong cave is mainly composed of limestone and dolomite which are rich in mg and poor in sr table 1 the soil was developed from the bedrock as water infiltrates into the soil a large number of elements in the soil are dissolved and lost to the soil water thereby resulting in the lower mg and sr contents of the soil compared with those of the bedrock table 1 mg is more chemically active than sr and soil clay particles exhibit strong sr adsorption solecki and michalik 2006 six types of limestone dissolution experiment showed that as the solution concentration of mg and sr increased the dissolution rate of mg was faster than that of sr pracný et al 2019 therefore after the surface rainwater infiltrates into the soil the mg and sr contents of the soil water increase but more mg is dissolved than sr over the same time interval thereby leading to an increase in the mg sr ratio of the soil water table 1 the soil temperature and soil co2 concentration exhibit seasonal trends similar to that of the air temperature li et al 2013 li and li 2018 the mean mg and sr concentration of the soil water in march april was 14 76 8 35 mg l and 0 023 0 012 mg l respectively while in may october the mean content of them was 12 80 6 62 mg l and 0 021 0 009 mg l respectively it has been known that the amount of soil water was in good agreement with the amount of rainfall li et al 2013 during november to the following february there was no soil water being collected fig 2a 2b attributing to the less rainfall li and li 2018 fig 3f in the seasons of low rainfall infiltration water may stagnate for a long time in the soil porosities which contributes to dissolving more co2 into the soil water and increasing the mineralization when precipitation increases more water infiltrates into soil and may lead to flushing trough the porosities therefore the soil water collected in march april had mixed the water which was held up in the winter with more mg and sr contents from may to october more rainfall results in less contact time between soil with infiltration water which decreases the concentrations of mg and sr in the soil water according to the analysis results of pearson correlation there is a good positive correlation between mg and sr in soil water fig 4a pca analysis showed that two main factors controlled the content of mg and sr in soil water one of which accounted for 86 table 3 residence time may be the most important factor affecting the contents of mg and sr in soil water 5 2 analysis of control factors affecting mg and sr contents in drip water the spring water above furong cave was characterized by δ13cdic of 12 to 13 in summer and 5 to 6 in winter which are in phase with the wet and dry climate season li et al 2011 in other words spring water can quickly respond to the change of precipitation the mean contents of ca mg and sr in spring water were all higher than those in the soil water but lower than those in the drip water xiang et al 2011 it is suggested that the infiltration water dissolves the elements from the limestone when it flows through the epikarst but the contact time between spring water and the bedrock is short therefore in the process of the infiltration water seeping into the fissures of the deeper bedrocks more mg and sr are dissolved which results to increasing the mg and sr contents and the mg sr ratios of the drip water table 1 the air temperature in furong cave is 16 0 16 3 c throughout the year which is similar to the local annual mean temperature li et al 2011 therefore as the fissure water flows through the bedrock overlying furong cave the effect of the temperature change on the element contents of the fissure water is negligible rainfall is another local environmental factor which is often taken into account in the process of fissure water dissolving the bedrock fairchild et al 2000 however there are no seasonal variations of mg and sr contents in drip water as well as mg sr ratios fig 2d 2e and 2f according the previous study in furong cave many geochemical indicators of drip water such as δ18o δ13cdic mg ca and drip rate lack seasonal variation due to the complicated hydrology conditions over the cave li et al 2011 li and li 2018 zhang and li 2019 which have the function of regulating and storing fissure water the fissure water are mixed in the bedrock resulting in the seasonal signal of precipitation being indistinct nevertheless the drip rate responded to the annual rainfall zhang and li 2019 when the annual rainfall increased gradually the drip rate increased as well which shortened the residence time of the fissure water in the bedrock and in turn weakened the bedrock dissolution it explained the decreasing trend of the mean mg contents and mg sr ratios of the drip water fig 3a 3c with the increasing rainfall during 2009 to 2018 fig 2g although there is a positive correlation between mg and sr of drip water r 0 45 fig 4b the decreasing trend of the mean sr content was not obvious as that of mg fig 3b only when the annual precipitation increased significantly such as in 2015 and 2016 the content of sr decreased as that of mg fig 2d 2e 2f in addition pca analysis also found that the most important factor affecting mg and sr accounted for 72 3 of two main factors in drip water which was lower than in soil water table 3 it indicated that except the annual precipitation the complicated hydrology condition in the epikarst overlying furong cave may have an important impact on mg and sr in drip water 5 3 variation characteristics and influencing factors of mg and sr contents in as the mg contents and mg sr ratios of the as decreased from 2009 to 2013 while sr contents increased during 2014 to 2016 mg sr and mg sr ratios all remained relatively stable fig 5a 5b and 5c though there is a positive correlation between mg and sr in as the correlation coefficient is lower than that in soil water and drip water fig 4 pca analysis showed that the most important factor synchronously affecting mg and sr accounted for 68 9 of the whole influencing factors table 3 the contents of mg and sr in speleothem are mainly controlled by the precipitation process of calcite in addition to the influence of mg and sr content in drip water the environment in the cave such as humidity temperature pco2 dripping rate and the growth rate of speleothem all have influence on mg and sr entering into the calcium carbonate crystal paquette and reeder 1995 goede et al 1998 fairchild et al 2000 2006 hellstrom and mcculloch 2000 tooth and fairchild 2003 treble et al 2003 mcdermott 2004 johnson et al 2006 even for a given factor the influences on element mg and sr are different for example temperature has an effect on mg but has little effect on sr gascoyne 1983 huang and fairchild 2001 experiments have shown that the sr partition coefficient ksr is strongly affected by the growth rate of calcium carbonate reeder and grams 1987 paquette and reeder 1995 stephenson et al 2008 gabitov et al 2014 confirmed through experiments and gem growth entrapment model simulations that ksr increased by a factor of six and kmg decreased by a factor of three as the calcium carbonate crystallization rate increased from 0 001 nm s to 4 nm s therefore the correlation coefficient between mg and sr in as was 0 38 which might be related to the comprehensive effect of multiple factors fig 4c the temperature and humidity in furong cave are stable all year around li et al 2011 however the pco2 in the cave has seasonal variation li and li 2018 the average growth rate of six as showed no seasonal characteristics but slowly increasing trend from 2009 to 2016 fig 5d which is corresponded with the rainfall fig 5e in section 5 2 it has been discussed that the decreasing trend of mg in drip water is related to the shortened water rock contact time with the increasing precipitation the reduction of mg in as might be affected by the content of mg in drip water in addition with the increase of growth rate more sr and less mg may enter into the calcium carbonate crystals which resulted in the decrease of mg sr ratios in as fig 5a 5b 5c 5 4 isotopic tracing with 87sr 86sr values the sr contents and 87sr 86sr ratios of speleothems are commonly used in paleoclimate research banner et al 1996 goede et al 1998 bar matthews et al 1999 verheyden et al 2000 frumkin and stein 2004 the 87sr 86sr values of stalagmites can be used to reveal the impacts of sr sources on the 87sr 86sr values of cave drip water faure and mensing 2005 studies have shown that the overlying soil bedrock dust materials and ocean spray are the main sources of sr banner et al 1996 goede et al 1998 ayalon et al 1999 bar matthews et al 1999 verheyden et al 2000 frumkin and stein 2004 li et al 2005 shand et al 2009 furong cave is located in the mainland of china about 850 km away from the nearest ocean south china sea therefore the influence of ocean spray is negligible moreover the daba mountains in the north and east of sichuan basin block the sand coming from the northwest which results in the study region less affected by the sand additionally agricultural origin fertilizers may change usually decrease the isotope signature of sr böhlke and horan 2000 jiang et al 2009 jiang 2011 according to our investigation the upper of furong cave is in a relatively primitive state covered by dense vegetation and with little interference from human activities given that the sr contents mean of 0 008 mg l of local rainwater are much lower than those of the soil and soil water table 1 only the soil and bedrock were considered when investigating the factors influencing the 87sr 86sr values of drip water the mean 87sr 86sr value of the overlying soil of furong cave was 0 72805 0 00222 which is higher than the mean value of the underlying bedrock 0 70958 0 00006 fig 6 the study area has a subtropical humid monsoon climate with high temperatures and rainfall in summer and dense vegetation and large amounts of co2 and other acidic substances are produced by soil respiration and microbial decomposition li et al 2012 li and li 2018 this results in strong chemical weathering of the soil and bedrock yang et al 2001 proposed that the soil 87sr 86sr values reflected the intensity of the chemical weathering with the ratios increasing with increasing weathering intensity therefore the sr supplied by soil that has undergone chemical weathering has higher 87sr 86sr values compared to that of the surrounding limestone li et al 2005 the 87sr 86sr values of all of the soil water and drip water fell between those of the soil and the bedrock fig 6 when rainwater infiltrates into the soil it not only dissolves soil debris but also transports limestone debris with low 87sr 86sr ratios away banner et al 1994 borg and banner 1996 resulting in lower soil water 87sr 86sr values compared with those of the soil and bedrock the mean 87sr 86sr value of the cave drip water at drip sites mp1 and mp2 was closer to the mean bedrock 87sr 86sr value than the mean soil water 87sr 86sr value table 2 fig 6 it is supposed that the evolution of 87sr 86sr ratios of groundwater from soil characteristics to that of bedrock reflects the occurrence of water rock interaction which is related to the residence time of fissure water in bedrock musgrove and banner 2004 oster et al 2010 wong et al 2011 wortham et al 2017 the overlying bedrock of furong cave is 300 500 m thick which leads to longer water rock interaction in other words the residence time of fissure water in the bedrock is the main factor affecting the trace element composition of the drip water 5 5 environmental implications of 87sr 86sr values the mean 87sr 86sr value of the overlying soil of furong cave differs from that of the bedrock by 0 01847 table 2 while the 87sr 86sr of the soil water and drip water are between that of the soil and that of the bedrock fig 6 which reflects the change of the residence time of infiltration water in the soil and bedrock musgrove and banner 2004 shand et al 2007 wong and banner 2010 wong et al 2011 wortham et al 2017 comprehensive studies on the 87sr 86sr value in modern stream waters fast drip waters and slow drip waters indicated that the faster the velocity the lower sr isotope ratio banner et al 1996 according to the values in table 2 the multi month mean 87sr 86sr ratios of the soil water in soil profile se in march may and june september were 0 71700 0 00114 and 0 71242 0 00072 respectively the overlying soil water of furong cave mainly originates from rainfall and thus it quickly responds to the changes of rainfall li et al 2013 from november to the following february the soil water dries up due to the reduction in rainfall therefore the soil water in march may contains infiltrated water that has stayed in the soil for a long time and more detrital materials with high 87sr 86sr ratio were dissolved in soil water the soil water in june september mainly originates from the rainfall in the same month resulting in the lower soil water interaction time and a reduction of 87sr 86sr values in soil water the cave drip water from sites mp1 and mp2 has similar 87sr 86sr values which remained stable throughout the year without obvious seasonal variations table 2 due to the limited number of 87sr 86sr measurements for the cave drip water and the short monitoring time march december 2015 the regular 87sr 86sr pattern of the cave drip water cannot be determined in detail accordingly the relationship between the 87sr 86sr of the cave drip water and the amount of rainfall is not addressed in this study 6 conclusions during 2009 2018 the contents of mg and sr mg sr ratios and 87sr 86sr values from the soil and soil water overlying the cave to the drip water and as in furong cave southwest china were monitored it is found that the trace element composition of the cave drip water mainly originates from the bedrock basing on the increase of the mg and sr contents from the soil water to the cave drip water as well as the 87sr 86sr values of the cave drip water closing to that of the bedrock there were no seasonal variations of the mg and sr contents and mg sr ratios in drip water and as which are related to the complex karst system in the bedrock with hundreds of meters thickness however mg contents and mg sr ratios responded to the change of regional rainfall on the multi year timescale figs 2 3 and 5 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

4717,the geochemical compositions of cave drip water and speleothems such as mg sr mg ca sr ca and 87sr 86sr are considered to be responsive to changes in the local climate and hydrological conditions systematic monitoring was performed on the mg and sr contents mg sr ratio and 87sr 86sr of soil soil water cave drip water and the active speleothems as in furong cave in chongqing southwest china during 2009 2018 a d the results were interpreted in conjunction with the changes in the 87sr 86sr ratios to explore the main sources and controlling factors of sr and other trace elements in drip water 1 due to the decrease in winter and spring rainfall the residence time of water in the soil was prolonged which resulted in increasing of mg and sr concentrations and 87sr 86sr ratios in soil water it indicates that the trace element contents of soil water reflect seasonal changes of the rainfall 2 the mg and sr contents were higher in drip water than in the soil water as well as the 87sr 86sr ratios of the cave drip water was closer to that of the bedrock which indicated that the overlying bedrock was the main source of the trace elements in the drip water and the speleothems in furong cave 3 mg contents and mg sr ratios in drip water and as showed decreasing trend which may be affected by the shorter water rock contact time due to the increasing annual rainfall in the monitoring period 4 the sr contents in as might be affected by the growth rate of as because of the similar increasing trend 5 the mg and sr contents and the mg sr ratios of the drip water and as did not exhibit seasonal variations due to the mixing of the fissure water and complex hydrology condition of the overlying bedrock however the geochemical indexes mg and mg sr ratio showed an opposite trend to the annual rainfall variation in short this study highlights the responses of the changes of mg sr contents and mg sr ratios of drip water and as to the rainfall on the multi year timescale which contributes critical insights into the paleoclimate interpretation of proxies of speleothems in the cave with hundreds of meters thick bedrock keywords karst hydrology soil water drip water active speleothems mg sr 87sr 86sr 1 introduction when rainfall permeates through the soil it dissolves co2 to form carbonic acid which in turn dissolves the carbonate in the soil and bedrock drip water contains a variety of elements coming from the soil and bedrock the information of environment is captured by the trace elements in drip water and speleothems in karst caves fairchild et al 2006 fairchild and treble 2009 the mg and sr concentrations and the mg ca and sr ca ratios in drip water and speleothems are often used to explore climate and environmental changes hellstrom and mcculloch 2000 mcmillan et al 2005 li et al 2005 johnson et al 2006 cruz et al 2007 griffiths et al 2010 wong et al 2011 oster et al 2012 studies tend to interpret possible annual to sub annual climate signals in mg ca sr ca and ba ca of speleothems roberts et al 1998 fairchild et al 2001 treble et al 2003 mcdermott 2004 it is possible that in caves covered by the bedrock tens of meters thick bar matthews et al 1996 or in caves with large entrances and the cave environment sensitive response to seasonal changes of temperature and humidity outside johnson et al 2006 the element ratios mg ca and sr ca of drip water and speleothems can respond to seasonal variations of local temperature and rainfall however with regard to the caves covered by the bedrock hundreds of meters thick a large amount of old water is stored in the complex bedrock fissures of the epikarst over the cave the surface water is mixed in the process of infiltration or due to the long flow path the precipitation cannot form drip water in time it has been assumed that water geochemistry variations due to seasonal changes in rainfall are unlikely to occur karmann et al 2007 nevertheless in order to use element ratios in speleothems from relatively deep caves to reconstruct paleoclimate and paleoenvironment it is concerned to know whether a climate signal exists in the trace elements of drip water how trace element concentrations vary in soil water drip water and active speleothem as well as what the time scale of climate information change is recorded cave monitoring is an important method to investigate the deposition mechanisms and factors influencing the trace elements in drip water and speleothems fairchild and treble 2009 previous studies have suggested that factors such as the external environment outside cave air temperature and rainfall the residence time of seepage water in the host rocks pcp prior calcite precipitation along seepage water flow paths and the chemical composition of soil and bed rock change the element ratios of drip water forming speleothems fairchild et al 2000 huang et al 2001 tooth and fairchild 2003 musgrove and banner 2004 fairchild et al 2006 wong et al 2011 huang et al 2016 zhang and li 2019 when performing a comprehensive study on a karst system in addition to monitoring the internal cave environment it is necessary to take into account the factors of local rainfall on recharge and on dissolution and precipitation processes occurring in karst systems smart and friederich 1987 fairchild et al 2000 this article provides the cave monitoring data performing in furong cave which is covered by host rock with 300 500 m thick li et al 2011 in southwest china from 2009 to 2018 a d after here all the years mentioned in this article refer to the year of a d the variations of the contents of mg and sr and the ratios of mg sr of soil soil water drip water and active speleothems have been systematically analyzed in the paper the main sources of the trace elements in speleothems are explored according to the changes of 87sr 86sr values from soil to drip water which is helpful to analyze the response mechanism of 87sr 86sr values of soil water and drip water to meteoric precipitation we focus on discussing the relationship between the precipitation soil epikarst hydrology and variations of the contents of mg sr and mg sr ratios in soil water drip water and as and exploring the indexes response mechanisms to the changes of the surface environment at the multi year time scale decades of monitoring data will help us to clarify the climate and environment significance of various proxy indexes in stalagmites from the deep caves and reconstruct paleoclimate quantitatively 2 overview of the study area furong cave 29 13 44 n 107 54 13 e is located in the wulong district chongqing city southwest china fig 1 a the cave entrance is 480 m above sea level the main hall is about 2700 m long and is 30 50 m wide and high furong cave was developed in middle cambrian limestone and dolomite formations the region has a subtropical humid monsoon climate with the annual mean temperature and rainfall of 17 8 c and 1 064 mm from 2009 to 2018 respectively about 70 80 of the precipitation is concentrated between may and october li et al 2011 in summer the temperature is often high maximum temperature 40 c due to subtropical high over the western pacific the surface soil overlying the cave is yellow subtropical mountain soil which is 20 100 cm thick the vegetation covering the cave are dominated by trees and shrubs li et al 2012 3 sample collection and analysis 3 1 sample collection on both sides of the valley above the main hall of furong cave five soil profiles sa se fig 1b were chosen to collect soil samples from top to bottom at 5 cm intervals except for intervals of 10 cm in the sc profile a total of 8 bedrock samples were collected at the bottom of the sa se profiles a water collection tray made of pe was placed at the bottom of the soil profile to collect the soil water the detailed methods of the soil water collection were described in li et al 2013 the soil water was collected in may october i e the period in which the regional rainfall is concentrated li et al 2013 drip water in the main hall of furong cave was collected each month below six drip sites mp1 mp5 mp9 as shown in fig 1c li et al 2011 li and li 2018 pe polyethylene bottles 50 ml were immersed in 1 1 hcl for 24 h washed with deionized water and then dried before collecting soil water the soil water samples were acidized with 0 1 ml of 7 m hno3 to maintain the ion activity li et al 2013 a glass slide that had been cleaned as pe bottles was placed below each drip site to precipitate active speleothem as samples and was replaced every three months the as samples were taken back to the laboratory and air dried naturally then weighed by subtracting the weight of blank glass slide from the total weight the mean as deposition weight was obtained 3 2 methods 3 2 1 samples analysis methods we pre processed the solid samples e g soil bedrock and as samples by hf hclo4 heating digestion method samples were digested by using a mixture including 22 5 m hf 12 38 m hclo4 6 m hcl and 14 m hno3 to dissolve the solid particles completely then the samples were diluted with 0 1 m hcl in pe bottles for the analysis of element concentration lu 1999 the treated solution and the soil water and drip water were analyzed to determine the contents of ca mg and sr using an optima 2100dv inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes perkin elmer usa with the detection limit of 1 μg l and the relative error of less than 2 at the geochemistry and isotope laboratory school of geographical sciences southwest university bedrock soil samples were weighed into the teflon beakers and dissolved completely using conventional hf hno3 hcl dissolution techniques in closed beakers soil water and drip water were acidified with concentrated nitric acid sr was purified with sr spec resin exchange columns following the procedure described in jung et al 2019 the 87sr 86sr ratios were analyzed using a multi collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer mc icp ms thermo electron finnigan neptune at the department of geosciences national taiwan university the measured 87sr 86sr ratios were normalized to 86sr 88sr 0 1194 to correct for mass fractionation jung et al 2019 3 2 2 data analysis methods pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation of mg and sr in soil water drip water and as respectively the correlation coefficients between mg and sr are showed in the fig 4 principal components analysis pca was conducted to explore the driving factors of mg and sr changes in soil water n 173 drip water n 643 and as n 110 this method does not require normal distributions for large data sets kotowski et al 2020 the parameters are provided in table 3 4 results according to table 1 it was showed that the mean values 1σ of mg and sr contents and the mg sr ratios were rainfall soil water drip water but the maximum content of mg and the mg sr ratios are in rock then in soil and the minimum is in as although the maximum content of sr is in rock but the minimum is in soil the reasons were analyzed in section 5 1 there were no seasonal variations of mg and sr contents in the soil water fig 2 a and 2b as well as the mg sr ratios fig 2c nevertheless the mg and sr contents of the soil water are significantly positively correlated r 0 72 n 173 p 0 01 fig 4a indicating that the dissolution of soil mg and sr may have been affected by the same factors from 2009 to 2018 the mg sr contents and the mg sr ratios of drip water exhibited similar trends at different drip sites respectively fig 2d 2e and 2f the range of mg was 6 66 47 65 mg l table 1 and the monthly mean mg contents showed an overall decrease trend fig 3 a as well as the monthly mean of mg sr ratios fig 3c during the whole monitoring period the variation range of sr concentration was between 0 021 0 077 mg l table 1 and the trend line of the monthly mean sr contents remained stable fig 3b it is worth noting that the precipitation in the same period showed increasing trend fig 2g the mg and sr contents of the as in furong cave underwent a two stage change 1 from 2009 to 2013 the mg contents gradually decreased mean content of 6162 1081 μg g while the sr contents continuously increased mean content of 45 57 15 98 μg g 2 from 2014 to 2016 both the mg and sr contents remained relatively stable mean mg content of 7327 1314 μg g and mean sr content of 58 17 12 29 μg g fig 5 a 5b the mg sr ratios decreased during 2009 2013 mean ratio of 166 26 61 98 while the ratios were relatively stable around a mean of 134 44 36 68 during 2014 2016 fig 5c 5 discussion 5 1 main factors affecting the contents of mg and sr in soil water the overlying bedrock of furong cave is mainly composed of limestone and dolomite which are rich in mg and poor in sr table 1 the soil was developed from the bedrock as water infiltrates into the soil a large number of elements in the soil are dissolved and lost to the soil water thereby resulting in the lower mg and sr contents of the soil compared with those of the bedrock table 1 mg is more chemically active than sr and soil clay particles exhibit strong sr adsorption solecki and michalik 2006 six types of limestone dissolution experiment showed that as the solution concentration of mg and sr increased the dissolution rate of mg was faster than that of sr pracný et al 2019 therefore after the surface rainwater infiltrates into the soil the mg and sr contents of the soil water increase but more mg is dissolved than sr over the same time interval thereby leading to an increase in the mg sr ratio of the soil water table 1 the soil temperature and soil co2 concentration exhibit seasonal trends similar to that of the air temperature li et al 2013 li and li 2018 the mean mg and sr concentration of the soil water in march april was 14 76 8 35 mg l and 0 023 0 012 mg l respectively while in may october the mean content of them was 12 80 6 62 mg l and 0 021 0 009 mg l respectively it has been known that the amount of soil water was in good agreement with the amount of rainfall li et al 2013 during november to the following february there was no soil water being collected fig 2a 2b attributing to the less rainfall li and li 2018 fig 3f in the seasons of low rainfall infiltration water may stagnate for a long time in the soil porosities which contributes to dissolving more co2 into the soil water and increasing the mineralization when precipitation increases more water infiltrates into soil and may lead to flushing trough the porosities therefore the soil water collected in march april had mixed the water which was held up in the winter with more mg and sr contents from may to october more rainfall results in less contact time between soil with infiltration water which decreases the concentrations of mg and sr in the soil water according to the analysis results of pearson correlation there is a good positive correlation between mg and sr in soil water fig 4a pca analysis showed that two main factors controlled the content of mg and sr in soil water one of which accounted for 86 table 3 residence time may be the most important factor affecting the contents of mg and sr in soil water 5 2 analysis of control factors affecting mg and sr contents in drip water the spring water above furong cave was characterized by δ13cdic of 12 to 13 in summer and 5 to 6 in winter which are in phase with the wet and dry climate season li et al 2011 in other words spring water can quickly respond to the change of precipitation the mean contents of ca mg and sr in spring water were all higher than those in the soil water but lower than those in the drip water xiang et al 2011 it is suggested that the infiltration water dissolves the elements from the limestone when it flows through the epikarst but the contact time between spring water and the bedrock is short therefore in the process of the infiltration water seeping into the fissures of the deeper bedrocks more mg and sr are dissolved which results to increasing the mg and sr contents and the mg sr ratios of the drip water table 1 the air temperature in furong cave is 16 0 16 3 c throughout the year which is similar to the local annual mean temperature li et al 2011 therefore as the fissure water flows through the bedrock overlying furong cave the effect of the temperature change on the element contents of the fissure water is negligible rainfall is another local environmental factor which is often taken into account in the process of fissure water dissolving the bedrock fairchild et al 2000 however there are no seasonal variations of mg and sr contents in drip water as well as mg sr ratios fig 2d 2e and 2f according the previous study in furong cave many geochemical indicators of drip water such as δ18o δ13cdic mg ca and drip rate lack seasonal variation due to the complicated hydrology conditions over the cave li et al 2011 li and li 2018 zhang and li 2019 which have the function of regulating and storing fissure water the fissure water are mixed in the bedrock resulting in the seasonal signal of precipitation being indistinct nevertheless the drip rate responded to the annual rainfall zhang and li 2019 when the annual rainfall increased gradually the drip rate increased as well which shortened the residence time of the fissure water in the bedrock and in turn weakened the bedrock dissolution it explained the decreasing trend of the mean mg contents and mg sr ratios of the drip water fig 3a 3c with the increasing rainfall during 2009 to 2018 fig 2g although there is a positive correlation between mg and sr of drip water r 0 45 fig 4b the decreasing trend of the mean sr content was not obvious as that of mg fig 3b only when the annual precipitation increased significantly such as in 2015 and 2016 the content of sr decreased as that of mg fig 2d 2e 2f in addition pca analysis also found that the most important factor affecting mg and sr accounted for 72 3 of two main factors in drip water which was lower than in soil water table 3 it indicated that except the annual precipitation the complicated hydrology condition in the epikarst overlying furong cave may have an important impact on mg and sr in drip water 5 3 variation characteristics and influencing factors of mg and sr contents in as the mg contents and mg sr ratios of the as decreased from 2009 to 2013 while sr contents increased during 2014 to 2016 mg sr and mg sr ratios all remained relatively stable fig 5a 5b and 5c though there is a positive correlation between mg and sr in as the correlation coefficient is lower than that in soil water and drip water fig 4 pca analysis showed that the most important factor synchronously affecting mg and sr accounted for 68 9 of the whole influencing factors table 3 the contents of mg and sr in speleothem are mainly controlled by the precipitation process of calcite in addition to the influence of mg and sr content in drip water the environment in the cave such as humidity temperature pco2 dripping rate and the growth rate of speleothem all have influence on mg and sr entering into the calcium carbonate crystal paquette and reeder 1995 goede et al 1998 fairchild et al 2000 2006 hellstrom and mcculloch 2000 tooth and fairchild 2003 treble et al 2003 mcdermott 2004 johnson et al 2006 even for a given factor the influences on element mg and sr are different for example temperature has an effect on mg but has little effect on sr gascoyne 1983 huang and fairchild 2001 experiments have shown that the sr partition coefficient ksr is strongly affected by the growth rate of calcium carbonate reeder and grams 1987 paquette and reeder 1995 stephenson et al 2008 gabitov et al 2014 confirmed through experiments and gem growth entrapment model simulations that ksr increased by a factor of six and kmg decreased by a factor of three as the calcium carbonate crystallization rate increased from 0 001 nm s to 4 nm s therefore the correlation coefficient between mg and sr in as was 0 38 which might be related to the comprehensive effect of multiple factors fig 4c the temperature and humidity in furong cave are stable all year around li et al 2011 however the pco2 in the cave has seasonal variation li and li 2018 the average growth rate of six as showed no seasonal characteristics but slowly increasing trend from 2009 to 2016 fig 5d which is corresponded with the rainfall fig 5e in section 5 2 it has been discussed that the decreasing trend of mg in drip water is related to the shortened water rock contact time with the increasing precipitation the reduction of mg in as might be affected by the content of mg in drip water in addition with the increase of growth rate more sr and less mg may enter into the calcium carbonate crystals which resulted in the decrease of mg sr ratios in as fig 5a 5b 5c 5 4 isotopic tracing with 87sr 86sr values the sr contents and 87sr 86sr ratios of speleothems are commonly used in paleoclimate research banner et al 1996 goede et al 1998 bar matthews et al 1999 verheyden et al 2000 frumkin and stein 2004 the 87sr 86sr values of stalagmites can be used to reveal the impacts of sr sources on the 87sr 86sr values of cave drip water faure and mensing 2005 studies have shown that the overlying soil bedrock dust materials and ocean spray are the main sources of sr banner et al 1996 goede et al 1998 ayalon et al 1999 bar matthews et al 1999 verheyden et al 2000 frumkin and stein 2004 li et al 2005 shand et al 2009 furong cave is located in the mainland of china about 850 km away from the nearest ocean south china sea therefore the influence of ocean spray is negligible moreover the daba mountains in the north and east of sichuan basin block the sand coming from the northwest which results in the study region less affected by the sand additionally agricultural origin fertilizers may change usually decrease the isotope signature of sr böhlke and horan 2000 jiang et al 2009 jiang 2011 according to our investigation the upper of furong cave is in a relatively primitive state covered by dense vegetation and with little interference from human activities given that the sr contents mean of 0 008 mg l of local rainwater are much lower than those of the soil and soil water table 1 only the soil and bedrock were considered when investigating the factors influencing the 87sr 86sr values of drip water the mean 87sr 86sr value of the overlying soil of furong cave was 0 72805 0 00222 which is higher than the mean value of the underlying bedrock 0 70958 0 00006 fig 6 the study area has a subtropical humid monsoon climate with high temperatures and rainfall in summer and dense vegetation and large amounts of co2 and other acidic substances are produced by soil respiration and microbial decomposition li et al 2012 li and li 2018 this results in strong chemical weathering of the soil and bedrock yang et al 2001 proposed that the soil 87sr 86sr values reflected the intensity of the chemical weathering with the ratios increasing with increasing weathering intensity therefore the sr supplied by soil that has undergone chemical weathering has higher 87sr 86sr values compared to that of the surrounding limestone li et al 2005 the 87sr 86sr values of all of the soil water and drip water fell between those of the soil and the bedrock fig 6 when rainwater infiltrates into the soil it not only dissolves soil debris but also transports limestone debris with low 87sr 86sr ratios away banner et al 1994 borg and banner 1996 resulting in lower soil water 87sr 86sr values compared with those of the soil and bedrock the mean 87sr 86sr value of the cave drip water at drip sites mp1 and mp2 was closer to the mean bedrock 87sr 86sr value than the mean soil water 87sr 86sr value table 2 fig 6 it is supposed that the evolution of 87sr 86sr ratios of groundwater from soil characteristics to that of bedrock reflects the occurrence of water rock interaction which is related to the residence time of fissure water in bedrock musgrove and banner 2004 oster et al 2010 wong et al 2011 wortham et al 2017 the overlying bedrock of furong cave is 300 500 m thick which leads to longer water rock interaction in other words the residence time of fissure water in the bedrock is the main factor affecting the trace element composition of the drip water 5 5 environmental implications of 87sr 86sr values the mean 87sr 86sr value of the overlying soil of furong cave differs from that of the bedrock by 0 01847 table 2 while the 87sr 86sr of the soil water and drip water are between that of the soil and that of the bedrock fig 6 which reflects the change of the residence time of infiltration water in the soil and bedrock musgrove and banner 2004 shand et al 2007 wong and banner 2010 wong et al 2011 wortham et al 2017 comprehensive studies on the 87sr 86sr value in modern stream waters fast drip waters and slow drip waters indicated that the faster the velocity the lower sr isotope ratio banner et al 1996 according to the values in table 2 the multi month mean 87sr 86sr ratios of the soil water in soil profile se in march may and june september were 0 71700 0 00114 and 0 71242 0 00072 respectively the overlying soil water of furong cave mainly originates from rainfall and thus it quickly responds to the changes of rainfall li et al 2013 from november to the following february the soil water dries up due to the reduction in rainfall therefore the soil water in march may contains infiltrated water that has stayed in the soil for a long time and more detrital materials with high 87sr 86sr ratio were dissolved in soil water the soil water in june september mainly originates from the rainfall in the same month resulting in the lower soil water interaction time and a reduction of 87sr 86sr values in soil water the cave drip water from sites mp1 and mp2 has similar 87sr 86sr values which remained stable throughout the year without obvious seasonal variations table 2 due to the limited number of 87sr 86sr measurements for the cave drip water and the short monitoring time march december 2015 the regular 87sr 86sr pattern of the cave drip water cannot be determined in detail accordingly the relationship between the 87sr 86sr of the cave drip water and the amount of rainfall is not addressed in this study 6 conclusions during 2009 2018 the contents of mg and sr mg sr ratios and 87sr 86sr values from the soil and soil water overlying the cave to the drip water and as in furong cave southwest china were monitored it is found that the trace element composition of the cave drip water mainly originates from the bedrock basing on the increase of the mg and sr contents from the soil water to the cave drip water as well as the 87sr 86sr values of the cave drip water closing to that of the bedrock there were no seasonal variations of the mg and sr contents and mg sr ratios in drip water and as which are related to the complex karst system in the bedrock with hundreds of meters thickness however mg contents and mg sr ratios responded to the change of regional rainfall on the multi year timescale figs 2 3 and 5 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

4718,previous studies linking large scale atmospheric circulation and river flow with traditional machine learning techniques have predominantly explored monthly seasonal or annual streamflow modelling for applications in direct downscaling or hydrological climate impact studies this paper identifies major drivers of daily streamflow from large scale atmospheric circulation using two reanalysis datasets for six catchments in norway representing various köppen geiger climate types and flood generating processes a nested loop of roughly pruned random forests is used for feature extraction demonstrating the potential for automated retrieval of physically consistent and interpretable input variables random forest rf support vector machine svm for regression and multilayer perceptron mlp neural networks are compared to multiple linear regression to assess the role of model complexity in utilizing the identified major drivers to reconstruct streamflow the machine learning models were trained on 31 years of aggregated atmospheric data with distinct moving windows for each catchment reflecting catchment specific forcing response relationships between the atmosphere and the rivers the results show that accuracy improves to some extent with model complexity in all but the smallest rainfall driven catchment the most complex model mlp gives a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse ranging from 0 71 to 0 81 on testing data spanning five years the poorer performance by all models in the smallest catchment is discussed in relation to catchment characteristics sub grid topography and local variability the intra model differences are also viewed in relation to the consistency between the automatically retrieved feature selections from the two reanalysis datasets this study provides a benchmark for future development of deep learning models for direct downscaling from large scale atmospheric variables to daily streamflow in norway keywords direct downscaling discharge automated feature extraction era5 era interim 1 introduction the plethora of available large scale atmospheric reanalysis products climate model outputs and weather re forecasts is growing in combination with quality controlled streamflow records this growth unlocks unprecedented opportunities for streamflow modelling with machine learning on various spatiotemporal scales the use of machine learning in hydrology has evolved over the last decades in association with the field of hydroinformatics abbott 1991 vojinovic and abbott 2017 a historical overview of the use of neural networks in hydrology is given by abrahart et al 2012 a review of machine learning applications for streamflow modelling is given by yaseen et al 2015 while mosavi et al 2018 provide a review of machine learning applications specifically for flood prediction in recent years a growing interest in deep learning is reflected in the literature kratzert et al 2018 kratzertet al 2019 xiang et al 2020 and attempts at integrating physical laws of hydrology in deep learning models have been made jiang et al 2020 meanwhile traditional machine learning techniques such as random forest support vector machine and shallow neural networks have demonstrated successful applications in the field of hydrology nevertheless machine learning applications for streamflow modelling predominantly take the form of autoregressive models in which past streamflow observations represent the primary input variables adnan et al 2019 thapa et al 2020 tongal and booij 2018 sometimes in combination with local meteorological observations climate indices and weather forecasts see for instance rasouli et al 2012 few studies have utilized machine learning for direct translation from large scale atmospheric circulation to streamflow without also employing past streamflow observations as predictive variables it has long been known that there are important linkages between large scale atmospheric circulation and river flow kingston et al 2006 table 1 provides an overview of relevant studies in which streamflow has been inferred from gridded large scale atmospheric variables an early attempt at modelling five day average streamflow from atmospheric reanalysis data with ensemble neural networks is presented by cannon and whitfield 2002 feature selection was carried out with stepwise predictor selection resulting in the use of 2 5 x 2 5 250 km 250 km gridded cells of geopotential heights mean sea level pressure and specific humidity at 500 hpa 850 hpa and 1000 hpa the study concluded that neural networks are more suitable than stepwise linear regression for nonlinear systems with complex interactions between inputs and outputs following this a number of studies used machine learning to reconstruct monthly streamflow and project hydrological climate impacts ghosh and mujumdar 2008 trained support vector machine svm and relevant vector machine rvm models on atmospheric reanalysis data to reconstruct monthly streamflow in the monsoon season the trained models were subsequently used to project hydrological climate impacts with climate model outputs interpolated to the grid points of the reanalysis data feature selection was performed on a prior selection of large scale atmospheric variables with known physical connections to the monsoon flooding regime principal component analysis pca was carried out on 2 0 x 2 0 200 km 200 km gridded cells of standardized mean sea level pressure air temperature specific humidity and 500 hpa geopotential to transform the correlated predictors into an n dimensional set of uncorrelated vectors whereby most of the variability of the original dataset is contained within the first few dimensions fuzzy clustering of the principal components was performed using three classes the resulting 12 inputs comprised 10 principal components and two memberships as the sum of three memberships is one similar approaches to feature extraction with pca and fuzzy clustering for hydrological climate impact modelling with svm have been followed by okkan and inan 2015 sahoo and sen 2017 and das and nanduri 2018 in the case of norway monthly streamflow has been directly downscaled from moving windows of atmospheric reanalysis data by huang et al 2020 using rvm precipitation was excluded as an input variable in order to make use of variables that are more accurately simulated by global circulation models temperature pressure and humidity the best performance was obtained in snowmelt driven catchments in inland regions of norway the poor performance in small rainfall driven catcments was associated with the relative difference in inter annual versus intra annual variability in monthly streamflow as is evident from table 1 most attempts at direct downscaling or climate impact modelling with machine learning have targeted monthly seasonal or annual streamflow often using variations of correlation analysis for feature selection ren et al 2018 justified selected features with expert knowledge and prior assumptions to assess climate impact on monthly streamflow in china nilsson et al 2008 used canonical correlation analysis to extract features for seasonal streamflow modelling with mlp in scandinavia moradi et al 2020 extracted relevant features using correlation analysis and pca for annual streamflow modelling with mlp to a reservoir in the middle east the majority of the previous studies on monthly seasonal or annual streamflow modelling have used monthly aggregations of atmospheric inputs on finer temporal scales few attempts can be found in the literature tisseuil et al 2010 modelled daily mean flow and fortnightly flow statistics from 2 5 x 2 5 250 km 250 km gridded atmospheric reanalysis data and projected hydrological climate impact under two scenarios with neural networks almost a decade later liao et al 2019 employed only surface variables from 0 75 x 0 75 75 km 75 km gridded reanalysis data to model daily streamflow and assess the hydrological impact of climate change using climate model outputs overall despite increasing spatiotemporal resolution of available reanalysis data attempts at reconstructing daily streamflow from large scale atmospheric circulation with machine learning remain sparse reichstein et al 2019 identified five main challenges for successful application of deep learning in geosciences i interpretability self explanatory and transparent model structures that allow for causal discovery from observational data ii physical consistency integration of domain knowledge iii complex and uncertain data methods to cope with complex statistics and sources of uncertainty iv limited labels methods to exploit data with unsupervised or semi supervised learning and v computational demand technical challenges of big data computing however recognizing the lack of non autoregressive machine learning models for direct downscaling to daily streamflow in the literature and embracing the fact that a model should be as simple as possible but nevertheless reliable this paper focuses on the two first points highlighted by reichstein et al 2019 namely interpretability and physical consistency within the context of traditional machine learning techniques hence a thorough investigation of deep learning is reserved for future studies while other studies have focused primarily on monthly seasonal or annual streamflow modelling this study focuses on the identification of major drivers of daily streamflow among relevant atmospheric and surface variables in relation to distinct flood generating processes the objective of this paper is to identify major drivers and investigate the forcing response relationship between large scale atmospheric circulation and daily streamflow with traditional machine learning techniques of increasing model complexity specifically this paper answers the following research question what are major drivers of daily streamflow in six selected norwegian catchments with different climate types flood generating processes and catchment characteristics and how does the direct translation from atmospheric forcing to streamflow response relate to model complexity in other words this paper provides a sampled screening of the potential of direct downscaling from large scale atmospheric variables to streamflow at a daily temporal scale in norway the aim is to present a methodology for identification of major drivers of daily streamflow and assess the accuracy of reconstructed streamflow in relation to model complexity major drivers are identified using an automatic feature selection procedure that returns atmospheric variables deemed relevant at informative pressure levels and aggregations in the atmospheric column above the relevant catchment three popular traditional machine learning techniques with differing structural complexities are explored the ensemble based piecewise linear random forest rf the nonlinear kernel based support vector machine svm for regression and multilayer perceptron mlp neural network multiple linear regression is used as a baseline model for the comparisons this paper is structured as follows the remainder of section 1 introduces the case study 1 1 section 2 presents materials and methods in subsections of data 2 1 feature selection 2 2 model development 2 3 and evaluation 2 4 results are shown in section 3 a discussion follows in section 4 with three subsections focusing on model performance 4 1 interpretability and physical consistency 4 2 and potential and limitations 4 3 respectively lastly section 5 provides concluding remarks and gives directions for future research 1 1 case study with 1660 hydropower plants accounting for more than 95 of installed capacity there are numerous regulated rivers in norway norwegian ministry of petroleum and energy 2015 however when linking large scale atmospheric circulation and river flow with machine learning it is pivotal that unregulated rivers are used so that signals from atmospheric forcing are less distorted by human activity the norwegian hydrological reference dataset for climate impact studies fleig et al 2013 consists of daily records from 188 active and unregulated streamflow gauges deemed suitable for climate impact studies from these 188 stations 40 stations distributed over six regions of norway were extracted as potential candidates for this study based on a filtering procedure considering record lengths record gaps flow duration curves and mean annual flows from 1950 and onwards the resulting dataset contained four stations in finnmark five stations in nordland eight stations in trøndelag ten stations in vestlandet ten stations in østlandet and three stations in sørlandet six representative stations one for each region finnmark nordland trøndelag østlandet vestlandet sørlandet were selected based on the correlation matrices for each region on the grounds of having the overall highest correlation with other stations in the region fig 1 shows the geographical location of the six selected hydrological stations at the catchment outlets and the corresponding annual mean flow normalized by catchment area important hydro climatic characteristics for each catchment are given in table 2 station 234 18 is located in the tana river basin and is the northernmost catchment considered in this study this catchment has clearly the most pronounced snowmelt driven flood regime station 152 4 measures the outflow from lake fustvatn which discharges further downstream into the fjord vefsnfjorden through the river fusta both rainfall and snowmelt contribute to flood generation in this catchment although rainfall has a tendency to dominate over snowmelt due to the coastal climate station 308 1 measures the flow in lake lenglingen which is part of a network of lakes in mid inland norway the main flood generating process is snowmelt in this catchment station 311 6 measures the river flow at nybergsund which is part of a larger river system that ultimately discharges into lake vånern in sweden the main flood generating process is snowmelt albeit marginally as mixed processes also play an important role the station 83 2 is located in the coastal west and the main flood generating process is rainfall the most distinct rainfall driven flood regime is found in the southernmost catchment station 22 22 measures river flow in søgne which connects to the fjord høllefjorden and eventually drains to the north sea the selected catchments differ with respect to size climate types and flood generating processes the catchments in vestlandet and sørlandet are located in coastal regions with a temperate oceanic climate however given the tilt of the mountain range near the western coast of norway winds carrying moisture eastward and northward have differing effects on the two catchments all other catchments are located in areas with a subarctic climate where both snowmelt and rainfall contribute to generation of high flows to various degrees similar characteristics are found for the selected catchments in finnmark and trøndelag the catchment in østlandet exhibits a distinctly different hydrological behavior in which mixed processes play a larger role although this station generally exhibits characteristics similar to the stations in finnmark and trøndelag likewise the catchment in nordland differs from the other catchments by being a high latitude predominantly rainfall driven catchment with some contribution from snowmelt in terms of hydrological behavior this catchment resembles the catchments in vestlandet and sørlandet in terms of catchment size the smallest catchment 204 km2 is found in sørlandet and the largest catchment 14161 km2 is found in finnmark see table 2 2 materials and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 hydrological data the flow duration curves of the six selected stations are shown in fig 2 mann kendall tests hussain and mahmud 2019 of maximum annual flows and average annual flows show no statistically significant monotonically increasing trends between 1979 and 2018 see table 3 descriptive statistics are summarized table 4 2 1 2 atmospheric data atmospheric data was retrieved from two reanalysis datasets of differing spatial resolution a fine resolution reanalysis dataset ecmwf era5 hersbach et al 2020 and a coarser resolution reanalysis dataset ecmwf era interim hereby abbreviated erai dee et al 2011 the column above each hydrological station was downloaded for a standard selection of variables at 20 pressure levels between 1000 hpa and 50 hpa the atmospheric reanalysis data were aggregated to daily values by summing or averaging extensive and intensive variates respectively table 5 provides an overview of the atmospheric reanalysis data and variates used for feature selection see table a1 in appendix a for list of symbols table 6 shows the geographical coordinates of the atmospheric columns 2 2 feature selection the hydrological and atmospheric data spans the period january 1 1979 to december 31 2017 to ensure a testing set of five consecutive years and also reserve the maximum flows at each hydrological station for the training set the data was split as shown in fig 3 two years 1979 1981 were set aside for cross validation to prevent overfitting five years 2009 2014 were reserved for testing the remaining 31 years were used for training the simplest machine learning model considered in this study random forest rf was first used to select features as identical input variable selections to all machine learning models as well as the baseline model feature selection was carried out on the training data with two loops of random forests based on the following assumptions 1 streamflow is albeit to various degrees directly forced by large scale atmospheric circulation as represented in the gridded pressure columns above the catchments 2 aggregations and or lags of atmospheric variables can only influence present streamflow if aggregated backwards in time 3 catchment response times and hydrological regimes vary from station to station even within a near homogenous region therefore each station requires a unique set of aggregated atmospheric inputs to establish a representation of catchment characteristics in the forcing response relationship both aggregations of atmospheric variables and lags between atmospheric variables and streamflow were systematically investigated using a range from two days to three months 88 days backwards in time first an outer loop was used to build n random forest rf models whereby n moving windows of i cumulative sums and averages and ii lags were fed to a rf consisting of 25 trees roughly pruned by limiting the depth of each regression tree to 10 following this the weights per model were sorted and the top ten features from n 88 models were fed to a new rf this inner loop facilitates a fair comparison of the relative importance of different aggregations and lags across the n 10 highest weighted features this procedure was followed for each reanalysis dataset table 7 displays the summed weights of the top 50 500 highest weighted features extracted from era5 for each hydrological station corresponding information on automated feature selection from erai is given in table 8 as can be seen the top 50 highest weighted features account for approximately 80 of the model input across the reanalysis datasets with a cross validation coefficient of determination r2 ranging from 0 76 to 0 95 based on this general pattern the top 50 highest weighted features were extracted as input variables for multiple linear regression mlr random forest rf support vector machine svm and multilayer perception mlp neural network to aid visual interpretation the top 30 highest weighted features extracted from era5 and erai for each hydrological station accounting for 80 of summed weights are shown in fig 4 interestingly lagged variables led to a far lower out of the bag r2 than did cumulative sums and averages not shown consequently only cumulative sums and averages and not lagged variables comprise the coarse resolution and fine resolution feature selection for each model at each hydrological station as seen in fig 4 shortwave radiation sw and temperature variates t at the surface t2m and in the boundary layer 1000 850 hpa are the most important variables with some variation between era5 and erai for the snowmelt driven flood regime at station 234 18 in finnmark the two month moving window of shortwave radiation from erai corresponds to the two month moving window of temperature at 950 hpa from era5 and may be interpreted as reflecting seasonality in the north the one to three weeks moving windows of surface temperature reflect melting a similar consistency is seen for the snowmelt driven flood regime at station 308 1 in trøndelag and station 311 6 in østlandet the persistence of near surface temperature and vertical wind variates in aggregation windows of one to two months is evident for all stations where snowmelt is the main flood generating process this may be interpreted as snow accumulation for which precipitation moisture and uplift in the boundary layer and persistent temperatures around 0 c are needed at longer aggregations mid level troposphere temperatures and relative humidity are also important this may link to troposphere stratosphere interactions and effects on the jet stream at 60 n but conclusive statements upon this cannot be drawn for the rainfall driven flood regime at station 152 4 in nordland shorter moving windows of moisture variates dew point temperature and eastward winds between 700 hpa and 950 hpa are of importance this distinct difference relative to the snowmelt driven flood regimes is confirmed by the extracted features for station 83 2 in vestlandet and 22 22 in sørlandet the seasonality in these rainfall driven flood regimes is represented through moisture and wind variates as opposed temperature variates in the case of snowmelt driven flood regimes reflecting the coastal influence on temperature and the seasonal variation in winds moreover the dominant aggregation period in rainfall driven flood regimes does not extend beyond roughly three weeks in essence these feature selections reflect that the contribution of snowmelt to streamflow generation requires temperatures around or below the freezing point throughout the winter season t2m followed by an increase in incoming short wave radiation sw and consistent corresponding shifts in the temperature profile in the spring t the contribution of rainfall to streamflow generation on the other hand is linked with the presence and transport u v of moisture sources tcv tcw rh td2m as well as uplift w in the boundary layer 1000 850 hpa the features extracted for station 22 22 in sørlandet are less consistent between the two reanalysis datasets for periods longer than roughly two weeks it should be mentioned that where orographic rainfall occurs the local variability in rainfall can be triggered by sub grid orographic features the role of catchment characteristics is only implicitly embedded in the statistical linking of the atmosphere and the hydrological regimes sub grid orographic features will be more pronounced in smaller steeper catchments and this in term is less likely to be revealed in the established statistical links at daily level the feature selection using nested loops of random forests was intentionally mild to minimize the early rejection of possibly useful predictors 2 3 model development 2 3 1 preprocessing of model inputs the atmospheric data were scaled by removing the median of each feature and dividing by the interquartile range 25th to 75th percentiles this standardization is more appropriate in the presence of outliers the resulting input data has zero mean zero median and a standard deviation of 1 while outliers are preserved without skewing the distribution since the hydrological data is skewed heteroscedastic and strictly positive a box cox transformation was applied before splitting into training cross validation and testing sets 2 3 2 baseline the baseline model in this study is a multiple linear regression mlr model the preprocessed selected features top 50 highest weighted features for each hydrological station subject to transformation were used to construct a mlr model for each of the two reanalysis datasets 2 3 3 random forest a random forest rf consists of n numbers of regression trees from which the average prediction for a given set of inputs is returned the regression trees collectively work as an ensemble of piecewise linear models where instances are sorted until a leaf with a linear regression model is reached this structure makes rf less sensitive to parameters and hence relatively robust for each hydrological station an rf was trained on the preprocessed selected features from the atmospheric column above the relevant station pruning was carried out by limiting the depth and increasing the number of samples required for splitting into nodes and leaves with the use of cross validation all the rf models were built using bootstrap samples so that samples as opposed to the full dataset of the extracted features were used to train each individual regression tree the mean square error was used as the loss function the models were implemented in python using randomforestregressor in sklearn pedregosa et al 2011 2 3 4 support vector machine although originally developed for classification problems support vector machine svm cortes and vapnik 1995 is also applicable to regression problems the idea behind this algorithm is to maximize the margins to an n 1 dimensional hyperplane for an n dimensional dataset so that the distance between the closest vectors or support vectors and the hyperplane is maximized to maximize this distance a loss function is used whereby smaller distances between the support vectors and the hyperplane are costlier than larger distances for regression problems this hyperplane is a regression curve defined by the support vectors kernels such as a radial basis function may be used to handle non linearity if data is not linearly separable after standardization and mapping to a higher dimensional space in essence the kernel then behaves as a weighted k nearest neighbor algorithm for unseen data in infinite dimensions in which closer observations have a larger influence on the prediction of unseen data for each hydrological station an svm was trained on the preprocessed selected features from the atmospheric column above the relevant station two parameters in the svm model were tuned with the use of cross validation these parameters respectively control i the strength of l2 regularization and ii the epsilon tube denoting the difference between the predicted and observed value for which no penalty occurs during training the svm models were implemented with a radial basis function in python using svr in sklearn pedregosa et al 2011 2 3 5 multilayer perceptron multilayer perceptron mlp is a feed forward neural network inputs propagate through the hidden layers by means of activation functions each hidden node is associated with a bias and weights per input and the activation function transfers the signal until the output layer is reached to avoid saturation of neurons the inputs should be standardized and normalized to avoid overfitting regularization methods such as dropout or weight decay can be applied for each hydrological station an mlp was trained on the preprocessed selected features using stochastic gradient decent hyperbolic tangent activation functions and rectified linear units were used in the hidden layers along with l2 regularization mlp differs from rf and svm by being more complex less transparent due to randomized noise in the hidden layers and more sensitive to parameters parameters were tuned using the cross validation set in addition to the use of cross validation for parameter tuning early stopping was employed when the loss on an arbitrary 10 of the training data stopped decreasing above a threshold value 0 0005 0 5 training was stopped with one to three hidden layers per model the mlp models constructed may be referred to as shallow neural networks the models were implemented in python using mlpregressor in sklearn pedregosa et al 2011 2 3 6 model complexity in the context of machine learning the term model complexity is often used to reflect the dimensionality of the space of possible models expressed as the number of degrees of freedom measured by the adjustable hyper parameters as each of the models described above was developed for each station and dataset with a unique set of hyper parameters and inputs a conceptual classification of relative model complexity based on general model characteristics shared between models employing the same algorithm was used to assess the improvements to accuracy with increasing model complexity see table 9 this allows for a separation between model performance resulting from strong and near linear coupling between the large scale atmospheric circulation and the catchment small inter model differences and model performance resulting from the structural complexity in which non linearity is handled consistently larger inter model differences the word reconstruct is used to refer to this translation from large scale atmospheric circulation to streamflow using major identified drivers only it should not be confused with prediction in which catchment characteristics will also contribute as explicit model inputs an illustrative flowchart of the methodology is provided in fig 5 2 4 evaluation four metrics commonly applied for evaluation of hydrological models were used to assess the performance of the machine learning models pearson s r r equation 1 normalized root mean square error nrmse equation 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse equation 3 and kling gupta efficiency kge equation 4 pearson s r measures the strength of a positive or negative linear relationship between the reconstructed and observed flows however it does not distinguish systematic errors therefore the root mean square error normalized by mean flow was used to indicate discrepancies in flow magnitudes between reconstructed and observed flows nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 is useful to assess model performance in relation to a mean flow benchmark whereby positive values indicate accuracy above estimating a particular value in the data series as the mean of all data points lastly the kling gupta efficiency is a decomposition of the nse into correlation variability bias and mean bias and is intended to improve certain shortcomings gupta et al 2009 hence kge has gained popularity for model evaluation in the hydrological community however kge does not have the intuitive mean flow benchmark nse 0 in fact using the mean flow as benchmark predictor results in kge 1 2 0 41 knoben et al 2019 therefore kge cannot be regarded a substitute for nse nor can it be directly compared rather all aforementioned components of kge should be considered and a concurrent use of kge and nse may constitute a better foundation for model evaluation in the equations below n denotes the sample size qrec

corresponding daily flows are shown for multiple linear regression mlr random forest rf support vector machine svm and multilayer perceptron mlp separately in fig 7 fig 8 fig 9 and fig 10 respectively at first glance the flow duration curves seem similar however flows below exceedance probabilities of 10 and above 90 are consistently smaller and larger than the observed flows for mlr this is not observed for the machine learning models a closer look at the time series of daily streamflow as reconstructed from the identified major drivers reveal that mlr fails to capture peaks and only gives a rough representation of the seasonal variation in streamflow while the baseline model mlr clearly is outperformed by the machine learning models both at high flows and low flows some differences in relation to model complexity and hydrological regimes are also evident the simpler model rf captures the seasonal behavior in snowmelt driven flood regimes 234 18 308 1 and 311 6 but tends to underestimate the magnitude of the annual peaks svm on the other hand captures the timing of these peaks better but does so at the expense of some overestimation particularly the annual peak in 2010 in finnmark the most accurate and timely reconstruction of streamflow that clearly distinguishes between high flows and low flows is obtained with mlp rf also fails to capture the magnitude of the larger peaks at stations 152 4 83 2 and 22 22 comparing the peaks in these rainfall driven flood regimes as reconstructed from the identified major drivers by rf svm and mlp it is evident that increasing model complexity leads to more distinct peaks furthermore a more accurate separation of high flows and low flows is obtained with mlp for the identification of major large scale atmospheric drivers of daily streamflow era5 is not consistently favored over erai however effects related to the scale of the atmospheric input relative to the size of a given catchment was not specifically investigated in this analysis nevertheless differences in reconstructed flows for each station may be viewed in relation to the consistency between identified drivers from the two reanalysis datasets this is most apparent for station 22 22 where identified drivers beyond two weeks are scattered in space and time across era5 and erai see fig 4 section 2 2 in the case of station 311 6 where mixed processes also contribute to the generation of high flows the reconstructed streamflow is consistently higher with era5 and the inter model differences between rf svm and mlp are generally smaller than for the other stations metrics for training and testing of mlr rf svm and mlp are given per station in tables 10 15 the best scores on the testing sets are highlighted in bold the poorest performance is seen for station 22 22 only mlp captures some of the streamflow dynamics at this station and to a larger extent with the coarser reanalysis data erai scatter plots comparing the performance of rf svm and mlp against the baseline model on the testing set are provided in fig 11 the corresponding score ranges obtained using identified drivers of daily streamflow are displayed for each metric in fig 12 in summary the highest performance in terms of correlation r normalized root mean square error nrmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge is obtained with mlp furthermore the lowest drop on the aforementioned metrics from training to testing is also obtained with mlp it should be emphasized that the scores obtained with simpler metrics r and nrmse on the testing set at times differ marginally between the machine learning models however when summarizing the highest scores on the more sophisticated metrics nse and kge from tables 10 15 the more complex models svm and mlp perform consistently better 4 discussion 4 1 model performance the direct translation from identified major drivers to daily streamflow was most accurately made with the most complex model mlp with a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse on the testing set ranging from 0 71 to 0 81 on all stations except for station 22 22 representing the smallest catchment although all models performed substantially worse on station 22 22 mlp still obtained the highest nse there as well 0 59 patterns of increasing accuracy with model complexity were found indicating that structural complexity is needed to exploit information in the identified major drivers although the machine learning models showed marginal differences on simpler metrics like correlation from the results it is clear that a simple multiple linear regression mlr is unsuitable for direct downscaling from large scale atmospheric variables to daily streamflow this is in alignment with previous findings cannon and whitfield 2002 and does not require further elaboration here the drops in nse from training to testing provide an indication of the robustness of the machine learning models mlp had an average drop of 0 03 with era5 and less than 0 01 with erai a slightly larger drop in nse 0 04 0 05 was observed for svm and the largest drop 0 11 was observed for rf mostly due to the inability to generalize for station 22 22 these drops inversely reflect the robustness of the models in other words the most accurate model mlp is also the most robust model this may seem counter intuitive as mlp is more sensitive to parameters than rf but nevertheless supports conclusions from previous studies showing that there are limitations to linear models when applied to nonlinear systems with complex interactions between inputs and outputs cannon and whitfield 2002 in essence a shallow neural network may generalize well when parameters are tuned optimal or near optimal with the use of cross validation the fact that the drop in nse was somewhat larger with the fine resolution reanalysis data 0 25 may be an artifact of scale issues nogueira 2020 assessed the differences in spatiotemporal resolution and convective and microphysical parameterizations between era5 and erai by relating systematic and random components of the differences in rainfall against the differences in temperature water vapor evaporation moisture flux divergence and pressure vertical velocity the study concluded that the spatial and temporal representation of rainfall as well as other variables in era5 and erai have similar error and bias except in the tropics where era5 provides improvements due to the increased quantity and quality of assimilated observations in other words erai may be preferred to era5 for the specific use and purpose of this study when only a single atmospheric column is to be considered the substantially lower model performance at station 22 22 in sørlandet must be viewed from a catchment perspective station 22 22 is located in a catchment that differs from the other catchments in a number of ways firstly it is the smallest catchment of the six considered has the second largest annual flow normalized by catchment area and the lowest lag autocorrelation as compared to the other stations this indicates a rapidly responding system needless to say the role of atmospheric forcing on finer spatiotemporal scales may therefore be of greater importance here than for the other stations secondly it has the most dominantly rainfall driven flood regime sivakumar et al 2001 identified the possible existence of chaos in rainfall runoff processes this in turn complicates streamflow reconstruction in rainfall driven flood regimes thirdly both feature selections from era5 and erai show the lowest dominant aggregation period for this station with the largest disagreement on aggregated atmospheric variables beyond roughly two weeks this indicates that coupling between the large scale atmospheric circulation and the catchment not only occurs on a shorter time scales but also that catchment characteristics like slope permeability land use and antecedent soil moisture sub grid features like topography and local variability may play an equally or more important role in streamflow generation at the temporal resolution of one day a traditional hydrological modelling approach could be used to investigate the relative importance of local variability sub grid topography and catchment characteristics in depth for prediction tasks catchment characteristics must undoubtedly be included for all stations however the relative improvements in accuracy with the inclusion of catchment characteristics can be expected to be higher for station 22 22 this in turn may from a hydrological climate impact perspective point to the potential of direct downscaling with shallow neural networks in catchments where forcing from large scale atmospheric circulation dominates local variability sub grid features and catchment characteristics in daily streamflow generation to the degree that an nse in the range of 0 7 0 8 can be obtained on daily testing data spanning five consecutive years as such the methodology presented in this paper may be used to filter out suitable catchments for direct downscaling in the context of hydrological climate impact modelling among the six catchments considered the smallest inter model difference in performance was observed for station 311 6 in østlandet while the overall intra model performance was consistent for all but station 22 22 in sørlandet station 311 6 would therefore be most suitable for direct downscaling while station 22 22 would not be suitable without complementary modelling using more physically based approaches the inability to reconstruct the magnitude of annual peak flows accurately with a tendency towards underestimation by rf overestimation by svm and a modest combination of both by mlp is partially a reflection of the loss functions used to optimize the models mean flow metrics and may hence improve with customized loss functions particularly penalizing error on high flows while a complex model structure should not be used to compensate for an inadequate selection of input variables a thorough investigation with deep learning should be undertaken in which variates selected based on i expert knowledge prior assumptions ii identified major drivers from an automated feature selection procedure as presented in this paper and iii all available data respectively are investigated in relation to increasing model complexity additionally some catchments are influenced by complex catchment characteristics that lag or amplify the catchment response dynamically in space and time for such catchments complex statistics are required to infer a forcing response relationship from the atmosphere and the direct linking between large scale atmospheric circulation and daily streamflow with traditional machine learning techniques is unsuitable to separate atmospheric forcing from anthropogenic forcing the selected catchments should not be heavily developed regulated or otherwise strongly influenced by human activity 4 2 interpretability and physical consistency the automated feature selection procedure presented in this paper differs from methods used in previous studies see table 1 section 1 in contrast with canonical correlation analysis stepwise predictor selection maximal information coefficient or simply prior assumptions this study has used the weights assigned by roughly pruned bootstrapped random forests to extract relevant features furthermore dimensionality reduction was not carried out rather the resulting feature selections comprised aggregated variables from two daily to three monthly moving windows consequently the feature selections retain both cross correlations and autocorrelations within the data and this translates into information in the most complex model mlp the setup using two different atmospheric reanalysis datasets provides a validation of the feature selection procedure although some variability was seen between the extracted features from era5 and erai the general patterns of the extracted temperature variates and shortwave radiation for station 234 18 in finnmark station 308 1 in trøndelag and station 311 6 in østlandet were consistent and interpretable for snowmelt driven flood regimes likewise the importance of shorter moving windows of moisture variates dew point temperature and boundary layer winds was consistent for the rainfall driven flood regimes at station 152 4 in nordland station 83 2 in vestlandet and station 22 22 in sørlandet seasonality was represented with aggregations of temperature variates for snowmelt driven flood regimes and moisture and wind variates for rainfall driven flood regimes at two to three months the inconsistency in features extracted for station 22 22 in sørlandet beyond two weeks may as mentioned above indicate the relative importance of catchment characteristics or the inability of the selected traditional machine learning techniques to treat complex statistics furthermore all atmospheric reanalysis datasets contain biases when biases across two reanalysis datasets differ the resulting feature selections will differ accordingly moreover the feature selection procedure with looped random forests assumed the same pruning depth for all regression trees and a constant retrieval of ten candidate variables per moving window this number could be considered a function of catchment size dominant streamflow generating mechanism and annual flow giving larger candidate retrieval per moving window in smaller rainfall driven fast responding catchments it should be emphasized that the method directly linking large scale atmospheric variables to streamflow on daily level presented in this paper is not intended as a replacement for traditional hydrological modelling tools this study has identified major large scale atmospheric drivers using traditional machine learning techniques for streamflow prediction the importance of catchment characteristics and their role in transforming atmospheric inputs into a spatial and temporal pattern of streamflow cannot be overstated however the possibility of establishing such direct links between the atmosphere and the hydrological regimes on a daily level unlocks opportunities for direct downscaling to daily streamflow from climate model outputs this will provide a deeper understanding of how climatic changes in large scale atmospheric circulation can drive changes in streamflow at the catchment scale as such machine learning techniques can supplement conventional hydrological models by providing a complementary approach to interpreting potential future changes directly from global circulation models thus a complementary approach that shortens the state of the art modelling chain with downscaling bias correction and hydrological modelling will allow for evaluation of a larger ensemble of models and hence provide better uncertainty estimates as well as avoid some of the potential errors and biases introduced in the modelling chain as a result a stronger physical basis for explaining patterns of non stationarity in the current and past climate may be obtained and thus further be used to distinguish natural variability from climate change induced trends 4 3 potential and limitations snowmelt driven floods in norway are decreasing in magnitude and frequency vormoor et al 2016 this trend is expected to continue into the future as rising temperatures lead to less snow accumulation hanssen bauer et al 2017 lawrence 2020 also causing a shift in the timing of spring floods as snowmelt driven floods decrease a transient change towards predominantly rainfall driven streamflow generation also in northern or mountainous areas can be expected however this transition need not be linear or monotonic due to the competing effects of increases in winter precipitation versus temperature while none of the hydrological stations used in this study showed statistically significant trends several hydrological stations in europe have shown both statistically significant increases and decreases blöschl et al 2019 future applications of the methodology presented in this paper may therefore need to include learning of trends as a minimum requirement to cope with non stationarity in the current model setup only one atmospheric column per station was considered representative of the relevant large scale atmospheric circulation a more elaborate approach may involve a grid search with the use of meta heuristics resulting in more than one representative atmospheric column per station and hence a more spatially distributed identification of major drivers this may be particularly useful in large catchments with contrasting characteristics in which daily streamflow results from several distinct and independent drivers that may form compound events an example of this would be partly mountainous catchments with low lying valleys where rivers directly connect to the sea so that drainage is affected by pressure while climate indices may complementary to large scale atmospheric variables feed as model input to identify major drivers care should be taken as robust representation of large scale atmospheric circulation is needed also in a changing climate despite the fact that existing discipline knowledge may be used to assess the consistency and interpretability of feature selections as employed in this study a clear separation of correlation and causation cannot be inferred from the model structures this becomes increasingly problematic as the model complexity increases furthermore ensuring that the maximum peaks were included in the training data facilitated a fair comparison of the generalization obtained by the three machine learning models in other words extrapolation techniques in each algorithm were not explicitly addressed in this study but should be given attention in future studies the findings of this paper demonstrate the potential for direct downscaling from large scale atmospheric variables to daily streamflow with shallow neural networks this calls for an investigation of gain in accuracy with deep neural networks despite a growing interest in the scientific community deep learning is largely unexplored in the field of hydrology ardabili et al 2020 and the number of available algorithms and model structures are increasing particularly through hybridization as transparency tends to decrease reciprocally with model complexity a robust collection of benchmark studies with traditional machine learning techniques is needed with a sample of six hydrological stations from catchments with low anthropogenic influence the generalization of the findings of this paper is limited this calls for further benchmark studies involving more hydrological stations for the case of norway the additional 34 regionally filtered stations from the norwegian hydrological reference dataset for climate impact studies fleig 2013 may be tested with the methodology presented here as such this paper provides a step towards a collection of robust benchmarks for deep learning models in the context of daily streamflow reconstruction and statistical downscaling from large scale atmospheric variables in norway 5 conclusion this paper identified major drivers of daily streamflow in snowmelt driven and rainfall driven flood regimes in norway from large scale atmospheric variables in two reanalysis datasets of fine 0 25 and coarse 0 75 spatial resolution consistency between the feature selections from the two reanalysis datasets was confirmed the translation from large scale atmospheric forcing to daily streamflow using the identified drivers was investigated in relation to model complexity with three machine learning models random forest rf support vector machine svm for regression and multilayer perceptron mlp a sampled screening of six hydrological stations located in catchments with a low degree of anthropogenic influence was presented this paper provides a first step towards applying machine learning for direct downscaling from large scale atmospheric circulation on a daily temporal scale in norway and may hence serve as a benchmark for later developments of deep learning models in answering the research question posed introductorily the following is concluded major drivers of daily streamflow in each of the six investigated catchments reflect unique forcing response relationships from the atmosphere but also exhibit similarities within dominantly snowmelt driven and rainfall driven flood regimes respectively in catchments where high flows to a large extent are generated by snowmelt 234 18 finnmark 308 1 trøndelag and 311 6 østlandet two distinct aggregation periods of boundary layer and near surface temperature variates were evident at one to three weeks and two to three months respectively representing melting and seasonality a consistent aggregation window in between these two dominant aggregation periods was also found reflecting snow accumulation with moisture and temperature variates in catchments where high flows primarily are generated by rainfall 152 4 nordland 83 2 vestlandet and 22 22 sørlandet the dominant aggregation period does not extend beyond 3 weeks in these catchments the identified major drivers are moisture wind and temperature variates in the boundary layer with less short term influence from variables in the middle and upper troposphere seasonality is not represented through temperature variates but rather moisture and wind variates with aggregation windows around three months increasing accuracy with model complexity was found for all the six investigated catchments furthermore the most complex model mlp was found to be the most robust machine learning model with the lowest drop in nash sutcliffe efficiency nse from training to testing in all but the southernmost and smallest catchment mlp obtained an nse ranging from 0 71 to 0 81 with an average drop of less than 0 02 this supports previous findings stating that neural networks handle non linearity in complex systems better than linear or piecewise linear approaches the inter model and intra model differences in performance indicate the strength of the relationship between direct forcing from large scale atmospheric circulation and daily streamflow and may hence be used to filter out suitable catchments for direct downscaling in the context of hydrological climate impact modelling however since streamflow is the product of both atmospheric forcing and catchment characteristics the latter must be explicitly included in streamflow prediction using the identified major drivers among the six investigated catchments station 311 6 in østlandet was determined most suitable for direct downscaling while station 22 22 in sørlandet was determined unsuitable without further investigation of the relative importance of catchment characteristics sub grid features and local variability by traditional hydrological modelling approaches future research should focus on further development of benchmark studies and move towards exploration of deep learning for daily streamflow reconstruction with major drivers identified from large scale atmospheric forcing and catchment characteristics increasing the number of hydrological stations representing the various snowmelt driven and rainfall driven flood regimes will particularly aid in assessing the scalability of the findings presented in this paper furthermore clustering of hydrological stations based on catchment characteristics may allow the development of a transient model structure in which changes in dominant streamflow generating mechanisms or timing of annual peaks may feed into the automated feature selection procedure as such the input variable selections may be directed towards features and aggregation windows characteristic of rainfall driven flood regimes in line with decreasing snowmelt driven floods for all of these potential future studies the work presented here may serve as a benchmark credit authorship contribution statement jenny sjåstad

4718,previous studies linking large scale atmospheric circulation and river flow with traditional machine learning techniques have predominantly explored monthly seasonal or annual streamflow modelling for applications in direct downscaling or hydrological climate impact studies this paper identifies major drivers of daily streamflow from large scale atmospheric circulation using two reanalysis datasets for six catchments in norway representing various köppen geiger climate types and flood generating processes a nested loop of roughly pruned random forests is used for feature extraction demonstrating the potential for automated retrieval of physically consistent and interpretable input variables random forest rf support vector machine svm for regression and multilayer perceptron mlp neural networks are compared to multiple linear regression to assess the role of model complexity in utilizing the identified major drivers to reconstruct streamflow the machine learning models were trained on 31 years of aggregated atmospheric data with distinct moving windows for each catchment reflecting catchment specific forcing response relationships between the atmosphere and the rivers the results show that accuracy improves to some extent with model complexity in all but the smallest rainfall driven catchment the most complex model mlp gives a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse ranging from 0 71 to 0 81 on testing data spanning five years the poorer performance by all models in the smallest catchment is discussed in relation to catchment characteristics sub grid topography and local variability the intra model differences are also viewed in relation to the consistency between the automatically retrieved feature selections from the two reanalysis datasets this study provides a benchmark for future development of deep learning models for direct downscaling from large scale atmospheric variables to daily streamflow in norway keywords direct downscaling discharge automated feature extraction era5 era interim 1 introduction the plethora of available large scale atmospheric reanalysis products climate model outputs and weather re forecasts is growing in combination with quality controlled streamflow records this growth unlocks unprecedented opportunities for streamflow modelling with machine learning on various spatiotemporal scales the use of machine learning in hydrology has evolved over the last decades in association with the field of hydroinformatics abbott 1991 vojinovic and abbott 2017 a historical overview of the use of neural networks in hydrology is given by abrahart et al 2012 a review of machine learning applications for streamflow modelling is given by yaseen et al 2015 while mosavi et al 2018 provide a review of machine learning applications specifically for flood prediction in recent years a growing interest in deep learning is reflected in the literature kratzert et al 2018 kratzertet al 2019 xiang et al 2020 and attempts at integrating physical laws of hydrology in deep learning models have been made jiang et al 2020 meanwhile traditional machine learning techniques such as random forest support vector machine and shallow neural networks have demonstrated successful applications in the field of hydrology nevertheless machine learning applications for streamflow modelling predominantly take the form of autoregressive models in which past streamflow observations represent the primary input variables adnan et al 2019 thapa et al 2020 tongal and booij 2018 sometimes in combination with local meteorological observations climate indices and weather forecasts see for instance rasouli et al 2012 few studies have utilized machine learning for direct translation from large scale atmospheric circulation to streamflow without also employing past streamflow observations as predictive variables it has long been known that there are important linkages between large scale atmospheric circulation and river flow kingston et al 2006 table 1 provides an overview of relevant studies in which streamflow has been inferred from gridded large scale atmospheric variables an early attempt at modelling five day average streamflow from atmospheric reanalysis data with ensemble neural networks is presented by cannon and whitfield 2002 feature selection was carried out with stepwise predictor selection resulting in the use of 2 5 x 2 5 250 km 250 km gridded cells of geopotential heights mean sea level pressure and specific humidity at 500 hpa 850 hpa and 1000 hpa the study concluded that neural networks are more suitable than stepwise linear regression for nonlinear systems with complex interactions between inputs and outputs following this a number of studies used machine learning to reconstruct monthly streamflow and project hydrological climate impacts ghosh and mujumdar 2008 trained support vector machine svm and relevant vector machine rvm models on atmospheric reanalysis data to reconstruct monthly streamflow in the monsoon season the trained models were subsequently used to project hydrological climate impacts with climate model outputs interpolated to the grid points of the reanalysis data feature selection was performed on a prior selection of large scale atmospheric variables with known physical connections to the monsoon flooding regime principal component analysis pca was carried out on 2 0 x 2 0 200 km 200 km gridded cells of standardized mean sea level pressure air temperature specific humidity and 500 hpa geopotential to transform the correlated predictors into an n dimensional set of uncorrelated vectors whereby most of the variability of the original dataset is contained within the first few dimensions fuzzy clustering of the principal components was performed using three classes the resulting 12 inputs comprised 10 principal components and two memberships as the sum of three memberships is one similar approaches to feature extraction with pca and fuzzy clustering for hydrological climate impact modelling with svm have been followed by okkan and inan 2015 sahoo and sen 2017 and das and nanduri 2018 in the case of norway monthly streamflow has been directly downscaled from moving windows of atmospheric reanalysis data by huang et al 2020 using rvm precipitation was excluded as an input variable in order to make use of variables that are more accurately simulated by global circulation models temperature pressure and humidity the best performance was obtained in snowmelt driven catchments in inland regions of norway the poor performance in small rainfall driven catcments was associated with the relative difference in inter annual versus intra annual variability in monthly streamflow as is evident from table 1 most attempts at direct downscaling or climate impact modelling with machine learning have targeted monthly seasonal or annual streamflow often using variations of correlation analysis for feature selection ren et al 2018 justified selected features with expert knowledge and prior assumptions to assess climate impact on monthly streamflow in china nilsson et al 2008 used canonical correlation analysis to extract features for seasonal streamflow modelling with mlp in scandinavia moradi et al 2020 extracted relevant features using correlation analysis and pca for annual streamflow modelling with mlp to a reservoir in the middle east the majority of the previous studies on monthly seasonal or annual streamflow modelling have used monthly aggregations of atmospheric inputs on finer temporal scales few attempts can be found in the literature tisseuil et al 2010 modelled daily mean flow and fortnightly flow statistics from 2 5 x 2 5 250 km 250 km gridded atmospheric reanalysis data and projected hydrological climate impact under two scenarios with neural networks almost a decade later liao et al 2019 employed only surface variables from 0 75 x 0 75 75 km 75 km gridded reanalysis data to model daily streamflow and assess the hydrological impact of climate change using climate model outputs overall despite increasing spatiotemporal resolution of available reanalysis data attempts at reconstructing daily streamflow from large scale atmospheric circulation with machine learning remain sparse reichstein et al 2019 identified five main challenges for successful application of deep learning in geosciences i interpretability self explanatory and transparent model structures that allow for causal discovery from observational data ii physical consistency integration of domain knowledge iii complex and uncertain data methods to cope with complex statistics and sources of uncertainty iv limited labels methods to exploit data with unsupervised or semi supervised learning and v computational demand technical challenges of big data computing however recognizing the lack of non autoregressive machine learning models for direct downscaling to daily streamflow in the literature and embracing the fact that a model should be as simple as possible but nevertheless reliable this paper focuses on the two first points highlighted by reichstein et al 2019 namely interpretability and physical consistency within the context of traditional machine learning techniques hence a thorough investigation of deep learning is reserved for future studies while other studies have focused primarily on monthly seasonal or annual streamflow modelling this study focuses on the identification of major drivers of daily streamflow among relevant atmospheric and surface variables in relation to distinct flood generating processes the objective of this paper is to identify major drivers and investigate the forcing response relationship between large scale atmospheric circulation and daily streamflow with traditional machine learning techniques of increasing model complexity specifically this paper answers the following research question what are major drivers of daily streamflow in six selected norwegian catchments with different climate types flood generating processes and catchment characteristics and how does the direct translation from atmospheric forcing to streamflow response relate to model complexity in other words this paper provides a sampled screening of the potential of direct downscaling from large scale atmospheric variables to streamflow at a daily temporal scale in norway the aim is to present a methodology for identification of major drivers of daily streamflow and assess the accuracy of reconstructed streamflow in relation to model complexity major drivers are identified using an automatic feature selection procedure that returns atmospheric variables deemed relevant at informative pressure levels and aggregations in the atmospheric column above the relevant catchment three popular traditional machine learning techniques with differing structural complexities are explored the ensemble based piecewise linear random forest rf the nonlinear kernel based support vector machine svm for regression and multilayer perceptron mlp neural network multiple linear regression is used as a baseline model for the comparisons this paper is structured as follows the remainder of section 1 introduces the case study 1 1 section 2 presents materials and methods in subsections of data 2 1 feature selection 2 2 model development 2 3 and evaluation 2 4 results are shown in section 3 a discussion follows in section 4 with three subsections focusing on model performance 4 1 interpretability and physical consistency 4 2 and potential and limitations 4 3 respectively lastly section 5 provides concluding remarks and gives directions for future research 1 1 case study with 1660 hydropower plants accounting for more than 95 of installed capacity there are numerous regulated rivers in norway norwegian ministry of petroleum and energy 2015 however when linking large scale atmospheric circulation and river flow with machine learning it is pivotal that unregulated rivers are used so that signals from atmospheric forcing are less distorted by human activity the norwegian hydrological reference dataset for climate impact studies fleig et al 2013 consists of daily records from 188 active and unregulated streamflow gauges deemed suitable for climate impact studies from these 188 stations 40 stations distributed over six regions of norway were extracted as potential candidates for this study based on a filtering procedure considering record lengths record gaps flow duration curves and mean annual flows from 1950 and onwards the resulting dataset contained four stations in finnmark five stations in nordland eight stations in trøndelag ten stations in vestlandet ten stations in østlandet and three stations in sørlandet six representative stations one for each region finnmark nordland trøndelag østlandet vestlandet sørlandet were selected based on the correlation matrices for each region on the grounds of having the overall highest correlation with other stations in the region fig 1 shows the geographical location of the six selected hydrological stations at the catchment outlets and the corresponding annual mean flow normalized by catchment area important hydro climatic characteristics for each catchment are given in table 2 station 234 18 is located in the tana river basin and is the northernmost catchment considered in this study this catchment has clearly the most pronounced snowmelt driven flood regime station 152 4 measures the outflow from lake fustvatn which discharges further downstream into the fjord vefsnfjorden through the river fusta both rainfall and snowmelt contribute to flood generation in this catchment although rainfall has a tendency to dominate over snowmelt due to the coastal climate station 308 1 measures the flow in lake lenglingen which is part of a network of lakes in mid inland norway the main flood generating process is snowmelt in this catchment station 311 6 measures the river flow at nybergsund which is part of a larger river system that ultimately discharges into lake vånern in sweden the main flood generating process is snowmelt albeit marginally as mixed processes also play an important role the station 83 2 is located in the coastal west and the main flood generating process is rainfall the most distinct rainfall driven flood regime is found in the southernmost catchment station 22 22 measures river flow in søgne which connects to the fjord høllefjorden and eventually drains to the north sea the selected catchments differ with respect to size climate types and flood generating processes the catchments in vestlandet and sørlandet are located in coastal regions with a temperate oceanic climate however given the tilt of the mountain range near the western coast of norway winds carrying moisture eastward and northward have differing effects on the two catchments all other catchments are located in areas with a subarctic climate where both snowmelt and rainfall contribute to generation of high flows to various degrees similar characteristics are found for the selected catchments in finnmark and trøndelag the catchment in østlandet exhibits a distinctly different hydrological behavior in which mixed processes play a larger role although this station generally exhibits characteristics similar to the stations in finnmark and trøndelag likewise the catchment in nordland differs from the other catchments by being a high latitude predominantly rainfall driven catchment with some contribution from snowmelt in terms of hydrological behavior this catchment resembles the catchments in vestlandet and sørlandet in terms of catchment size the smallest catchment 204 km2 is found in sørlandet and the largest catchment 14161 km2 is found in finnmark see table 2 2 materials and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 hydrological data the flow duration curves of the six selected stations are shown in fig 2 mann kendall tests hussain and mahmud 2019 of maximum annual flows and average annual flows show no statistically significant monotonically increasing trends between 1979 and 2018 see table 3 descriptive statistics are summarized table 4 2 1 2 atmospheric data atmospheric data was retrieved from two reanalysis datasets of differing spatial resolution a fine resolution reanalysis dataset ecmwf era5 hersbach et al 2020 and a coarser resolution reanalysis dataset ecmwf era interim hereby abbreviated erai dee et al 2011 the column above each hydrological station was downloaded for a standard selection of variables at 20 pressure levels between 1000 hpa and 50 hpa the atmospheric reanalysis data were aggregated to daily values by summing or averaging extensive and intensive variates respectively table 5 provides an overview of the atmospheric reanalysis data and variates used for feature selection see table a1 in appendix a for list of symbols table 6 shows the geographical coordinates of the atmospheric columns 2 2 feature selection the hydrological and atmospheric data spans the period january 1 1979 to december 31 2017 to ensure a testing set of five consecutive years and also reserve the maximum flows at each hydrological station for the training set the data was split as shown in fig 3 two years 1979 1981 were set aside for cross validation to prevent overfitting five years 2009 2014 were reserved for testing the remaining 31 years were used for training the simplest machine learning model considered in this study random forest rf was first used to select features as identical input variable selections to all machine learning models as well as the baseline model feature selection was carried out on the training data with two loops of random forests based on the following assumptions 1 streamflow is albeit to various degrees directly forced by large scale atmospheric circulation as represented in the gridded pressure columns above the catchments 2 aggregations and or lags of atmospheric variables can only influence present streamflow if aggregated backwards in time 3 catchment response times and hydrological regimes vary from station to station even within a near homogenous region therefore each station requires a unique set of aggregated atmospheric inputs to establish a representation of catchment characteristics in the forcing response relationship both aggregations of atmospheric variables and lags between atmospheric variables and streamflow were systematically investigated using a range from two days to three months 88 days backwards in time first an outer loop was used to build n random forest rf models whereby n moving windows of i cumulative sums and averages and ii lags were fed to a rf consisting of 25 trees roughly pruned by limiting the depth of each regression tree to 10 following this the weights per model were sorted and the top ten features from n 88 models were fed to a new rf this inner loop facilitates a fair comparison of the relative importance of different aggregations and lags across the n 10 highest weighted features this procedure was followed for each reanalysis dataset table 7 displays the summed weights of the top 50 500 highest weighted features extracted from era5 for each hydrological station corresponding information on automated feature selection from erai is given in table 8 as can be seen the top 50 highest weighted features account for approximately 80 of the model input across the reanalysis datasets with a cross validation coefficient of determination r2 ranging from 0 76 to 0 95 based on this general pattern the top 50 highest weighted features were extracted as input variables for multiple linear regression mlr random forest rf support vector machine svm and multilayer perception mlp neural network to aid visual interpretation the top 30 highest weighted features extracted from era5 and erai for each hydrological station accounting for 80 of summed weights are shown in fig 4 interestingly lagged variables led to a far lower out of the bag r2 than did cumulative sums and averages not shown consequently only cumulative sums and averages and not lagged variables comprise the coarse resolution and fine resolution feature selection for each model at each hydrological station as seen in fig 4 shortwave radiation sw and temperature variates t at the surface t2m and in the boundary layer 1000 850 hpa are the most important variables with some variation between era5 and erai for the snowmelt driven flood regime at station 234 18 in finnmark the two month moving window of shortwave radiation from erai corresponds to the two month moving window of temperature at 950 hpa from era5 and may be interpreted as reflecting seasonality in the north the one to three weeks moving windows of surface temperature reflect melting a similar consistency is seen for the snowmelt driven flood regime at station 308 1 in trøndelag and station 311 6 in østlandet the persistence of near surface temperature and vertical wind variates in aggregation windows of one to two months is evident for all stations where snowmelt is the main flood generating process this may be interpreted as snow accumulation for which precipitation moisture and uplift in the boundary layer and persistent temperatures around 0 c are needed at longer aggregations mid level troposphere temperatures and relative humidity are also important this may link to troposphere stratosphere interactions and effects on the jet stream at 60 n but conclusive statements upon this cannot be drawn for the rainfall driven flood regime at station 152 4 in nordland shorter moving windows of moisture variates dew point temperature and eastward winds between 700 hpa and 950 hpa are of importance this distinct difference relative to the snowmelt driven flood regimes is confirmed by the extracted features for station 83 2 in vestlandet and 22 22 in sørlandet the seasonality in these rainfall driven flood regimes is represented through moisture and wind variates as opposed temperature variates in the case of snowmelt driven flood regimes reflecting the coastal influence on temperature and the seasonal variation in winds moreover the dominant aggregation period in rainfall driven flood regimes does not extend beyond roughly three weeks in essence these feature selections reflect that the contribution of snowmelt to streamflow generation requires temperatures around or below the freezing point throughout the winter season t2m followed by an increase in incoming short wave radiation sw and consistent corresponding shifts in the temperature profile in the spring t the contribution of rainfall to streamflow generation on the other hand is linked with the presence and transport u v of moisture sources tcv tcw rh td2m as well as uplift w in the boundary layer 1000 850 hpa the features extracted for station 22 22 in sørlandet are less consistent between the two reanalysis datasets for periods longer than roughly two weeks it should be mentioned that where orographic rainfall occurs the local variability in rainfall can be triggered by sub grid orographic features the role of catchment characteristics is only implicitly embedded in the statistical linking of the atmosphere and the hydrological regimes sub grid orographic features will be more pronounced in smaller steeper catchments and this in term is less likely to be revealed in the established statistical links at daily level the feature selection using nested loops of random forests was intentionally mild to minimize the early rejection of possibly useful predictors 2 3 model development 2 3 1 preprocessing of model inputs the atmospheric data were scaled by removing the median of each feature and dividing by the interquartile range 25th to 75th percentiles this standardization is more appropriate in the presence of outliers the resulting input data has zero mean zero median and a standard deviation of 1 while outliers are preserved without skewing the distribution since the hydrological data is skewed heteroscedastic and strictly positive a box cox transformation was applied before splitting into training cross validation and testing sets 2 3 2 baseline the baseline model in this study is a multiple linear regression mlr model the preprocessed selected features top 50 highest weighted features for each hydrological station subject to transformation were used to construct a mlr model for each of the two reanalysis datasets 2 3 3 random forest a random forest rf consists of n numbers of regression trees from which the average prediction for a given set of inputs is returned the regression trees collectively work as an ensemble of piecewise linear models where instances are sorted until a leaf with a linear regression model is reached this structure makes rf less sensitive to parameters and hence relatively robust for each hydrological station an rf was trained on the preprocessed selected features from the atmospheric column above the relevant station pruning was carried out by limiting the depth and increasing the number of samples required for splitting into nodes and leaves with the use of cross validation all the rf models were built using bootstrap samples so that samples as opposed to the full dataset of the extracted features were used to train each individual regression tree the mean square error was used as the loss function the models were implemented in python using randomforestregressor in sklearn pedregosa et al 2011 2 3 4 support vector machine although originally developed for classification problems support vector machine svm cortes and vapnik 1995 is also applicable to regression problems the idea behind this algorithm is to maximize the margins to an n 1 dimensional hyperplane for an n dimensional dataset so that the distance between the closest vectors or support vectors and the hyperplane is maximized to maximize this distance a loss function is used whereby smaller distances between the support vectors and the hyperplane are costlier than larger distances for regression problems this hyperplane is a regression curve defined by the support vectors kernels such as a radial basis function may be used to handle non linearity if data is not linearly separable after standardization and mapping to a higher dimensional space in essence the kernel then behaves as a weighted k nearest neighbor algorithm for unseen data in infinite dimensions in which closer observations have a larger influence on the prediction of unseen data for each hydrological station an svm was trained on the preprocessed selected features from the atmospheric column above the relevant station two parameters in the svm model were tuned with the use of cross validation these parameters respectively control i the strength of l2 regularization and ii the epsilon tube denoting the difference between the predicted and observed value for which no penalty occurs during training the svm models were implemented with a radial basis function in python using svr in sklearn pedregosa et al 2011 2 3 5 multilayer perceptron multilayer perceptron mlp is a feed forward neural network inputs propagate through the hidden layers by means of activation functions each hidden node is associated with a bias and weights per input and the activation function transfers the signal until the output layer is reached to avoid saturation of neurons the inputs should be standardized and normalized to avoid overfitting regularization methods such as dropout or weight decay can be applied for each hydrological station an mlp was trained on the preprocessed selected features using stochastic gradient decent hyperbolic tangent activation functions and rectified linear units were used in the hidden layers along with l2 regularization mlp differs from rf and svm by being more complex less transparent due to randomized noise in the hidden layers and more sensitive to parameters parameters were tuned using the cross validation set in addition to the use of cross validation for parameter tuning early stopping was employed when the loss on an arbitrary 10 of the training data stopped decreasing above a threshold value 0 0005 0 5 training was stopped with one to three hidden layers per model the mlp models constructed may be referred to as shallow neural networks the models were implemented in python using mlpregressor in sklearn pedregosa et al 2011 2 3 6 model complexity in the context of machine learning the term model complexity is often used to reflect the dimensionality of the space of possible models expressed as the number of degrees of freedom measured by the adjustable hyper parameters as each of the models described above was developed for each station and dataset with a unique set of hyper parameters and inputs a conceptual classification of relative model complexity based on general model characteristics shared between models employing the same algorithm was used to assess the improvements to accuracy with increasing model complexity see table 9 this allows for a separation between model performance resulting from strong and near linear coupling between the large scale atmospheric circulation and the catchment small inter model differences and model performance resulting from the structural complexity in which non linearity is handled consistently larger inter model differences the word reconstruct is used to refer to this translation from large scale atmospheric circulation to streamflow using major identified drivers only it should not be confused with prediction in which catchment characteristics will also contribute as explicit model inputs an illustrative flowchart of the methodology is provided in fig 5 2 4 evaluation four metrics commonly applied for evaluation of hydrological models were used to assess the performance of the machine learning models pearson s r r equation 1 normalized root mean square error nrmse equation 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse equation 3 and kling gupta efficiency kge equation 4 pearson s r measures the strength of a positive or negative linear relationship between the reconstructed and observed flows however it does not distinguish systematic errors therefore the root mean square error normalized by mean flow was used to indicate discrepancies in flow magnitudes between reconstructed and observed flows nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 is useful to assess model performance in relation to a mean flow benchmark whereby positive values indicate accuracy above estimating a particular value in the data series as the mean of all data points lastly the kling gupta efficiency is a decomposition of the nse into correlation variability bias and mean bias and is intended to improve certain shortcomings gupta et al 2009 hence kge has gained popularity for model evaluation in the hydrological community however kge does not have the intuitive mean flow benchmark nse 0 in fact using the mean flow as benchmark predictor results in kge 1 2 0 41 knoben et al 2019 therefore kge cannot be regarded a substitute for nse nor can it be directly compared rather all aforementioned components of kge should be considered and a concurrent use of kge and nse may constitute a better foundation for model evaluation in the equations below n denotes the sample size qrec

corresponding daily flows are shown for multiple linear regression mlr random forest rf support vector machine svm and multilayer perceptron mlp separately in fig 7 fig 8 fig 9 and fig 10 respectively at first glance the flow duration curves seem similar however flows below exceedance probabilities of 10 and above 90 are consistently smaller and larger than the observed flows for mlr this is not observed for the machine learning models a closer look at the time series of daily streamflow as reconstructed from the identified major drivers reveal that mlr fails to capture peaks and only gives a rough representation of the seasonal variation in streamflow while the baseline model mlr clearly is outperformed by the machine learning models both at high flows and low flows some differences in relation to model complexity and hydrological regimes are also evident the simpler model rf captures the seasonal behavior in snowmelt driven flood regimes 234 18 308 1 and 311 6 but tends to underestimate the magnitude of the annual peaks svm on the other hand captures the timing of these peaks better but does so at the expense of some overestimation particularly the annual peak in 2010 in finnmark the most accurate and timely reconstruction of streamflow that clearly distinguishes between high flows and low flows is obtained with mlp rf also fails to capture the magnitude of the larger peaks at stations 152 4 83 2 and 22 22 comparing the peaks in these rainfall driven flood regimes as reconstructed from the identified major drivers by rf svm and mlp it is evident that increasing model complexity leads to more distinct peaks furthermore a more accurate separation of high flows and low flows is obtained with mlp for the identification of major large scale atmospheric drivers of daily streamflow era5 is not consistently favored over erai however effects related to the scale of the atmospheric input relative to the size of a given catchment was not specifically investigated in this analysis nevertheless differences in reconstructed flows for each station may be viewed in relation to the consistency between identified drivers from the two reanalysis datasets this is most apparent for station 22 22 where identified drivers beyond two weeks are scattered in space and time across era5 and erai see fig 4 section 2 2 in the case of station 311 6 where mixed processes also contribute to the generation of high flows the reconstructed streamflow is consistently higher with era5 and the inter model differences between rf svm and mlp are generally smaller than for the other stations metrics for training and testing of mlr rf svm and mlp are given per station in tables 10 15 the best scores on the testing sets are highlighted in bold the poorest performance is seen for station 22 22 only mlp captures some of the streamflow dynamics at this station and to a larger extent with the coarser reanalysis data erai scatter plots comparing the performance of rf svm and mlp against the baseline model on the testing set are provided in fig 11 the corresponding score ranges obtained using identified drivers of daily streamflow are displayed for each metric in fig 12 in summary the highest performance in terms of correlation r normalized root mean square error nrmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge is obtained with mlp furthermore the lowest drop on the aforementioned metrics from training to testing is also obtained with mlp it should be emphasized that the scores obtained with simpler metrics r and nrmse on the testing set at times differ marginally between the machine learning models however when summarizing the highest scores on the more sophisticated metrics nse and kge from tables 10 15 the more complex models svm and mlp perform consistently better 4 discussion 4 1 model performance the direct translation from identified major drivers to daily streamflow was most accurately made with the most complex model mlp with a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse on the testing set ranging from 0 71 to 0 81 on all stations except for station 22 22 representing the smallest catchment although all models performed substantially worse on station 22 22 mlp still obtained the highest nse there as well 0 59 patterns of increasing accuracy with model complexity were found indicating that structural complexity is needed to exploit information in the identified major drivers although the machine learning models showed marginal differences on simpler metrics like correlation from the results it is clear that a simple multiple linear regression mlr is unsuitable for direct downscaling from large scale atmospheric variables to daily streamflow this is in alignment with previous findings cannon and whitfield 2002 and does not require further elaboration here the drops in nse from training to testing provide an indication of the robustness of the machine learning models mlp had an average drop of 0 03 with era5 and less than 0 01 with erai a slightly larger drop in nse 0 04 0 05 was observed for svm and the largest drop 0 11 was observed for rf mostly due to the inability to generalize for station 22 22 these drops inversely reflect the robustness of the models in other words the most accurate model mlp is also the most robust model this may seem counter intuitive as mlp is more sensitive to parameters than rf but nevertheless supports conclusions from previous studies showing that there are limitations to linear models when applied to nonlinear systems with complex interactions between inputs and outputs cannon and whitfield 2002 in essence a shallow neural network may generalize well when parameters are tuned optimal or near optimal with the use of cross validation the fact that the drop in nse was somewhat larger with the fine resolution reanalysis data 0 25 may be an artifact of scale issues nogueira 2020 assessed the differences in spatiotemporal resolution and convective and microphysical parameterizations between era5 and erai by relating systematic and random components of the differences in rainfall against the differences in temperature water vapor evaporation moisture flux divergence and pressure vertical velocity the study concluded that the spatial and temporal representation of rainfall as well as other variables in era5 and erai have similar error and bias except in the tropics where era5 provides improvements due to the increased quantity and quality of assimilated observations in other words erai may be preferred to era5 for the specific use and purpose of this study when only a single atmospheric column is to be considered the substantially lower model performance at station 22 22 in sørlandet must be viewed from a catchment perspective station 22 22 is located in a catchment that differs from the other catchments in a number of ways firstly it is the smallest catchment of the six considered has the second largest annual flow normalized by catchment area and the lowest lag autocorrelation as compared to the other stations this indicates a rapidly responding system needless to say the role of atmospheric forcing on finer spatiotemporal scales may therefore be of greater importance here than for the other stations secondly it has the most dominantly rainfall driven flood regime sivakumar et al 2001 identified the possible existence of chaos in rainfall runoff processes this in turn complicates streamflow reconstruction in rainfall driven flood regimes thirdly both feature selections from era5 and erai show the lowest dominant aggregation period for this station with the largest disagreement on aggregated atmospheric variables beyond roughly two weeks this indicates that coupling between the large scale atmospheric circulation and the catchment not only occurs on a shorter time scales but also that catchment characteristics like slope permeability land use and antecedent soil moisture sub grid features like topography and local variability may play an equally or more important role in streamflow generation at the temporal resolution of one day a traditional hydrological modelling approach could be used to investigate the relative importance of local variability sub grid topography and catchment characteristics in depth for prediction tasks catchment characteristics must undoubtedly be included for all stations however the relative improvements in accuracy with the inclusion of catchment characteristics can be expected to be higher for station 22 22 this in turn may from a hydrological climate impact perspective point to the potential of direct downscaling with shallow neural networks in catchments where forcing from large scale atmospheric circulation dominates local variability sub grid features and catchment characteristics in daily streamflow generation to the degree that an nse in the range of 0 7 0 8 can be obtained on daily testing data spanning five consecutive years as such the methodology presented in this paper may be used to filter out suitable catchments for direct downscaling in the context of hydrological climate impact modelling among the six catchments considered the smallest inter model difference in performance was observed for station 311 6 in østlandet while the overall intra model performance was consistent for all but station 22 22 in sørlandet station 311 6 would therefore be most suitable for direct downscaling while station 22 22 would not be suitable without complementary modelling using more physically based approaches the inability to reconstruct the magnitude of annual peak flows accurately with a tendency towards underestimation by rf overestimation by svm and a modest combination of both by mlp is partially a reflection of the loss functions used to optimize the models mean flow metrics and may hence improve with customized loss functions particularly penalizing error on high flows while a complex model structure should not be used to compensate for an inadequate selection of input variables a thorough investigation with deep learning should be undertaken in which variates selected based on i expert knowledge prior assumptions ii identified major drivers from an automated feature selection procedure as presented in this paper and iii all available data respectively are investigated in relation to increasing model complexity additionally some catchments are influenced by complex catchment characteristics that lag or amplify the catchment response dynamically in space and time for such catchments complex statistics are required to infer a forcing response relationship from the atmosphere and the direct linking between large scale atmospheric circulation and daily streamflow with traditional machine learning techniques is unsuitable to separate atmospheric forcing from anthropogenic forcing the selected catchments should not be heavily developed regulated or otherwise strongly influenced by human activity 4 2 interpretability and physical consistency the automated feature selection procedure presented in this paper differs from methods used in previous studies see table 1 section 1 in contrast with canonical correlation analysis stepwise predictor selection maximal information coefficient or simply prior assumptions this study has used the weights assigned by roughly pruned bootstrapped random forests to extract relevant features furthermore dimensionality reduction was not carried out rather the resulting feature selections comprised aggregated variables from two daily to three monthly moving windows consequently the feature selections retain both cross correlations and autocorrelations within the data and this translates into information in the most complex model mlp the setup using two different atmospheric reanalysis datasets provides a validation of the feature selection procedure although some variability was seen between the extracted features from era5 and erai the general patterns of the extracted temperature variates and shortwave radiation for station 234 18 in finnmark station 308 1 in trøndelag and station 311 6 in østlandet were consistent and interpretable for snowmelt driven flood regimes likewise the importance of shorter moving windows of moisture variates dew point temperature and boundary layer winds was consistent for the rainfall driven flood regimes at station 152 4 in nordland station 83 2 in vestlandet and station 22 22 in sørlandet seasonality was represented with aggregations of temperature variates for snowmelt driven flood regimes and moisture and wind variates for rainfall driven flood regimes at two to three months the inconsistency in features extracted for station 22 22 in sørlandet beyond two weeks may as mentioned above indicate the relative importance of catchment characteristics or the inability of the selected traditional machine learning techniques to treat complex statistics furthermore all atmospheric reanalysis datasets contain biases when biases across two reanalysis datasets differ the resulting feature selections will differ accordingly moreover the feature selection procedure with looped random forests assumed the same pruning depth for all regression trees and a constant retrieval of ten candidate variables per moving window this number could be considered a function of catchment size dominant streamflow generating mechanism and annual flow giving larger candidate retrieval per moving window in smaller rainfall driven fast responding catchments it should be emphasized that the method directly linking large scale atmospheric variables to streamflow on daily level presented in this paper is not intended as a replacement for traditional hydrological modelling tools this study has identified major large scale atmospheric drivers using traditional machine learning techniques for streamflow prediction the importance of catchment characteristics and their role in transforming atmospheric inputs into a spatial and temporal pattern of streamflow cannot be overstated however the possibility of establishing such direct links between the atmosphere and the hydrological regimes on a daily level unlocks opportunities for direct downscaling to daily streamflow from climate model outputs this will provide a deeper understanding of how climatic changes in large scale atmospheric circulation can drive changes in streamflow at the catchment scale as such machine learning techniques can supplement conventional hydrological models by providing a complementary approach to interpreting potential future changes directly from global circulation models thus a complementary approach that shortens the state of the art modelling chain with downscaling bias correction and hydrological modelling will allow for evaluation of a larger ensemble of models and hence provide better uncertainty estimates as well as avoid some of the potential errors and biases introduced in the modelling chain as a result a stronger physical basis for explaining patterns of non stationarity in the current and past climate may be obtained and thus further be used to distinguish natural variability from climate change induced trends 4 3 potential and limitations snowmelt driven floods in norway are decreasing in magnitude and frequency vormoor et al 2016 this trend is expected to continue into the future as rising temperatures lead to less snow accumulation hanssen bauer et al 2017 lawrence 2020 also causing a shift in the timing of spring floods as snowmelt driven floods decrease a transient change towards predominantly rainfall driven streamflow generation also in northern or mountainous areas can be expected however this transition need not be linear or monotonic due to the competing effects of increases in winter precipitation versus temperature while none of the hydrological stations used in this study showed statistically significant trends several hydrological stations in europe have shown both statistically significant increases and decreases blöschl et al 2019 future applications of the methodology presented in this paper may therefore need to include learning of trends as a minimum requirement to cope with non stationarity in the current model setup only one atmospheric column per station was considered representative of the relevant large scale atmospheric circulation a more elaborate approach may involve a grid search with the use of meta heuristics resulting in more than one representative atmospheric column per station and hence a more spatially distributed identification of major drivers this may be particularly useful in large catchments with contrasting characteristics in which daily streamflow results from several distinct and independent drivers that may form compound events an example of this would be partly mountainous catchments with low lying valleys where rivers directly connect to the sea so that drainage is affected by pressure while climate indices may complementary to large scale atmospheric variables feed as model input to identify major drivers care should be taken as robust representation of large scale atmospheric circulation is needed also in a changing climate despite the fact that existing discipline knowledge may be used to assess the consistency and interpretability of feature selections as employed in this study a clear separation of correlation and causation cannot be inferred from the model structures this becomes increasingly problematic as the model complexity increases furthermore ensuring that the maximum peaks were included in the training data facilitated a fair comparison of the generalization obtained by the three machine learning models in other words extrapolation techniques in each algorithm were not explicitly addressed in this study but should be given attention in future studies the findings of this paper demonstrate the potential for direct downscaling from large scale atmospheric variables to daily streamflow with shallow neural networks this calls for an investigation of gain in accuracy with deep neural networks despite a growing interest in the scientific community deep learning is largely unexplored in the field of hydrology ardabili et al 2020 and the number of available algorithms and model structures are increasing particularly through hybridization as transparency tends to decrease reciprocally with model complexity a robust collection of benchmark studies with traditional machine learning techniques is needed with a sample of six hydrological stations from catchments with low anthropogenic influence the generalization of the findings of this paper is limited this calls for further benchmark studies involving more hydrological stations for the case of norway the additional 34 regionally filtered stations from the norwegian hydrological reference dataset for climate impact studies fleig 2013 may be tested with the methodology presented here as such this paper provides a step towards a collection of robust benchmarks for deep learning models in the context of daily streamflow reconstruction and statistical downscaling from large scale atmospheric variables in norway 5 conclusion this paper identified major drivers of daily streamflow in snowmelt driven and rainfall driven flood regimes in norway from large scale atmospheric variables in two reanalysis datasets of fine 0 25 and coarse 0 75 spatial resolution consistency between the feature selections from the two reanalysis datasets was confirmed the translation from large scale atmospheric forcing to daily streamflow using the identified drivers was investigated in relation to model complexity with three machine learning models random forest rf support vector machine svm for regression and multilayer perceptron mlp a sampled screening of six hydrological stations located in catchments with a low degree of anthropogenic influence was presented this paper provides a first step towards applying machine learning for direct downscaling from large scale atmospheric circulation on a daily temporal scale in norway and may hence serve as a benchmark for later developments of deep learning models in answering the research question posed introductorily the following is concluded major drivers of daily streamflow in each of the six investigated catchments reflect unique forcing response relationships from the atmosphere but also exhibit similarities within dominantly snowmelt driven and rainfall driven flood regimes respectively in catchments where high flows to a large extent are generated by snowmelt 234 18 finnmark 308 1 trøndelag and 311 6 østlandet two distinct aggregation periods of boundary layer and near surface temperature variates were evident at one to three weeks and two to three months respectively representing melting and seasonality a consistent aggregation window in between these two dominant aggregation periods was also found reflecting snow accumulation with moisture and temperature variates in catchments where high flows primarily are generated by rainfall 152 4 nordland 83 2 vestlandet and 22 22 sørlandet the dominant aggregation period does not extend beyond 3 weeks in these catchments the identified major drivers are moisture wind and temperature variates in the boundary layer with less short term influence from variables in the middle and upper troposphere seasonality is not represented through temperature variates but rather moisture and wind variates with aggregation windows around three months increasing accuracy with model complexity was found for all the six investigated catchments furthermore the most complex model mlp was found to be the most robust machine learning model with the lowest drop in nash sutcliffe efficiency nse from training to testing in all but the southernmost and smallest catchment mlp obtained an nse ranging from 0 71 to 0 81 with an average drop of less than 0 02 this supports previous findings stating that neural networks handle non linearity in complex systems better than linear or piecewise linear approaches the inter model and intra model differences in performance indicate the strength of the relationship between direct forcing from large scale atmospheric circulation and daily streamflow and may hence be used to filter out suitable catchments for direct downscaling in the context of hydrological climate impact modelling however since streamflow is the product of both atmospheric forcing and catchment characteristics the latter must be explicitly included in streamflow prediction using the identified major drivers among the six investigated catchments station 311 6 in østlandet was determined most suitable for direct downscaling while station 22 22 in sørlandet was determined unsuitable without further investigation of the relative importance of catchment characteristics sub grid features and local variability by traditional hydrological modelling approaches future research should focus on further development of benchmark studies and move towards exploration of deep learning for daily streamflow reconstruction with major drivers identified from large scale atmospheric forcing and catchment characteristics increasing the number of hydrological stations representing the various snowmelt driven and rainfall driven flood regimes will particularly aid in assessing the scalability of the findings presented in this paper furthermore clustering of hydrological stations based on catchment characteristics may allow the development of a transient model structure in which changes in dominant streamflow generating mechanisms or timing of annual peaks may feed into the automated feature selection procedure as such the input variable selections may be directed towards features and aggregation windows characteristic of rainfall driven flood regimes in line with decreasing snowmelt driven floods for all of these potential future studies the work presented here may serve as a benchmark credit authorship contribution statement jenny sjåstad

4719,carbon climate feedback is sensitive in the qinghai tibet plateau a series of temporal measurements from jinsha river and yalong river in conjunction with flow information were used to study the carbon dynamics and predict future carbon fluxes under ongoing climate change dic and doc concentrations showed considerable temporal variations with low dic and high doc concentrations in the high flow season and vice versa dic and doc concentrations had negative and positive relationships with runoff changes respectively showing the hydro biogeochemical controls on carbon dynamics with the increase of runoff the accelerated chemical weathering and the high carbonate buffering capacity should be responsible for the chemostatic behaviors of dic meanwhile warm weather would enhance organic carbon degradation and also thicken the active layer of permafrost in the source area both of which would produce doc in addition organic carbon degradation in the high flow season would produce dic with 13c depleted values δ13cdic also had significant temporal variations synchronous with runoff changes i e light values under high runoff conditions supporting that biological carbon plays an important role in carbon dynamics during the warm season based on the clear positive correlations between carbon fluxes and runoff we predicted that the sensitivities of doc fluxes to temperature changes are 12 2 c and 8 3 c for the jinsha river and yalong river respectively the sensitivities of dic fluxes to temperature changes are much lower which are 5 5 c and 6 1 c for the jinsha river and yalong river respectively this study sheds lights on the alpine riverine carbon cycling based on runoff shifting concentration isotope q c i relationships in the qinghai tibet plateau which has

introduction the riverine carbon dynamics and fluxes have great implications for carbon cycling on landscape scale which is an important linkage of atmospheric terrestrial and oceanic carbon reservoirs gao et al 2020 meybeck 1993 raymond and oh 2007 tank et al 2012 dissolved organic carbon doc mobilized from soils and transported to the rivers is a net source of co2 to the atmosphere through remineralization in coastal waters canadell et al 2019 raymond and oh 2007 tank et al 2012 contrarily dissolved inorganic carbon dic mainly derived from chemical weathering represents a terrestrial co2 sink which is closely linked to atmospheric co2 concentration over geological timescales drake et al 2018 li et al 2014 raymond and oh 2007 shih et al 2019 tank et al 2012 globally rivers transport 0 21 and 0 38 pg c yr to the ocean for doc and dic respectively shih et al 2019 and references therein although the riverine dic and doc fluxes to the ocean are small with respect to the terrestrial carbon storage they represent important net fluxes which are often as large as terrestrial net ecosystem productivity cole et al 2007 in addition the direct effect of riverine carbon on downstream and ocean is significant because dic can buffer the ph of the river and doc can affect water quality dawson et al 2008 raymond and oh 2007 raymond and saiers 2010 therefore the riverine carbon dynamics and fluxes have significant implications for carbon balance and water quality of the catchment and the ocean understanding the processes that regulate the carbon dynamics and fluxes and how they may change will be useful to predict future alteration in carbon cycling current studies were mainly conducted using limited temporal samples to decipher the biogeochemical processes which might introduce a large uncertainty into the fluxes calculation and processes analysis e g zhong et al 2018 in addition time series datasets will provide us more information about the climate forcing on carbon cycling zhong et al 2018 the climatic response of carbon dynamics and fluxes is usually considered a primary driver on carbon cycling on the landscape scale drake et al 2018 gao et al 2019 huntington et al 2016 laudon et al 2012 zhong et al 2018 short term climate variabilities could be expressed the changes of hydrology and temperature and hydrological change was deemed as the main controller on carbon cycling maher and chamberlain 2014 zhong et al 2020b it has long been recognized that hydrological processes such as supply storage and routing of water influence carbon cycling raymond and oh 2007 tank et al 2012 torres et al 2015 zhong et al 2020a 2020b the importance of hydrology on carbon cycling is evidenced from the dependence of both carbon fluxes and concentrations on river runoff changes gao and yu 2020 raymond and oh 2007 torres et al 2015 zhong et al 2020b concentration discharge c q defined herein as concentration runoff relationships i e c q relationships of carbon have been widely used to decipher the carbon dynamics under various runoff conditions dawson et al 2008 drake et al 2018 sun et al 2020 zhong et al 2020b climate warming is always associated with higher precipitation intensity westra et al 2013 and subsequently causes changes in carbon transport in the river system zhong et al 2020b the climate induced carbon cycling can be expressed by the c q relationships providing potential clues on future carbon cycling based on climate models zhong et al 2020b there is great concern in how the ongoing climate change may affect riverine carbon dynamics and fluxes from the terrestrial ecosystems huntington et al 2016 but it still remains unclear isotopes could provide us additional insights on biogeochemical processes chemical weathering processes and pollution inputs ma et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhong et al 2018 stable carbon isotope of dic δ13cdic was proved to be more sensitive to climate variability than dic concentration zhong et al 2018 consequently δ13cdic is successfully used to distinguish the carbon dynamics under short term climate variability qin et al 2020 song et al 2020 zhong et al 2018 because of the alpine climate i e cold and the high velocity of water induced by plateau topography i e high slope aquatic photosynthesis can be neglected in this study area climate variabilities play an important role on temporal carbon dynamics accordingly δ13cdic is a sensitive indicator to short term climate variabilities song et al 2020 zhong et al 2018 for example biological carbon soil co2 or mineralization of organic carbon can add 13c depleted carbon to the dic pool zhong et al 2018 in stream photosynthesis can increase the δ13cdic via preferentially using 13c depleted carbon wang et al 2020 although investigations of carbon cycling using δ13cdic have been conducted by many researchers studies on carbon cycling in rivers under various climatic conditions are still limited incorporating temporal carbon concentrations and δ13cdic through runoff shifting concentration isotope q c i relationships can contribute to fundamental understanding of carbon cycling under ongoing climate change the carbon cycling of the qinghai tibet plateau is highly sensitive to climate change and significant seasonal climate variabilities are induced by the influence of asian monsoon yao et al 2013 large areas of alpine permafrost are distributed in the qinghai tibet plateau and the monsoonal climate can bring both high temperature and rainfall which causes the co occurrence of active layer thaw and high discharge song et al 2020 the monsoonal climate would enhance aquatic carbon export zhong et al 2018 playing important roles in carbon cycling therefore the short term climate variabilities can result in the high temporal heterogenicities of carbon dynamics and fluxes gao et al 2019 but it can provide more information of future carbon cycling under ongoing climate change the understanding of climate forcing on aquatic carbon cycling in the qinghai tibet plateau is still limited therefore the temporal riverine carbon budgets and dynamics should be updated to better understand the carbon cycle under various climatic variabilities in riverine system of the qinghai tibet plateau herein we proposed a hypothesis that carbon dynamics and fluxes will have a sensitive response to global climate change this study takes advantage of temporal samples monthly to daily sampling from jinsha river and yalong river draining the eastern qinghai tibet plateau we report time series data of carbon concentrations and δ13cdic and use this data to understand how carbon dynamics and fluxes respond to short term climate variability and then infer the future carbon cycling under ongoing climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the jinsha river is the headwater of the changjiang yangtze river whereas yalong river is the largest tributary of the jinsha river the jinsha river and yalong river are located in the eastern qinghai tibet plateau fig 1 a where is characterized by significant spatial variations in geographical characteristics and climate conditions fig 1b glacier permafrost and salt lakes widely distribute in the upper reach of the study region fig 1c climate condition shows significant spatially and temporally seasonally variations in the study region which is highly affected by indian summer monsoon and mid latitude westerlies yao et al 2013 with 85 of annual precipitation occurring in the warm season between may and october because the average population density of the study region is low the anthropogenic input is considered to be negligible chen et al 2020a li et al 2014 ma et al 2020 noh et al 2009 wu et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 the study area of jinsha river represents 35 of the total length and 14 of the draining area of the changjiang river which is one of the largest rivers in the world noh et al 2009 the jinsha river originates from the southern glacier at the geladandong peak with an elevation of 6621 m of the tangula mountains in the northern qinghai tibet plateau the jinsha river covers an altitude range of around 3300 m between its upper and lower reaches ma et al 2020 and references therein which flow through four provinces qinghai tibet yunnan and sichuan generally the evaporation is intense in the upper reaches of the jinsha river i e from the origin to zhimenda with dry and cold climate i e mean annual temperature mat below 4 c mean annual precipitation map ranging from 200 mm to 500 mm noh et al 2009 in the downstream of the jinsha river i e shigu to panzhihua the map is 900 1300 mm a sharp change occurs from cold dry and alpine climate in the upper reaches to a warm and wet climate in the lower reaches consequently three types of main vegetation community exist in the jinsha river catchment alpine meadow in the source area arid semiarid scrub in the middle reaches and combination of coniferous and subtropical forest at the lower reaches originating from the bayan har mountains in the eastern qinghai tibet plateau the yalong river covers an area of 1 28 105 m2 with a mainstream length of 1571 km the altitude of the yalong river catchment varies from 4500 m to 1500 m from the source to the outlet of the catchment li et al 2014 the climate of the yalong river catchment is controlled by high altitude atmospheric circulation and asian monsoon the variations of elevation and latitude cause complex climate conditions in the yalong river basin similar to the jinsha river the yalong river catchment has a cold and dry climate condition in the upper reaches i e map of 500 800 mm and warm and wet climate in the lower reaches i e map of 900 1300 mm zhang et al 2019 approximately 68 and 20 of the catchment are covered by grassland and forest land respectively 2 2 sampling and analyses the sampling sites were located in the outlets of the two rivers before they merge in panzhihua city approximately 30 km away from panzhihua city for the jinsha river and 20 km away from the panzhihua city for the yalong river we collected monthly water samples in one year from november 2013 to october 2014 and additionally sampled in the high flow seasons may 2014 october 2014 according to the runoff changes because the boat was not available in the study area we collected the running water at the bank of the river water samples were stored in pre cleaned low density polyethylene bottles and then filtered through 0 7 μm glass fiber filters all the water samples were stored in 4 c before analyses alkalinity was titrated with 0 02 mol l hydrochloric acid within 24 h after sampling and dic concentration was calculated based on mass action relationships clark and fritz 1997 doc concentrations were determined by a toc analyzer oi analytical aurora 1030 college station texas 15 ml of river water sample for δ13cdic analysis was first injected into sealed vacuum glass bottles that were prefilled with magmatic stirrer bar and 2 ml 85 phosphoric acid to convert all dic species to gaseous co2 then the produced co2 was purified cryogenically in a vacuum system and transferred for carbon isotopic measurements li et al 2014 zhong et al 2018 finally the value of δ13cdic was measured using a conventional isotope ratio mas spectrometer finnigan mat 252 thermo finnigan usa in state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry at guiyang the δ13c value was reported in terms of deviation from the standard vienna peedee belemnite v pdb with a standard deviation of 0 1 the runoff data in this study was from the ministry of water resources http www hydroinfo gov cn 2 3 data processing 2 3 1 concentration runoff relationships following godsey

3 results 3 1 the temporal variations of dic doc and δ13cdic the jinsha river had runoff ranging from 0 040 to 0 72 m yr with an average value of 0 21 m yr table 1 the yalong river had much higher runoff of 0 098 2 08 m yr averaging 0 47 m yr table 1 the runoff was low from november 2013 to may 2014 which was defined as the low flow season and high from june 2014 to october 2014 which was the high flow season fig 2 a and b the dic concentrations varied from 23 4 to 35 0 mg c l with a cfw of 26 6 mgc l for the jinsha river which were slightly higher than those in the yalong river 19 9 32 3 mg c l table 1 the dic concentrations in the jinsha river showed high values in the low flow season and low values in the high flow season fig 2a in the yalong river dic concentrations were generally much higher in the low flow season than those in the high flow season but the period from april 2014 to jun 2014 showed the higher values fig 2b δ13cdic of the jinsha river 5 3 to 2 7 with a δ13cdic fw of 4 4 was much heavier than that of the yalong river 6 9 to 5 3 with a δ13cdic fw of 6 3 table 1 in addition δ13cdic showed synchronous variations with dic for both the jinsha river and yalong river fig 2a and b the doc concentrations ranged from 0 5 to 2 3 mg c l cfw of 1 4 mg c l for the jinsha river and range of 0 6 1 8 mg c l cfw of 1 2 mg c l was observed for the yalong river table 1 and the doc concentrations had low values in the low flow season and high values in the high flow season for both the jinsha river and yalong river fig 2a and b 3 2 concentration runoff relationships the dic concentrations decreased with the increases of runoff with high dic concentrations under low runoff conditions and low dic concentrations under high runoff conditions for the jinsha river and yalong river fig 3 a and b the slopes of dic concentration versus runoff were negative b 0 but were not statistically different from zero showing chemostatic behavior 0 2 b 0 2 the doc concentrations increased with runoff increases for both jinsha river and yalong river showing high values under high runoff conditions fig 3c and d positive power law relationships were observed in jinsha river and yalong river with positive doc versus runoff slopes b 0 fig 3c and d the doc concentrations showed enrichment behavior b 0 2 with increasing runoff conditions for the jinsha river fig 3c for the yalong river although positive b value was observed for correlation of doc versus runoff the doc concentrations showed chemostatic behavior 0 2 b 0 2 fig 3c 3 3 loadest model performance the loadest modeled dic and doc concentrations were shown in fig 4 a and b the temporal loadest modeled dic and doc concentrations had same patterns with temporal variations of the measured values the loadest modeled dic and doc had strong correlations with the measured dic and doc concentrations around the 1 1 lines fig 4c and d the equations selected for the loadest estimated dic and doc fluxes for the jinsha river and yalong river were shown in table 2 which was automatically selected by amle runkel et al 2004 both the dic and doc fluxes in the jinsha river were much lower than those in the yalong river the calculated dic fluxes were 5 78 0 07 tc km2 yr and 11 12 0 13 tc km2 yr for jinsha river and yalong river respectively table 2 which were much higher than the global mean annual flux of dic 2 6 tc km2 yr shih et al 2019 the doc fluxes were 0 26 0 01 tc km2 yr and 0 49 0 01 tc km2 yr for jinsha river and yalong river respectively table 2 lower than the global mean annual doc flux 1 4 tc km2 yr shih et al 2019 4 discussion 4 1 controls on the temporal carbon dynamics the correlations between solute concentration and runoff presented in this study eq 1 are used to constrain the processes that affect the solute concentration under various runoff conditions our results show dic concentrations decreased with increasing runoff conditions fig 3a and b which were consistent with those in most chinese rivers zhong et al 2020b the decrease of dic with increasing runoff reflects the depletion of dic supply due to the shortened fluid transit time tipper et al 2006 torres et al 2015 zhong et al 2020b but the chemostatic behavior of dic suggests the supply for the riverine dic with increasing runoff conditions chemical weathering is the main source of dic and increasing runoff intensifies the chemical weathering through increasing reactive surface area torres et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 2020b in addition the carbonate buffer systems in the riverine water can also maintain the dic concentrations therefore the dic concentrations show decreased but chemostatic behavior to increasing runoff conditions as the runoff increases in the two rivers the concentration of doc also increases fig 3c and d increasing riverine doc concentrations during hydrologic events is mainly derived from allochthonous terrestrial carbon chen et al 2020b and references therein flushing would remove doc transport limitation in the river system which should be ascribed to the increased soil reactive surface under high flow conditions canadell et al 2019 raymond and saiers 2010 in addition high runoff is always synchronous with high temperature in the high flow season which enhances terrestrial photosynthesis and organic carbon degradation chen et al 2020b guo et al 2010 laudon et al 2012 and accelerated organic carbon cycle would also increase doc production through increasing doc supply mu et al 2017 the doc concentrations showed enriched behavior with increasing runoff conditions in the jinsha river b 0 2 fig 3c but the doc concentrations showed increased but chemostatic behavior in the yalong river b 0 12 fig 3d in the jinsha river the elevation of source area is much higher than that of the yalong river fig 1b as a result the permafrost distributed in the jinsha river source region fig 1c would transport doc to the river system in the warm season through permafrost thawing gao et al 2019 mu et al 2017 o donnell et al 2012 song et al 2020 meanwhile the vast permafrost carbon pool in the jinsha river source region would affect the temporal doc variations and permafrost carbon export would also be responsible for the temporal doc dynamics fig 1c therefore doc concentrations show enrichment behavior to runoff increases in the jinsha river processes controlling the carbon dynamics can be expressed by the temporal δ13cdic variations campeau et al 2018 liu and han 2020 song et al 2020 zhong et al 2018 negative correlations between δ13cdic and runoff were observed for the jinsha river and yalong river fig 5 a showing that 13c depleted values occurred under high flow conditions the high runoff occurs synchronously with high temperature in this study region in the low flow season water and carbon are mainly from the downstream of the two rivers and the active layer of permafrost is frozen because of the cold and dry climate song et al 2020 the cold temperature reduces biomass productivity and biological activities so that low doc and heavy δ13cdic coincide in time however warm and wet climate in the high flow season would thaw the active layer of permafrost which would lead to organic carbon degradation producing high contents of biogenic co2 and then shifting 13c depleted dic song et al 2020 in addition warm and wet climate in the high flow season also accelerates the biological activities i e both vegetation and microbe producing high doc and light δ13cdic therefore δ13cdic has negative relationships with doc fig 5b and short term climate variability controls the temporal carbon dynamics positive linear relationships were observed between δ13cdic and dic for the jinsha river and yalong river with higher slope of δ13cdic versus dic in the jinsha river than that in the yalong river fig 6 heavy δ13cdic values accompanied with high dic concentrations which was observed in the high flow conditions fig 6 the runoff regulation of dic δ13cdic relationship q c i can be intuitively used to represent the underlying biogeochemical processes shifted by changes of hydrology high runoff would shift low dic concentrations but dic concentrations showed chemostatic behaviors with changing runoff conditions indicating the additional sources of dic influxes zhong et al 2018 meanwhile lighter δ13cdic values occurred under high runoff conditions showing that the additional sources had 13c depleted dic the wider δ13cdic range and higher c i slope in the jinsha river than those in the yalong river should be ascribed to the wide distribution of permafrost in the source region of jinsha river consistent with the high sensitivity of alpine catchment to climate change the results evidenced that biological carbon influx controls on the carbon dynamics of dic under short term climate variability 4 2 hydrology driven carbon fluxes the projected future trend and sensitivity of carbon fluxes to changes in runoff carbon yield flux gc m2 yr with respect to runoff changes provides valuable comparative information on carbon exports from catchments striegl et al 2007 the runoff in the yalong river was much higher than that in the jinsha river table 1 and accordingly higher dic and doc fluxes were observed in the yalong river table 1 suggesting that hydrology plays an important role in carbon fluxes the correlation of carbon fluxes versus runoff reveals the degree to which variability in carbon fluxes is driven by changes in runoff versus carbon concentrations gareis and lesack 2017 similar to the slopes of dic concentrations or doc concentrations versus runoff fig 3 the dic fluxes were much lower than the 1 1 line while the doc fluxes were much higher than the 1 1 line fig 6a and b the decreased dic concentrations and increased doc concentrations with increasing runoff should be responsible for the relationships of fluxes versus runoff however strong positive correlations were observed between dic or doc fluxes and runoff fig 6a and b indicating that hydrology controls temporal carbon fluxes for these two rivers the dic fluxes are controlled by source limitation while the doc fluxes are controlled by transport limitation overall although carbon concentrations can affect the temporal carbon fluxes carbon fluxes from a certain catchment are highly controlled by runoff changes the good relationships of carbon fluxes versus runoff in fig 7 allow us to use a strong power law function to estimate carbon fluxes when coupled with runoff in this case the effects of time in flux calculation of loadest can be eliminated we predict the future dic or doc flux using the power law functions with the annual modern regional jinsha river and yalong river and global ibarra et al 2016 runoff global warming will enhance hydrologic cycling and result in attendant runoff increases though the climate model shows high uncertainty manabe et al 2004 zhong et al 2020b runoff increases were predicted to be 6 8 c for high latitude regions manabe et al 2004 which is used to estimate the changes of carbon fluxes for global warming therefore increase of 14 7 c will induce a double of runoff for the two rivers based on this assumption we estimate the effects of temperature variability on carbon fluxes for the jinsha river and yalong river the sensitivities of temperature variability on dic fluxes are 5 5 c and 6 1 c for the jinsha river and yalong river respectively in case of doc the effects of temperature variabilities on doc fluxes are much higher i e 12 2 c and 8 3 c for the jinsha river and yalong river respectively the sensitivities of carbon fluxes to runoff f q are shown in fig 8 b runoff sensitivities on dic fluxes decrease with increasing runoff but runoff sensitivities on doc fluxes increase with runoff increases fig 8b the increasing f q of doc with increasing runoff indicates that future climate change will shift the doc dynamics and fluxes more intensely than dic both the runoff and temperature changes have higher effects on doc fluxes than dic fluxes because doc and dic fluxes are controlled by transport limitation and source limitation respectively high temperature and precipitation will enhance the photosynthesis and thicken the active layer depth of permafrost causing higher carbon dynamics to future climate change taken together the ongoing climate change will strongly change carbon fluxes in rivers of the qinghai tibet plateau and doc fluxes will be more sensitive to future climate change 5 conclusions climate acts as an important controlling factor on carbon cycling in this study we found that both dic and doc concentrations showed sensitive response to runoff changes through investigating the c q relationships chemostatic behaviors were observed for dic concentrations which should be mainly ascribed to the accelerated chemical weathering and the strong carbonate buffering capacity doc concentrations increased with increasing runoff for both the two rivers photosynthesis and respiration increased in the warm season and strong runoff flushed the large doc pool stored in land surface and soil which would highly affect the doc concentrations in addition warm weather in the high flow season could thicken the active layer depth of permafrost in the source area of the two rivers and consequently warming induced permafrost thaw would release doc to the river water affecting the riverine doc dynamics the evidence of seasonal δ13cdic variations also supported that high amounts of biological carbon influx played an important role in temporal carbon dynamics the carbon fluxes were strongly correlated with runoff indicating that hydrology controls on the carbon fluxes in the view of ongoing global climate change we analyzed the potential tendency of carbon fluxes based on the climate model the effects of temperature variability on doc fluxes i e 12 2 c and 8 3 c for the jinsha river and yalong river respectively were much higher than that on dic fluxes i e 5 5 c and 6 1 c for the jinsha river and yalong river respectively additionally we propose that the runoff sensitivity on carbon fluxes for doc will increase but the runoff sensitivity on dic fluxes will decrease this study shows that carbon fluxes in alpine rivers have high sensitivity for global climate change and more systematic researches should focus on climate sensitive alpine catchments credit authorship contribution statement jun zhong formal analysis methodology software writing original draft si liang

4719,carbon climate feedback is sensitive in the qinghai tibet plateau a series of temporal measurements from jinsha river and yalong river in conjunction with flow information were used to study the carbon dynamics and predict future carbon fluxes under ongoing climate change dic and doc concentrations showed considerable temporal variations with low dic and high doc concentrations in the high flow season and vice versa dic and doc concentrations had negative and positive relationships with runoff changes respectively showing the hydro biogeochemical controls on carbon dynamics with the increase of runoff the accelerated chemical weathering and the high carbonate buffering capacity should be responsible for the chemostatic behaviors of dic meanwhile warm weather would enhance organic carbon degradation and also thicken the active layer of permafrost in the source area both of which would produce doc in addition organic carbon degradation in the high flow season would produce dic with 13c depleted values δ13cdic also had significant temporal variations synchronous with runoff changes i e light values under high runoff conditions supporting that biological carbon plays an important role in carbon dynamics during the warm season based on the clear positive correlations between carbon fluxes and runoff we predicted that the sensitivities of doc fluxes to temperature changes are 12 2 c and 8 3 c for the jinsha river and yalong river respectively the sensitivities of dic fluxes to temperature changes are much lower which are 5 5 c and 6 1 c for the jinsha river and yalong river respectively this study sheds lights on the alpine riverine carbon cycling based on runoff shifting concentration isotope q c i relationships in the qinghai tibet plateau which has

rivers transport 0 21 and 0 38 pg c yr to the ocean for doc and dic respectively shih et al 2019 and references therein although the riverine dic and doc fluxes to the ocean are small with respect to the terrestrial carbon storage they represent important net fluxes which are often as large as terrestrial net ecosystem productivity cole et al 2007 in addition the direct effect of riverine carbon on downstream and ocean is significant because dic can buffer the ph of the river and doc can affect water quality dawson et al 2008 raymond and oh 2007 raymond and saiers 2010 therefore the riverine

concentrations on river runoff changes gao and yu 2020 raymond and oh 2007 torres et al 2015 zhong et al 2020b concentration discharge c q defined herein as concentration runoff relationships i e c q relationships of carbon have been widely used to decipher the carbon dynamics under various runoff conditions dawson et al 2008 drake et al 2018 sun et al 2020 zhong et al 2020b climate warming is always associated with higher precipitation intensity westra et al 2013 and subsequently causes changes in carbon transport in the river system zhong et al 2020b the climate induced carbon cycling can be expressed by the c q relationships providing potential clues on future carbon cycling based on climate models zhong et al 2020b there is great concern in how the ongoing climate change may affect riverine carbon dynamics and fluxes from the terrestrial ecosystems huntington et al 2016 but it still remains unclear isotopes could provide us additional insights on biogeochemical processes chemical weathering processes and pollution inputs ma et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhong et al 2018 stable carbon isotope of dic δ13cdic was proved to be more sensitive to climate variability than dic concentration zhong et al 2018 consequently δ13cdic is successfully used to distinguish the carbon dynamics under short term climate variability qin et al 2020 song et al 2020 zhong et al 2018 because of the alpine climate i e cold and the high velocity of water induced by plateau topography i e high slope aquatic photosynthesis can be neglected in this study area climate variabilities play an important role on temporal carbon dynamics accordingly δ13cdic is a sensitive indicator to short term climate variabilities song et al 2020 zhong et al 2018 for example biological carbon soil co2 or mineralization of organic carbon can add 13c depleted carbon to the dic pool zhong et al 2018 in stream photosynthesis can increase the δ13cdic via preferentially using 13c depleted carbon wang et al 2020 although investigations of carbon cycling using δ13cdic have been conducted by many researchers studies on carbon cycling in rivers under various climatic conditions are still limited incorporating temporal carbon concentrations and δ13cdic through runoff shifting concentration isotope q c i relationships can contribute to fundamental understanding of carbon cycling under ongoing climate change the carbon cycling of the qinghai tibet plateau is highly sensitive to climate change and significant seasonal climate variabilities are induced by the influence of asian monsoon yao et al 2013 large areas of alpine permafrost are distributed in the qinghai tibet plateau and the monsoonal climate can bring both high temperature and rainfall which causes the co occurrence of active layer thaw and high discharge song et al 2020 the monsoonal climate would enhance aquatic carbon export zhong et al 2018 playing important roles in carbon cycling therefore the short term climate variabilities can result in the high temporal heterogenicities of carbon dynamics and fluxes gao et al 2019 but it can provide more information of future carbon cycling under ongoing climate change the understanding of climate forcing on aquatic carbon cycling in the qinghai tibet plateau is still limited therefore the temporal riverine carbon budgets and dynamics should be updated to better understand the carbon cycle under various climatic variabilities in riverine system of the qinghai tibet plateau herein we proposed a hypothesis that carbon dynamics and fluxes will have a sensitive response to global climate change this study takes advantage of temporal samples monthly to daily sampling from jinsha river and yalong river draining the eastern qinghai tibet plateau we report time series data of carbon concentrations and δ13cdic and use this data to understand how carbon dynamics and fluxes respond to short term climate variability and then infer the future carbon cycling under ongoing climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the jinsha river is the headwater of the changjiang yangtze river whereas yalong river is the largest tributary of the jinsha river the jinsha river and yalong river are located in the eastern qinghai tibet plateau fig 1 a where is characterized by significant spatial variations in geographical characteristics and climate conditions fig 1b glacier permafrost and salt lakes widely distribute in the upper reach of the study region fig 1c climate condition shows significant spatially and temporally seasonally variations in the study region which is highly affected by indian summer monsoon and mid latitude westerlies yao et al 2013 with 85 of annual precipitation occurring in the warm season between may and october because the average population density of the study region is low the anthropogenic input is considered to be negligible chen et al 2020a li et al 2014 ma et al 2020 noh et al 2009 wu et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 the study area of jinsha river represents 35 of the total length and 14 of the draining area of the changjiang river which is one of the largest rivers in the world noh et al 2009 the jinsha river originates from the southern glacier at the geladandong peak with an elevation of 6621 m of the tangula mountains in the northern qinghai tibet plateau the jinsha river covers an altitude range of around 3300 m between its upper and lower reaches ma et al 2020 and references therein which flow through four provinces qinghai tibet yunnan and sichuan generally the evaporation is intense in the upper reaches of the jinsha river i e from the origin to zhimenda with dry and cold climate i e mean annual temperature mat below 4 c mean annual precipitation map ranging from 200 mm to 500 mm noh et al 2009 in the downstream of the jinsha river i e shigu to panzhihua the map is 900 1300 mm a sharp change occurs from cold dry and alpine climate in the upper reaches to a warm and wet climate in the lower reaches consequently three types of main vegetation community exist in the jinsha river catchment alpine meadow in the source area arid semiarid scrub in the middle reaches and combination of coniferous and subtropical forest at the lower reaches originating from the bayan har mountains in the eastern qinghai tibet plateau the yalong river covers an area of 1 28 105 m2 with a mainstream length of 1571 km the altitude of the yalong river catchment varies from 4500 m to 1500 m from the source to the outlet of the catchment li et al 2014 the climate of the yalong river catchment is controlled by high altitude atmospheric circulation and asian monsoon the variations of elevation and latitude cause complex climate conditions in the yalong river basin similar to the jinsha river the yalong river catchment has a cold and dry climate condition in the upper reaches i e map of 500 800 mm and warm and wet climate in the lower reaches i e map of 900 1300 mm zhang et al 2019 approximately 68 and 20 of the catchment are covered by grassland and forest land respectively 2 2 sampling and analyses the sampling sites were located in the outlets of the two rivers before they merge in panzhihua city approximately 30 km away from panzhihua city for the jinsha river and 20 km away from the panzhihua city for the yalong river we collected monthly water samples in one year from november 2013 to october 2014 and additionally sampled in the high flow seasons may 2014 october 2014 according to the runoff changes because the boat was not available in the study area we collected the running water at the bank of the river water samples were stored in pre cleaned low density polyethylene bottles and then filtered through 0 7 μm glass fiber filters all the water samples were stored in 4 c before analyses alkalinity was titrated with 0 02 mol l hydrochloric acid within 24 h after sampling and dic concentration was calculated based on mass action relationships clark and fritz 1997 doc concentrations were determined by a toc analyzer oi analytical aurora 1030 college station texas 15 ml of river water sample for δ13cdic analysis was first injected into sealed vacuum glass bottles that were prefilled with magmatic stirrer bar and 2 ml 85 phosphoric acid to convert all dic species to gaseous co2 then the produced co2 was purified cryogenically in a vacuum system and transferred for carbon isotopic measurements li et al 2014 zhong et al 2018 finally the value of δ13cdic was measured using a conventional isotope ratio mas spectrometer finnigan mat 252 thermo finnigan usa in state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry at guiyang the δ13c value was reported in terms of deviation from the standard vienna peedee belemnite v pdb with a standard deviation of 0 1 the runoff data in this study was from the ministry of water resources http www hydroinfo gov cn 2 3 data processing 2 3 1 concentration runoff relationships following godsey

3 results 3 1 the temporal variations of dic doc and δ13cdic the jinsha river had runoff ranging from 0 040 to 0 72 m yr with an average value of 0 21 m yr table 1 the yalong river had much higher runoff of 0 098 2 08 m yr averaging 0 47 m yr table 1 the runoff was low from november 2013 to may 2014 which was defined as the low flow season and high from june 2014 to october 2014 which was the high flow season fig 2 a and b the dic concentrations varied from 23 4 to 35 0 mg c l with a cfw of 26 6 mgc l for the jinsha river which were slightly higher than those in the yalong river 19 9 32 3 mg c l table 1 the dic concentrations in the jinsha river showed high values in the low flow season and low values in the high flow season fig 2a in the yalong river dic concentrations were generally much higher in the low flow season than those in the high flow season but the period from april 2014 to jun 2014 showed the higher values fig 2b δ13cdic of the jinsha river 5 3 to 2 7 with a δ13cdic fw of 4 4 was much heavier than that of the yalong river 6 9 to 5 3 with a δ13cdic fw of 6 3 table 1 in addition δ13cdic showed synchronous variations with dic for both the jinsha river and yalong river fig 2a and b the doc concentrations ranged from 0 5 to 2 3 mg c l cfw of 1 4 mg c l for the jinsha river and range of 0 6 1 8 mg c l cfw of 1 2 mg c l was observed for the yalong river table 1 and the doc concentrations had low values in the low flow season and high values in the high flow season for both the jinsha river and yalong river fig 2a and b 3 2 concentration runoff relationships the dic concentrations decreased with the increases of runoff with high dic concentrations under low runoff conditions and low dic concentrations under high runoff conditions for the jinsha river and yalong river fig 3 a and b the slopes of dic concentration versus runoff were negative b 0 but were not statistically different from zero showing chemostatic behavior 0 2 b 0 2 the doc concentrations increased with runoff increases for both jinsha river and yalong river showing high values under high runoff conditions fig 3c and d positive power law relationships were observed in jinsha river and yalong river with positive doc versus runoff slopes b 0 fig 3c and d the doc concentrations showed enrichment behavior b 0 2 with increasing runoff conditions for the jinsha river fig 3c for the yalong river although positive b value was observed for correlation of doc versus runoff the doc concentrations showed chemostatic behavior 0 2 b 0 2 fig 3c 3 3 loadest model performance the loadest modeled dic and doc concentrations were shown in fig 4 a and b the temporal loadest modeled dic and doc concentrations had same patterns with temporal variations of the measured values the loadest modeled dic and doc had strong correlations with the measured dic and doc concentrations around the 1 1 lines fig 4c and d the equations selected for the loadest estimated dic and doc fluxes for the jinsha river and yalong river were shown in table 2 which was automatically selected by amle runkel et al 2004 both the dic and doc fluxes in the jinsha river were much lower than those in the yalong river the calculated dic fluxes were 5 78 0 07 tc km2 yr and 11 12 0 13 tc km2 yr for jinsha river and yalong river respectively table 2 which were much higher than the global mean annual flux of dic 2 6 tc km2 yr shih et al 2019 the doc fluxes were 0 26 0 01 tc km2 yr and 0 49 0 01 tc km2 yr for jinsha river and yalong river respectively table 2 lower than the global mean annual doc flux 1 4 tc km2 yr shih et al 2019 4 discussion 4 1 controls on the temporal carbon dynamics the correlations between solute concentration and runoff presented in this study eq 1 are used to constrain the processes that affect the solute concentration under various runoff conditions our results show dic concentrations decreased with increasing runoff conditions fig 3a and b which were consistent with those in most chinese rivers zhong et al 2020b the decrease of dic with increasing runoff reflects the depletion of dic supply due to the shortened fluid transit time tipper et al 2006 torres et al 2015 zhong et al 2020b but the chemostatic behavior of dic suggests the supply for the riverine dic with increasing runoff conditions chemical weathering is the main source of dic and increasing runoff intensifies the chemical weathering through increasing reactive surface area torres et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 2020b in addition the carbonate buffer systems in the riverine water can also maintain the dic concentrations therefore the dic concentrations show decreased but chemostatic behavior to increasing runoff conditions as the runoff increases in the two rivers the concentration of doc also increases fig 3c and d increasing riverine doc concentrations during hydrologic events is mainly derived from allochthonous terrestrial carbon chen et al 2020b and references therein flushing would remove doc transport limitation in the river system which should be ascribed to the increased soil reactive surface under high flow conditions canadell et al 2019 raymond and saiers 2010 in addition high runoff is always synchronous with high temperature in the high flow season which enhances terrestrial photosynthesis and organic carbon degradation chen et al 2020b guo et al 2010 laudon et al 2012 and accelerated organic carbon cycle would also increase doc production through increasing doc supply mu et al 2017 the doc concentrations showed enriched behavior with increasing runoff conditions in the jinsha river b 0 2 fig 3c but the doc concentrations showed increased but chemostatic behavior in the yalong river b 0 12 fig 3d in the jinsha river the elevation of source area is much higher than that of the yalong river fig 1b as a result the permafrost distributed in the jinsha river source region fig 1c would transport doc to the river system in the warm season through permafrost thawing gao et al 2019 mu et al 2017 o donnell et al 2012 song et al 2020 meanwhile the vast permafrost carbon pool in the jinsha river source region would affect the temporal doc variations and permafrost carbon export would also be responsible for the temporal doc dynamics fig 1c therefore doc concentrations show enrichment behavior to runoff increases in the jinsha river processes controlling the carbon dynamics can be expressed by the temporal δ13cdic variations campeau et al 2018 liu and han 2020 song et al 2020 zhong et al 2018 negative correlations between δ13cdic and runoff were observed for the jinsha river and yalong river fig 5 a showing that 13c depleted values occurred under high flow conditions the high runoff occurs synchronously with high temperature in this study region in the low flow season water and carbon are mainly from the downstream of the two rivers and the active layer of permafrost is frozen because of the cold and dry climate song et al 2020 the cold temperature reduces biomass productivity and biological activities so that low doc and heavy δ13cdic coincide in time however warm and wet climate in the high flow season would thaw the active layer of permafrost which would lead to organic carbon degradation producing high contents of biogenic co2 and then shifting 13c depleted dic song et al 2020 in addition warm and wet climate in the high flow season also accelerates the biological activities i e both vegetation and microbe producing high doc and light δ13cdic therefore δ13cdic has negative relationships with doc fig 5b and short term climate variability controls the temporal carbon dynamics positive linear relationships were observed between δ13cdic and dic for the jinsha river and yalong river with higher slope of δ13cdic versus dic in the jinsha river than that in the yalong river fig 6 heavy δ13cdic values accompanied with high dic concentrations which was observed in the high flow conditions fig 6 the runoff regulation of dic δ13cdic relationship q c i can be intuitively used to represent the underlying biogeochemical processes shifted by changes of hydrology high runoff would shift low dic concentrations but dic concentrations showed chemostatic behaviors with changing runoff conditions indicating the additional sources of dic influxes zhong et al 2018 meanwhile lighter δ13cdic values occurred under high runoff conditions showing that the additional sources had 13c depleted dic the wider δ13cdic range and higher c i slope in the jinsha river than those in the yalong river should be ascribed to the wide distribution of permafrost in the source region of jinsha river consistent with the high sensitivity of alpine catchment to climate change the results evidenced that biological carbon influx controls on the carbon dynamics of dic under short term climate variability 4 2 hydrology driven carbon fluxes the projected future trend and sensitivity of carbon fluxes to changes in runoff carbon yield flux gc m2 yr with respect to runoff changes provides valuable comparative information on carbon exports from catchments striegl et al 2007 the runoff in the yalong river was much higher than that in the jinsha river table 1 and accordingly higher dic and doc fluxes were observed in the yalong river table 1 suggesting that hydrology plays an important role in carbon fluxes the correlation of carbon fluxes versus runoff reveals the degree to which variability in carbon fluxes is driven by changes in runoff versus carbon concentrations gareis and lesack 2017 similar to the slopes of dic concentrations or doc concentrations versus runoff fig 3 the dic fluxes were much lower than the 1 1 line while the doc fluxes were much higher than the 1 1 line fig 6a and b the decreased dic concentrations and increased doc concentrations with increasing runoff should be responsible for the relationships of fluxes versus runoff however strong positive correlations were observed between dic or doc fluxes and runoff fig 6a and b indicating that hydrology controls temporal carbon fluxes for these two rivers the dic fluxes are controlled by source limitation while the doc fluxes are controlled by transport limitation overall although carbon concentrations can affect the temporal carbon fluxes carbon fluxes from a certain catchment are highly controlled by runoff changes the good relationships of carbon fluxes versus runoff in fig 7 allow us to use a strong power law function to estimate carbon fluxes when coupled with runoff in this case the effects of time in flux calculation of loadest can be eliminated we predict the future dic or doc flux using the power law functions with the annual modern regional jinsha river and yalong river and global ibarra et al 2016 runoff global warming will enhance hydrologic cycling and result in attendant runoff increases though the climate model shows high uncertainty manabe et al 2004 zhong et al 2020b runoff increases were predicted to be 6 8 c for high latitude regions manabe et al 2004 which is used to estimate the changes of carbon fluxes for global warming therefore increase of 14 7 c will induce a double of runoff for the two rivers based on this assumption we estimate the effects of temperature variability on carbon fluxes for the jinsha river and yalong river the sensitivities of temperature variability on dic fluxes are 5 5 c and 6 1 c for the jinsha river and yalong river respectively in case of doc the effects of temperature variabilities on doc fluxes are much higher i e 12 2 c and 8 3 c for the jinsha river and yalong river respectively the sensitivities of carbon fluxes to runoff f q are shown in fig 8 b runoff sensitivities on dic fluxes decrease with increasing runoff but runoff sensitivities on doc fluxes increase with runoff increases fig 8b the increasing f q of doc with increasing runoff indicates that future climate change will shift the doc dynamics and fluxes more intensely than dic both the runoff and temperature changes have higher effects on doc fluxes than dic fluxes because doc and dic fluxes are controlled by transport limitation and source limitation respectively high temperature and precipitation will enhance the photosynthesis and thicken the active layer depth of permafrost causing higher carbon dynamics to future climate change taken together the ongoing climate change will strongly change carbon fluxes in rivers of the qinghai tibet plateau and doc fluxes will be more sensitive to future climate change 5 conclusions climate acts as an important controlling factor on carbon cycling in this study we found that both dic and doc concentrations showed sensitive response to runoff changes through investigating the c q relationships chemostatic behaviors were observed for dic concentrations which should be mainly ascribed to the accelerated chemical weathering and the strong carbonate buffering capacity doc concentrations increased with increasing runoff for both the two rivers photosynthesis and respiration increased in the warm season and strong runoff flushed the large doc pool stored in land surface and soil which would highly affect the doc concentrations in addition warm weather in the high flow season could thicken the active layer depth of permafrost in the source area of the two rivers and consequently warming induced permafrost thaw would release doc to the river water affecting the riverine doc dynamics the evidence of seasonal δ13cdic variations also supported that high amounts of biological carbon influx played an important role in temporal carbon dynamics the carbon fluxes were strongly correlated with runoff indicating that hydrology controls on the carbon fluxes in the view of ongoing global climate change we analyzed the potential tendency of carbon fluxes based on the climate model the effects of temperature variability on doc fluxes i e 12 2 c and 8 3 c for the jinsha river and yalong river respectively were much higher than that on dic fluxes i e 5 5 c and 6 1 c for the jinsha river and yalong river respectively additionally we propose that the runoff sensitivity on carbon fluxes for doc will increase but the runoff sensitivity on dic fluxes will decrease this study shows that carbon fluxes in alpine rivers have high sensitivity for global climate change and more systematic researches should focus on climate sensitive alpine catchments credit authorship contribution statement jun zhong formal analysis methodology software writing original draft si liang
