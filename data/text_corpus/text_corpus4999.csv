24995,forest inventory and monitoring is indispensable for coconut cocos nucifera l forest plantation owners as it allows them in assessing tree growth fruit production rates and vitality of plantations as well as assists to meet up with the rising market demands by ensuring better yields nonetheless the use of remote sensing techniques for optimizing the management and production of coconut plantations is still at a latent stage in this paper we present an airborne laser scanning lidar based tree detection method applied for automatically identifying individual coconut trees in a plantation in southeast brazil this method locates individual trees by searching treetops on canopy height models chm derived from lidar data through a moving window having fixed treetop window size tws here an adaptive tws approach was implemented as a function of lidar derived canopy cover cov along with additional smoothening window sizes sws for enhancing tree detection accuracy a total of 19 plots characterized by varying levels of canopy cover were used for testing the accuracy of our framework and we were able to obtain an average tree detection accuracy of 86 22 from a total of 341 trees 294 trees were detected correctly by the algorithm using adaptive tws a low tws 3x3 value was found to perform best in study plots having cov 80 and for rest of the cases a higher tws 7x7 was perceived suitable results were further analyzed and compared to evaluate the relationship of individual tree detection itd accuracy with varying canopy cover levels within plot tree distribution

fruit production rates wood stocks optimal harvest times land characteristics and resource allocation of their plantations wulder et al 2012 silva et al 2017a 2017b roise et al 2016 schreuder et al 1993 over the years development of remote sensing techniques computer software and machine learning algorithms have significantly improved inventory and monitoring methods applied to plantation forestry and have helped in characterizing forest structure vertically across the landscapes ferraz et al 2015 2016 hall et al 2011 jaafar et al 2018 several recent studies have highlighted the effectiveness of airborne laser scanning als lidar light detection and ranging for individual tree detection itd the prime advantage of utilizing lidar data over aerial imagery for itd is that being an active sensing technology lidar beams are able to penetrate vegetations and attain more information on the vertical profile of the canopies and individual trees even under poor lighting conditions whereas aerial imagery cannot hodgson and bresnahan 2004 silva et al 2019 in fact research on algorithm creation for itd dates back to the early 1990s with the local maxima lm based algorithm being one of the most prominent methods pinz 1991 ke and quackenbush 2011 lm algorithm assume that high local intensity maxima in the imagery represent treetops korpela et al 2006 and utilizes two major parameters a smoothing window size sws and a tree window size tws application of smoothing filters help eliminates spurious local maxima caused by spread out tree branches and contorted snags the tws parameter allow us to define a fixed boundary within which the algorithm looks for treetops although most of the initial studies on lm which were based on aerial images encountered serious flaws resulting in over detection of trees mostly produced by multiple hits per tree advancements in lidar technology helped improve this situation as extraction of details on the canopy structure became possible as coconut offers versality to its growers due to its multiple uses such as food beverages cosmetics and healthcare the number of foreign investments that support coconut plantations in tropical countries such as brazil have been on a boom in the past couple of years martins and jesus junior 2011 satyanand 2009 bai et al 2005 martins and jesus junior 2014 studies focusing on application of remote sensing techniques for the optimization and management of coconut plantations can possibly assist the coconut plantation sector worldwide in navigating various globally prevailing issues such as competition from oil palm plantations improper farming practices unidentified ecological changes lack of environmental awareness and several other location specific issues such as water deficiency and nutrient variations saha and mat 2018a ohler 1998 samarajeewa et al 2001 choudhury 2002 srinivasan 2002 saha and mat 2018b carvalho et al 2013 de azevedo et al 2006 kahlon et al 2018 in this regard itd of coconut trees can be perceived very helpful as the automatic itd process helps make the inventory and monitoring processes less time consuming more frequent affordable and efficient in spite of that detection of individual coconut trees poses great challenges due to the lack of technological awareness among small scale farmers irregularly configured coconut canopy structure and limited availability of spatial data with sufficient detail edson and wing 2011 andersen 2009 saha and mat 2018a ohler 1998 samarajeewa et al 2001 choudhury 2002 srinivasan 2002 saha and mat 2018b issues faced with itd of oil palms a similar tree species that show resemblance in crown structures and textural features with that of coconut trees such as overlap of palm crowns of similar heights incomplete palm crown reconstructions caused due to irregular crown shapes and exposed wind and gust limitations by class heterogeneity and attendant mixed pixels and financial constraints for small scale area can also be viewed as potential hindrances towards optimal itd of coconut trees kattenborn et al 2014 nunes et al 2017 mayossa et al 2015 puttemans et al 2018 srestasathiern and rakwatin 2014 teina 2009 lelong et al 2004 from individually detected trees tree heights can also be estimated and based on the deviations exhibited by tree heights forest uniformity indices could be developed for increasing forest productivity hentz et al 2018 hakamada et al 2015a zucon et al 2015 in general if a stand is highly heterogeneous its final yield can get limited due to the presence of dominant trees which get greater access to soil nutrients water sunlight and fertilizers reducing availability for the younger and shorter dominated trees hakamada et al 2015a luu et al 2013 campoe 2012 binkley 2004 ryan et al 2010 boyden et al 2008 binkley et al 2002 stape et al 2010 binkley et al 2010 otto et al 2014 additionally by understanding the variation of tree growth rates we can identify parts of the field affected by soil nutrient deficiency and or inappropriate level of water availability in our research study we utilize lidar data to detect individual coconut trees at multiple plots of varying canopy cover levels within a coconut plantation located in southeast brazil in particular we are employing a lm based algorithm along with different combinations of tws and sws on lidar derived chms for executing the itd process the canopy cover cov is also computed from lidar to evaluate its usefulness for optimizing tws selection adding to that as an extension of itd estimation of plot level uniformity is also performed with an aim to approximate the existing variability in growth rates of trees for this purpose ph350 index was computed for each plot 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area fig 1 encompasses 11 ha of a coconut plantation in a rural settlement located northeast of japeri municipality in the state of rio de janeiro brazil the elevation of the region ranges from 30 m to 100 m and the climate is characterized as tropical without dry season defined as af tropical rainforest climate in koppen classification alvares et al 2013 annual average precipitation is around 1450 mm average temperature ranges from a minimum of 20 9 c in the coolest month july to a 26 7 c in the hottest month february climate data org 2014 a total of 7 sites with varying levels of canopy cover were considered these sites can be subsumed under three categories based on experts opinions after analyzing the aerial imageries of the study area type a stands plantations with high canopy cover sites 1 2 and 3 type b stands plantations with medium canopy cover sites 4 and 5 and type c stands plantations with low canopy cover sites 6 and 7 2 2 lidar data collection and processing the lidar data were acquired through a private company named topocart and they employed a leica geosystems als60 sensor scanning with a camera rcd 105 for data acquisition purpose the survey was conducted on september 2013 specifications of the lidar system used are summarized in table 1 we employed functionalities available in us forest service fusion ldv3 42 software mcgauchey 2015 and lastools isenburg 2015 to perform lidar preprocessing for ground and non ground separation a filtering algorithm based on kraus and pfeifer kraus and pfeifer 1998 was applied afterwards using the classified ground bare earth points dtm with a spatial resolution of 1 0 m was generated using gridsurfacecreate function the gridsurfacecreate function generates a gridded surface model representing the average elevation for all points within a cell so that the final surface it produces lies within the bare earth point set subsequently the heights were normalized using clipdata tool and it was assured that the z coordinate for each point corresponded to the height above ground and not the orthometric elevation of the single point the clipdata tool when used in conjunction with a bare earth model allows ground elevations to be subtracted from the return elevations the canopy height model chm with a spatial resolution of 0 5 m was built using the pit free algorithm developed by khosravipour et al 2014 the workflow was implemented by following the approach proposed in isenburg 2015 a pit free algorithm is a kind of technique that exploits the 3d structure of the tree crowns for removing height variations existing within lidar data this way issues associated with data pits which are irregular height variations present in chms can be resolved khosravipour et al 2014 2013 these pits are usually developed when the first return from lidar is far below the canopy and these impede the accurate extraction of forest parameters from chms persson et al 2002 leckie et al 2003 nevertheless pit free algorithm incorporates a three step workflow that includes i normalizing the height of the lidar data by replacing the elevation of each point with its vertical height above the ground ii constructing one standard chm using all first returns and multiple partial chms based on first returns associated with higher up vegetation hits and iii stacking all the previously developed chms for creating a final chm where each cell location has the maximum value across all input rasters that addresses this issue hence aforementioned approach was selected over alternative choices such as gaussian filtering which often fails to accurately target the pits and instead alter all pixels of the chm raster thereby exerting distortion on the tree crown structures khosravipour et al 2013 even then we tested this surrogate in the hope of extracting fruitful interpretations in parallel lasclip function from lidr package roussel and auty 2018 was employed for creating subsets of the lidar points clouds within the study plots following this the point clouds were normalized using lasnormalize function in lidr package roussel and auty 2018 and cov value for plots were computed from the normalized point clouds using lasmetrics function in rlidar package lasmetrics function allows the user to compute a wide range of lidar metrics that statistically describe the lidar dataset silva et al 2017a all the aforementioned functions were implemented in r software r core team 2015 cov calculation see eq 1 was done to test its applicability for improving the selection of tws parameters in a particular test plot as listed in previous studies silva et al 2016 falkowski et al 2008 this way an adaptive tws selection approach was enacted in this study for optimizing itd accuracy the height threshold ht was set to 0 08 m while calculating cov so that the potential lidar returns from grass are removed not at the expense of lidar returns from coconut tree saplings crowns whose heights were as low as 0 10 m at some instances 1 c o v n u m b e r o f l i d a r f i r s t r e t u r n s a b o v e h t t o t a l n u m b e r o f l i d a r f i

2017a r core team 2015 was used the findtreeschm function search for treetops in the chm through a moving window with a fixed tws wulder et al 2000 as the underlying methodology incorporated for this function is the local maximum algorithm tree tops found are actually the pixels with maximum heights within the fixed window see fig 2 b the number of local maxima identified are kept under check by defining a height threshold as well as by applying smoothing filters silva et al 2016 wulder et al 2000 gebreslasie et al 2011 for our study we selected a total of 19 plots 20 m x 20 m having an area of approximately 0 04 ha each randomly from 7 different sites such that variable canopy cover levels are accounted in the samples consequently we tested the combination of various tws 3 3 5 5 and 7 7 pixels with an unsmoothed chm as well as with multiple fixed smoothing window sizes sws 3 3 and 5 5 pixels and chose parameters accordingly for attaining an optimal tree detection result the spatial filter employed was mean filter as this filter has been found to perform well with trees having irregular canopy structures silva et al 2016 along with that the associated tree top heights h were also noted from the chms for further analysis purposes for evaluation purposes initially the number of trees detected ntd per plot using lidar were manually compared with reference data gathered through visual assessment of high resolution imagery which was created after orthorectifying aerial photos that were taken along with the lidar survey september 2013 of the study sites the spatial resolution of the images were 30 cm and the camera used was a vexcel microsoft model ultracam x tws sws combinations that gave best results for each plot were noted and the best performing tws sws combinations with respect to cov were selected for conducting accuracy assessment a performance assessment in terms of relative error rate eq 2 was also done for exploring the individual and combined influence of cov tws and sws in itd and the cases for which the relative error was close to 10 were further analyzed lastly accuracy assessment which involved evaluating in terms of statistical measures such as true positive tp correct detection false negative fn omission error false positive fp commission error recall r precision p and f score f was performed on the selected combinations eqs 3 5 were adopted from li et al 2012 goutte and gaussier 2005 sokolova et al 2006 here recall gives us a measure of trees detected and is inversely related to omission error precision denotes a measure of correctly detected trees and is inversely related to commission error and f score represents the harmonic mean of recall and precision fig 3 illustrates the itd pipeline implemented in this paper for validating the itd derived tree heights we measured the tree heights manually from the lidar point clouds using fusion ldv see supplementary figure s1 and used them as our reference for comparison 2 r

surprisingly only a few studies hentz et al 2018 hakamada et al 2015a b hakamada 2012 have explored the possibility of deriving uniformity indices to date and none focusing on coconut plantations luu et al 2013 boyden et al 2008 stape et al 2010 little et al 2003 silva 2005 in these studies the authors mostly employed the forest uniformity index pvar50 or pv50 hakamada et al 2015a b these entities provide a measure of the accumulated contribution of the smaller trees 50 of the total trees in terms of volume in these cases with respect to the entire stand being considered the variables being analyzed such as volume height biomass etc can be chosen depending on study purpose even though the indices were initially developed based on field data schreuder et al 1993 gibbs et al 2007 its variations such as ph350 that employ remotely sensed data have also been tested and found applicable for assessing forest uniformity former studies hentz et al 2018 hakamada et al 2015a b hakamada 2012 have reported ph350 index to be highly correlated to pv50 and the authors have reported satisfactory results and interpretations from the ph350 index values especially in case of young plantations hentz et al 2018 where it is not possible to obtain the dbh hence considering the fact that a lot of our stands had coconut saplings aforementioned index with variable of importance being tree height was chosen for this study the plot level uniformity was estimated using the ph350 index which gives a measure of the accumulated contribution of 50 shorter trees i e trees having heights below the 50th percentile tree height within any given plot hentz et al 2018 hakamada 2012 the ph350 values eq 6 were calculated based on the lidar detected trees in all the plots irrespective of whether the algorithm exhibited discrepancies such as detection of nonexistent trees commission errors or failure in detecting actually existing trees omission errors this strategy was incorporated as in real time applications we will not be able to detect if these errors are occurring or not the equation for ph350 index is as follows 6 p h 3 50 i 1 n 2 h i 3 i 1 n h i 3 where h i 3 denotes the cubic power of the ith tree height and n is the sorted i e trees are initially sorted from smallest to the largest with respect to tree heights tree number adhering to the observations made by hakamada et al 2015a we considered the plots having ph350 index within the range of 0 37 and 0 50 to be homogeneous plots fig 4 provides a pictorial representation of the step by step processes involved in ph350 index estimation the first step fig 4a1 being the tree top identification with the algorithm detecting 18 trees in this case allows us to extract individual tree heights and we estimate the 50th tree height percentile fig 4a2 from the obtained values afterwards for calculating ph350 index we determine the ratio of sum of cubes of tree heights of trees below 50th tree height percentile and sum of cubes of tree heights of all the trees in a given plot see eq 6 in part b1 of the fig 4 the x axis denotes the trees which are ranked from the shortest to the tallest i e tree 1 has the lowest height value and the height keeps increasing till tree 18 which is the tallest tree on the y axis corresponding ph350 values are provided the green line presents the case of a hypothetical homogenous plot having maximum uniformity this can be perceived as an equality line in this case 50 of shorter trees would account for 50 of total ph350 which means ph350 index will be 0 5 the orange line represents the sample under consideration figure 4a1 and in this case 50 of the shorter trees correspond to only 34 of total ph350 resulting in a ph350 index of 0 34 indicating the mildly heterogenous nature of the plot 3 results with varying combinations of tws and sws we observed differences in accuracy rates for itd see table 2 the best combination for itd was found to be for 7 7 5 5 tws sws combination in this case 7 out of the total 19 instances gave best tree detection results here best implies closeness of number of trees detected ntd to the reference tree count n also it was noted that 1 plot of type a plantations 3 plots of type b stands and 5 plots of type c stands had their n and ntd values identical in some cases see table 2 plot ids 4 5 10 12 15 and 19 multiple combinations of tws and sws were found to provide similar results in general an increase in cov was found to be detrimental towards the tree detection ability of the algorithm for very high canopy cover plots i e cov 80 tws sws combination of 3 3 5 5 gave best results in 3 out of 4 cases nevertheless the impact of varying tws and sws was not having a linear relationship with the tree detection accuracy the total number of detected trees in 3 3 tws revealed better results with increasing sws values whereas for 5 5 tws and 7 7 tws both 3 3 sws and 5 5 sws were found to perform equally well this non uniform trend in itd encouraged us to further analyze the possibilities of relationships existing between tws and sws as well as with canopy cover levels without the smoothing filter nf itd showed near zero accuracy in all the cases by calculating relative error for all the cases table 3 we were able to choose satisfactory error close to 10 observations and analyze the individual as well as combined influence of canopy cover levels tws and sws towards tree detection accuracy in 13 cases 3 plots of type a stands 4 plots of type b stands and 6 plots of type c stands itd algorithm of varying tws and sws combinations were able to detect trees with satisfactory accuracy on a combined basis 7 7 tws and 5 5 sws gave the best results in maximum number of instances 8 cases however for cases where cov was greater than 80 3 3 5 5 tws sws combination gave better less than or close to 10 relative error values therefore while performing accuracy assessment table 4 in plots where cov was greater than 80 3 3 5 5 tws sws combination was selected and for rest of the cases 7 7 5 5 tws sws was considered we obtained recall r precision p and f score values of 0 87 range 0 72 to 1 00 0 94 range 0 69 to 1 00 and 0 90 range 0 75 to 1 00 respectively a count of 294 86 22 successful tree tops was reported from the itd process from a total of 341 trees the algorithm missed 47 trees and falsely detected 24 trees giving an estimate of 318 trees it also became evident that in plots with cov lesser than 80 average tree detection accuracy 87 64 and omission error 12 35 were comparatively better than for the cases where cov was greater than 80 average itd accuracy was 82 22 and omission error was 17 78 see table 5 adding to that with respect to f score and commission error values study plots with cov less than 80 showed significantly stronger results f score was 0 93 and commission error was 1 59 compared to plots where cov was greater than 80 f score was 0 80 and commission error was 22 22 illustrations of 3d lidar point clouds of plots with varying canopy cover levels and their corresponding itd results with respect to the reference trees are presented in fig 5 on evaluating the range of tree heights obtained from lidar we noticed the standard deviations to vary between 0 19 and 2 97 even though the average tree heights were below 6 m in all the cases for plot 5 we obtained a maximum tree height of 14 79 m using these derived heights ph350 indices were calculated and they ranged from 0 0432 to 0 4571 out of the 19 plots only 4 were found to exhibit high levels of homogeneity summary statistics of plot level lidar derived tree heights and associated ph350 values are presented in table 6 we also estimated the coefficient of determination r2 for itd derived tree heights and reference tree heights and obtained an r2 value of 0 98 see supplementary figure s2 4 discussion in the past few decades lidar data has found a stronghold in the realm of itd based forest inventory applications due to its ability in estimating tree level attributes such as crown size dbh crown close and canopy structure from delineated trees with satisfactory accuracies silva et al 2017a zhen et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 bai et al 2005 harding et al 2001 duncanson and dubayah 2018 additionally ongoing advancements in optical remote sensing hyperspectral imagery uav applications and their combinations are also paving ways to enhance itd initiatives within the forestry sector mohan et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 dempewolf et al 2017 cardil et al 2017 2019 while remote sensing techniques especially lidar has become a promising source for performing itd its applications have been limited to tropical forests mixed conifer forests eucalyptus plantations and pine plantations in several countries primarily due to data constraints and challenging canopy structures that variant species possess ferraz et al 2016 ke and quackenbush 2011 féret and asner 2013 pont et al 2015 jeronimo et al 2018 hence supplemental studies are required tested with wide variety of cultures and vegetation covers to confirm the proposed advantages of using airborne laser scanning for itd in our study we evaluated the applicability of a lm based algorithm for detecting and delineating individual coconut trees which are rarely studied from a remote sensing perspective in a plantation comprising of sites with variable canopy cover levels the basic assumptions of the algorithm being that each imaged tree crown has a single brightest spot with darker areas between tree crowns larsen et al 2011 gougeon and moore 1988 in accordance with the underlying assumption we observed the tree tops being represented as brightest spots within the chms and depending on the varying levels of canopy covers from high to low there occurred an evident increase in darker areas between the brightest spots blue colored region in fig 5 a4 c4 coconut tree crowns because of its irregular canopy cover and often slanted stems were expected to be comparatively harder to detect and isolate fig 6 a notwithstanding the potential limitations selection of a lm approach and testing of different combinations of sws and tws proved beneficial for achieving optimal accuracy with the tree top detections employing cov variable with a threshold of 80 which was relatively higher than the thresholds applied in previous studies silva et al 2016 falkowski et al 2008 as a criterion for adapting the tws also enabled us to substantially improve the average tree detection accuracy from 79 77 when only the best tws sws combination 7 7 5 5 was applied for all the plots see supplementary table s1 to 86 22 this in turn underscores the ability of our proposed methodology for isolating individual trees having irregular tree crowns even in dense canopy plantations also as noted in previous studies silva et al 2016 khosravipour et al 2014 a choice of mean filter smoothing with pit free chms gave superior results compared to other commonly employed filter techniques gaussian based approaches were tested as alternatives however since coconut tree crowns are acutely asymmetrical unlike conifers which tend to have a more regular conical shape the results were not at par to the findings obtained using the formerly mentioned method the accuracy rates for itd which were verified in terms of precision recall and f score shows that successful combinations of tws and sws can achieve satisfactory detection results for coconut plantations based on the results from the relative error table table 4 we deduced that with the increase in canopy cover accurate itd becomes more challenging in case of coconut plantations this can be attributed to issues associated with occlusion shadows variation in light reflectance canopy overlap and closure size and tree spacing as listed in similar studies hyyppä et al 2008 silva et al 2016 zhen et al 2016 wulder et al 2003 asner and heidebrecht 2002 even though from table 4 itd it was found that for plots with cov greater than 80 a tws sws combination of 3 3 5 5 provided the best result in table 5 relative error estimation we noticed that 5 5 3 3 combination gave satisfactory results in two instances as opposed to 3 3 5 5 combination which met the cut off in only one case however the relative error for plots 2 and 4 were very close to 10 11 5 and 10 5 respectively which corroborates the previously observed pattern in general for plots in type a high canopy cover stands tws of 3 3 and sws of 5 5 gave the best results inaccurate estimation of results happened in alternative tws sws combinations can be related with the irregular canopy of the coconut trees which has many leaves identified with the local maximum this can be a serious hurdle in plots having high canopy covers especially when there occur several matured trees fig 6b for plots in type b medium canopy cover stands effects of tws sws on tree detection enhancement was limited all the tws sws combinations expect for nf were able to identify tree tops of at least one plot with satisfiable accuracy in alignment to the observations made by previous studies densities hyyppä et al 2008 silva et al 2016 we noticed that a lower tws of 3 3 was more effective in itd when tree counts were high n 24 taking into consideration the high performance exhibited by lower tws in itd for cases where tree count was relatively high n 20 it can be inferred that number of trees detected is inversely proportional to the tws adding to that precision was also found to reduce with decreasing tws in our case the plots with cov 80 where 3 3 tws was applied showed high commission error rate which implies low precision furthermore in most cases at plots where the tree heights are relatively higher chances of obstructions to lidar pulses will be lower and this helps in generating more accurate chm models and thereby better itd accuracy this might have partially contributed to the aberrations in findings revolving plot 8 which has a cov close to 80 here around half of the total trees were saplings and the remaining half comprised of taller trees with larger crown size areas nonetheless this inference was not able to be made by interpreting uniformity index values the sizable change in height differences would have enabled a higher tws to make better tree count approximation as compared to lower tws also the tree count was low in plot 8 compared to other plots having cov 80 tws of 5 5 and 7 7 performed in an identical manner when tree count was below 20 moreover we were curious to explore the reasons why among the 4 plots of type b stands only the trees in plot 10 were not able to be detected with 100 accuracy by any tws sws combination we expect this anomaly to be arising from the differences in within plot tree distribution and canopy gap patterns see fig 7 this further implies that multiple plots having similar canopy cover values might behave differently to itd algorithm depending on how the overall arrangement of trees are within each plot and also at times perhaps contingent on within plot tree height distributions as well as presumed in the case of plot 8 based on the algorithm assumptions a uniform distribution like that of study plot 12 fig 7c would be easier to detect for the algorithm than an indented distribution exhibited in plot 10 fig 7d where tree crowns have a higher level of overlaps along with uneven canopy gaps nevertheless since we had only taken 4 plots into consideration extensive research for understanding the influence of canopy gap patterns and within plot tree distribution for itd is highly recommended before drawing conclusions schneider and larson 2017 nyamgeroh et al 2018 white et al 2018 bagaram et al 2018 plots in type c low canopy cover stands gave satisfactory results for 6 in 7 plots 19 out of 63 tws sws combination cases with multiple combinations of tws and sws yielding optimal predictions also an average precision value of 0 99 and an average f score of 0 95 was attained in this case therefore it can be inferred that when the trees are widely spaced as in study plot 19 figure 6d the algorithm s efficiency in detecting trees correctly is very high here combinations of tws and sws have comparatively minor influence on itd performance identical to the findings in type a and type b stands nf cases did not yield any compelling results in type c stands either this was because of the fact that the irregular tree crowns of the coconut trees cause multiple local maxima to be detected on a single tree crown unless smoothed thereby resulting in extreme overestimation of tree counts considering the overall tree detection results we noticed that there occurred no specific linear tree detection trends with respect to the tws sws combinations which can be attributed to the complexity arising from various levels of canopy covers and or biological features associated with the coconut canopy crown structures notwithstanding this lack of explicit relationships based on our findings using a 7 7 5 5 or 3 3 5 5 tws sws combination can be viewed as reliable strategies nonetheless while employing lower 3 3 tws the commission error rate is expected to very high due to the overestimation of tree crowns it makes on the other hand the former combination which adopted a higher 7 7 tws had a commission error of only 2 34 nevertheless the 7 7 tws and 5 5 sws combination suffered from underestimation of trees majorly in plantations with high canopy cover out of the 69 missed trees 48 trees were missed while performing itd in type a stands see supplementary table s1 hence this combination is not recommended for plantations similar to the type a stands described in this study for performing itd in coconut plantations selecting suitable tws based on cov similar to what we did here is advised also from table 3 we noted that 5 5 3 3 tws sws combination performed well in comparison with the previously mentioned combinations however since our final objective was more inclined to pinpointing maximum number of trees extracted that are relevant i e high precision rather than on the number of relevant trees that are extracted this combination which had high commission error possibility table 3 was not further evaluated at times for larger areas taking a consistent tws and sws combination might seem appropriate and time efficient however in this case performance variations can happen if multiple canopy cover levels tree distribution patterns and or forest types are present as observed in our situation as well as in previous studies lindberg and hollaus 2012 asner and heidebrecht 2002 kwak et al 2007 from the obtained relative error values table 3 for itd with 7 7 5 5 tws sws combination table 3 it can be noted that even when we increase the relative error allowable from 0 to 10 the number of satisfactory results in case of type a stands is minimal also there occurred two cases plot 2 11 5 and plot 4 10 5 where the values were very close to the cut off limit which tacitly states that unconditionally relying on relative error for evaluating itd efficiency of tws sws combinations can be both erroneous and misleading on the contrary for type b and type c stands additional tws sws combinations acquired satisfactory accuracy with increasing the relative error denoting an ease in selecting tws sws combinations among the plots in type c stands only for plot 15 we did not find any suitable tws sws combination here two pertinent concerns were accounted firstly for few trees on edges a major part of their crowns was found to be slanted and leaning outside of the plot perimeter at times application of a buffer on the study plots might help address issues associated with slanted tree crowns monnet et al 2010 secondly even though all the trees in type c stands had adequate amount of spacing between them some trees had their pinnate leaves spread out making it hard to be identified from the chms these issues might have caused most of the tws sws combinations to inaccurately estimate the number of tree tops similarly for plot 14 of the type c stands the algorithm was not able to detect trees with 100 efficiency using any of the tws sws combinations even though the tree count was only 12 nevertheless 100 recall was achieved when 7 7 5 5 tws sws combination was applied meanwhile plot 19 was found to provide the maximum number of satisfactory results here 5 different tws sws combinations were able to obtain 100 accuracy in tree detection this was a type c plot with minimum level of canopy cover and very low number of trees which were regularly spaced also three other plots in type c stands plots 13 16 and 17 and one plot in type b stands plot 12 provided above average results i e at least 3 different tws sws combinations resulted in high accuracy results plots of type c stands and type b stands except plot 11 where the ntd and n values were found equal i e relative error 0 generally comprised of coconut trees with low canopy crown area and closely packed pinnate leave structures the wide and organized spacing in between individual tree crowns would have enabled itd algorithm to have 100 accuracy in these cases for the plot 3 belonging to type a stands where relative error was found to be 0 tree spacing was well structured and canopy gap irregularities were minimal this might have permitted a lower value tws in effective tree detection silva et al 2016 nevertheless further analysis involving accuracy assessment in terms of precision recall and f score is required for confirming our inferences on the itd trend observed in the aforementioned study plots average tree density is another principal factor that has been found to be influential towards tws sws selection and itd in plantations species previously conducted studies recommend adopting a small sws for efficient itd in areas having high plantation densities hyyppä et al 2008 silva et al 2016 this is because as observed from our results a lower sws results in estimating larger number of tree tops and thereby achieves better prediction accuracy when dealing with dense forest plots having a colossal amount of tree nevertheless this pattern was not highly perceivable except for the plot 3 in our study as all our study plots were parts of a plantation which was developed in a way to have equal number of coconut trees separated by uniform spacing throughout the irregular shape of coconut tree crowns might have also contributed to this anomaly as previously stated the differences in average tree density between plots were expected to be nominal in our case even then we did notice minor changes in the number of trees being reported from the survey which we expect to result from issues related to seedling mortality rates natural hazards and or rapid weather changes additionally preceding studies have also mentioned about the advantages of using a high tws for low canopy cover areas hyyppä et al 2008 silva et al 2016 however we did not notice such a trend either probably because of the equally spaced trees which made the detection of tree tops a less complicated process despite that in consistent with recent studies we observed that itd algorithm in overall performed better in cases with open canopies compared to areas with dense canopy covers koukoulas and blackburn 2005 pinz 1991 therefore we expect the proposed itd parameter combinations to work best for regularly spaced coconut trees as in these cases the canopy cover overlaps will be minimal as an extended application of itd and solely for demonstration purposes estimation of uniformity index ph350 at plot levels is presented as a part of this study in our case ph350 values ranged from 0 0432 to 0 451 table 6 revealing high irregularities which imply notable variations in tree heights in a number of plots since there had been no previously published studies done in this direction focusing on coconut plantations our inference that almost 80 15 of 19 cases of the total plots exhibit high heterogeneity solely relies on the findings reported by authors who conducted similar studies in other major plantation crops of brazil hentz et al 2018 hakamada et al 2015a zucon et al 2015 hakamada et al 2015b exhaustive research targeted at coconut plantations would be able to append more clarity and applicability to the presented approach for instance hakamada et al 2015a performed extensive study on clonal eucalyptus forests for investigating the behavior of the uniformity between trees along a rotation and its relationship with the productivity and arrived at a conclusion highlighting the importance of homogenous supply of resources within plots and suggested that for stands to be considered uniform pv50 for volume in this case value should be in the range of 37 50 campoe 2012 obtained comparable results in eucalyptus grandis stands where the 20 larger trees of the stands were noted to acquire higher light efficiency in relation to the 20 smaller ones as calculation of heights deemed more justifiable in case of younger plants another study undertook by hentz et al 2018 evaluated the forest uniformity in terms of ph350 index here the authors compared the performance of two different uav based tree height calculation approaches in estimating ph350 index of eucalyptus spp and pinus taeda l plantations with respect to field data and found the study sites to have ph350 index values greater than 0 34 and classified them as homogenous stands another interesting inference made was that the errors aggregating from tree height calculation does not influence the uniformity index results significantly as these errors are generally distributed evenly among the individual trees even then uniform index error reduction up to 2 79 was found attainable with careful selection of height calculation methods along the same line zucon et al 2015 also observed that the influence of issues associated with uav based crown delineations had very nominal impact on accuracy of pvar50 values in a young eucalyptus plantation in case of coconut plantations it is often the case that due to tree mortality in the initial phases a lot of additional saplings are planted at a later stage resulting in increased stand heterogeneity differences in silvicultural practices such as soil preparation weed control fertilizer treatment and number of trees per hectare also add to the overall heterogeneity ryan et al 2010 stape et al 2010 little et al 2003 silva 2005 örlander et al 2002 nilsson and allen 2003 understanding these variations in the early stages are crucial for optimizing production as the responses of fertilization and several silvicultural practices are more pronounced at this growth period borders et al 2004 martinez vilalta et al 2007 for instance in case of plot 14 where the corresponding uniformity index was 0 0432 it can be noticed that the mean tree height was only 0 30 m therefore proper application of fertilization and management practices has the potential to enhance homogeneity in these types of stands whereas with plot 5 the standard deviation was very striking this was due to the influence of a single tree that was almost three times as tall as the remaining trees and it greatly affected the uniformity index despite that when we calculated the same without considering the aforementioned tree the uniformity index increased from an initial 0 1432 to 0 4036 which emphasizes the necessity for careful consideration of outliers for drawing meaningful interpretations with regard to itd in general stands with higher uniformity is expected to enhance tree detection accuracy as in case of heterogenous stands the taller trees with larger crown shapes might increase the amount of overlaps or even cause occlusion hyyppä et al 2008 silva et al 2016 however based on our results which does not reveal any significant pattern in the aforementioned angle we recommend future studies to take into consideration heights of individual trees and perform comparison studies for unfolding the intricacies extraction of fruitful information on influence of forest uniformity and itd is very limited from plot level assessments also since uniformity index can be derived only after performing itd studies on the influence of this entity on itd is wholly for advancing scientific perspectives and this index cannot be considered as a stand alone determinant such as cov for enhancing itd accuracy in spite of that we advocate research endeavors for evaluating combinations of pixel size and itd methods for itd and impact of forest uniformity assessment in mere future to reiterate for successful identification of tree locations in depth understanding of tws and sws determination with respect to cov is vital as proved from our observations and similar studies silva et al 2016 wulder et al 2000 with the emerging growth of software technology algorithm development and remote sensing platforms applications and functionalities of itd are expected to expand and thereby assist the forest sector extensively herein we presented plot level uniformity index estimation as an extension of itd research focused on itd in areas with multiple species types will be highly intriguing in this regard the results from our study underscores that successful selection of tws and sws depending on tree crown structure within plot tree distribution patterns and canopy cover is crucial for developing adaptive itd models based on lm algorithm however species specific issues need to be carefully considered and further research on forest uniformity and tree spacing s influence is also required to corroborate the applicability of the proposed methodology application of the template matching algorithm provided by advance software like ecognition or state of the art visual analytic and multispectral lidar based techniques might offer more clarity in this regard huo et al 2018 olofsson et al 2006 gavazzi et al 2016 murugesan et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 nonetheless the cost of attaining these software license and high quality data can be a hurdle for small scale users to address issues regarding omission errors faced by certain tws sws combinations like in our case 7 7 5 5 tws sws combination results for type a stands additional studies involving a wide range of complementing tree level variables such as crown diameter stem volume tree basal area etc are advocated also we recommend evaluating the role of external factors such as climate season wind etc as well as impact of dried or diseased coconut leaves which might affect the quality and output of the itd workflow this was beyond the scope of this paper in addition development in uav technology has made it possible to have multiple cameras attached to uav quadcopters and that way take images in different wavelengths of the same locations at the same instant and hence we expect to find a considerable amount of applications integrating features of uav lidar data with optical as well as hyperspectral imagery in the mere future zhao et al 2018 yao and wei 2013 caughlin et al 2016 sankey et al 2017 kandare et al 2017 in sum through our research we extended the usage of itd phenomenon to trees with irregular and attenuated canopy covers such as coconut trees and provided recommendations for assisting plantation owners investors and companies that rely on coconut production even though our study focused on a plantation in brazil we expect our work to conceivably pave the way for further research advancements in itd and coconut plantation management spheres of a wider spectrum 5 conclusions lidar data along with suitable tree detection algorithm and window sizes based on lidar derived canopy cover can be effectively used for delineating individual trees and thereby estimating a wide range of tree and canopy characteristics this study was performed to detect individual coconut trees from a plantation having plots of varying canopy cover levels and presents an extended application of itd which is estimation of plot level uniformity index by employing a lm algorithm we tested various combinations of tws and sws for achieving optimal itd rates our results emphasize the importance of tws and sws parameter selection depending on species types forest structure and management objectives and demonstrates the potential of itd algorithm in attaining satisfactory results in cases of trees with irregular and attenuated canopy structures such as coconut trees future research focusing on integrating uav derived images hyperspectral imagery and satellite images with lidar data can further assist the efficient detection of individual trees in coconut plantations as well as forest areas having multiple species types author contributions

24995,forest inventory and monitoring is indispensable for coconut cocos nucifera l forest plantation owners as it allows them in assessing tree growth fruit production rates and vitality of plantations as well as assists to meet up with the rising market demands by ensuring better yields nonetheless the use of remote sensing techniques for optimizing the management and production of coconut plantations is still at a latent stage in this paper we present an airborne laser scanning lidar based tree detection method applied for automatically identifying individual coconut trees in a plantation in southeast brazil this method locates individual trees by searching treetops on canopy height models chm derived from lidar data through a moving window having fixed treetop window size tws here an adaptive tws approach was implemented as a function of lidar derived canopy cover cov along with additional smoothening window sizes sws for enhancing tree detection accuracy a total of 19 plots characterized by varying levels of canopy cover were used for testing the accuracy of our framework and we were able to obtain an average tree detection accuracy of 86 22 from a total of 341 trees 294 trees were detected correctly by the algorithm using adaptive tws a low tws 3x3 value was found to perform best in study plots having cov 80 and for rest of the cases a higher tws 7x7 was perceived suitable results were further analyzed and compared to evaluate the relationship of individual tree detection itd accuracy with varying canopy cover levels within plot tree distribution

tree count irregular tree crown 1 introduction forest inventory and monitoring is critical to plantation owners due to its usage in identifying quantifying and tracking forest cover growth stages fruit production rates wood stocks optimal harvest times land characteristics and resource allocation of their plantations wulder et al 2012 silva et al 2017a 2017b roise et al 2016 schreuder et al 1993 over the years development of remote sensing techniques computer software and machine learning algorithms have significantly improved inventory and monitoring methods applied to plantation forestry and have helped in characterizing forest structure vertically across the landscapes ferraz et al 2015 2016 hall et al 2011 jaafar et al 2018 several recent studies have highlighted the effectiveness of airborne laser scanning als lidar light detection and ranging for individual tree detection itd the prime advantage of utilizing lidar data over aerial imagery for itd is that being an active sensing technology lidar beams are able to penetrate vegetations and attain more information on the vertical profile of the canopies and individual trees even under poor lighting conditions whereas aerial imagery cannot hodgson and bresnahan 2004 silva et al 2019 in fact research on algorithm creation for itd dates back to the early 1990s with the local maxima lm based algorithm being one of the most prominent methods pinz 1991 ke and quackenbush 2011 lm algorithm assume that high local intensity maxima in the imagery represent treetops korpela et al 2006 and utilizes two major parameters a smoothing window size sws and a tree window size tws application of smoothing filters help eliminates spurious local maxima caused by spread out tree branches and contorted snags the tws parameter allow us to define a fixed boundary within which the algorithm looks for treetops although most of the initial studies on lm which were based on aerial images encountered serious flaws resulting in over detection of trees mostly produced by multiple hits per tree advancements in lidar technology helped improve this situation as extraction of details on the canopy structure became possible as coconut offers versality to its growers due to its multiple uses such as food beverages cosmetics and healthcare the number of foreign investments that support coconut plantations in tropical countries such as brazil have been on a boom in the past couple of years martins and jesus junior 2011 satyanand 2009 bai et al 2005 martins and jesus junior 2014 studies focusing on application of remote sensing techniques for the optimization and management of coconut plantations can possibly assist the coconut plantation sector worldwide in navigating various globally prevailing issues such as competition from oil palm plantations improper farming practices unidentified ecological changes lack of environmental awareness and several other location specific issues such as water deficiency and nutrient variations saha and mat 2018a ohler 1998 samarajeewa et al 2001 choudhury 2002 srinivasan 2002 saha and mat 2018b carvalho et al 2013 de azevedo et al 2006 kahlon et al 2018 in this regard itd of coconut trees can be perceived very helpful as the automatic itd process helps make the inventory and monitoring processes less time consuming more frequent affordable and efficient in spite of that detection of individual coconut trees poses great challenges due to the lack of technological awareness among small scale farmers irregularly configured coconut canopy structure and limited availability of spatial data with sufficient detail edson and wing 2011 andersen 2009 saha and mat 2018a ohler 1998 samarajeewa et al 2001 choudhury 2002 srinivasan 2002 saha and mat 2018b issues faced with itd of oil palms a similar tree species that show resemblance in crown structures and textural features with that of coconut trees such as overlap of palm crowns of similar heights incomplete palm crown reconstructions caused due to irregular crown shapes and exposed wind and gust limitations by class heterogeneity and attendant mixed pixels and financial constraints for small scale area can also be viewed as potential hindrances towards optimal itd of coconut trees kattenborn et al 2014 nunes et al 2017 mayossa et al 2015 puttemans et al 2018 srestasathiern and rakwatin 2014 teina 2009 lelong et al 2004 from individually detected trees tree heights can also be estimated and based on the deviations exhibited by tree heights forest uniformity indices could be developed for increasing forest productivity hentz et al 2018 hakamada et al 2015a zucon et al 2015 in general if a stand is highly heterogeneous its final yield can get limited due to the presence of dominant trees which get greater access to soil nutrients water sunlight and fertilizers reducing availability for the younger and shorter dominated trees hakamada et al 2015a luu et al 2013 campoe 2012 binkley 2004 ryan et al 2010 boyden et al 2008 binkley et al 2002 stape et al 2010 binkley et al 2010 otto et al 2014 additionally by understanding the variation of tree growth rates we can identify parts of the field affected by soil nutrient deficiency and or inappropriate level of water availability in our research study we utilize lidar data to detect individual coconut trees at multiple plots of varying canopy cover levels within a coconut plantation located in southeast brazil in particular we are employing a lm based algorithm along with different combinations of tws and sws on lidar derived chms for executing the itd process the canopy cover cov is also computed from lidar to evaluate its usefulness for optimizing tws selection adding to that as an extension of itd estimation of plot level uniformity is also performed with an aim to approximate the existing variability in growth rates of trees for this purpose ph350 index was computed for each plot 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area fig 1 encompasses 11 ha of a coconut plantation in a rural settlement located northeast of japeri municipality in the state of rio de janeiro brazil the elevation of the region ranges from 30 m to 100 m and the climate is characterized as tropical without dry season defined as af tropical rainforest climate in koppen classification alvares et al 2013 annual average precipitation is around 1450 mm average temperature ranges from a minimum of 20 9 c in the coolest month july to a 26 7 c in the hottest month february climate data org 2014 a total of 7 sites with varying levels of canopy cover were considered these sites can be subsumed under three categories based on experts opinions after analyzing the aerial imageries of the study area type a stands plantations with high canopy cover sites 1 2 and 3 type b stands plantations with medium canopy cover sites 4 and 5 and type c stands plantations with low canopy cover sites 6 and 7 2 2 lidar data collection and processing the lidar data were acquired through a private company named topocart and they employed a leica geosystems als60 sensor scanning with a camera rcd 105 for data acquisition purpose the survey was conducted on september 2013 specifications of the lidar system used are summarized in table 1 we employed functionalities available in us forest service fusion ldv3 42 software mcgauchey 2015 and lastools isenburg 2015 to perform lidar preprocessing for ground and non ground separation a filtering algorithm based on kraus and pfeifer kraus and pfeifer 1998 was applied afterwards using the classified ground bare earth points dtm with a spatial resolution of 1 0 m was generated using gridsurfacecreate function the gridsurfacecreate function generates a gridded surface model representing the average elevation for all points within a cell so that the final surface it produces lies within the bare earth point set subsequently the heights were normalized using clipdata tool and it was assured that the z coordinate for each point corresponded to the height above ground and not the orthometric elevation of the single point the clipdata tool when used in conjunction with a bare earth model allows ground elevations to be subtracted from the return elevations the canopy height model chm with a spatial resolution of 0 5 m was built using the pit free algorithm developed by khosravipour et al 2014 the workflow was implemented by following the approach proposed in isenburg 2015 a pit free algorithm is a kind of technique that exploits the 3d structure of the tree crowns for removing height variations existing within lidar data this way issues associated with data pits which are irregular height variations present in chms can be resolved khosravipour et al 2014 2013 these pits are usually developed when the first return from lidar is far below the canopy and these impede the accurate extraction of forest parameters from chms persson et al 2002 leckie et al 2003 nevertheless pit free algorithm incorporates a three step workflow that includes i normalizing the height of the lidar data by replacing the elevation of each point with its vertical height above the ground ii constructing one standard chm using all first returns and multiple partial chms based on first returns associated with higher up vegetation hits and iii stacking all the previously developed chms for creating a final chm where each cell location has the maximum value across all input rasters that addresses this issue hence aforementioned approach was selected over alternative choices such as gaussian filtering which often fails to accurately target the pits and instead alter all pixels of the chm raster thereby exerting distortion on the tree crown structures khosravipour et al 2013 even then we tested this surrogate in the hope of extracting fruitful interpretations in parallel lasclip function from lidr package roussel and auty 2018 was employed for creating subsets of the lidar points clouds within the study plots following this the point clouds were normalized using lasnormalize function in lidr package roussel and auty 2018 and cov value for plots were computed from the normalized point clouds using lasmetrics function in rlidar package lasmetrics function allows the user to compute a wide range of lidar metrics that statistically describe the lidar dataset silva et al 2017a all the aforementioned functions were implemented in r software r core team 2015 cov calculation see eq 1 was done to test its applicability for improving the selection of tws parameters in a particular test plot as listed in previous studies silva et al 2016 falkowski et al 2008 this way an adaptive tws selection approach was enacted in this study for optimizing itd accuracy the height threshold ht was set to 0 08 m while calculating cov so that the potential lidar returns from grass are removed not at the expense of lidar returns from coconut tree saplings crowns whose heights were as low as 0 10 m at some instances 1 c o v n u m b e r o f l i d a r f i r s t r e t u r n s a b o v e h t t o t a l n u m b e r o f l i d a r f i

2017a r core team 2015 was used the findtreeschm function search for treetops in the chm through a moving window with a fixed tws wulder et al 2000 as the underlying methodology incorporated for this function is the local maximum algorithm tree tops found are actually the pixels with maximum heights within the fixed window see fig 2 b the number of local maxima identified are kept under check by defining a height threshold as well as by applying smoothing filters silva et al 2016 wulder et al 2000 gebreslasie et al 2011 for our study we selected a total of 19 plots 20 m x 20 m having an area of approximately 0 04 ha each randomly from 7 different sites such that variable canopy cover levels are accounted in the samples consequently we tested the combination of various tws 3 3 5 5 and 7 7 pixels with an unsmoothed chm as well as with multiple fixed smoothing window sizes sws 3 3 and 5 5 pixels and chose parameters accordingly for attaining an optimal tree detection result the spatial filter employed was mean filter as this filter has been found to perform well with trees having irregular canopy structures silva et al 2016 along with that the associated tree top heights h were also noted from the chms for further analysis purposes for evaluation purposes initially the number of trees detected ntd per plot using lidar were manually compared with reference data gathered through visual assessment of high resolution imagery which was created after orthorectifying aerial photos that were taken along with the lidar survey september 2013 of the study sites the spatial resolution of the images were 30 cm and the camera used was a vexcel microsoft model ultracam x tws sws combinations that gave best results for each plot were noted and the best performing tws sws combinations with respect to cov were selected for conducting accuracy assessment a performance assessment in terms of relative error rate eq 2 was also done for exploring the individual and combined influence of cov tws and sws in itd and the cases for which the relative error was close to 10 were further analyzed lastly accuracy assessment which involved evaluating in terms of statistical measures such as true positive tp correct detection false negative fn omission error false positive fp commission error recall r precision p and f score f was performed on the selected combinations eqs 3 5 were adopted from li et al 2012 goutte and gaussier 2005 sokolova et al 2006 here recall gives us a measure of trees detected and is inversely related to omission error precision denotes a measure of correctly detected trees and is inversely related to commission error and f score represents the harmonic mean of recall and precision fig 3 illustrates the itd pipeline implemented in this paper for validating the itd derived tree heights we measured the tree heights manually from the lidar point clouds using fusion ldv see supplementary figure s1 and used them as our reference for comparison 2 r

surprisingly only a few studies hentz et al 2018 hakamada et al 2015a b hakamada 2012 have explored the possibility of deriving uniformity indices to date and none focusing on coconut plantations luu et al 2013 boyden et al 2008 stape et al 2010 little et al 2003 silva 2005 in these studies the authors mostly employed the forest uniformity index pvar50 or pv50 hakamada et al 2015a b these entities provide a measure of the accumulated contribution of the smaller trees 50 of the total trees in terms of volume in these cases with respect to the entire stand being considered the variables being analyzed such as volume height biomass etc can be chosen depending on study purpose even though the indices were initially developed based on field data schreuder et al 1993 gibbs et al 2007 its variations such as ph350 that employ remotely sensed data have also been tested and found applicable for assessing forest uniformity former studies hentz et al 2018 hakamada et al 2015a b hakamada 2012 have reported ph350 index to be highly correlated to pv50 and the authors have reported satisfactory results and interpretations from the ph350 index values especially in case of young plantations hentz et al 2018 where it is not possible to obtain the dbh hence considering the fact that a lot of our stands had coconut saplings aforementioned index with variable of importance being tree height was chosen for this study the plot level uniformity was estimated using the ph350 index which gives a measure of the accumulated contribution of 50 shorter trees i e trees having heights below the 50th percentile tree height within any given plot hentz et al 2018 hakamada 2012 the ph350 values eq 6 were calculated based on the lidar detected trees in all the plots irrespective of whether the algorithm exhibited discrepancies such as detection of nonexistent trees commission errors or failure in detecting actually existing trees omission errors this strategy was incorporated as in real time applications we will not be able to detect if these errors are occurring or not the equation for ph350 index is as follows 6 p h 3 50 i 1 n 2 h i 3 i 1 n h i 3 where h i 3 denotes the cubic power of the ith tree height and n is the sorted i e trees are initially sorted from smallest to the largest with respect to tree heights tree number adhering to the observations made by hakamada et al 2015a we considered the plots having ph350 index within the range of 0 37 and 0 50 to be homogeneous plots fig 4 provides a pictorial representation of the step by step processes involved in ph350 index estimation the first step fig 4a1 being the tree top identification with the algorithm detecting 18 trees in this case allows us to extract individual tree heights and we estimate the 50th tree height percentile fig 4a2 from the obtained values afterwards for calculating ph350 index we determine the ratio of sum of cubes of tree heights of trees below 50th tree height percentile and sum of cubes of tree heights of all the trees in a given plot see eq 6 in part b1 of the fig 4 the x axis denotes the trees which are ranked from the shortest to the tallest i e tree 1 has the lowest height value and the height keeps increasing till tree 18 which is the tallest tree on the y axis corresponding ph350 values are provided the green line presents the case of a hypothetical homogenous plot having maximum uniformity this can be perceived as an equality line in this case 50 of shorter trees would account for 50 of total ph350 which means ph350 index will be 0 5 the orange line represents the sample under consideration figure 4a1 and in this case 50 of the shorter trees correspond to only 34 of total ph350 resulting in a ph350 index of 0 34 indicating the mildly heterogenous nature of the plot 3 results with varying combinations of tws and sws we observed differences in accuracy rates for itd see table 2 the best combination for itd was found to be for 7 7 5 5 tws sws combination in this case 7 out of the total 19 instances gave best tree detection results here best implies closeness of number of trees detected ntd to the reference tree count n also it was noted that 1 plot of type a plantations 3 plots of type b stands and 5 plots of type c stands had their n and ntd values identical in some cases see table 2 plot ids 4 5 10 12 15 and 19 multiple combinations of tws and sws were found to provide similar results in general an increase in cov was found to be detrimental towards the tree detection ability of the algorithm for very high canopy cover plots i e cov 80 tws sws combination of 3 3 5 5 gave best results in 3 out of 4 cases nevertheless the impact of varying tws and sws was not having a linear relationship with the tree detection accuracy the total number of detected trees in 3 3 tws revealed better results with increasing sws values whereas for 5 5 tws and 7 7 tws both 3 3 sws and 5 5 sws were found to perform equally well this non uniform trend in itd encouraged us to further analyze the possibilities of relationships existing between tws and sws as well as with canopy cover levels without the smoothing filter nf itd showed near zero accuracy in all the cases by calculating relative error for all the cases table 3 we were able to choose satisfactory error close to 10 observations and analyze the individual as well as combined influence of canopy cover levels tws and sws towards tree detection accuracy in 13 cases 3 plots of type a stands 4 plots of type b stands and 6 plots of type c stands itd algorithm of varying tws and sws combinations were able to detect trees with satisfactory accuracy on a combined basis 7 7 tws and 5 5 sws gave the best results in maximum number of instances 8 cases however for cases where cov was greater than 80 3 3 5 5 tws sws combination gave better less than or close to 10 relative error values therefore while performing accuracy assessment table 4 in plots where cov was greater than 80 3 3 5 5 tws sws combination was selected and for rest of the cases 7 7 5 5 tws sws was considered we obtained recall r precision p and f score values of 0 87 range 0 72 to 1 00 0 94 range 0 69 to 1 00 and 0 90 range 0 75 to 1 00 respectively a count of 294 86 22 successful tree tops was reported from the itd process from a total of 341 trees the algorithm missed 47 trees and falsely detected 24 trees giving an estimate of 318 trees it also became evident that in plots with cov lesser than 80 average tree detection accuracy 87 64 and omission error 12 35 were comparatively better than for the cases where cov was greater than 80 average itd accuracy was 82 22 and omission error was 17 78 see table 5 adding to that with respect to f score and commission error values study plots with cov less than 80 showed significantly stronger results f score was 0 93 and commission error was 1 59 compared to plots where cov was greater than 80 f score was 0 80 and commission error was 22 22 illustrations of 3d lidar point clouds of plots with varying canopy cover levels and their corresponding itd results with respect to the reference trees are presented in fig 5 on evaluating the range of tree heights obtained from lidar we noticed the standard deviations to vary between 0 19 and 2 97 even though the average tree heights were below 6 m in all the cases for plot 5 we obtained a maximum tree height of 14 79 m using these derived heights ph350 indices were calculated and they ranged from 0 0432 to 0 4571 out of the 19 plots only 4 were found to exhibit high levels of homogeneity summary statistics of plot level lidar derived tree heights and associated ph350 values are presented in table 6 we also estimated the coefficient of determination r2 for itd derived tree heights and reference tree heights and obtained an r2 value of 0 98 see supplementary figure s2 4 discussion in the past few decades lidar data has found a stronghold in the realm of itd based forest inventory applications due to its ability in estimating tree level attributes such as crown size dbh crown close and canopy structure from delineated trees with satisfactory accuracies silva et al 2017a zhen et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 bai et al 2005 harding et al 2001 duncanson and dubayah 2018 additionally ongoing advancements in optical remote sensing hyperspectral imagery uav applications and their combinations are also paving ways to enhance itd initiatives within the forestry sector mohan et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 dempewolf et al 2017 cardil et al 2017 2019 while remote sensing techniques especially lidar has become a promising source for performing itd its applications have been limited to tropical forests mixed conifer forests eucalyptus plantations and pine plantations in several countries primarily due to data constraints and challenging canopy structures that variant species possess ferraz et al 2016 ke and quackenbush 2011 féret and asner 2013 pont et al 2015 jeronimo et al 2018 hence supplemental studies are required tested with wide variety of cultures and vegetation covers to confirm the proposed advantages of using airborne laser scanning for itd in our study we evaluated the applicability of a lm based algorithm for detecting and delineating individual coconut trees which are rarely studied from a remote sensing perspective in a plantation comprising of sites with variable canopy cover levels the basic assumptions of the algorithm being that each imaged tree crown has a single brightest spot with darker areas between tree crowns larsen et al 2011 gougeon and moore 1988 in accordance with the underlying assumption we observed the tree tops being represented as brightest spots within the chms and depending on the varying levels of canopy covers from high to low there occurred an evident increase in darker areas between the brightest spots blue colored region in fig 5 a4 c4 coconut tree crowns because of its irregular canopy cover and often slanted stems were expected to be comparatively harder to detect and isolate fig 6 a notwithstanding the potential limitations selection of a lm approach and testing of different combinations of sws and tws proved beneficial for achieving optimal accuracy with the tree top detections employing cov variable with a threshold of 80 which was relatively higher than the thresholds applied in previous studies silva et al 2016 falkowski et al 2008 as a criterion for adapting the tws also enabled us to substantially improve the average tree detection accuracy from 79 77 when only the best tws sws combination 7 7 5 5 was applied for all the plots see supplementary table s1 to 86 22 this in turn underscores the ability of our proposed methodology for isolating individual trees having irregular tree crowns even in dense canopy plantations also as noted in previous studies silva et al 2016 khosravipour et al 2014 a choice of mean filter smoothing with pit free chms gave superior results compared to other commonly employed filter techniques gaussian based approaches were tested as alternatives however since coconut tree crowns are acutely asymmetrical unlike conifers which tend to have a more regular conical shape the results were not at par to the findings obtained using the formerly mentioned method the accuracy rates for itd which were verified in terms of precision recall and f score shows that successful combinations of tws and sws can achieve satisfactory detection results for coconut plantations based on the results from the relative error table table 4 we deduced that with the increase in canopy cover accurate itd becomes more challenging in case of coconut plantations this can be attributed to issues associated with occlusion shadows variation in light reflectance canopy overlap and closure size and tree spacing as listed in similar studies hyyppä et al 2008 silva et al 2016 zhen et al 2016 wulder et al 2003 asner and heidebrecht 2002 even though from table 4 itd it was found that for plots with cov greater than 80 a tws sws combination of 3 3 5 5 provided the best result in table 5 relative error estimation we noticed that 5 5 3 3 combination gave satisfactory results in two instances as opposed to 3 3 5 5 combination which met the cut off in only one case however the relative error for plots 2 and 4 were very close to 10 11 5 and 10 5 respectively which corroborates the previously observed pattern in general for plots in type a high canopy cover stands tws of 3 3 and sws of 5 5 gave the best results inaccurate estimation of results happened in alternative tws sws combinations can be related with the irregular canopy of the coconut trees which has many leaves identified with the local maximum this can be a serious hurdle in plots having high canopy covers especially when there occur several matured trees fig 6b for plots in type b medium canopy cover stands effects of tws sws on tree detection enhancement was limited all the tws sws combinations expect for nf were able to identify tree tops of at least one plot with satisfiable accuracy in alignment to the observations made by previous studies densities hyyppä et al 2008 silva et al 2016 we noticed that a lower tws of 3 3 was more effective in itd when tree counts were high n 24 taking into consideration the high performance exhibited by lower tws in itd for cases where tree count was relatively high n 20 it can be inferred that number of trees detected is inversely proportional to the tws adding to that precision was also found to reduce with decreasing tws in our case the plots with cov 80 where 3 3 tws was applied showed high commission error rate which implies low precision furthermore in most cases at plots where the tree heights are relatively higher chances of obstructions to lidar pulses will be lower and this helps in generating more accurate chm models and thereby better itd accuracy this might have partially contributed to the aberrations in findings revolving plot 8 which has a cov close to 80 here around half of the total trees were saplings and the remaining half comprised of taller trees with larger crown size areas nonetheless this inference was not able to be made by interpreting uniformity index values the sizable change in height differences would have enabled a higher tws to make better tree count approximation as compared to lower tws also the tree count was low in plot 8 compared to other plots having cov 80 tws of 5 5 and 7 7 performed in an identical manner when tree count was below 20 moreover we were curious to explore the reasons why among the 4 plots of type b stands only the trees in plot 10 were not able to be detected with 100 accuracy by any tws sws combination we expect this anomaly to be arising from the differences in within plot tree distribution and canopy gap patterns see fig 7 this further implies that multiple plots having similar canopy cover values might behave differently to itd algorithm depending on how the overall arrangement of trees are within each plot and also at times perhaps contingent on within plot tree height distributions as well as presumed in the case of plot 8 based on the algorithm assumptions a uniform distribution like that of study plot 12 fig 7c would be easier to detect for the algorithm than an indented distribution exhibited in plot 10 fig 7d where tree crowns have a higher level of overlaps along with uneven canopy gaps nevertheless since we had only taken 4 plots into consideration extensive research for understanding the influence of canopy gap patterns and within plot tree distribution for itd is highly recommended before drawing conclusions schneider and larson 2017 nyamgeroh et al 2018 white et al 2018 bagaram et al 2018 plots in type c low canopy cover stands gave satisfactory results for 6 in 7 plots 19 out of 63 tws sws combination cases with multiple combinations of tws and sws yielding optimal predictions also an average precision value of 0 99 and an average f score of 0 95 was attained in this case therefore it can be inferred that when the trees are widely spaced as in study plot 19 figure 6d the algorithm s efficiency in detecting trees correctly is very high here combinations of tws and sws have comparatively minor influence on itd performance identical to the findings in type a and type b stands nf cases did not yield any compelling results in type c stands either this was because of the fact that the irregular tree crowns of the coconut trees cause multiple local maxima to be detected on a single tree crown unless smoothed thereby resulting in extreme overestimation of tree counts considering the overall tree detection results we noticed that there occurred no specific linear tree detection trends with respect to the tws sws combinations which can be attributed to the complexity arising from various levels of canopy covers and or biological features associated with the coconut canopy crown structures notwithstanding this lack of explicit relationships based on our findings using a 7 7 5 5 or 3 3 5 5 tws sws combination can be viewed as reliable strategies nonetheless while employing lower 3 3 tws the commission error rate is expected to very high due to the overestimation of tree crowns it makes on the other hand the former combination which adopted a higher 7 7 tws had a commission error of only 2 34 nevertheless the 7 7 tws and 5 5 sws combination suffered from underestimation of trees majorly in plantations with high canopy cover out of the 69 missed trees 48 trees were missed while performing itd in type a stands see supplementary table s1 hence this combination is not recommended for plantations similar to the type a stands described in this study for performing itd in coconut plantations selecting suitable tws based on cov similar to what we did here is advised also from table 3 we noted that 5 5 3 3 tws sws combination performed well in comparison with the previously mentioned combinations however since our final objective was more inclined to pinpointing maximum number of trees extracted that are relevant i e high precision rather than on the number of relevant trees that are extracted this combination which had high commission error possibility table 3 was not further evaluated at times for larger areas taking a consistent tws and sws combination might seem appropriate and time efficient however in this case performance variations can happen if multiple canopy cover levels tree distribution patterns and or forest types are present as observed in our situation as well as in previous studies lindberg and hollaus 2012 asner and heidebrecht 2002 kwak et al 2007 from the obtained relative error values table 3 for itd with 7 7 5 5 tws sws combination table 3 it can be noted that even when we increase the relative error allowable from 0 to 10 the number of satisfactory results in case of type a stands is minimal also there occurred two cases plot 2 11 5 and plot 4 10 5 where the values were very close to the cut off limit which tacitly states that unconditionally relying on relative error for evaluating itd efficiency of tws sws combinations can be both erroneous and misleading on the contrary for type b and type c stands additional tws sws combinations acquired satisfactory accuracy with increasing the relative error denoting an ease in selecting tws sws combinations among the plots in type c stands only for plot 15 we did not find any suitable tws sws combination here two pertinent concerns were accounted firstly for few trees on edges a major part of their crowns was found to be slanted and leaning outside of the plot perimeter at times application of a buffer on the study plots might help address issues associated with slanted tree crowns monnet et al 2010 secondly even though all the trees in type c stands had adequate amount of spacing between them some trees had their pinnate leaves spread out making it hard to be identified from the chms these issues might have caused most of the tws sws combinations to inaccurately estimate the number of tree tops similarly for plot 14 of the type c stands the algorithm was not able to detect trees with 100 efficiency using any of the tws sws combinations even though the tree count was only 12 nevertheless 100 recall was achieved when 7 7 5 5 tws sws combination was applied meanwhile plot 19 was found to provide the maximum number of satisfactory results here 5 different tws sws combinations were able to obtain 100 accuracy in tree detection this was a type c plot with minimum level of canopy cover and very low number of trees which were regularly spaced also three other plots in type c stands plots 13 16 and 17 and one plot in type b stands plot 12 provided above average results i e at least 3 different tws sws combinations resulted in high accuracy results plots of type c stands and type b stands except plot 11 where the ntd and n values were found equal i e relative error 0 generally comprised of coconut trees with low canopy crown area and closely packed pinnate leave structures the wide and organized spacing in between individual tree crowns would have enabled itd algorithm to have 100 accuracy in these cases for the plot 3 belonging to type a stands where relative error was found to be 0 tree spacing was well structured and canopy gap irregularities were minimal this might have permitted a lower value tws in effective tree detection silva et al 2016 nevertheless further analysis involving accuracy assessment in terms of precision recall and f score is required for confirming our inferences on the itd trend observed in the aforementioned study plots average tree density is another principal factor that has been found to be influential towards tws sws selection and itd in plantations species previously conducted studies recommend adopting a small sws for efficient itd in areas having high plantation densities hyyppä et al 2008 silva et al 2016 this is because as observed from our results a lower sws results in estimating larger number of tree tops and thereby achieves better prediction accuracy when dealing with dense forest plots having a colossal amount of tree nevertheless this pattern was not highly perceivable except for the plot 3 in our study as all our study plots were parts of a plantation which was developed in a way to have equal number of coconut trees separated by uniform spacing throughout the irregular shape of coconut tree crowns might have also contributed to this anomaly as previously stated the differences in average tree density between plots were expected to be nominal in our case even then we did notice minor changes in the number of trees being reported from the survey which we expect to result from issues related to seedling mortality rates natural hazards and or rapid weather changes additionally preceding studies have also mentioned about the advantages of using a high tws for low canopy cover areas hyyppä et al 2008 silva et al 2016 however we did not notice such a trend either probably because of the equally spaced trees which made the detection of tree tops a less complicated process despite that in consistent with recent studies we observed that itd algorithm in overall performed better in cases with open canopies compared to areas with dense canopy covers koukoulas and blackburn 2005 pinz 1991 therefore we expect the proposed itd parameter combinations to work best for regularly spaced coconut trees as in these cases the canopy cover overlaps will be minimal as an extended application of itd and solely for demonstration purposes estimation of uniformity index ph350 at plot levels is presented as a part of this study in our case ph350 values ranged from 0 0432 to 0 451 table 6 revealing high irregularities which imply notable variations in tree heights in a number of plots since there had been no previously published studies done in this direction focusing on coconut plantations our inference that almost 80 15 of 19 cases of the total plots exhibit high heterogeneity solely relies on the findings reported by authors who conducted similar studies in other major plantation crops of brazil hentz et al 2018 hakamada et al 2015a zucon et al 2015 hakamada et al 2015b exhaustive research targeted at coconut plantations would be able to append more clarity and applicability to the presented approach for instance hakamada et al 2015a performed extensive study on clonal eucalyptus forests for investigating the behavior of the uniformity between trees along a rotation and its relationship with the productivity and arrived at a conclusion highlighting the importance of homogenous supply of resources within plots and suggested that for stands to be considered uniform pv50 for volume in this case value should be in the range of 37 50 campoe 2012 obtained comparable results in eucalyptus grandis stands where the 20 larger trees of the stands were noted to acquire higher light efficiency in relation to the 20 smaller ones as calculation of heights deemed more justifiable in case of younger plants another study undertook by hentz et al 2018 evaluated the forest uniformity in terms of ph350 index here the authors compared the performance of two different uav based tree height calculation approaches in estimating ph350 index of eucalyptus spp and pinus taeda l plantations with respect to field data and found the study sites to have ph350 index values greater than 0 34 and classified them as homogenous stands another interesting inference made was that the errors aggregating from tree height calculation does not influence the uniformity index results significantly as these errors are generally distributed evenly among the individual trees even then uniform index error reduction up to 2 79 was found attainable with careful selection of height calculation methods along the same line zucon et al 2015 also observed that the influence of issues associated with uav based crown delineations had very nominal impact on accuracy of pvar50 values in a young eucalyptus plantation in case of coconut plantations it is often the case that due to tree mortality in the initial phases a lot of additional saplings are planted at a later stage resulting in increased stand heterogeneity differences in silvicultural practices such as soil preparation weed control fertilizer treatment and number of trees per hectare also add to the overall heterogeneity ryan et al 2010 stape et al 2010 little et al 2003 silva 2005 örlander et al 2002 nilsson and allen 2003 understanding these variations in the early stages are crucial for optimizing production as the responses of fertilization and several silvicultural practices are more pronounced at this growth period borders et al 2004 martinez vilalta et al 2007 for instance in case of plot 14 where the corresponding uniformity index was 0 0432 it can be noticed that the mean tree height was only 0 30 m therefore proper application of fertilization and management practices has the potential to enhance homogeneity in these types of stands whereas with plot 5 the standard deviation was very striking this was due to the influence of a single tree that was almost three times as tall as the remaining trees and it greatly affected the uniformity index despite that when we calculated the same without considering the aforementioned tree the uniformity index increased from an initial 0 1432 to 0 4036 which emphasizes the necessity for careful consideration of outliers for drawing meaningful interpretations with regard to itd in general stands with higher uniformity is expected to enhance tree detection accuracy as in case of heterogenous stands the taller trees with larger crown shapes might increase the amount of overlaps or even cause occlusion hyyppä et al 2008 silva et al 2016 however based on our results which does not reveal any significant pattern in the aforementioned angle we recommend future studies to take into consideration heights of individual trees and perform comparison studies for unfolding the intricacies extraction of fruitful information on influence of forest uniformity and itd is very limited from plot level assessments also since uniformity index can be derived only after performing itd studies on the influence of this entity on itd is wholly for advancing scientific perspectives and this index cannot be considered as a stand alone determinant such as cov for enhancing itd accuracy in spite of that we advocate research endeavors for evaluating combinations of pixel size and itd methods for itd and impact of forest uniformity assessment in mere future to reiterate for successful identification of tree locations in depth understanding of tws and sws determination with respect to cov is vital as proved from our observations and similar studies silva et al 2016 wulder et al 2000 with the emerging growth of software technology algorithm development and remote sensing platforms applications and functionalities of itd are expected to expand and thereby assist the forest sector extensively herein we presented plot level uniformity index estimation as an extension of itd research focused on itd in areas with multiple species types will be highly intriguing in this regard the results from our study underscores that successful selection of tws and sws depending on tree crown structure within plot tree distribution patterns and canopy cover is crucial for developing adaptive itd models based on lm algorithm however species specific issues need to be carefully considered and further research on forest uniformity and tree spacing s influence is also required to corroborate the applicability of the proposed methodology application of the template matching algorithm provided by advance software like ecognition or state of the art visual analytic and multispectral lidar based techniques might offer more clarity in this regard huo et al 2018 olofsson et al 2006 gavazzi et al 2016 murugesan et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 nonetheless the cost of attaining these software license and high quality data can be a hurdle for small scale users to address issues regarding omission errors faced by certain tws sws combinations like in our case 7 7 5 5 tws sws combination results for type a stands additional studies involving a wide range of complementing tree level variables such as crown diameter stem volume tree basal area etc are advocated also we recommend evaluating the role of external factors such as climate season wind etc as well as impact of dried or diseased coconut leaves which might affect the quality and output of the itd workflow this was beyond the scope of this paper in addition development in uav technology has made it possible to have multiple cameras attached to uav quadcopters and that way take images in different wavelengths of the same locations at the same instant and hence we expect to find a considerable amount of applications integrating features of uav lidar data with optical as well as hyperspectral imagery in the mere future zhao et al 2018 yao and wei 2013 caughlin et al 2016 sankey et al 2017 kandare et al 2017 in sum through our research we extended the usage of itd phenomenon to trees with irregular and attenuated canopy covers such as coconut trees and provided recommendations for assisting plantation owners investors and companies that rely on coconut production even though our study focused on a plantation in brazil we expect our work to conceivably pave the way for further research advancements in itd and coconut plantation management spheres of a wider spectrum 5 conclusions lidar data along with suitable tree detection algorithm and window sizes based on lidar derived canopy cover can be effectively used for delineating individual trees and thereby estimating a wide range of tree and canopy characteristics this study was performed to detect individual coconut trees from a plantation having plots of varying canopy cover levels and presents an extended application of itd which is estimation of plot level uniformity index by employing a lm algorithm we tested various combinations of tws and sws for achieving optimal itd rates our results emphasize the importance of tws and sws parameter selection depending on species types forest structure and management objectives and demonstrates the potential of itd algorithm in attaining satisfactory results in cases of trees with irregular and attenuated canopy structures such as coconut trees future research focusing on integrating uav derived images hyperspectral imagery and satellite images with lidar data can further assist the efficient detection of individual trees in coconut plantations as well as forest areas having multiple species types author contributions

24996,the streaked horned lark hereafter lark eremophila alpestris strigata is a federally listed bird subspecies of the pacific northwest that occupies open landscapes with short vegetation and abundant bare ground across its breeding range which has contracted dramatically the lark relies primarily on human modified habitats maintained in early successional states e g agricultural fields airfields deposition islands the focus of our study is the lower columbia river where larks primarily occupy deposition islands created as a byproduct of shipping channel deepening dredging projects the u s army corps of engineers has proactively adopted a shifting habitat mosaic management approach when placing dredge sand materials to maintain lark habitat throughout the project area to help achieve their goal we created a geospatial tool capable of quantifying and tracking habitat suitability for larks throughout the project area with satellite imagery we created spatial models of lark breeding habitat by incorporating lark survey data sentinel 2 satellite imagery dredge deposition maps and surface elevation models we built candidate predictive models of lark breeding habitat after combining survey data years 2016 and 2017 predictor variables and logistic regression in addition we created a novel seral stage predictor variable to identify young mature old and unsuitable locations critical information for lark conservation planning and dredge disposal operational planning we challenged probability models the year they were constructed 2016 and the following year 2017 with set aside survey data the best model contained terrain ruggedness deposition age vegetation greenness e g lushness and density of vegetation inside a 10 m cell and heterogeneity in greenness within a 100 m radius verification accuracy ranged from 75 to 83 depending on the model tested and year importantly the seral stage variable allowed us to quantify and locate early optimal and late habitats model results will facilitate conservation planning decisions by informing real time management decisions furthermore they provide a foundation for application in other human modified habitats across the species range keywords streaked horned lark federally threatened columbia river habitat suitability predictive modeling early succession 1 introduction the streaked horned lark or lark eremophila alpestris strigata is endemic to the pacific northwest where it depends on large open landscapes with short sparse vegetation and abundant bare ground pearson and altman 2005 prior to the early 1900s larks ranged from southwestern british columbia to the rogue river valley in oregon occurring on wet and dry prairies coastal dunes and river sand bars that were maintained in early successional states by natural disturbances such as fire wind and flooding beason 1995 pearson and altman 2005 the lark s breeding range contracted dramatically following extensive habitat loss degradation and elimination of most natural disturbance processes during the late 1900s altman 2011 recent estimates indicate the range wide population at less than 2000 altman 2011 with fewer than 10 along the lower columbia river and in 2013 the lark was listed as threatened under the endangered species act esa u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2013 currently the lark is distributed in four subpopulations the willamette valley in oregon the puget lowlands of southwest washington the outer coast of washington and the lower columbia river pearson and altman 2005 altman 2011 since 2010 population trends for the puget lowlands washington coast and lower columbia river appear relatively stable keren and pearson 2016 except for the outer coast where larks occur on foredunes maintained by wind they now mainly rely on human modified habitats maintained in early successional states by unique disturbance processes that replicate natural cycles of habitat creation and destruction for example in the willamette valley larks are primarily found on agricultural lands after the first year or two of cultivation e g grass seed farms while in the puget lowlands they occur on remnant native prairies maintained either by prescribed fire or ignition from military artillery in both the willamette valley and puget lowlands larks occur on grass dominated airfields where airfield maintenance operations keep vegetation short in the lower columbia river region larks primarily occupy deposition islands created by placement of dredged materials conducted by the u s army corp of engineers usace the federal listing of the lark and designation of eight critical habitat units on deposition placement sites had significant implications for federally mandated dredging activities by usace in the lower columbia river specifically section 7 of the esa requires federal agencies to ensure that their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or adversely modify designated critical habitat u s fish and wildlife service usfws 1998 moreover the esa directs federal agencies to use their existing authorities to further the purposes of the act e g aid in species recovery and address potential conservation issues u s fish and wildlife service usfws 1998 the usace developed a shifting habitat mosaic management approach to maintain or expand suitable habitat throughout the deposition network by conducting deposition activities following general guidelines that placement sites were suitable for two to eight years after deposition depending on location anderson 2013 our goal was the creation of a validated geospatial tool to quantify assess and track habitat suitability for larks among islands and between years the utility of this tool would facilitate and enhance the ability of usace to plan and manage deposition schedules by tracking and predicting habitat suitability while also meeting regulatory obligations we used a combination of gis and remote sensing techniques found useful for mapping and monitoring bird habitats across large landscapes hatten and paradzick 2003 johnson et al 2017 we streamlined the process and reduced costly labor intensive geoprocessing steps by utilizing free orthorectified satellite imagery and cloud based mapping techniques attaining our goal required that we accomplish four objectives 1 develop a predictive probability model capable of remotely quantifying lark habitat suitability across the lower 169 km of the columbia river hereafter project area 2 create maps of lark habitat at each usace dredge disposal site 3 develop a novel variable capable of identifying lark habitat by seral stage e g unsuitable early optimal late and 4 characterize the distribution and stability of lark habitat throughout the project area within and between years although our probability models are directly applicable to usace managers planning optimal locations and timing of dredge deposition information from these models should prove useful to a wide number of management agencies involved in lark conservation because anthropogenic impacts affect lark habitat rangewide 2 methods 2 1 study area the project area consists of 25 deposition placement sites totaling 769 ha along 169 km of the lower columbia river fig 1 eight of the 25 sites totaling 264 ha are designated critical habitat for the lark because of their size and importance to the conservation of the species federal register 2013 in this stretch of river usace is authorized by congress to maintain a 13 m deep navigation channel larks occupy the section of the river from south of vancouver washington and west of portland international airport elevation of 9 m rkm 169 to the pacific ocean near astoria oregon elevation 0 m rkm 0 sites range in size from 6 ha skamokawa vista park to 127 ha howard island consisting of island and mainland deposition areas within washington and oregon state boundaries sites are owned by various entities but non federal sponsors e g local ports secure easements to provide right of entry authorization to usace for deposition placement deposition typically occurs as a two step process site preparation e g vegetation removal construction of landing ramps and berms begins in winter and spring and may include dissuasion actions vegetation removal trenching mounding etc to minimize lark use during the breeding season deposition placement usually occurs in late summer and fall coinciding with lower flows and river levels although some deposition may occur in the breeding season 2 2 modeling overview to accomplish our objectives we divided the project into tasks fig 2 bottom panel first we created a list of candidate predictor variables for lark habitat modeling after reviewing reports and consulting with experts next we entered lark survey data from 2016 and 2017 into gis format downloaded sentinel 2 imagery 10 m resolution and compiled digital surface elevation models for the project area we then created a set of predictor variables from imagery and elevation models with arcgis redlands ca prior to committing full support to sentinel 2 imagery we compared the performance of preliminary habitat models obtained with sentinel 2 imagery 10 m resolution and high resolution ortho rectified imagery 1 10 m resolution following verification of sentinel 2 imagery see appendix a for details we developed a set of spatially explicit probability models with environmental data lark presence absence locations and logistic regression we challenged the models in two ways the year they were developed 2016 with a set aside of presence absence locations and the following year 2017 by projecting the models and overlaying new lark locations we summarized and visualized model outputs with maps and bar graphs of predicted lark habitat by island and year last we examined the correlations among model predictions and lark numbers across 25 deposition sites in the following sections we provide additional details related to each task 2 3 lark surveys on sites occupied by larks surveys were conducted three times during the breeding season may june along established line transects spaced 150 m apart within suitable habitat pearson et al 2016 most sites contained multiple line transects that were surveyed simultaneously by multiple observers surveys were conducted between 30 min after sunrise and noon under appropriate weather conditions e g wind 20 mph observers walked the transect at a pace of 1 2 miles per hour stopping every 150 m to look and listen for larks for approximately 30 s observers recorded all larks seen or heard 75 m on either side of their line avoiding double counting by communicating with adjacent observers by radio for each detection observers recorded the time age and sex initial position flight vs ground and detection type aural or visual the estimated location of each individual was mapped on aerial photographs in the field and subsequently entered into a gis file total transect lengths surveyed on repeated visits in 2016 and 2017 were 28 km and 31 km respectively for sites where larks were not detected the previous year but where apparently suitable habitat existed surveyors followed a standardized occupancy protocol pearson et al 2016 methods mirrored the abundance protocol except surveys were conducted once each in may june and july prior to surveys observers received training on survey protocols identification of larks and other focal species by song and call and how to differentiate larks by sex and age territory mapping was conducted in 2016 and 2017 at two deposition sites brown and crims islands ralph et al 1993 these sites were chosen because they differ in size deposition history and are relatively easy to access mapping was conducted by systematically traversing suitable habitat across each island to identify unique pairs or single individuals once a pair or territorial unpaired male was located either the male or female was followed for 30 60 min with the goal of collecting 5 7 sequential locations that were 25 m apart overall the goal was to collect 30 locations for each unique pair deposition islands were visited 6 times during the peak of the breeding season early to mid may to late july and locations were collected from sunrise until bird activity waned usually around noon we assigned lark locations into unique territories based on interpretation by observers including behavior and nest locations in each year we created island wide 95 utilization distributions ud for territories on brown and crims islands using the local convex hull method locoh lyons et al 2013 we used the k method for determining nearest neighbors evaluating different k values by comparing hullsets with different values of k lyons et al 2013 we chose k 10 which yielded a relatively general area of habitat use rather than fine grained detail that showed swiss cheese like patterns we visually compared uds as a secondary validation measure when assessing the habitat suitability models we estimated all uds using program r package tlocoh r core team 2014 and transferred them into a gis environment esri 10 3 2 4 environmental database we assembled a database for predictive modeling comprised of georeferenced layers at fine 10 m radius territory 50 100 m radius and landscape 400 m radius scales and examined their relationship with lark occurrence using univariate and multivariate logistic regression we began by developing a list of potential predictor variables at various scales that described habitat elements thought important to lark initial variables we considered included deposition age greenness or lack of it variation in greenness topography slope terrain ruggedness roughness viewshed openness surface elevation river location distance to edge and patch size following proof of concept and exploratory analyses we retained seven candidate variables that we considered potentially important in explaining variation in lark habitat suitability table 1 deposition age depo we digitized the footprints of deposition events using a combination of tabular records and aerial photography provided by usace or natural resources conservation service nrcs national agriculture imagery program naip 2015 for time periods 2011 2016 we used gis data provided by usace for each time period deposition activity within an individual year was produced as a separate feature class feature classes representing deposition age across all sites were generated for 2013 2017 by starting with the oldest date of deposition per site moving forward in time and erasing deposition that occurred in subsequent years to ensure that areas that received dredge deposition in multiple years reflected the most recent date of deposition for cells on placement sites that never received deposition we assigned a value of 30 years viewshed view we calculated intervisibility for each site within the study area for 2016 2017 using a cumulative viewshed analysis each site was buffered by 400 m to account for sites adjacent to open water we combined the digital surface model dsm created from high resolution aerial imagery acquired by usace for each site for each year with 2010 highest hit hh lidar data provided by usace the resolution of the combined dsm hh topography raster was changed to 10 m using bilinear resampling within the extent of each buffered site we generated a grid of regularly spaced sample points with 2 m separation view was calculated from each point and the cumulative observation frequency for each cell was determined for each site for each year terrain ruggedness index tri riley et al 1999 was calculated for years 2014 2017 using dsms for each site by year we buffered sites by 400 m to eliminate edge effects and combined the dsm for each year with the 2010 hh lidar and resampled the resulting raster to 10 m resolution we produced a tri using 50 m 100 m and 400 m moving windows using the generalized formula 1 squareroot abs square windowsizemax square windowsizemin where windowsizemax represents a raster using the output from a focal measurement that returns the maximum elevation within a circular moving window of the specified size and windowsizemin is the minimum elevation within a circular moving window of the specified size greenness ndvi was calculated from sentinel 2 imagery with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi with the following equation 2 ir band red band ir band red band ndvi is scaled from 1 to 1 with larger values indicating lusher denser vegetation and smaller values indicating less or no vegetation ndvi values less than zero usually represent water features since water absorbs near infrared hatten et al 2010 we visually inspected output to confirm patterns corresponded with our knowledge of the sites variation standard deviation in greenness ndvi sd characterized edges and variability in vegetation density at multiple scales 20 400 m radius with a moving window function hatten and paradzick 2003 river mile rm and river location loc characterized location within the project area but in different ways specifically rm was the river mile at the approximate center of each deposition site usually an island but sometimes a beachfront with rm 1 5 rkm 2 4 corresponding to the mouth of the columbia river benson beach and rm 105 rkm 169 corresponding to the furthest upstream location in the project area west hayden island in contrast loc was a binary variable that separated the first 34 miles 55 km of the river benson beach to welch island and river miles 35 105 rkm 56 169 tenasillahe island to west hayden island the rationale behind this separation is evidence that average wind speed and duration is higher in the first 34 rm negatively affecting the rate of vegetation emergence and growth on sandbars and deposition piles anderson 2013 we used european space agency esa sentinel 2 imagery european space agency esa 2015 to map lark habitat because of its high spatial resolution 10 m pixel to ground distance and availability every four to eight days google harvests sentinel 2 imagery daily and makes the entire collection available via earth engine gee a cloud based modeling platform that automatically mosaics sentinel 2 imagery provides top of atmosphere correction and creates a seamless mosaic ideal for modeling large landscapes hatten 2016 we leveraged the tremendous computational power of gee since all calculations occur on the server side thereby saving time and resources all gis layers in the environmental database were resampled or aggregated to 10 m resolution to match sentinel 2 imagery and projected into a common reference system utm zone 10 wgs84 2 5 probability models we randomly selected 68 of 230 lark ground locations observed in 2016 n 157 for model development and withheld 32 n 73 for verification lark ground locations were all collected in the field during summer 2016 while a complimentary set of absence locations 247 was randomly generated with gis in areas larks were not observed we reduced pseudo replication in our analysis by filtering presence absence data so all points were 10 m apart hurlbert 1984 when absence locations randomly fell inside a 10 m cell that contained a lark it was coded as occupied we created probability models of lark habitat in the lower columbia river rkm 0 169 with presence absence locations environmental variables and logistic regression hosmer and lemeshow 2000 we calculated the relative quality of breeding habitat bh with the following equation 3 bh exp logit 1 exp logit where logit is the linear combination of parameter estimates obtained from logistic regression keating and cherry 2004 in eq 3 the relative quality of lark habitat is linked to the probability of a lark occurring based on the logistic regression under consideration we evaluated the strength of associations between environmental predictor variables and lark presence absence locations with univariate logistic regression and the likelihood ratio test g hosmer and lemeshow 2000 larger g values reflect bigger changes in the log likelihood and a stronger association between a predictor and response variable we ranked predictor variables according to their g values and statistical significance with a χ2 distribution and one degree of freedom hosmer and lemeshow 2000 once suitable candidate variables were determined we assessed their contribution in multivariate logistic regression with backward stepping examining linearity collinearity and interactions hosmer and lemeshow 2000 next we assessed model fit with akaike s information criterion aic

1975 2 6 four state habitat variable we created a novel habitat variable hereafter four state that describes four seral stages related to lark breeding habitat young early peak optimal old late and unusable unsuitable fig 2 top panel we discriminated four seral states by overlaying lark locations model probabilities and ndvi on a scatterplot i e the range of model probabilities and ndvi values used to include or exclude locations the four state variable characterizes how habitat changes over time as early habitat evolves into optimal habitat before transitioning into late habitat eventually returning to an unsuitable heavily vegetated or forested state the successional cycle repeats itself where and when usace deposits dredge material or when other anthropogenic or natural factors e g upland sand borrowing flooding fire devegetates a location 2 7 verification we assessed accuracy and specificity of the habitat models with multiple statistics each model outputs a continuous range of model probabilities so accuracy depends upon a movable probability cutpoint used to delineate extract suitable versus unsuitable lark locations i e cells from the probability grid we examined tradeoffs between omission and commission errors with roc curves and selected probability cutpoints that achieved 80 sensitivity i e 80 of lark locations occurred within cells predicted suitable cells with probabilities less than the probability threshold were classified unsuitable model accuracies were calculated as model sensitivity 1 omission error specificity 1 commission error and overall accuracy sensitivity specificity 2 lark locations that fell outside of predicted habitat were counted as an omission error story and congalton 1986 whereas cells that were predicted suitable but contained no larks were counted as a commission error we also examined the area number of cells predicted suitable for each candidate model at an 80 sensitivity allowing us to quantify the tradeoffs of different models from a ground perspective i e how much area would need to be searched to find 80 of larks for a given model lastly we calculated the density of larks that occurred at different probability thresholds i e lark ha above 50 probability threshold and visualized results with maps and bar graphs 2 8 habitat suitability mapping we generated habitat suitability maps using the 10 probability classes binary suitability and four state variables binary habitat suitability maps were created with a probability threshold obtained from roc curves generated during model development that identified 80 of lark locations binary habitat suitability maps were generated in 2016 the year we built and tested the models and 2017 the year we projected and challenged the models for each year we summarized amount of predicted habitat at 25 deposition sites and produced maps and bar graphs this allowed us to compare and contrast model predictions site by site by year among years 2016 17 or by seral state early optimal late unsuitable 2 9 correlating lark numbers and habitat projections we examined the relationships between lark numbers and habitat abundance at 25 deposition sites for years 2016 and 2017 with five predictor variables predicted habitat pred early optimal late and hybrid the sum of early and optimal the output from the correlation analysis was a 3 5 matrix with pearson s correlation coefficients and p values we also conducted linear regressions and produced a table of regression coefficients and r2 values 3 results 3 1 lark surveys we detected a total of 248 lark locations in 2016 and 238 in 2017 we filtered out aerial detections and flight displays returning 230 and 226 ground detections that were used for modeling the 95 ud areas from territory mapping were 15 7 ha and 14 3 ha on brown island and 4 1 and 3 7 ha on crims island in 2016 and 2017 respectively figs 3 and 4 3 2 environmental variables the environmental values measured at lark locations were smaller in magnitude and range than values observed at random absence locations table 2 specifically larks were more common in locations that were not as green ndvi fig 5 a contained fewer vegetation edges within a 100 m radius nd sd fig 5b had younger substrates more recent deposition events depo fig 5c and or where surroundings were flatter 400 m radius tri fig 5d the mean ndvi value at lark locations was 0 078 compared with 0 302 in absence locations mean deposition age was 10 6 years compared with 20 5 years nd sd was 0 093 compared with 0 188 and tri was 30 2 compared with 39 4 two sample t tests table 2 found the group means for each predictor variable presence versus absence were all significantly different p 0 05 except for viewshed view p 0 05 the distribution of ndvi values at lark locations in 2016 n 230 and 2017 n 226 revealed that lark rarely occurred in locations with ndvi 0 0 i e water saturated sand along the shore water interface or ndvi 0 35 i e shrubs trees most lark locations occurred between 0 0 and 0 1 with a declining frequency of occurrence between 0 1 and 0 2 fig 6 3 3 probability models univariate logistic regression found all predictor variables were significantly associated with lark presence except for view table 3 ordered in descending order of association g were ndvi sd ndvi depo tri rm loc and view all predictor variables had

global model model 4 contained all variables including quadratic terms for ndvi and depo in contrast model 3 included all variables except tri 400 while models 1 and 2 only included ndvi derived variables we also investigated several other models in an exploratory phase including placement location in the river rm and loc along with an interaction with depo we eliminated models containing rm and loc because they appeared to model lark distribution more larks downstream than upstream rather than lark habitat suitability and models that included interaction terms between river location and depo since ndvi captured that dynamic state multivariate logistic regression found the global model model 4 achieved the best aic r2 and ĉ scores table 4 models 3 2 and 1 were the next best performing models in descending order of significance see table 5 for model parameters the two quadratic variables ndvi and depo had positive and negative coefficients indicating greenness and deposition age were positively associated with lark presence up to a point before turning sharply negative backward stepping and the log likelihood ratio test g found ndvi quadratic influenced the global model model 4 most followed in descending order of influence by tri ndvi sd and depo quadratic when tri 400 was excluded from the model model 3 ndvi sd was the most influential followed in descending order of importance by ndvi and depo model 2 which excluded tri and depo revealed ndvi was the most influential followed by ndvi sd 3 4 four state habitat variable we identified four habitat states with a scatterplot depicting ndvi quadratic model probabilities models 3 or 4 and lark locations fig 7 state 1 comprised locations where lark did not occur unsuitable characterized by ndvi values less than 0

beach characterized by ndvi values greater than 0 035 and less than 0 1 state 3 was peak optimal habitat comprised of sandy areas mixed with vegetation typically 3 10 years old characterized by ndvi

lark locations in 2017 after projecting them from 2016 to 2017 with an 80 sensitivity probability threshold specifically model 4 s predicted habitat contained 85 4 of larks 193 followed by model 3 78 3 model 2 70 8 and model 1 74 8 another measure of model performance was the observation that lark densities increased exponentially from lower to higher probability classes both years for each model fig 9 due to the relatively small amount of predicted habitat above the 90 threshold we consolidated the top two classes when calculating lark densities model 3 in 2016 achieved the highest lark densities in its probability classes ranging from 0 01 lark per ha class 1 to 1 3 lark per ha in class 8 while model 4 densities ranged from 0 001 to 1 0 larks per ha in 2017 lark densities for model

of predicted lark habitat in 2016 at an 80 sensitivity threshold and 238 250 ha in 2017 fig 10 model 3 predicted 11 5 more habitat in 2017 than 2016 while model 4 predicted 2 1 less habitat in 2017

miller sands island in 2017 and a spike on howard island in 2016 in contrast brown and rice islands had very similar habitat predictions between models and years indicating habitat stability and reduced uncertainty compared to miller sands or howard islands a habitat time series output by the four state variable provided the amount of predicted lark habitat by seral stage and deposition site in 2016 and 2017 for model 3 table c2 fig 13 or model 4 table c3 fig c1 looking broadly the largest concentration of predicted optimal habitat was on rice island in 2016 51 70 ha and 2017 64 80 ha brown island produced the second most optimal habitat with relatively large differences between years 3 16 ha model predictions of optimal habitat were sparse following rice and brown islands with miller sands crims sandy austin point and howard islands containing 1 12 ha depending on year and model the habitat patterns changed when we examined early habitat with howard island containing the largest concentration 25 38 ha followed closely by rice island 11 37 ha unlike optimal habitat many sites contained small to moderate amounts of early habitat such as austin point 1 10 ha gateway 2 10 ha brown 5 21 ha tenasillahee 6 11 ha and miller sands 5 16 ha there were also numerous sites that had substantial amounts of late habitat such as howard island 41 67 ha west hayden 15 31 ha hump 12 16 ha and sandy islands 5 9 ha 3 7 correlating lark numbers and habitat abundance we identified numerous significant correlations among lark numbers deposition sites and five habitat variables table 6 predicted habitat pred early optimal late plus a hybrid variable that is the sum of early and optimal hybrid both models achieved similar correlations with larks each year with minor exceptions specifically the binary habitat variable pred produced the strongest correlations with lark abundance followed in descending order of significance by hybrid early optimal and late late was the only variable that had insignificant correlations with lark numbers in three out of four possible combinations only model 3 in 2017 was significant the strength of the correlations was reflected in univariate linear regressions between predicted habitat and lark abundance ground locations across 25 deposition sites with adjusted r 2 values between 0 58 and 0 73 table 7 of the eight possible linear combinations among model predictions by year model 3 produced the strongest linear relationship with lark numbers in 2016 n 25 r 2 0 73 fig 14 compared with an r2 of 0 62 in 2017 in contrast model 4 produced an r 2 value of 0 58 in 2016 and an r 2 of 0 62 in 2017 collectively the four linear regression models produced 0 86 1 0 larks ha of predicted habitat depending on the model and year selected demonstrating an almost one to one relationship between predicted habitat ha and larks 4 discussion 4 1 lark habitat selection passerine species like the streaked horned lark select habitat based on decisions at multiple scales hutto 1985 johnson 1980 and our model incorporated that hierarchical complexity at the finest scale 10 m ndvi was one of the most significant predictor variables in our analysis highlighting the importance of vegetation or the lack of it to lark habitat suitability throughout their range the lark prefers areas with a relatively high percentage of bare ground 20 and avoids areas with dense vegetation altman 1999 pearson and knapp 2016 ndvi adequately captures that preference in particular the quadratic expression of ndvi describes the narrow window niche of vegetation cover that influences suitability in the lower columbia river lark home range sizes range from 1 1 to 3 0 ha slater and treadwell 2019 and at the 100 m radius scale 3 14 ha the variation in ndvi ndvi sd was also one of the most significant predictor variables in our analysis the negative coefficient indicates larks prefer territory sized patches of relatively homogeneous habitat with a minimum number of vegetation edges previous data collected in 2014 in the columbia river and puget lowlands concurs with this pattern as more than 80 of the lark detections on standardized surveys occurred 100 m or greater from a hard edge n 120 and the minimum distance from nest locations to hard edge was 130 m mean of 447 n 169 center for natural lands management unpublished data streaked horned larks like other lark subspecies are described as preferring large open landscapes 60 ha with relatively flat topography beason 1995 pearson and altman 2005 anderson and pearson 2015 our top model included a variable characterizing flatness tri at the landscape scale 400 m however intervisibility view which we used to characterize openness at the 400 m scale did not explain variability in lark presence in the study area the lack of support for view may reflect the general openness found on most deposition islands in the columbia river openness on deposition islands is created and maintained in part by operations involved with deposition operations typically involve clearing an area adjacent to the water to transfer large earth moving and pumping equipment removing vegetation including trees and building wide sand berms to hold dredge material all of which increase intervisibility especially at larger sites that receive sediments regularly e g brown rice however a small number of deposition islands support a perimeter of trees e g cottonwood welch and in those cases we found few larks suggesting that view remains important when modeling suitability in the columbia river we suspect that other variables such as ndvi sd or ndvi are better at discriminating lark occupancy although this may not be the case in other regions of its range in addition to habitat related variables deposition age depo and its quadratic term were an important variable dredged material deposition by usace has replaced natural flooding processes as the habitat creation process for larks in the columbia river region deposition age like ndvi tracks seral succession but unlike ndvi is determined by usace dredged material management decisions therefore the depo variable can directly help guide usace s use of this management action to reset the cycle of vegetation succession a critical component for ensuring adequate habitat is available throughout the network under the shifting habitat mosaic approach surprisingly depo did not interact with placement sites closer to the mouth of the columbia river where harsher conditions are thought to delay vegetation colonization and succession anderson 2013 certainly many factors could obscure that relationship in the short time period in which we modeled suitability for example the amount of organic matter in the deposition seedbank or rate of colonization by invasive species we also suspect that ndvi alone is efficient at capturing the dynamic state of vegetation succession and thus lark habitat suitability in this system as the use of this model extends over a longer temporal period we expect the model will provide insight to managers about the relationship among placement site location time since deposition and vegetation succession 4 2 model flexibility the two top models 3 and 4 both received significant support and yielded relatively comparable results providing usace with options for modeling where data are missing model 4 the global model was considered the top model whereas model 3 which did not retain tri was considered the second best model at the 80 sensitivity threshold the amount of predicted habitat between the two models differed by approximately 18 ha in 2016 model 4 243 model 3 225 ha and 11 ha in 2017 model 4 239 model 3 250 acres although the most efficient model i e least amount of area to capture 80 sensitivity differed between years because the tri variable was developed using a dsm created through high resolution imagery usace collected in 2016 it cannot be recreated in the future with the satellite imagery we used sentinel 2 the tri variable could be recreated if additional high resolution imagery lidar or some other version of a digital surface model was obtained in the future however we don t view this as a major issue in the short term since we don t expect tri to change dramatically over the next 3 5 years afterwards a decision will need to be made to recreate the tri variable or rely on model 3 creating a four state model of habitat suitability provides another layer of important information to help interpret model results and provides a critical mechanism for management response previous usace models included yet to be suitable suitable and unsuitable classes u s army corps of engineers usace 2015 while this separation provided an indication of the amount of area that would likely transition into becoming suitable i e yet to be suitable it overlooked the full ecological process and timeline of habitat succession and suitability for lark the four state variable builds on that approach by describing both tails of peak habitat suitability although density of larks in early and late habitats was similar the important distinction between these two habitat states is that early habitat is progressing from a sub optimal state to a peak optimal state whereas late habitat has already transitioned away from optimal habitat and will next transition into unsuitable habitat thus from a manager s perspective knowing where these different habitat states are located can affect operational decisions such as where to place dredge materials what not to disturb and where there may be opportunities to conduct restoration enhancement activities in addition to deposition events other anthropogenic factors are thought to influence habitat suitability for lark in this region specifically these effects fall into two categories and are not directly accounted for in our models the first category includes direct physical modification of the habitat through events such as sand borrowing or off road vehicle activities ongoing but irregular sand borrowing activity occurs at a number of smaller sites e g skamokawa vista park james river martin bar gateway the effect of this activity is similar to a deposition event in that a patch of unvegetated sand is created resetting the vegetation succession cycle we expect our habitat model adequately captures this change in suitability through the two ndvi variables however in cases where these occur within a deposition event they could throw off the forecast of when a site will be suitable after corps placement potentially impacting estimates of suitability based on planned operations lark habitat suitability could also be influenced indirectly by human recreation activities if they are intense enough to impact site occupancy or demographic rates such as nesting success several deposition sites serve as parks e g sand island skamokawa vista park and appear to be popular beach walking areas often with dogs many of the islands are also popular camping areas particularly during the salmon fishing season which can overlap portions of the lark breeding season the effects of these recreational activities which likely deter lark occupancy are not accounted for in our model and could lead to overestimates of suitable areas for larks moreover human recreation likely attracts a wide variety of potential nest and post fledging predators e g raccoons corvids that could impact fecundity at a minimum we recommend removing islands with high recreational use e g sand island skamokawa vista park from summaries of habitat suitability 4 3 managing larks in columbia river this habitat model will aid dredge deposition management and planning by usace and provides a tool that facilitates conservation planning efforts between usace and usfws particularly around regulatory obligations e g biological opinions the usace has adopted the approach of a shifting mosaic of suitable habitat across the network anderson 2013 using intentional deposition placement to create and maintain lark habitat in a pattern that is presumably consistent with historical habitat creation by doing so they achieve their goal of ensuring adequate habitat for the lark as required under ongoing biological opinions with usfws while achieving their legally mandated requirement of maintaining a shipping channel in the columbia river because larks use early successional habitats that are prone to rapid changes in vegetation conditions between seasons the greatest threat to larks in this region is vegetation succession thus tracking habitat suitability is a requirement of current and presumably future biological opinions between the usace and usfws although there have been some general rules of thumb for when habitat is optimal for larks between 2 3 years or 6 8 years depending on location anderson 2013 the pace of vegetation succession is quite variable throughout the network factors that influence succession include the type of vegetation present on the site the nature of past and ongoing human disturbance the amount of organic material and presumably seedbank in dredged sediments and the site s position in the river g slater pers obs anderson 2013 by putting this model into a nearly automated process housed within gee usace can reevaluate the suitability of individual sites as frequently as necessary providing flexibility and knowledge to help guide usace s annual deposition planning efforts and meet habitat suitability targets use of this habitat model will also be valuable for conservation partners in the project area not specifically involved with dredged deposition for example the port of portland recently created a mitigation site for larks on an island that could no longer receive deposition they are intending to manage the site through mowing and regular tilling to create bare ground and sparse vegetation conditions suitable for larks use of this model will facilitate that management by indicating where management should be conducted on areas heading out of optimal suitability 4 4 range wide conservation implications our spatially explicit habitat models provide a foundation for creating suitability models in other human modified habitats across the lark s range we expect that surrogate habitat and vegetation variables such as ndvi ndvi sd and tri will be equally important in other systems indeed even model 2 which only included ndvi values performed relatively well although a recovery plan has not been finalized for the lark this model will be helpful on a number of key conservation actions identified by the streaked horned lark working group that should ultimately be included in the plan center for natural lands management cnlm 2018 for example this model could be especially helpful in south puget sound to identify areas where prairie management needs to be prioritized at occupied or unoccupied sites to increase habitat suitability it could also be helpful to evaluate unoccupied sites and guide decisions about efforts to encourage reestablishment through either conspecific attraction or reintroduction in the agricultural lands of the willamette valley most of which are privately owned the model could help quantify and track available habitat for larks moreover it could delineate the sampling frame from which to implement a willamette valley wide survey to estimate lark population size currently there is a tremendous gap in our knowledge about lark habitat requirements during the non breeding season with greater recognition of the importance of non breeding season habitat quality on population dynamics norris et al 2003 this model affords opportunities to evaluate habitat suitability during the non breeding season in general qualitative assessments of lark nonbreeding habitat appear similar to breeding habitat and thus variables included in this breeding season model might serve as an adequate first step in describing the abundance and distribution of lark habitat during this period where little is known about the species life history 4 5 summary understanding variation in habitat suitability of endangered species particularly where anthropogenic factors have a strong influence is important for endangered species management in this study we created a geospatial tool capable of estimating and tracking habitat suitability using freely available satellite imagery for the endangered streaked horned lark in the lower columbia river where they primarily use deposition islands within the usace dredging network variables identified to assess and track habitat suitability are biologically relevant and consistent with our knowledge of lark natural history and models showed agreement with on the ground mapping of lark territories furthermore we created a unique four state variable that describes vegetation succession as it pertains to lark suitability providing usace with important information to develop dredging operation plans that maintain or expand the amount of suitable habitat throughout their deposition network even though our probability models are most applicable to usace managers achieving their dual goals of maintaining shipping channels while planning optimal locations for dredge deposition for larks information from these models should prove useful to a wide number of management agencies involved in lark conservation because anthropogenic impacts affect lark habitat rangewide lastly the modeling approach outlined in this paper should prove useful in the creation of dynamic habitat models for many other species worldwide at minimal cost to management agencies acknowledgements funding for this study was provided

24996,the streaked horned lark hereafter lark eremophila alpestris strigata is a federally listed bird subspecies of the pacific northwest that occupies open landscapes with short vegetation and abundant bare ground across its breeding range which has contracted dramatically the lark relies primarily on human modified habitats maintained in early successional states e g agricultural fields airfields deposition islands the focus of our study is the lower columbia river where larks primarily occupy deposition islands created as a byproduct of shipping channel deepening dredging projects the u s army corps of engineers has proactively adopted a shifting habitat mosaic management approach when placing dredge sand materials to maintain lark habitat throughout the project area to help achieve their goal we created a geospatial tool capable of quantifying and tracking habitat suitability for larks throughout the project area with satellite imagery we created spatial models of lark breeding habitat by incorporating lark survey data sentinel 2 satellite imagery dredge deposition maps and surface elevation models we built candidate predictive models of lark breeding habitat after combining survey data years 2016 and 2017 predictor variables and logistic regression in addition we created a novel seral stage predictor variable to identify young mature old and unsuitable locations critical information for lark conservation planning and dredge disposal operational planning we challenged probability models the year they were constructed 2016 and the following year 2017 with set aside survey data the best model contained terrain ruggedness deposition age vegetation greenness e g lushness and density of vegetation inside a 10 m cell and heterogeneity in greenness within a 100 m radius verification accuracy ranged from 75 to 83 depending on the model tested and year importantly the seral stage variable allowed us to quantify and locate early optimal and late habitats model results will facilitate conservation planning decisions by informing real time management decisions furthermore they provide a foundation for application in other human modified habitats across the species range keywords streaked horned lark federally threatened columbia river habitat suitability predictive modeling early succession 1 introduction the streaked horned lark or lark eremophila alpestris strigata is endemic to the pacific northwest where it depends on large open landscapes with short sparse vegetation and abundant bare ground pearson and altman 2005 prior to the early 1900s larks ranged from southwestern british columbia to the rogue river valley in oregon occurring on wet and dry prairies coastal dunes and river sand bars that were maintained in early successional states by natural disturbances such as fire wind and flooding beason 1995 pearson and altman 2005 the lark s breeding range contracted dramatically following extensive habitat loss degradation and elimination of most natural disturbance processes during the late 1900s altman 2011 recent estimates indicate the range wide population at less than 2000 altman 2011 with fewer than 10 along the lower columbia river and in 2013 the lark was listed as threatened under the endangered species act esa u s fish and wildlife service usfws 2013 currently the lark is distributed in four subpopulations the willamette valley in oregon the puget lowlands of southwest washington the outer coast of washington and the lower columbia river pearson and altman 2005 altman 2011 since 2010 population trends for the puget lowlands washington coast and lower columbia river appear relatively stable keren and pearson 2016 except for the outer coast where larks occur on foredunes maintained by wind they now mainly rely on human modified habitats maintained in early successional states by unique disturbance processes that replicate natural cycles of habitat creation and destruction for example in the willamette valley larks are primarily found on agricultural lands after the first year or two of cultivation e g grass seed farms while in the puget lowlands they occur on remnant native prairies maintained either by prescribed fire or ignition from military artillery in both the willamette valley and puget lowlands larks occur on grass dominated airfields where airfield maintenance operations keep vegetation short in the lower columbia river region larks primarily occupy deposition islands created by placement of dredged materials conducted by the u s army corp of engineers usace the federal listing of the lark and designation of eight critical habitat units on deposition placement sites had significant implications for federally mandated dredging activities by usace in the lower columbia river specifically section 7 of the esa requires federal agencies to ensure that their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or adversely modify designated critical habitat u s fish and wildlife service usfws 1998 moreover the esa directs federal agencies to use their existing authorities to further the purposes of the act e g aid in species recovery and address potential conservation issues u s fish and wildlife service usfws 1998 the usace developed a shifting habitat mosaic management approach to maintain or expand suitable habitat throughout the deposition network by conducting deposition activities following general guidelines that placement sites were suitable for two to eight years after deposition depending on location anderson 2013 our goal was the creation of a validated geospatial tool to quantify assess and track habitat suitability for larks among islands and between years the utility of this tool would facilitate and enhance the ability of usace to plan and manage deposition schedules by tracking and predicting habitat suitability while also meeting regulatory obligations we used a combination of gis and remote sensing techniques found useful for mapping and monitoring bird habitats across large landscapes hatten and paradzick 2003 johnson et al 2017 we streamlined the process and reduced costly labor intensive geoprocessing steps by utilizing free orthorectified satellite imagery and cloud based mapping techniques attaining our goal required that we accomplish four objectives 1 develop a predictive probability model capable of remotely quantifying lark habitat suitability across the lower 169 km of the columbia river hereafter project area 2 create maps of lark habitat at each usace dredge disposal site 3 develop a novel variable capable of identifying lark habitat by seral stage e g unsuitable early optimal late and 4 characterize the distribution and stability of lark habitat throughout the project area within and between years although our probability models are directly applicable to usace managers planning optimal locations and timing of dredge deposition information from these models should prove useful to a wide number of management agencies involved in lark conservation because anthropogenic impacts affect lark habitat rangewide 2 methods 2 1 study area the project area consists of 25 deposition placement sites totaling 769 ha along 169 km of the lower columbia river fig 1 eight of the 25 sites totaling 264 ha are designated critical habitat for the lark because of their size and importance to the conservation of the species federal register 2013 in this stretch of river usace is authorized by congress to maintain a 13 m deep navigation channel larks occupy the section of the river from south of vancouver washington and west of portland international airport elevation of 9 m rkm 169 to the pacific ocean near astoria oregon elevation 0 m rkm 0 sites range in size from 6 ha skamokawa vista park to 127 ha howard island consisting of island and mainland deposition areas within washington and oregon state boundaries sites are owned by various entities but non federal sponsors e g local ports secure easements to provide right of entry authorization to usace for deposition placement deposition typically occurs as a two step process site preparation e g vegetation removal construction of landing ramps and berms begins in winter and spring and may include dissuasion actions vegetation removal trenching mounding etc to minimize lark use during the breeding season deposition placement usually occurs in late summer and fall coinciding with lower flows and river levels although some deposition may occur in the breeding season 2 2 modeling overview to accomplish our objectives we divided the project into tasks fig 2 bottom panel first we created a list of candidate predictor variables for lark habitat modeling after reviewing reports and consulting with experts next we entered lark survey data from 2016 and 2017 into gis format downloaded sentinel 2 imagery 10 m resolution and compiled digital surface elevation models for the project area we then created a set of predictor variables from imagery and elevation models with arcgis redlands ca prior to committing full support to sentinel 2 imagery we compared the performance of preliminary habitat models obtained with sentinel 2 imagery 10 m resolution and high resolution ortho rectified imagery 1 10 m resolution following verification of sentinel 2 imagery see appendix a for details we developed a set of spatially explicit probability models with environmental data lark presence absence locations and logistic regression we challenged the models in two ways the year they were developed 2016 with a set aside of presence absence locations and the following year 2017 by projecting the models and overlaying new lark locations we summarized and visualized model outputs with maps and bar graphs of predicted lark habitat by island and year last we examined the correlations among model predictions and lark numbers across 25 deposition sites in the following sections we provide additional details related to each task 2 3 lark surveys on sites occupied by larks surveys were conducted three times during the breeding season may june along established line transects spaced 150 m apart within suitable habitat pearson et al 2016 most sites contained multiple line transects that were surveyed simultaneously by multiple observers surveys were conducted between 30 min after sunrise and noon under appropriate weather conditions e g wind 20 mph observers walked the transect at a pace of 1 2 miles per hour stopping every 150 m to look and listen for larks for approximately 30 s observers recorded all larks seen or heard 75 m on either side of their line avoiding double counting by communicating with adjacent observers by radio for each detection observers recorded the time age and sex initial position flight vs ground and detection type aural or visual the estimated location of each individual was mapped on aerial photographs in the field and subsequently entered into a gis file total transect lengths surveyed on repeated visits in 2016 and 2017 were 28 km and 31 km respectively for sites where larks were not detected the previous year but where apparently suitable habitat existed surveyors followed a standardized occupancy protocol pearson et al 2016 methods mirrored the abundance protocol except surveys were conducted once each in may june and july prior to surveys observers received training on survey protocols identification of larks and other focal species by song and call and how to differentiate larks by sex and age territory mapping was conducted in 2016 and 2017 at two deposition sites brown and crims islands ralph et al 1993 these sites were chosen because they differ in size deposition history and are relatively easy to access mapping was conducted by systematically traversing suitable habitat across each island to identify unique pairs or single individuals once a pair or territorial unpaired male was located either the male or female was followed for 30 60 min with the goal of collecting 5 7 sequential locations that were 25 m apart overall the goal was to collect 30 locations for each unique pair deposition islands were visited 6 times during the peak of the breeding season early to mid may to late july and locations were collected from sunrise until bird activity waned usually around noon we assigned lark locations into unique territories based on interpretation by observers including behavior and nest locations in each year we created island wide 95 utilization distributions ud for territories on brown and crims islands using the local convex hull method locoh lyons et al 2013 we used the k method for determining nearest neighbors evaluating different k values by comparing hullsets with different values of k lyons et al 2013 we chose k 10 which yielded a relatively general area of habitat use rather than fine grained detail that showed swiss cheese like patterns we visually compared uds as a secondary validation measure when assessing the habitat suitability models we estimated all uds using program r package tlocoh r core team 2014 and transferred them into a gis environment esri 10 3 2 4 environmental database we assembled a database for predictive modeling comprised of georeferenced layers at fine 10 m radius territory 50 100 m radius and landscape 400 m radius scales and examined their relationship with lark occurrence using univariate and multivariate logistic regression we began by developing a list of potential predictor variables at various scales that described habitat elements thought important to lark initial variables we considered included deposition age greenness or lack of it variation in greenness topography slope terrain ruggedness roughness viewshed openness surface elevation river location distance to edge and patch size following proof of concept and exploratory analyses we retained seven candidate variables that we considered potentially important in explaining variation in lark habitat suitability table 1 deposition age depo we digitized the footprints of deposition events using a combination of tabular records and aerial photography provided by usace or natural resources conservation service nrcs national agriculture imagery program naip 2015 for time periods 2011 2016 we used gis data provided by usace for each time period deposition activity within an individual year was produced as a separate feature class feature classes representing deposition age across all sites were generated for 2013 2017 by starting with the oldest date of deposition per site moving forward in time and erasing deposition that occurred in subsequent years to ensure that areas that received dredge deposition in multiple years reflected the most recent date of deposition for cells on placement sites that never received deposition we assigned a value of 30 years viewshed view we calculated intervisibility for each site within the study area for 2016 2017 using a cumulative viewshed analysis each site was buffered by 400 m to account for sites adjacent to open water we combined the digital surface model dsm created from high resolution aerial imagery acquired by usace for each site for each year with 2010 highest hit hh lidar data provided by usace the resolution of the combined dsm hh topography raster was changed to 10 m using bilinear resampling within the extent of each buffered site we generated a grid of regularly spaced sample points with 2 m separation view was calculated from each point and the cumulative observation frequency for each cell was determined for each site for each year terrain ruggedness index tri riley et al 1999 was calculated for years 2014 2017 using dsms for each site by year we buffered sites by 400 m to eliminate edge effects and combined the dsm for each year with the 2010 hh lidar and resampled the resulting raster to 10 m resolution we produced a tri using 50 m 100 m and 400 m moving windows using the generalized formula 1 squareroot abs square windowsizemax square windowsizemin where windowsizemax represents a raster using the output from a focal measurement that returns the maximum elevation within a circular moving window of the specified size and windowsizemin is the minimum elevation within a circular moving window of the specified size greenness ndvi was calculated from sentinel 2 imagery with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi with the following equation 2 ir band red band ir band red band ndvi is scaled from 1 to 1 with larger values indicating lusher denser vegetation and smaller values indicating less or no vegetation ndvi values less than zero usually represent water features since water absorbs near infrared hatten et al 2010 we visually inspected output to confirm patterns corresponded with our knowledge of the sites variation standard deviation in greenness ndvi sd characterized edges and variability in vegetation density at multiple scales 20 400 m radius with a moving window function hatten and paradzick 2003 river mile rm and river location loc characterized location within the project area but in different ways specifically rm was the river mile at the approximate center of each deposition site usually an island but sometimes a beachfront with rm 1 5 rkm 2 4 corresponding to the mouth of the columbia river benson beach and rm 105 rkm 169 corresponding to the furthest upstream location in the project area west hayden island in contrast loc was a binary variable that separated the first 34 miles 55 km of the river benson beach to welch island and river miles 35 105 rkm 56 169 tenasillahe island to west hayden island the rationale behind this separation is evidence that average wind speed and duration is higher in the first 34 rm negatively affecting the rate of vegetation emergence and growth on sandbars and deposition piles anderson 2013 we used european space agency esa sentinel 2 imagery european space agency esa 2015 to map lark habitat because of its high spatial resolution 10 m pixel to ground distance and availability every four to eight days google harvests sentinel 2 imagery daily and makes the entire collection available via earth engine gee a cloud based modeling platform that automatically mosaics sentinel 2 imagery provides top of atmosphere correction and creates a seamless mosaic ideal for modeling large landscapes hatten 2016 we leveraged the tremendous computational power of gee since all calculations occur on the server side thereby saving time and resources all gis layers in the environmental database were resampled or aggregated to 10 m resolution to match sentinel 2 imagery and projected into a common reference system utm zone 10 wgs84 2 5 probability models we randomly selected 68 of 230 lark ground locations observed in 2016 n 157 for model development and withheld 32 n 73 for verification lark ground locations were all collected in the field during summer 2016 while a complimentary set of absence locations 247 was randomly generated with gis in areas larks were not observed we reduced pseudo replication in our analysis by filtering presence absence data so all points were 10 m apart hurlbert 1984 when absence locations randomly fell inside a 10 m cell that contained a lark it was coded as occupied we created probability models of lark habitat in the lower columbia river rkm 0 169 with presence absence locations environmental variables and logistic regression hosmer and lemeshow 2000 we calculated the relative quality of breeding habitat bh with the following equation 3 bh exp logit 1 exp logit where logit is the linear combination of parameter estimates obtained from logistic regression keating and cherry 2004 in eq 3 the relative quality of lark habitat is linked to the probability of a lark occurring based on the logistic regression under consideration we evaluated the strength of associations between environmental predictor variables and lark presence absence locations with univariate logistic regression and the likelihood ratio test g hosmer and lemeshow 2000 larger g values reflect bigger changes in the log likelihood and a stronger association between a predictor and response variable we ranked predictor variables according to their g values and statistical significance with a χ2 distribution and one degree of freedom hosmer and lemeshow 2000 once suitable candidate variables were determined we assessed their contribution in multivariate logistic regression with backward stepping examining linearity collinearity and interactions hosmer and lemeshow 2000 next we assessed model fit with akaike s information criterion aic burnham and anderson 2002 hosmer lemeshow goodness of fit test ĉ hosmer and lemeshow 2000 nagelkerke s pseudo r2 nagelkerke 1991 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve roc auc egan 1975 2 6 four state habitat variable we created a novel habitat variable hereafter four state that describes four seral stages related to lark breeding habitat young early peak optimal old late and unusable unsuitable fig 2 top panel we discriminated four seral states by overlaying lark locations model probabilities and ndvi on a scatterplot i e the range of model probabilities and ndvi values used to include or exclude locations the four state variable characterizes how habitat changes over time as early habitat evolves into optimal habitat before transitioning into late habitat eventually returning to an unsuitable heavily vegetated or forested state the successional cycle repeats itself where and when usace deposits dredge material or when other anthropogenic or natural factors e g upland sand borrowing flooding fire devegetates a location 2 7 verification we assessed accuracy and specificity of the habitat models with multiple statistics each model outputs a continuous range of model probabilities so accuracy depends upon a movable probability cutpoint used to delineate extract suitable versus unsuitable lark locations i e cells from the probability grid we examined tradeoffs between omission and commission errors with roc curves and selected probability cutpoints that achieved 80 sensitivity i e 80 of lark locations occurred within cells predicted suitable cells with probabilities less than the probability threshold were classified unsuitable model accuracies were calculated as model sensitivity 1 omission error specificity 1 commission error and overall accuracy sensitivity specificity 2 lark locations that fell outside of predicted habitat were counted as an omission error story and congalton 1986 whereas cells that were predicted suitable but contained no larks were counted as a commission error we also examined the area number of cells predicted suitable for each candidate model at an 80 sensitivity allowing us to quantify the tradeoffs of different models from a ground perspective i e how much area would need to be searched to find 80 of larks for a given model lastly we calculated the density of larks that occurred at different probability thresholds i e lark ha above 50 probability threshold and visualized results with maps and bar graphs 2 8 habitat suitability mapping we generated habitat suitability maps using the 10 probability classes binary suitability and four state variables binary habitat suitability maps were created with a probability threshold obtained from roc curves generated during model development that identified 80 of lark locations binary habitat suitability maps were generated in 2016 the year we built and tested the models and 2017 the year we projected and challenged the models for each year we summarized amount of predicted habitat at 25 deposition sites and produced maps and bar graphs this allowed us to compare and contrast model predictions site by site by year among years 2016 17 or by seral state early optimal late unsuitable 2 9 correlating lark numbers and habitat projections we examined the relationships between lark numbers and habitat abundance at 25 deposition sites for years 2016 and 2017 with five predictor variables predicted habitat pred early optimal late and hybrid the sum of early and optimal the output from the correlation analysis was a 3 5 matrix with pearson s correlation coefficients and p values we also conducted linear regressions and produced a table of regression coefficients and r2 values 3 results 3 1 lark surveys we detected a total of 248 lark locations in 2016 and 238 in 2017 we filtered out aerial detections and flight displays returning 230 and 226 ground detections that were used for modeling the 95 ud areas from territory mapping were 15 7 ha and 14 3 ha on brown island and 4 1 and 3 7 ha on crims island in 2016 and 2017 respectively figs 3 and 4 3 2 environmental variables the environmental values measured at lark locations were smaller in magnitude and range than values observed at random absence locations table 2 specifically larks were more common in locations that were not as green ndvi fig 5 a contained fewer vegetation edges within a 100 m radius nd sd fig 5b had younger substrates more recent deposition events depo fig 5c and or where surroundings were flatter 400 m radius tri fig 5d the mean ndvi value at lark locations was 0 078 compared with 0 302 in absence locations mean deposition age was 10 6 years compared with 20 5 years nd sd was 0 093 compared with 0 188 and tri was 30 2 compared with 39 4 two sample t tests table 2 found the group means for each predictor variable presence versus absence were all significantly different p 0 05 except for viewshed view p 0 05 the distribution of ndvi values at lark locations in 2016 n 230 and 2017 n 226 revealed that lark rarely occurred in locations with ndvi 0 0 i e water saturated sand along the shore water interface or ndvi 0 35 i e shrubs trees most lark locations occurred between 0 0 and 0 1 with a declining frequency of occurrence between 0 1 and 0 2 fig 6 3 3 probability models univariate logistic regression found all predictor variables were significantly associated with lark presence except for view table 3 ordered in descending order of association g were ndvi sd ndvi depo tri rm loc and view all predictor variables had negative coefficients except loc and view the top univariate performer ndvi sd explained 29 6 of variability in lark presence absence followed in descending order by ndvi 24 6 depo 20 2 tri 18 7 rm 8 7 loc 1 5 and view 0 1 based on the univariate results we created a candidate set of four models using the following variables ndvi ndvi 2 quadratic nd sd depo depo 2 quadratic and tri 400 table 4 the global model model 4 contained all variables including quadratic terms for ndvi and depo in contrast model 3 included all variables except tri 400 while models 1 and 2 only included ndvi derived variables we also investigated several other models in an exploratory phase including placement location in the river rm and loc along with an interaction with depo we eliminated models containing rm and loc because they appeared to model lark distribution more larks downstream than upstream rather than lark habitat suitability and models that included interaction terms between river location and depo since ndvi captured that dynamic state multivariate logistic regression found the global model model 4 achieved the best aic r2 and ĉ scores table 4 models 3 2 and 1 were the next best performing models in descending order of significance see table 5 for model parameters the two quadratic variables ndvi and depo had positive and negative coefficients indicating greenness and deposition age were positively associated with lark presence up to a point before turning sharply negative backward stepping and the log likelihood ratio test g found ndvi quadratic influenced the global model model 4 most followed in descending order of influence by tri ndvi sd and depo quadratic when tri 400 was excluded from the model model 3 ndvi sd was the most influential followed in descending order of importance by ndvi and depo model 2 which excluded tri and depo revealed ndvi was the most influential followed by ndvi sd 3 4 four state habitat variable we identified four habitat states with a scatterplot depicting ndvi quadratic model probabilities models 3 or 4 and lark locations fig 7 state 1 comprised locations where lark did not occur unsuitable characterized by ndvi values less than 0

beach characterized by ndvi values greater than 0 035 and less than 0 1 state 3 was peak optimal habitat comprised of sandy areas mixed with vegetation typically 3 10 years old characterized by ndvi values greater than 0 035 and less than 0 1 and model probabilities 0 65 model 3 or 0 7 model 4 state 4 was old late habitat comprised of dense vegetation e g shrubs trees typically greater than 10 years old characterized by ndvi values between 0 1 and 0 33 and model probabilities 0 65 model 3 or 0 7 model 4 readers may view the four habitat states found inside the study area fig 1 in google

highly significant p 0 01 with performance similar among the top three models when we examined model accuracy from a binary habitat suitability perspective models 1 4 correctly classified 71 85 of lark locations in 2017 after projecting them from 2016 to 2017 with an 80 sensitivity probability threshold specifically model 4 s predicted habitat contained 85 4 of larks 193 followed by model 3 78 3 model 2 70 8 and model 1 74 8 another measure of model performance was the observation that lark densities increased exponentially from lower to higher probability classes both years for each model fig 9 due to the relatively small amount of predicted habitat above the 90 threshold we consolidated the top two classes when calculating lark densities model 3 in 2016 achieved the highest lark densities in its probability classes ranging from 0 01 lark per ha class 1 to 1 3 lark per ha in class 8 while model 4 densities ranged from 0 001 to 1 0 larks per ha in 2017 lark densities for model 3 ranged from 0 006 0 78 while model 4 densities ranged from 0 0 0 77 an independent line of evidence supporting model accuracy were the territory maps created on brown and crims islands figs 3 and 4

of predicted lark habitat in 2016 at an 80 sensitivity threshold and 238 250 ha in 2017 fig 10 model 3 predicted 11 5 more habitat in 2017 than 2016 while model 4 predicted 2 1 less habitat in 2017

85 93 ha than the other three top producing sites both years followed in descending order by howard 21 56 ha brown 28 34 ha and miller sands 11 27 ha model 4 produced a spike in predicted habitat at miller sands island in 2017 and a spike on howard island in 2016 in contrast brown and rice islands had very similar habitat predictions between models and years indicating habitat stability and reduced uncertainty compared to miller sands or howard islands a habitat time series output by the four state variable provided the amount of predicted lark habitat by seral stage and deposition site in 2016 and 2017 for model 3 table c2 fig 13 or model 4 table c3 fig c1 looking broadly the largest concentration of predicted optimal habitat was on rice island in 2016 51 70 ha and 2017 64 80 ha brown island produced the second most optimal habitat with relatively large differences between years 3 16 ha model predictions of optimal habitat were sparse following rice and brown islands with miller sands crims sandy austin point and howard islands containing 1 12 ha depending on year and model the habitat patterns changed when we examined early habitat with howard island containing the largest concentration 25 38 ha followed closely by rice island 11 37 ha unlike optimal habitat many sites contained small to moderate amounts of early habitat such as austin point 1 10 ha gateway 2 10 ha brown 5 21 ha tenasillahee 6 11 ha and miller sands 5 16 ha there were also numerous sites that had substantial amounts of late habitat such as howard island 41 67 ha west hayden 15 31 ha hump 12 16 ha and sandy islands 5 9 ha 3 7 correlating lark numbers and habitat abundance we identified numerous significant correlations among lark numbers deposition sites and five habitat variables table 6 predicted habitat pred early optimal late plus a hybrid variable that is the sum of early and optimal hybrid both models achieved similar correlations with larks each year with minor exceptions specifically the binary habitat variable pred produced the strongest correlations with lark abundance followed in descending order of significance by hybrid early optimal and late late was the only variable that had insignificant correlations with lark numbers in three out of four possible combinations only model 3 in 2017 was significant the strength of the correlations was reflected in univariate linear regressions between predicted habitat and lark abundance ground locations across 25 deposition sites with adjusted r 2 values between 0 58 and 0 73 table 7 of the eight possible linear combinations among model predictions by year model 3 produced the strongest linear relationship with lark numbers in 2016 n 25 r 2 0 73 fig 14 compared with an r2 of 0 62 in 2017 in contrast model 4 produced an r 2 value of 0 58 in 2016 and an r 2 of 0 62 in 2017 collectively the four linear regression models produced 0 86 1 0 larks ha of predicted habitat depending on the model and year selected demonstrating an almost one to one relationship between predicted habitat ha and larks 4 discussion 4 1 lark habitat selection passerine species like the streaked horned lark select habitat based on decisions at multiple scales hutto 1985 johnson 1980 and our model incorporated that hierarchical complexity at the finest scale 10 m ndvi was one of the most significant predictor variables in our analysis highlighting the importance of vegetation or the lack of it to lark habitat suitability throughout their range the lark prefers areas with a relatively high percentage of bare ground 20 and avoids areas with dense vegetation altman 1999 pearson and knapp 2016 ndvi adequately captures that preference in particular the quadratic expression of ndvi describes the narrow window niche of vegetation cover that influences suitability in the lower columbia river lark home range sizes range from 1 1 to 3 0 ha slater and treadwell 2019 and at the 100 m radius scale 3 14 ha the variation in ndvi ndvi sd was also one of the most significant predictor variables in our analysis the negative coefficient indicates larks prefer territory sized patches of relatively homogeneous habitat with a minimum number of vegetation edges previous data collected in 2014 in the columbia river and puget lowlands concurs with this pattern as more than 80 of the lark detections on standardized surveys occurred 100 m or greater from a hard edge n 120 and the minimum distance from nest locations to hard edge was 130 m mean of 447 n 169 center for natural lands management unpublished data streaked horned larks like other lark subspecies are described as preferring large open landscapes 60 ha with relatively flat topography beason 1995 pearson and altman 2005 anderson and pearson 2015 our top model included a variable characterizing flatness tri at the landscape scale 400 m however intervisibility view which we used to characterize openness at the 400 m scale did not explain variability in lark presence in the study area the lack of support for view may reflect the general openness found on most deposition islands in the columbia river openness on deposition islands is created and maintained in part by operations involved with deposition operations typically involve clearing an area adjacent to the water to transfer large earth moving and pumping equipment removing vegetation including trees and building wide sand berms to hold dredge material all of which increase intervisibility especially at larger sites that receive sediments regularly e g brown rice however a small number of deposition islands support a perimeter of trees e g cottonwood welch and in those cases we found few larks suggesting that view remains important when modeling suitability in the columbia river we suspect that other variables such as ndvi sd or ndvi are better at discriminating lark occupancy although this may not be the case in other regions of its range in addition to habitat related variables deposition age depo and its quadratic term were an important variable dredged material deposition by usace has replaced natural flooding processes as the habitat creation process for larks in the columbia river region deposition age like ndvi tracks seral succession but unlike ndvi is determined by usace dredged material management decisions therefore the depo variable can directly help guide usace s use of this management action to reset the cycle of vegetation succession a critical component for ensuring adequate habitat is available throughout the network under the shifting habitat mosaic approach surprisingly depo did not interact with placement sites closer to the mouth of the columbia river where harsher conditions are thought to delay vegetation colonization and succession anderson 2013 certainly many factors could obscure that relationship in the short time period in which we modeled suitability for example the amount of organic matter in the deposition seedbank or rate of colonization by invasive species we also suspect that ndvi alone is efficient at capturing the dynamic state of vegetation succession and thus lark habitat suitability in this system as the use of this model extends over a longer temporal period we expect the model will provide insight to managers about the relationship among placement site location time since deposition and vegetation succession 4 2 model flexibility the two top models 3 and 4 both received significant support and yielded relatively comparable results providing usace with options for modeling where data are missing model 4 the global model was considered the top model whereas model 3 which did not retain tri was considered the second best model at the 80 sensitivity threshold the amount of predicted habitat between the two models differed by approximately 18 ha in 2016 model 4 243 model 3 225 ha and 11 ha in 2017 model 4 239 model 3 250 acres although the most efficient model i e least amount of area to capture 80 sensitivity differed between years because the tri variable was developed using a dsm created through high resolution imagery usace collected in 2016 it cannot be recreated in the future with the satellite imagery we used sentinel 2 the tri variable could be recreated if additional high resolution imagery lidar or some other version of a digital surface model was obtained in the future however we don t view this as a major issue in the short term since we don t expect tri to change dramatically over the next 3 5 years afterwards a decision will need to be made to recreate the tri variable or rely on model 3 creating a four state model of habitat suitability provides another layer of important information to help interpret model results and provides a critical mechanism for management response previous usace models included yet to be suitable suitable and unsuitable classes u s army corps of engineers usace 2015 while this separation provided an indication of the amount of area that would likely transition into becoming suitable i e yet to be suitable it overlooked the full ecological process and timeline of habitat succession and suitability for lark the four state variable builds on that approach by describing both tails of peak habitat suitability although density of larks in early and late habitats was similar the important distinction between these two habitat states is that early habitat is progressing from a sub optimal state to a peak optimal state whereas late habitat has already transitioned away from optimal habitat and will next transition into unsuitable habitat thus from a manager s perspective knowing where these different habitat states are located can affect operational decisions such as where to place dredge materials what not to disturb and where there may be opportunities to conduct restoration enhancement activities in addition to deposition events other anthropogenic factors are thought to influence habitat suitability for lark in this region specifically these effects fall into two categories and are not directly accounted for in our models the first category includes direct physical modification of the habitat through events such as sand borrowing or off road vehicle activities ongoing but irregular sand borrowing activity occurs at a number of smaller sites e g skamokawa vista park james river martin bar gateway the effect of this activity is similar to a deposition event in that a patch of unvegetated sand is created resetting the vegetation succession cycle we expect our habitat model adequately captures this change in suitability through the two ndvi variables however in cases where these occur within a deposition event they could throw off the forecast of when a site will be suitable after corps placement potentially impacting estimates of suitability based on planned operations lark habitat suitability could also be influenced indirectly by human recreation activities if they are intense enough to impact site occupancy or demographic rates such as nesting success several deposition sites serve as parks e g sand island skamokawa vista park and appear to be popular beach walking areas often with dogs many of the islands are also popular camping areas particularly during the salmon fishing season which can overlap portions of the lark breeding season the effects of these recreational activities which likely deter lark occupancy are not accounted for in our model and could lead to overestimates of suitable areas for larks moreover human recreation likely attracts a wide variety of potential nest and post fledging predators e g raccoons corvids that could impact fecundity at a minimum we recommend removing islands with high recreational use e g sand island skamokawa vista park from summaries of habitat suitability 4 3 managing larks in columbia river this habitat model will aid dredge deposition management and planning by usace and provides a tool that facilitates conservation planning efforts between usace and usfws particularly around regulatory obligations e g biological opinions the usace has adopted the approach of a shifting mosaic of suitable habitat across the network anderson 2013 using intentional deposition placement to create and maintain lark habitat in a pattern that is presumably consistent with historical habitat creation by doing so they achieve their goal of ensuring adequate habitat for the lark as required under ongoing biological opinions with usfws while achieving their legally mandated requirement of maintaining a shipping channel in the columbia river because larks use early successional habitats that are prone to rapid changes in vegetation conditions between seasons the greatest threat to larks in this region is vegetation succession thus tracking habitat suitability is a requirement of current and presumably future biological opinions between the usace and usfws although there have been some general rules of thumb for when habitat is optimal for larks between 2 3 years or 6 8 years depending on location anderson 2013 the pace of vegetation succession is quite variable throughout the network factors that influence succession include the type of vegetation present on the site the nature of past and ongoing human disturbance the amount of organic material and presumably seedbank in dredged sediments and the site s position in the river g slater pers obs anderson 2013 by putting this model into a nearly automated process housed within gee usace can reevaluate the suitability of individual sites as frequently as necessary providing flexibility and knowledge to help guide usace s annual deposition planning efforts and meet habitat suitability targets use of this habitat model will also be valuable for conservation partners in the project area not specifically involved with dredged deposition for example the port of portland recently created a mitigation site for larks on an island that could no longer receive deposition they are intending to manage the site through mowing and regular tilling to create bare ground and sparse vegetation conditions suitable for larks use of this model will facilitate that management by indicating where management should be conducted on areas heading out of optimal suitability 4 4 range wide conservation implications our spatially explicit habitat models provide a foundation for creating suitability models in other human modified habitats across the lark s range we expect that surrogate habitat and vegetation variables such as ndvi ndvi sd and tri will be equally important in other systems indeed even model 2 which only included ndvi values performed relatively well although a recovery plan has not been finalized for the lark this model will be helpful on a number of key conservation actions identified by the streaked horned lark working group that should ultimately be included in the plan center for natural lands management cnlm 2018 for example this model could be especially helpful in south puget sound to identify areas where prairie management needs to be prioritized at occupied or unoccupied sites to increase habitat suitability it could also be helpful to evaluate unoccupied sites and guide decisions about efforts to encourage reestablishment through either conspecific attraction or reintroduction in the agricultural lands of the willamette valley most of which are privately owned the model could help quantify and track available habitat for larks moreover it could delineate the sampling frame from which to implement a willamette valley wide survey to estimate lark population size currently there is a tremendous gap in our knowledge about lark habitat requirements during the non breeding season with greater recognition of the importance of non breeding season habitat quality on population dynamics norris et al 2003 this model affords opportunities to evaluate habitat suitability during the non breeding season in general qualitative assessments of lark nonbreeding habitat appear similar to breeding habitat and thus variables included in this breeding season model might serve as an adequate first step in describing the abundance and distribution of lark habitat during this period where little is known about the species life history 4 5 summary understanding variation in habitat suitability of endangered species particularly where anthropogenic factors have a strong influence is important for endangered species management in this study we created a geospatial tool capable of estimating and tracking habitat suitability using freely available satellite imagery for the endangered streaked horned lark in the lower columbia river where they primarily use deposition islands within the usace dredging network variables identified to assess and track habitat suitability are biologically relevant and consistent with our knowledge of lark natural history and models showed agreement with on the ground mapping of lark territories furthermore we created a unique four state variable that describes vegetation succession as it pertains to lark suitability providing usace with important information to develop dredging operation plans that maintain or expand the amount of suitable habitat throughout their deposition network even though our probability models are most applicable to usace managers achieving their dual goals of maintaining shipping channels while planning optimal locations for dredge deposition for larks information from these models should prove useful to a wide number of management agencies involved in lark conservation because anthropogenic impacts affect lark habitat rangewide lastly the modeling approach outlined in this paper should prove useful in the creation of dynamic habitat models for many other species worldwide at minimal cost to management agencies acknowledgements funding for this study was provided

24997,recent research suggests that the spread of pest outbreaks is driven by ecological processes acting at different spatial scales in this work we establish a network model for the analysis and management of pest outbreaks that takes into account small scale host pest interactions as well as landscape topology and connectivity the model explains outbreak cycles both for geometrid moths and bark beetles and provides insight into the relative importance and interactions between the multi scale drivers of outbreak dynamics our results demonstrate that outbreak behavior is most sensitive to changes in pest pressure at the local scale and that accounting for the spatial connectivity of habitat patches is crucial to capturing the spreading behavior through landscapes in contrast to early warning signals based on retrospective data our model provides predictions of future outbreak risk based on a mechanistic understanding of the system which we apply for landscape scale forest management keywords landscape management network of networks pest dynamics pest outbreaks 1 introduction pest outbreaks can strongly affect ecosystem health and hence have far reaching consequences for local economies that depend on specific ecosystem services ludwig et al 1978 lewis et al 2010 fahse and heurich 2011 nelson et al 2013 it has become clear in recent research that pest outbreaks are more complex than previously assumed specifically outbreaks are driven by factors on multiple scales i e host abundance at the stand level connectivity at the landscape level and climate related effects at the regional level senf et al 2017 seidl et al 2016b raffa et al 2008 peters et al 2004 with and crist 1995 these insights coincide with a global increase in disturbances by forest pests inter alia influenced by anthropogenic climate change seidl et al 2017 2014 kautz et al 2017 empirical evidence supports the relevance of these multiple factors but an integrated understanding of their respective roles their interactions and the resulting complex dynamics is still missing limiting our ability to predict pest outbreaks consequently there is a need for a better quantitative understanding of the causalities and cross scale interactions leading to large scale outbreaks raffa et al 2008 seidl et al 2016b senf et al 2017 typically the growth of pest populations is described at the stand level using population models or system dynamics ludwig et al 1978 clark et al 1979 fernández and fort 2009 lewis et al 2010 fahse and heurich 2011 this however does not reveal how local phenomena translate into large scale dynamics although there are models describing spatial dynamics zhou and liebhold 1995 logan et al 1998 a multi scale perspective on pest outbreaks has mainly been presented through a phenomenological peters et al 2004 raffa et al 2008 or an empirical lens bjørnstad et al 2002 seidl et al 2016b senf et al 2017 to date for successful pest management an integrated quantitative perspective on pest outbreaks is needed which describes the propagation of pests as a function of landscape topology and host pest interactions such a perspective translated into a formal mathematical model of multi scale outbreak dynamics can lead to improved outbreak prediction and the design of effective anticipatory actions to mitigate outbreak losses to achieve this perspective we harness the increased availability of high resolution spatial data on pest outbreaks and link ecological insights with multi scale network theory strogatz 2001 urban and keitt 2001 networks have first been introduced in ecological studies through the use of economic input output models to analyze structural properties of ecosystems and their impacts on synergism and stability hannon 1973 finn 1976 patten 1978 ulanowicz 1980 fath and patten 1999 in the field of epidemiology compartmental models initially looked at disease spread in a fully mixed population meaning that an infected individual is equally likely to spread the disease to any other member of the population kermack and mckendrick 1991 due to the wide occurrence of complex networks in nature network based approaches developed for modelling the spread of epidemics have later also been considered to study the spread of computer viruses pastor satorras and vespignani 2001 the spread of sexually transmitted diseases newman 2002 for approximation techniques keeling and eames 2005 and the development of strategies to counter virus spread in real networks chakrabarti et al 2008 until 2010 almost all network research focused on the properties of a single network but since most natural systems are composed of multiple subsystems interconnected networks have received increasing attention in order to improve the understanding of real complex networks gao et al 2012a 2014 in ecology networks of networks nons have been used to study the spread of invasive species through the combination of social and ecological networks haak et al 2017 and networks of species interactions have been studied in view of species decline and extinction pocock et al 2012 many interconnected networks also account for spatial constraints the main advantage of these so called embedded networks over other spatially explicit models is that spatially explicit phenomena can occur at different scales as an example in epidemiology multi scale mobility processes based on gravity models have been analyzed and the effects on disease spread of short range commuting versus long range airline traffic have been evaluated balcan et al 2009 here we present a general framework to determine the spread of a pest over a landscape accounting for large scale factors related to the landscape topology as well as small scale factors that result from varying pest pressure first we present the building blocks of the framework subsequently we illustrate the effectiveness of the approach in capturing the pest dynamics of two fundamentally different pest species finally we illustrate how the framework can be used to guide landscape scale pest management building on network concepts strogatz 2001 messier et al 2013 we demonstrate how anticipatory forest management catered to the landscape rather than the individual stand can optimize pest control seidl et al 2018 2 material and methods 2 1 a multi scale analysis of pest spreading we apply a multi scale network approach and develop a network of networks comprising a large scale and a small scale network the large scale network considers the landscape as a network of habitat patches while the small scale network examines individual habitat patches fig 1 a the nodes in the large scale network represent habitat patches whereas nodes in the small scale network represent grid cells within a patch temporal variability e g pest pressure is captured by the small scale network while spatial connectivity i e contagion dispersal is captured by the large scale network weather effects such as precipitation and temperature influence pest development and spread within a patch while the distance between habitat patches affects the possible spread of a pest between patches throughout the landscape the modular framework presented here consists of a landscape module which captures the pest propagation over the large scale network and a stand module which captures the percolation of the pest through a small scale habitat patch the framework is constructed according to the following three steps fig 1b on the landscape scale we first identify the potential habitat patches of the pest and determine the connectivity between habitat patches based on the dispersal capability of the species under consideration the outcome of this step is a network of habitat patches next we formulate how a pest spreads over the constructed network the study of disease propagation has evolved from unstructured populations to networked populations using a variety of epidemic models newman 2002 pastor satorras and vespignani 2002 depending on the specific pest under consideration we select the appropriate epidemic model to describe the network dynamics we can for instance differentiate between cases where the passage of the pest is followed by host recovery appendix a or host mortality appendix b we here propose a probabilistic model that evaluates over time the probability of each node in the large scale network to be in a given state i e susceptible s infested i or removed r although the epidemic model operates at the landscape scale the model reacts to changes occurring in the small scale networks in the last step we define the temporal variation in the pest pressure active at the local scale through a suitable model of the host pest interactions appendix c which represents the time varying probability that a pest percolates through a local habitat patch appendix d the number of model parameters required by our framework is small at the local scale β s indicates the probability that an infestation disperses through a patch while at the landscape scale β l specifies the probability that a pest spreads to a neighbouring node the recovery rate δ represents the probability that an infested node recovers in a single time step and γ is the probability that an infested node dies the connectivity of the large scale network is fully determined by adjacency matrix a and the spectral radius λ 1 a of the adjacency matrix which is the dominant eigenvalue of a indicating whether the presence of a pest species will lead to an outbreak or not the combination of the network structure the large scale spreading and the small scale variations in the pest pressure makes it possible to describe the evolution of the fraction of susceptible habitat patches infested habitat patches and dead habitat patches where applicable 2 2 geometrid moth outbreaks in birch forests in a first case study we consider the outbreak dynamics of geometrid moths epirrita autumnata and operophtera brumata in boreal birch forest of fennoscandia covering the northern parts of norway sweden and finland jepsen et al 2009b we construct the network by using a spatio temporal dataset over the years 2002 to 2010 the dataset originates from satellite imagery and consists of annual binary defoliation maps with a spatial resolution of 250 m 250 m defoliation scores were previously shown to be an appropriate proxy for larval densities measured on the ground jepsen et al 2009a using the forest mask of the area and based on geographical separation the area is divided into habitat patches that correspond to nodes in a large scale network fig 2 a subsequently network connectivity is determined by comparing the minimum distance between patches with the dispersal capability of the species i e the maximum distance that moths can cover to find new hosts or mates based on expert knowledge we use a baseline dispersal distance of 1500m merging the node and link data a landscape network is obtained fig 2b urban and keitt 2001 a network node in the large scale network is considered infested if the fraction of infested grid cells within a forest stand exceeds a specified threshold η fig 2d we observe that the appearance of outbreaks can consistently be detected under a wide range of threshold values fig 2d the value η 0 5 is selected as the minimum value that discerns three defoliation episodes originating from local outbreaks occurring in different habitat patches as can be observed from our example dataset we adopt the sis susceptible infested susceptible epidemic model chakrabarti et al 2008 and account for multiple scales by linking the small scale and large scale factors in the model the large scale epidemic model hinges upon the infestation rate β β l β s which represents the product of large scale and small scale infestation rates and the recovery rate δ the succession of outbreak and recovery phases indicate that β varies over time the variation in β is due to the small scale factor β s as will be shown later and is modeled by means of a predator prey model the infestation probabilities β s and β l are active at different time scales and we assume that β l is time independent a detailed mathematical description of the network dynamics both large scale and small scale is provided in appendices a and c the appendices also contain the parameter values used to validate the model 2 3 european spruce bark beetle outbreaks in a temporate forest in a second case study we consider the outbreak dynamics of the european spruce bark beetle ips typographus based on a time series of outbreak dynamics from 1990 to 2012 in the bavarian forest national park seidl et al 2016b the data set contains the binary infestation status over the considered period with a spatial resolution of 30 30m over a total area of 13 319 ha and covers two distinct epidemics over this period the network structure is derived from the definition of the habitat patches based on geographical separation fig 3 a and a maximum dispersal capacity of 253 m seidl et al 2016b the resulting network structure is shown in fig 3b the main phenomenological difference with respect to geometrid moths is that trees die after bark beetle infestation the state of habitat patches can therefore be categorized as susceptible s infested i and removed r in order to classify the habitat patches into these three states two thresholds η i and η r are introduced that compare the fraction of infested and removed cells within a habitat patch to their corresponding threshold a habitat patch is infested if the fraction of infested grid cells within the habitat patch is greater than η i and the habitat patch is removed if the fraction of removed grid cells within the patch is greater than η r the values of the thresholds are set to η i 0 07 and η r 0 6 determined by matching the shape of the infestation probability of cells in the entire data set to the infestation probability of nodes in the network to find η i and using an analogous approach to find η r at the landscape scale we adopt an adjusted sir model with possible transitions between the susceptible and infested states indicated by the infestation rate β between the infested and susceptible states represented by the recovery rate δ and between the infested and removed states described by the removal rate γ similar to the moth case study the bark beetle data set contains a succession of epidemic and recovery phases which indicates that the infestation rate is time dependent the evolution of β is modeled by means of a predator prey model a detailed mathematical description of the building blocks of the model can be found in appendix b and appendix c as well as the parameter values used to validate the model 2 4 early warning and risk monitoring building on this modular framework we define first an epidemic threshold that determines whether the ecosystem is in the epidemic or non epidemic regime see appendix e and f then we use the distance to the epidemic threshold as a risk measure for pest outbreaks so that the framework allows us to track outbreak risk over time the presented modelling framework enables us to discriminate between two regimes that are typical for pest outbreaks i e epidemic and non epidemic conditions additionally the model relates the dynamics of the system and its switching between these two regimes to small scale and large scale drivers by means of a parsimonious set of parameters this limited set of system parameters which can be directly estimated from spatial data and observations allows us to define the threshold for the transition between non epidemic and epidemic conditions whether or not analytically tractable solutions can be found depends on the formulation of the model if no analytical solution is possible regions of epidemic and non epidemic conditions can always be determined by simulating a particular instance of the model here we use the geometrid moth case study which has tractable solutions to demonstrate how the framework can be used to inform landscape scale pest management for the large scale model with sis dynamics it can be shown see appendix e that the ecosystem is in the non epidemic regime with decreasing infestation probability when the following condition is met 1 β l β s δ 1 λ 1 a which means that the ratio of infestation rate β to recovery rate δ is smaller than a certain value determined by the landscape topology defined by 1 λ a conversely the system is in the epidemic regime when β l β s δ 1 λ 1 a this result reveals that small scale and large scale factors interact in a multiplicative way in regime shifts from non epidemic to epidemic behavior small scale factors exhibit rapid changes over time as will be demonstrated later and pest outbreaks are very sensitive to these changes on the local scale such that small changes in pest pressure can have substantial effects on the landscape scale behavior eq 1 also reflects the relevance of the network structure through the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix probabilistic insights can be obtained for landscape topologies with similar spatial characteristics in terms of forest density we can determine a lower bound of the epidemic threshold for a landscape characterized by a forest density μ and a dispersal capability r which is given by see appendix f 2 β l β s δ 1 l μ r 2 1 λ 1 a with l a constant defined in the appendix f eq 2 provides general insight how the interaction between pest dispersal capability and forest density affects the epidemic threshold specifically the lower bound of the epidemic threshold is inversely proportional to the forest density and the square of the dispersal capability this result shows the sensitivity of outbreak dynamics with respect to the dispersal capability it is notably hard to predict critical transitions scheffer et al 2009 carpenter 2013 dai et al 2013 similar to early warning signals based on the statistical analysis of past system behavior scheffer et al 2009 the proposed analytical framework requires sufficient historical data in this case to estimate the model parameters however in contrast to statistical indicators of regime shifts our analytical framework provides parameter space trajectories that allow us to track the risk of pest outbreaks over time as a function of key ecological parameters the distance in parameter space to the critical threshold gives indications about the likelihood of an outbreak which enables an anticipatory approach in ecosystem management responding to risk rather than to incidence of events seidl 2014 the distance to the epidemic threshold provides a quantification of the risk of regime shifts between epidemic and non epidemic conditions based on the system parameters β l β s δ and λ 1 a 3 results 3 1 multi scale model provides outbreak dynamics consistent with data the modelling framework can simultaneously simulate population dynamics at the small scale and spreading behavior at the large scale in the case study of the geometrid moths a single population features decadal cycles but by aggregation of data over the considered area we observe three defoliation episodes with a periodicity of three years fig 4 a the three year periodicity originates from different outbreak episodes occurring in different habitat patches which is taking place due to network effects note that in the presented test case we capture the aggregate pest pressure originating from two moth species that feed on a common host while underlying processes and factors e g species differences that generate the aggregate pest pressure are implicit the effectiveness of the framework in capturing the moth outbreak dynamics is illustrated by analyzing the fraction of infested area over time fig 4a showing good agreement between model and data and a coefficient of determination of r 2 0 6 the modelling framework is able to reproduce the epidemic and non epidemic phases with accurate frequency and the magnitude of the outbreaks can be reproduced well for the first two outbreaks the smaller magnitude of the third peak cannot be reproduced by the analytical tool due to the deterministic evolution of β higher temporal resolutions of the available data and an adaptive algorithm to adjust the parameters of the predator prey model over time could resolve this issue in future work the predator prey dynamics are much faster than the temporal variation in large scale factors affecting spreading probability which leads to the assumption of time varying small scale factors captured by β s and time invariant large scale factors captured by β l we test this assumption by estimating the probability that an infestation percolates through the small scale habitat patch based on observations a detailed mathematical description can be found in appendix d and comparing this with the time varying pest pressure in the model comparing the percolation probability arising at the small scale with the modeled trajectory for β fig 4b we observe a good match indicating that the large scale pest dynamics emerge from variations in the small scale factors and justifying the assumption of time invariant large scale factors for the case study of the spruce bark beetle the model is also deployed to monitor the state of the network nodes over time focusing on the infested network nodes we find good agreement between the fraction of infested area derived by the model versus the observed data with a coefficient of determination of r 2 0 67 fig 4c we also verify that the dynamics of the infestation rate β stem from the local scale factors by estimating the percolation probability and comparing it with the evolution of β fig 4d as in the moth case study we find that the observations are consistent with time independent large scale factors and time dependent small scale factors 3 2 pest outbreaks are driven by pest pressure fluctuations at the local scale modulated by the landscape structure as a result of its modular structure the sensitivity of the model can be analysed separately for large scale and small scale factors fig 5 a and b we here use the geometrid moth case study to illustrate the sensitivity of the model to factors manifesting at different scales with regard to large scale factors we alter the network connectivity by assuming different dispersal capabilities fig 5a we observe that modest changes in network connectivity can lead to substantial changes in the magnitude of outbreaks with regard to small scale factors we evaluate how changes in the host pest interaction affect the number of infested nodes over time we observe that the variation of the trajectories of the infestation rate β see appendix g fig g 8 results in radically different outbreak behaviour both in terms of outbreak frequency and magnitude using modifications in the network connectivity and the host pest interactions the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that outbreak dynamics are responsive to small changes in both large scale and small scale parameters this supports the hypothesis that pest outbreak behaviour can only be captured correctly through an accurate understanding of the cross scale interactions of landscape topology and host pest dynamics 3 3 selective landscape management necessary for efficient outbreak prevention based on the epidemic threshold we can distinguish between epidemic and non epidemic regimes and moreover the distance to the epidemic threshold provides a quantification of the risk of regime shifts between epidemic and non epidemic conditions as an example the epidemic region depicted in the space defined by the large scale infestation rate β l and the transition probability q indicating the measurable probability that an infested cell contaminates neighbouring cells illustrates the high sensitivity of the system dynamics to small scale factors since small variations of the transition probability q can result in a regime shift fig 6 a in addition we observe how the size of the epidemic region decreases with increasing recovery rate δ it is also possible to reduce the outbreak risk in terms of the size of the epidemic region in the parameter space through the removal of infested cells or the introduction of dispersal barriers fig 6b in this case the decrease of the epidemic region results from a decrease of the spectral radius due to the changing network structure as a result of the management actions the decrease of the spectral radius corresponds to an increase of the epidemic threshold as can be deduced from eq 1 the trajectory of the ecosystem through the epidemic and non epidemic regions provides us with a quantification of how outbreak risk evolves over time fig 6a and b in fact the trajectory in parameter space provides early warning signals and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of potential management strategies for instance we observe that through targeted management of three forest stands the ecosystem trajectory remains completely in the non epidemic region of the parameter space in the geometrid moth example fig 6b importantly rather than being solely determined by historical pest observations our early warning signals encapsulate mechanistic knowledge of the ecosystem and the environmental drivers in addition to the observations since the epidemic threshold is inversely proportional to the spectral radius the optimal management strategy exploits the knowledge of the network structure by protecting the node in the network that has the largest effect on the spectral radius such a targeted management strategy results in a maximal increase of the non epidemic region in parameter space fig 6b in order to benchmark pest management strategies the mathematically optimal strategy can be contrasted with random actions fig 6c and the benefit of targeted management quantified in terms of the gain in healthy forest area the model determined optimal strategy consistently results in large gains of forest area not infested by the pest relative to the random protection strategy 4 discussion empirical evidence has shown that outbreak dynamics of pests are driven by multi scale processes senf et al 2017 seidl et al 2016b raffa et al 2008 through a phenomenological analysis multi scale drivers were identified raffa et al 2008 and the relative importance of different drivers was determined by means of statistical analysis senf et al 2017 this study provides a first analytical model for pest outbreaks that incorporates multi scale drivers and their interactions we have shown that the model is capable to reproduce the outbreak dynamics of forest insects that feature very different epidemic behavior the analytical modelling framework provides opportunities to include multi scale perspectives into management practices the modelling framework presented here has been designed for parsimony based on a basic model for predator prey dynamics and an epidemic model with parameters that are homogeneous over space nevertheless homogeneous interactions between network nodes are sufficient to yield good agreement between model results and the available data the flexibility of the framework allows us to incorporate different building blocks in order to adapt it to different types of epidemic behavior and or host pest interactions the building blocks of our model can easily be replaced by more advanced ones in the future for example including pest antagonists or introducing spatially variable infestation rates with respect to the structure of the network of networks the small scale lattice network is directly driven by the resolution of the available satellite imagery while the large scale network identification could be improved by designing a classification algorithm in order to make the framework applicable for actual forest management other aspects such as administrative boundaries and specific habitat characteristics could also be included although climate dependent and climate independent factors have been identified in our framework climate effects are currently only implicitly included in the model see appendix g table g 1 addressing the relationship between climate effects and outbreak occurrence more explicitly in future work could allow us to assess the robustness of pest management strategies under changing climate conditions further limitations of our current framework are that variable development trajectories of hosts and subsequently their susceptibility are not considered seidl et al 2016a the framework can represent dispersal of a species up to the landscape scale and in order to expand the model to the regional scale other effects should be included such as long range infestations cain et al 2000 mundt et al 2009 in spite of these limitations the case studies involving two strongly differing pest species defoliator bark beetle indicate that the presented framework is sufficiently flexible to capture the relevant phenomena governing pest outbreak waves in ecosystems the modelling framework is generally applicable to a wide range of systems due to its modular setup with practical relevance as a toolbox for early warning and landscape level disturbance management by integrating different sources of complex dynamics an effective model for pest outbreaks has been developed that quantifies the relevance and relation between small scale and large scale factors the sensitivity analysis underlines that both the host pest interactions at the local scale and the network structure at the landscape scale drive pest dynamics in forest ecosystems consequently the inclusion of spatially explicit landscape scale data as well as host pest interactions is crucial for an accurate quantification of outbreak dynamics yet remains neglected in many pest models e g dietze and matthes 2014 forest managers currently tackle biotic disturbances mostly at the patch level and largely neglect the relevance of landscape effects seidl et al 2016b however the speed at which pests spread through fragmented habitats is largely governed by the network connectivity margosian et al 2009 meentemeyer et al 2012 the danger of over connected systems fig 5a calls for a multi scale perspective in outbreak management and the proposed framework fosters such a perspective by consistently integrating drivers at different scales cornelius et al 2013 this is in line with previous research indicating an increased vulnerability of networks of networks compared to single networks gao et al 2012b several silvicultural practices such as sanitation felling and introducing dispersal barriers can efficiently be tested as virtual immunization strategies long 2009 with our framework in order to improve future pest management 5 conclusions from an applied science perspective the most important implication of this work is that our quantitative model of pest dynamics can be used in landscape scale forest management the modelling framework provides outbreak trajectories that allow an assessment of future areas at risk of disturbances exploiting the knowledge of landscape topology a targeted management strategy that optimally mitigates the spreading potential of a pest can be devised a priori whereas reducing habitat quantity has been discussed in the past senf et al 2017 our model identifies which habitat patches contribute most to the risk of pest spreading which in turn allows us to develop an optimal landscape scale management scheme our results show that the optimal management scheme yields gains of uninfested forest area up to 15 with respect to random habitat reduction in the example of geometrid moth outbreaks these capabilities are especially timely and important given the growing concern about changing disturbance regimes seidl et al 2017 authors contributions mw led the overall research project

landscape module with sis dynamics when the sis model is used to describe the large scale dynamics the network nodes can be in the susceptible or infested state the sis model we use here is defined by the infestation rate β which indicates the probability that an infested node infects a neighbouring node in one time step and a constant recovery rate δ which represents the probability that an infested node heals in a single time step the infestation rate β β l β s consists of the large scale rate β l which specifies the probability that a pest spreads to a neighbouring patch and the small scale rate β s which indicates the probability that an infestation percolates through a patch by assuming that the spread at the landscape scale can only proceed once an outbreak occurred on the local scale we make the connection between small scale and large scale factors explicit and consider cross scale amplifying interactions peters et al 2004 seidl et al 2016a the network structure is uniquely defined by the adjacency matrix a and the parameters β l and β s are assumed homogeneous in space and equal to the expected value of the infestation rates the dynamics of the infestation across the network are represented by a system of difference equations with state vector p t p 1 t p n t containing for each node the infestation probability that changes over time according to a stochastic process we settle on a discrete time dynamic model to express the evolution of p t chakrabarti et al 2008 let ζ i t denote the probability that node i does not get infested at time t which can be written as 3 ζ i t j n i p j t 1 1 β l β s 1 p j t 1 j n i 1 a ij β l β s p j t 1 where a ij are the entries of the adjacency matrix and n i stands for the neighbourhood of node i i e the nodes j that are connected to node i the dynamics of the infestation probabilities over the network can be written as the vector function p i t f i p t 1 a β δ where f i p t 1 a β δ is defined as 4 f i p t 1 a β δ 1 1 p i t 1 ζ i t p i t 1 δ ζ i t 5 1 j 1 a ij β l β s p j t 1 1 δ 1 p i t 1 the second term in 4 represents the probability that a healthy node does not get infested and the third term designates the probability that an infested node heals in the considered time step the function f i is a non linear function of the infestation probabilities and reflects the role of large scale factors small scale factors and landscape topology through β l β s and a the parameters β and δ are estimated in the least squares sense using the observed trajectory of the number of infested nodes the value of the constant recovery rate is δ 0 65 and the time dependent value of β minimizing the modelling error is passed to the small scale stand module appendix b large scale landscape module with sir dynamics when trees or crops do not recover from infestations they can be in the susceptible infested and removed state under these conditions the dynamics are described by the so called sir model draief et al 2008 in the case of bark beetles trees get infested by beetles dispersing from infested neighbors and can transmit the infestation further once the next generation of beetles disperses on an individual level the traditional sir model with transitions from the susceptible to the infested state and from the infested to the removed state is suitable nonetheless by aggregating data over a habitat patch we observe that the transition from the infested state to the susceptible state is also possible this happens when the fraction of infested nodes is too low to pass the threshold for the node to become removed the sir model presented in this section is therefore a combination of the traditional sis and sir models once a network node is removed it cannot become infested or susceptible again in the adjusted sir model the dynamics of the infestation over the network are captured by the adjacency matrix a the infestation rates on the small scale and landscape scale β s and β l the recovery rate δ and the removal rate γ since nodes can be in three different states the dynamics can be described by two sets of difference equations and the probability of the third state can be obtained as the complement of the two other states similar as for the sis model we define the probability that node i does not get infested at time t as 6 ζ i t j n i p j s t 1 p j r t 1 p j i t 1 1 β l β s j 1 a ij β l β s p j i t 1 where p j s p j i and p j r represent the probabilities that node j is in the susceptible infested and removed state knowing that p j s p j i p j r 1 the dynamics of the state probabilities can be written as three vector functions p s t f s p s t 1 p i t 1 a β δ p i t f i p s t 1 p i t 1 a β δ γ and p r t f r p r t 1 p i t 1 a γ these vector functions can be expressed as 7 p s t p s t 1 ζ t p i t 1 δ 8 p i t p s t 1 1 ζ t 1 γ δ p i t 1 9 p r t p r t 1 γ p i t 1 where stands for elementwise multiplication since the node probabilities sum to one one of the difference equations can be omitted similar to the sis model framework we assume the parameters δ and γ to be constant and β to be time dependent capturing the time varying pest pressure the values of β δ and γ are estimated in the least squares sense using the observed trajectory of the state of each network node for the bark beetle case study presented here we find that the constant parameters take the values δ 0 2 and γ 0 05 while the time dependent value of β minimizing modelling errors is passed to the small scale stand module in both the sis and sir model a mean field approach is applied by assuming homogeneous parameter values over the network for β δ and where applicable γ for the sis model this assumption allows us to determine the critical threshold analytically however the mean field approach can be omitted and a numerical analysis for the spreading of infestation probabilities can also be performed for variable infestation and recovery rates although the results of the homogeneous model provide a good match with the available data an inhomogeneous model can include more spatial precision appendix c small scale stand module it is essential that the framework captures the succession of outbreak and decay phases fig 4a and c which requires time varying model parameters as temporal outbreak patterns are strongly related to pest population pressure seidl et al 2016b we consider a time varying small scale infestation rate this is motivated by the fact that the presence of more insects in one habitat patch will increase the probability of successful spreading to neighbouring patches we model β as an endogenous variable in the analytical framework and model the time varying β t β l β s t through host pest interactions by means of a predator prey model brauer and castillo chavez 2001 in our example the prey is represented by the foliage or cambium pool of the forest and the predator represents the pest population here we use defoliation χ and infestation rate β as proxies for the prey and predator respectively and model the predator prey dynamics of the network by means of the lotka volterra equations 10 χ t a χ b χ β β t c β d χ β the parameterset a b c d determines the growth and decay of both predator and prey populations for the estimation of the predator prey model parameters we have access to data relative to tree infestation while data with respect to the predator stock is not available we therefore generate the infestation rate that provides the best fit in the least square sense between available data and analytical framework the estimation of a b c d matches the parameters of 10 to the available data on infested trees and the estimated infestation rate determined in the large scale landscape module since the outcome of the parameter estimation is sensitive to noise the data is fitted to a three term fourier model before the estimation of the set a b c d in the geometrid moth case study we obtain the following parameter values 0 81 4 85 0 04 0 72 while in the bark beetle case study we obtain 0 8 6 0 7 6 the negative values of all parameters require more justification note that we use defoliation tree infestation χ as a proxy for the prey since χ represents the complement of host foliage bark we require χ to decrease exponentially in the absence of the predator and hence we find negative values for a since defoliation will increase with increasing populations of predator and prey we also find a negative value for b in the absence of prey the predator population will extinguish and therefore we find negative values for c finally predator abundance will decrease with higher defoliation resulting in negative values for the parameter d through the predator prey model we capture the host pest interaction where the variation of β provides a density dependent feedback to the epidemic model in this respect it is relevant to observe that the pest pressure is captured by means of an unstructured population which is a mean field approximation for the entire region the host pest interaction model produces a trajectory of β t β l β s t with β l considered time invariant this assumption is justified as the fluctuations in insect population are much faster than the dynamics of β l fig 4b and d note further that the population dynamics of the pest are strongly related to climate effects see appendix g table g 1 seidl et al 2016b the model for host pest interactions in 10 is simple and generic but more advanced interactions can be incorporated that consider both for the geometrid moth and the bark beetle case studies the choice of this simple model provides good agreement between data and model results this is due to the fact that foliage and bark production in a given year depends on the passage of a pest in the previous year notwithstanding the good performance of the stylized model the limitations of the lotka volterra equations need to be spelled out for the two considered case studies first the considered model does not consider intraspecific competition nor does it include heterogeneity over the landscape due to spatial variation also spatial density dependence that considers the increasing number of encounters with hosts that have already been infested is not included in the current formulation in fact in the current model the predator prey interactions result in cycles of the predator and prey population that are followed indefinitely in reality owing to persistent disturbances and changes of the ecosystem the predator and prey populations would not exhibit regular cycles but considerably more stochastic behavior on that account the predator prey model should be used with caution and the model is meaningful mostly for short term predictions appendix d percolation probability through a habitat patch at the small scale level we can derive from the available data the probability β s that an infestation percolates to the boundaries of a habitat patch the available fine scale grid data represents a forest stand as a regular lattice graph which encourages the use of percolation theory often applied in the context of disease spread and forest fires the edges in the lattice graph are marked with a transition probability q specifying the likelihood that an infested raster cell can contaminate the neighbouring cells within the patch we model the small scale infestation rate as β s kθ q where k encapsulates conditions related to host susceptibility such as tree vigor or tree size and age effects the factor θ q is the probability that a pest pervades through the habitat patch referred to as percolation probability grimmett 1999 since the percolation probability θ q is hard to obtain analytically as a function of the network size we resort to simulations considering an l l square lattice and approximate the percolation probability by a logistic function as θ q 1 1 exp k p q q c with q c the critical threshold the value of q the likelihood that adjacent grid cells get infested can be estimated from the available data and is subsequently used to compute θ q appendix e epidemic threshold in the multi scale network model based on the network dynamics formulated in eq 5 we observe that p t 0 is an equilibrium point of eq 5 and the asymptotic stability in the neighbourhood of this stationary point gives rise to the epidemic threshold chakrabarti et al 2008 in order to prove asymptotic stability in a discrete time system the eigenvalues of the jacobian evaluated at the stationary point need to have an absolute value smaller than one this leads to the necessary conditions of the epidemic threshold in eq 1 of the main document chakrabarti et al 2008 the sufficiency of the epidemic threshold can be proven based on the following bound 11 ζ i t j n i 1 β l β s p j t 1 1 β l β s j n i p j t 1 using this bound we can find a linear approximation of the set of non linear difference equations 5 which can be written in vector form as 12 p t β l β s a 1 δ i p t 1 the linearised system is asymptotically stable if the modules of all eigenvalues of the system matrix s β l β s a 1 δ i are smaller than one which leads to 13 β l β s δ 1 λ 1 a where λ 1 a represents the spectral radius of a i e the supremum of the absolute value of the eigenvalues of a appendix f epidemic threshold in a random landscape topology when the location of all habitat patches is known the patches can be described by a deterministic network for which the epidemic threshold is given by eq 1 of the main document it is however also relevant to make statistical statements about regions with comparable or rather disparate distance distributions between habitat patches in this case we resort to a stochastic characterization by means of a random geometric graph rgg in an rgg the nodes follow a spatial point process while links are drawn between the nodes that lie within the dispersal range of the pest the large scale network can be modelled as the graph g v e with v x i x i π f where πf represents a poisson point process ppp with density μ the edge set is given by e x i x j r x i x j r and r the dispersal capability the spectral radius of an rgg can be bound by λ 1 a lμr 2 with l a positive constant below the epidemic threshold in an rgg characterized by the density and the dispersal capability is therefore given by 14 β l β s δ 1 l μ r 2 1 λ 1 a this result illustrates the dependence of the epidemic threshold on the patch density and the dispersal capability and is important to determine which landscape topologies have high risk for the spread of pests bound on spectral radius of rgg the bound of the spectral radius can be found based on the sequence of spectral moments preciado and jadbabaie 2009 to avoid boundary effects in the network typically a d dimensional torus is chosen on which the network is laid out we are interested in poisson point processes over a square area and therefore the constant l has been determined based on simulations l 2 2247 fig f 7 the spectral radius is depicted as a function of the expected degree together with an upper bound of the form λ 1 a cμr 2 fig f 7 as the expected degree in an rgg is given by e d μ π r 2 the spectral radius is depicted as a function of e d for moderate values of the expected degree the upper bound is shown to be tight appendix g sensitivity analysis we present here the sensitivity of the model with respect to the small scale effects fig g 8 the baseline case uses the following parameters a bl 0 81 b bl 4 85 c bl 0 04 and d bl 0 72 we note that the all parameters of the predator prey model are negative this is due to using the available data on infested trees as a proxy for the prey whereas the fraction of infested trees represents in reality the complement of the prey overview of network parameters and their climate dependency 
24997,recent research suggests that the spread of pest outbreaks is driven by ecological processes acting at different spatial scales in this work we establish a network model for the analysis and management of pest outbreaks that takes into account small scale host pest interactions as well as landscape topology and connectivity the model explains outbreak cycles both for geometrid moths and bark beetles and provides insight into the relative importance and interactions between the multi scale drivers of outbreak dynamics our results demonstrate that outbreak behavior is most sensitive to changes in pest pressure at the local scale and that accounting for the spatial connectivity of habitat patches is crucial to capturing the spreading behavior through landscapes in contrast to early warning signals based on retrospective data our model provides predictions of future outbreak risk based on a mechanistic understanding of the system which we apply for landscape scale forest management keywords landscape management network of networks pest dynamics pest outbreaks 1 introduction pest outbreaks can strongly affect ecosystem health and hence have far reaching consequences for local economies that depend on specific ecosystem services ludwig et al 1978 lewis et al 2010 fahse and heurich 2011 nelson et al 2013 it has become clear in recent research that pest outbreaks are more complex than previously assumed specifically outbreaks are driven by factors on multiple scales i e host abundance at the stand level connectivity at the landscape level and climate related effects at the regional level senf et al 2017 seidl et al 2016b raffa et al 2008 peters et al 2004 with and crist 1995 these insights coincide with a global increase in disturbances by forest pests inter alia influenced by anthropogenic climate change seidl et al 2017 2014 kautz et al 2017 empirical evidence supports the relevance of these multiple factors but an integrated understanding of their respective roles their interactions and the resulting complex dynamics is still missing limiting our ability to predict pest outbreaks consequently there is a need for a better quantitative understanding of the causalities and cross scale interactions leading to large scale outbreaks raffa et al 2008 seidl et al 2016b senf et al 2017 typically the growth of pest populations is described at the stand level using population models or system dynamics ludwig et al 1978 clark et al 1979 fernández and fort 2009 lewis et al 2010 fahse and heurich 2011 this however does not reveal how local phenomena translate into large scale dynamics although there are models describing spatial dynamics zhou and liebhold 1995 logan et al 1998 a multi scale perspective on pest outbreaks has mainly been presented through a phenomenological peters et al 2004 raffa et al 2008 or an empirical lens bjørnstad et al 2002 seidl et al 2016b senf et al 2017 to date for successful pest management an integrated quantitative perspective on pest outbreaks is needed which describes the propagation of pests as a function of landscape topology and host pest interactions such a perspective translated into a formal mathematical model of multi scale outbreak dynamics can lead to improved outbreak prediction and the design of effective anticipatory actions to mitigate outbreak losses to achieve this perspective we harness the increased availability of high resolution spatial data on pest outbreaks and link ecological insights with multi scale network theory strogatz 2001 urban and keitt 2001 networks have first been introduced in ecological studies through the use of economic input output models to analyze structural properties of ecosystems and their impacts on synergism and stability hannon 1973 finn 1976 patten 1978 ulanowicz 1980 fath and patten 1999 in the field of epidemiology compartmental models initially looked at disease spread in a fully mixed population meaning that an infected individual is equally likely to spread the disease to any other member of the population kermack and mckendrick 1991 due to the wide occurrence of complex networks in nature network based approaches developed for modelling the spread of epidemics have later also been considered to study the spread of computer viruses pastor satorras and vespignani 2001 the spread of sexually transmitted diseases newman 2002 for approximation techniques keeling and eames 2005 and the development of strategies to counter virus spread in real networks chakrabarti et al 2008 until 2010 almost all network research focused on the properties of a single network but since most natural systems are composed of multiple subsystems interconnected networks have received increasing attention in order to improve the understanding of real complex networks gao et al 2012a 2014 in ecology networks of networks nons have been used to study the spread of invasive species through the combination of social and ecological networks haak et al 2017 and networks of species interactions have been studied in view of species decline and extinction pocock et al 2012 many interconnected networks also account for spatial constraints the main advantage of these so called embedded networks over other spatially explicit models is that spatially explicit phenomena can occur at different scales as an example in epidemiology multi scale mobility processes based on gravity models have been analyzed and the effects on disease spread of short range commuting versus long range airline traffic have been evaluated balcan et al 2009 here we present a general framework to determine the spread of a pest over a landscape accounting for large scale factors related to the landscape topology as well as small scale factors that result from varying pest pressure first we present the building blocks of the framework subsequently we illustrate the effectiveness of the approach in capturing the pest dynamics of two fundamentally different pest species finally we illustrate how the framework can be used to guide landscape scale pest management building on network concepts strogatz 2001 messier et al 2013 we demonstrate how anticipatory forest management catered to the landscape rather than the individual stand can optimize pest control seidl et al 2018 2 material and methods 2 1 a multi scale analysis of pest spreading we apply a multi scale network approach and develop a network of networks comprising a large scale and a small scale network the large scale network considers the landscape as a network of habitat patches while the small scale network examines individual habitat patches fig 1 a the nodes in the large scale network represent habitat patches whereas nodes in the small scale network represent grid cells within a patch temporal variability e g pest pressure is captured by the small scale network while spatial connectivity i e contagion dispersal is captured by the large scale network weather effects such as precipitation and temperature influence pest development and spread within a patch while the distance between habitat patches affects the possible spread of a pest between patches throughout the landscape the modular framework presented here consists of a landscape module which captures the pest propagation over the large scale network and a stand module which captures the percolation of the pest through a small scale habitat patch the framework is constructed according to the following three steps fig 1b on the landscape scale we first identify the potential habitat patches of the pest and determine the connectivity between habitat patches based on the dispersal capability of the species under consideration the outcome of this step is a network of habitat patches next we formulate how a pest spreads over the constructed network the study of disease propagation has evolved from unstructured populations to networked populations using a variety of epidemic models newman 2002 pastor satorras and vespignani 2002 depending on the specific pest under consideration we select the appropriate epidemic model to describe the network dynamics we can for instance differentiate between cases where the passage of the pest is followed by host recovery appendix a or host mortality appendix b we here propose a probabilistic model that evaluates over time the probability of each node in the large scale network to be in a given state i e susceptible s infested i or removed r although the epidemic model operates at the landscape scale the model reacts to changes occurring in the small scale networks in the last step we define the temporal variation in the pest pressure active at the local scale through a suitable model of the host pest interactions appendix c which represents the time varying probability that a pest percolates through a local habitat patch appendix d the number of model parameters required by our framework is small at the local scale β s indicates the probability that an infestation disperses through a patch while at the landscape scale β l specifies the probability that a pest spreads to a neighbouring node the recovery rate δ represents the probability that an infested node recovers in a single time step and γ is the probability that an infested node dies the connectivity of the large scale network is fully determined by adjacency matrix a and the spectral radius λ 1 a of the adjacency matrix which is the dominant eigenvalue of a indicating whether the presence of a pest species will lead to an outbreak or not the combination of the network structure the large scale spreading and the small scale variations in the pest pressure makes it possible to describe the evolution of the fraction of susceptible habitat patches infested habitat patches and dead habitat patches where applicable 2 2 geometrid moth outbreaks in birch forests in a first case study we consider the outbreak dynamics of geometrid moths epirrita autumnata and operophtera brumata in boreal birch forest of fennoscandia covering the northern parts of norway sweden and finland jepsen et al 2009b we construct the network by using a spatio temporal dataset over the years 2002 to 2010 the dataset originates from satellite imagery and consists of annual binary defoliation maps with a spatial resolution of 250 m 250 m defoliation scores were previously shown to be an appropriate proxy for larval densities measured on the ground jepsen et al 2009a using the forest mask of the area and based on geographical separation the area is divided into habitat patches that correspond to nodes in a large scale network fig 2 a subsequently network connectivity is determined by comparing the minimum distance between patches with the dispersal capability of the species i e the maximum distance that moths can cover to find new hosts or mates based on expert knowledge we use a baseline dispersal distance of 1500m merging the node and link data a landscape network is obtained fig 2b urban and keitt 2001 a network node in the large scale network is considered infested if the fraction of infested grid cells within a forest stand exceeds a specified threshold η fig 2d we observe that the appearance of outbreaks can consistently be detected under a wide range of threshold values fig 2d the value η 0 5 is selected as the minimum value that discerns three defoliation episodes originating from local outbreaks occurring in different habitat patches as can be observed from our example dataset we adopt the sis susceptible infested susceptible epidemic model chakrabarti et al 2008 and account for multiple scales by linking the small scale and large scale factors in the model the large scale epidemic model hinges upon the infestation rate β β l β s which represents the product of large scale and small scale infestation rates and the recovery rate δ the succession of outbreak and recovery phases indicate that β varies over time the variation in β is due to the small scale factor β s as will be shown later and is modeled by means of a predator prey model the infestation probabilities β s and β l are active at different time scales and we assume that β l is time independent a detailed mathematical description of the network dynamics both large scale and small scale is provided in appendices a and c the appendices also contain the parameter values used to validate the model 2 3 european spruce bark beetle outbreaks in a temporate forest in a second case study we consider the outbreak dynamics of the european spruce bark beetle ips typographus based on a time series of outbreak dynamics from 1990 to 2012 in the bavarian forest national park seidl et al 2016b the data set contains the binary infestation status over the considered period with a spatial resolution of 30 30m over a total area of 13 319 ha and covers two distinct epidemics over this period the network structure is derived from the definition of the habitat patches based on geographical separation fig 3 a and a maximum dispersal capacity of 253 m seidl et al 2016b the resulting network structure is shown in fig 3b the main phenomenological difference with respect to geometrid moths is that trees die after bark beetle infestation the state of habitat patches can therefore be categorized as susceptible s infested i and removed r in order to classify the habitat patches into these three states two thresholds η i and η r are introduced that compare the fraction of infested and removed cells within a habitat patch to their corresponding threshold a habitat patch is infested if the fraction of infested grid cells within the habitat patch is greater than η i and the habitat patch is removed if the fraction of removed grid cells within the patch is greater than η r the values of the thresholds are set to η i 0 07 and η r 0 6 determined by matching the shape of the infestation probability of cells in the entire data set to the infestation probability of nodes in the network to find η i and using an analogous approach to find η r at the landscape scale we adopt an adjusted sir model with possible transitions between the susceptible and infested states indicated by the infestation rate β between the infested and susceptible states represented by the recovery rate δ and between the infested and removed states described by the removal rate γ similar to the moth case study the bark beetle data set contains a succession of epidemic and recovery phases which indicates that the infestation rate is time dependent the evolution of β is modeled by means of a predator prey model a detailed mathematical description of the building blocks of the model can be found in appendix b and appendix c as well as the parameter values used to validate the model 2 4 early warning and risk monitoring building on this modular framework we define first an epidemic threshold that determines whether the ecosystem is in the epidemic or non epidemic regime see appendix e and f then we use the distance to the epidemic threshold as a risk measure for pest outbreaks so that the framework allows us to track outbreak risk over time the presented modelling framework enables us to discriminate between two regimes that are typical for pest outbreaks i e epidemic and non epidemic conditions additionally the model relates the dynamics of the system and its switching between these two regimes to small scale and large scale drivers by means of a parsimonious set of parameters this limited set of system parameters which can be directly estimated from spatial data and observations allows us to define the threshold for the transition between non epidemic and epidemic conditions whether or not analytically tractable solutions can be found depends on the formulation of the model if no analytical solution is possible regions of epidemic and non epidemic conditions can always be determined by simulating a particular instance of the model here we use the geometrid moth case study which has tractable solutions to demonstrate how the framework can be used to inform landscape scale pest management for the large scale model with sis dynamics it can be shown see appendix e that the ecosystem is in the non epidemic regime with decreasing infestation probability when the following condition is met 1 β l β s δ 1 λ 1 a which means that the ratio of infestation rate β to recovery rate δ is smaller than a certain value determined by the landscape topology defined by 1 λ a conversely the system is in the epidemic regime when β l β s δ 1 λ 1 a this result reveals that small scale and large scale factors interact in a multiplicative way in regime shifts from non epidemic to epidemic behavior small scale factors exhibit rapid changes over time as will be demonstrated later and pest outbreaks are very sensitive to these changes on the local scale such that small changes in pest pressure can have substantial effects on the landscape scale behavior eq 1 also reflects the relevance of the network structure through the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix probabilistic insights can be obtained for landscape topologies with similar spatial characteristics in terms of forest density we can determine a lower bound of the epidemic threshold for a landscape characterized by a forest density μ and a dispersal capability r which is given by see appendix f 2 β l β s δ 1 l μ r 2 1 λ 1 a with l a constant defined in the appendix f eq 2 provides general insight how the interaction between pest dispersal capability and forest density affects the epidemic threshold specifically the lower bound of the epidemic threshold is inversely proportional to the forest density and the square of the dispersal capability this result shows the sensitivity of outbreak dynamics with respect to the dispersal capability it is notably hard to predict critical transitions scheffer et al 2009 carpenter 2013 dai et al 2013 similar to early warning signals based on the statistical analysis of past system behavior scheffer et al 2009 the proposed analytical framework requires sufficient historical data in this case to estimate the model parameters however in contrast to statistical indicators of regime shifts our analytical framework provides parameter space trajectories that allow us to track the risk of pest outbreaks over time as a function of key ecological parameters the distance in parameter space to the critical threshold gives indications about the likelihood of an outbreak which enables an anticipatory approach in ecosystem management responding to risk rather than to incidence of events seidl 2014 the distance to the epidemic threshold provides a quantification of the risk of regime shifts between epidemic and non epidemic conditions based on the system parameters β l β s δ and λ 1 a 3 results 3 1 multi scale model provides outbreak dynamics consistent with data the modelling framework can simultaneously simulate population dynamics at the small scale and spreading behavior at the large scale in the case study of the geometrid moths a single population features decadal cycles but by aggregation of data over the considered area we observe three defoliation episodes with a periodicity of three years fig 4 a the three year periodicity originates from different outbreak episodes occurring in different habitat patches which is taking place due to network effects note that in the presented test case we capture the aggregate pest pressure originating from two moth species that feed on a common host while underlying processes and factors e g species differences that generate the aggregate pest pressure are implicit the effectiveness of the framework in capturing the moth outbreak dynamics is illustrated by analyzing the fraction of infested area over time fig 4a showing good agreement between model and data and a coefficient of determination of r 2 0 6 the modelling framework is able to reproduce the epidemic and non epidemic phases with accurate frequency and the magnitude of the outbreaks can be reproduced well for the first two outbreaks the smaller magnitude of the third peak cannot be reproduced by the analytical tool due to the deterministic evolution of β higher temporal resolutions of the available data and an adaptive algorithm to adjust the parameters of the predator prey model over time could resolve this issue in future work the predator prey dynamics are much faster than the temporal variation in large scale factors affecting spreading probability which leads to the assumption of time varying small scale factors captured by β s and time invariant large scale factors captured by β l we test this assumption by estimating the probability that an infestation percolates through the small scale habitat patch based on observations a detailed mathematical description can be found in appendix d and comparing this with the time varying pest pressure in the model comparing the percolation probability arising at the small scale with the modeled trajectory for β fig 4b we observe a good match indicating that the large scale pest dynamics emerge from variations in the small scale factors and justifying the assumption of time invariant large scale factors for the case study of the spruce bark beetle the model is also deployed to monitor the state of the network nodes over time focusing on the infested network nodes we find good agreement between the fraction of infested area derived by the model versus the observed data with a coefficient of determination of r 2 0 67 fig 4c we also verify that the dynamics of the infestation rate β stem from the local scale factors by estimating the percolation probability and comparing it with the evolution of β fig 4d as in the moth case study we find that the observations are consistent with time independent large scale factors and time dependent small scale factors 3 2 pest outbreaks are driven by pest pressure fluctuations at the local scale modulated by the landscape structure as a result of its modular structure the sensitivity of the model can be analysed separately for large scale and small scale factors fig 5 a and b we here use the geometrid moth case study to illustrate the sensitivity of the model to factors manifesting at different scales with regard to large scale factors we alter the network connectivity by assuming different dispersal capabilities fig 5a we observe that modest changes in network connectivity can lead to substantial changes in the magnitude of outbreaks with regard to small scale factors we evaluate how changes in the host pest interaction affect the number of infested nodes over time we observe that the variation of the trajectories of the infestation rate β see appendix g fig g 8 results in radically different outbreak behaviour both in terms of outbreak frequency and magnitude using modifications in the network connectivity and the host pest interactions the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that outbreak dynamics are responsive to small changes in both large scale and small scale parameters this supports the hypothesis that pest outbreak behaviour can only be captured correctly through an accurate understanding of the cross scale interactions of landscape topology and host pest dynamics 3 3 selective landscape management necessary for efficient outbreak prevention based on the epidemic threshold we can distinguish between epidemic and non epidemic regimes and moreover the distance to the epidemic threshold provides a quantification of the risk of regime shifts between epidemic and non epidemic conditions as an example the epidemic region depicted in the space defined by the large scale infestation rate β l and the transition probability q indicating the measurable probability that an infested cell contaminates neighbouring cells illustrates the high sensitivity of the system dynamics to small scale factors since small variations of the transition probability q can result in a regime shift fig 6 a in addition we observe how the size of the epidemic region decreases with increasing recovery rate δ it is also possible to reduce the outbreak risk in terms of the size of the epidemic region in the parameter space through the removal of infested cells or the introduction of dispersal barriers fig 6b in this case the decrease of the epidemic region results from a decrease of the spectral radius due to the changing network structure as a result of the management actions the decrease of the spectral radius corresponds to an increase of the epidemic threshold as can be deduced from eq 1 the trajectory of the ecosystem through the epidemic and non epidemic regions provides us with a quantification of how outbreak risk evolves over time fig 6a and b in fact the trajectory in parameter space provides early warning signals and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of potential management strategies for instance we observe that through targeted management of three forest stands the ecosystem trajectory remains completely in the non epidemic region of the parameter space in the geometrid moth example fig 6b importantly rather than being solely determined by historical pest observations our early warning signals encapsulate mechanistic knowledge of the ecosystem and the environmental drivers in addition to the observations since the epidemic threshold is inversely proportional to the spectral radius the optimal management strategy exploits the knowledge of the network structure by protecting the node in the network that has the largest effect on the spectral radius such a targeted management strategy results in a maximal increase of the non epidemic region in parameter space fig 6b in order to benchmark pest management strategies the mathematically optimal strategy can be contrasted with random actions fig 6c and the benefit of targeted management quantified in terms of the gain in healthy forest area the model determined optimal strategy consistently results in large gains of forest area not infested by the pest relative to the random protection strategy 4 discussion empirical evidence has shown that outbreak dynamics of pests are driven by multi scale processes senf et al 2017 seidl et al 2016b raffa et al 2008 through a phenomenological analysis multi scale drivers were identified raffa et al 2008 and the relative importance of different drivers was determined by means of statistical analysis senf et al 2017 this study provides a first analytical model for pest outbreaks that incorporates multi scale drivers and their interactions we have shown that the model is capable to reproduce the outbreak dynamics of forest insects that feature very different epidemic behavior the analytical modelling framework provides opportunities to include multi scale perspectives into management practices the modelling framework presented here has been designed for parsimony based on a basic model for predator prey dynamics and an epidemic model with parameters that are homogeneous over space nevertheless homogeneous interactions between network nodes are sufficient to yield good agreement between model results and the available data the flexibility of the framework allows us to incorporate different building blocks in order to adapt it to different types of epidemic behavior and or host pest interactions the building blocks of our model can easily be replaced by more advanced ones in the future for example including pest antagonists or introducing spatially variable infestation rates with respect to the structure of the network of networks the small scale lattice network is directly driven by the resolution of the available satellite imagery while the large scale network identification could be improved by designing a classification algorithm in order to make the framework applicable for actual forest management other aspects such as administrative boundaries and specific habitat characteristics could also be included although climate dependent and climate independent factors have been identified in our framework climate effects are currently only implicitly included in the model see appendix g table g 1 addressing the relationship between climate effects and outbreak occurrence more explicitly in future work could allow us to assess the robustness of pest management strategies under changing climate conditions further limitations of our current framework are that variable development trajectories of hosts and subsequently their susceptibility are not considered seidl et al 2016a the framework can represent dispersal of a species up to the landscape scale and in order to expand the model to the regional scale other effects should be included such as long range infestations cain et al 2000 mundt et al 2009 in spite of these limitations the case studies involving two strongly differing pest species defoliator bark beetle indicate that the presented framework is sufficiently flexible to capture the relevant phenomena governing pest outbreak waves in ecosystems the modelling framework is generally applicable to a wide range of systems due to its modular setup with practical relevance as a toolbox for early warning and landscape level disturbance management by integrating different sources of complex dynamics an effective model for pest outbreaks has been developed that quantifies the relevance and relation between small scale and large scale factors the sensitivity analysis underlines that both the host pest interactions at the local scale and the network structure at the landscape scale drive pest dynamics in forest ecosystems consequently the inclusion of spatially explicit landscape scale data as well as host pest interactions is crucial for an accurate quantification of outbreak dynamics yet remains neglected in many pest models e g dietze and matthes 2014 forest managers currently tackle biotic disturbances mostly at the patch level and largely neglect the relevance of landscape effects seidl et al 2016b however the speed at which pests spread through fragmented habitats is largely governed by the network connectivity margosian et al 2009 meentemeyer et al 2012 the danger of over connected systems fig 5a calls for a multi scale perspective in outbreak management and the proposed framework fosters such a perspective by consistently integrating drivers at different scales cornelius et al 2013 this is in line with previous research indicating an increased vulnerability of networks of networks compared to single networks gao et al 2012b several silvicultural practices such as sanitation felling and introducing dispersal barriers can efficiently be tested as virtual immunization strategies long 2009 with our framework in order to improve future pest management 5 conclusions from an applied science perspective the most important implication of this work is that our quantitative model of pest dynamics can be used in landscape scale forest management the modelling framework provides outbreak trajectories that allow an assessment of future areas at risk of disturbances exploiting the knowledge of landscape topology a targeted management strategy that optimally mitigates the spreading potential of a pest can be devised a priori whereas reducing habitat quantity has been discussed in the past senf et al 2017 our model identifies which habitat patches contribute most to the risk of pest spreading which in turn allows us to develop an optimal landscape scale management scheme our results show that the optimal management scheme yields gains of uninfested forest area up to 15 with respect to random habitat reduction in the example of geometrid moth outbreaks these capabilities are especially timely and important given the growing concern about changing disturbance regimes seidl et al 2017 authors contributions mw led the overall research project

landscape module with sis dynamics when the sis model is used to describe the large scale dynamics the network nodes can be in the susceptible or infested state the sis model we use here is defined by the infestation rate β which indicates the probability that an infested node infects a neighbouring node in one time step and a constant recovery rate δ which represents the probability that an infested node heals in a single time step the infestation rate β β l β s consists of the large scale rate β l which specifies the probability that a pest spreads to a neighbouring patch and the small scale rate β s which indicates the probability that an infestation percolates through a patch by assuming that the spread at the landscape scale can only proceed once an outbreak occurred on the local scale we make the connection between small scale and large scale factors explicit and consider cross scale amplifying interactions peters et al 2004 seidl et al 2016a the network structure is uniquely defined by the adjacency matrix a and the parameters β l and β s are assumed homogeneous in space and equal to the expected value of the infestation rates the dynamics of the infestation across the network are represented by a system of difference equations with state vector p t p 1 t p n t containing for each node the infestation probability that changes over time according to a stochastic process we settle on a discrete time dynamic model to express the evolution of p t chakrabarti et al 2008 let ζ i t denote the probability that node i does not get infested at time t which can be written as 3 ζ i t j n i p j t 1 1 β l β s 1 p j t 1 j n i 1 a ij β l β s p j t 1 where a ij are the entries of the adjacency matrix and n i stands for the neighbourhood of node i i e the nodes j that are connected to node i the dynamics of the infestation probabilities over the network can be written as the vector function p i t f i p t 1 a β δ where f i p t 1 a β δ is defined as 4 f i p t 1 a β δ 1 1 p i t 1 ζ i t p i t 1 δ ζ i t 5 1 j 1 a ij β l β s p j t 1 1 δ 1 p i t 1 the second term in 4 represents the probability that a healthy node does not get infested and the third term designates the probability that an infested node heals in the considered time step the function f i is a non linear function of the infestation probabilities and reflects the role of large scale factors small scale factors and landscape topology through β l β s and a the parameters β and δ are estimated in the least squares sense using the observed trajectory of the number of infested nodes the value of the constant recovery rate is δ 0 65 and the time dependent value of β minimizing the modelling error is passed to the small scale stand module appendix b large scale landscape module with sir dynamics when trees or crops do not recover from infestations they can be in the susceptible infested and removed state under these conditions the dynamics are described by the so called sir model draief et al 2008 in the case of bark beetles trees get infested by beetles dispersing from infested neighbors and can transmit the infestation further once the next generation of beetles disperses on an individual level the traditional sir model with transitions from the susceptible to the infested state and from the infested to the removed state is suitable nonetheless by aggregating data over a habitat patch we observe that the transition from the infested state to the susceptible state is also possible this happens when the fraction of infested nodes is too low to pass the threshold for the node to become removed the sir model presented in this section is therefore a combination of the traditional sis and sir models once a network node is removed it cannot become infested or susceptible again in the adjusted sir model the dynamics of the infestation over the network are captured by the adjacency matrix a the infestation rates on the small scale and landscape scale β s and β l the recovery rate δ and the removal rate γ since nodes can be in three different states the dynamics can be described by two sets of difference equations and the probability of the third state can be obtained as the complement of the two other states similar as for the sis model we define the probability that node i does not get infested at time t as 6 ζ i t j n i p j s t 1 p j r t 1 p j i t 1 1 β l β s j 1 a ij β l β s p j i t 1 where p j s p j i and p j r represent the probabilities that node j is in the susceptible infested and removed state knowing that p j s p j i p j r 1 the dynamics of the state probabilities can be written as three vector functions p s t f s p s t 1 p i t 1 a β δ p i t f i p s t 1 p i t 1 a β δ γ and p r t f r p r t 1 p i t 1 a γ these vector functions can be expressed as 7 p s t p s t 1 ζ t p i t 1 δ 8 p i t p s t 1 1 ζ t 1 γ δ p i t 1 9 p r t p r t 1 γ p i t 1 where stands for elementwise multiplication since the node probabilities sum to one one of the difference equations can be omitted similar to the sis model framework we assume the parameters δ and γ to be constant and β to be time dependent capturing the time varying pest pressure the values of β δ and γ are estimated in the least squares sense using the observed trajectory of the state of each network node for the bark beetle case study presented here we find that the constant parameters take the values δ 0 2 and γ 0 05 while the time dependent value of β minimizing modelling errors is passed to the small scale stand module in both the sis and sir model a mean field approach is applied by assuming homogeneous parameter values over the network for β δ and where applicable γ for the sis model this assumption allows us to determine the critical threshold analytically however the mean field approach can be omitted and a numerical analysis for the spreading of infestation probabilities can also be performed for variable infestation and recovery rates although the results of the homogeneous model provide a good match with the available data an inhomogeneous model can include more spatial precision appendix c small scale stand module it is essential that the framework captures the succession of outbreak and decay phases fig 4a and c which requires time varying model parameters as temporal outbreak patterns are strongly related to pest population pressure seidl et al 2016b we consider a time varying small scale infestation rate this is motivated by the fact that the presence of more insects in one habitat patch will increase the probability of successful spreading to neighbouring patches we model β as an endogenous variable in the analytical framework and model the time varying β t β l β s t through host pest interactions by means of a predator prey model brauer and castillo chavez 2001 in our example the prey is represented by the foliage or cambium pool of the forest and the predator represents the pest population here we use defoliation χ and infestation rate β as proxies for the prey and predator respectively and model the predator prey dynamics of the network by means of the lotka volterra equations 10 χ t a χ b χ β β t c β d χ β the parameterset a b c d determines the growth and decay of both predator and prey populations for the estimation of the predator prey model parameters we have access to data relative to tree infestation while data with respect to the predator stock is not available we therefore generate the infestation rate that provides the best fit in the least square sense between available data and analytical framework the estimation of a b c d matches the parameters of 10 to the available data on infested trees and the estimated infestation rate determined in the large scale landscape module since the outcome of the parameter estimation is sensitive to noise the data is fitted to a three term fourier model before the estimation of the set a b c d in the geometrid moth case study we obtain the following parameter values 0 81 4 85 0 04 0 72 while in the bark beetle case study we obtain 0 8 6 0 7 6 the negative values of all parameters require more justification note that we use defoliation tree infestation χ as a proxy for the prey since χ represents the complement of host foliage bark we require χ to decrease exponentially in the absence of the predator and hence we find negative values for a since defoliation will increase with increasing populations of predator and prey we also find a negative value for b in the absence of prey the predator population will extinguish and therefore we find negative values for c finally predator abundance will decrease with higher defoliation resulting in negative values for the parameter d through the predator prey model we capture the host pest interaction where the variation of β provides a density dependent feedback to the epidemic model in this respect it is relevant to observe that the pest pressure is captured by means of an unstructured population which is a mean field approximation for the entire region the host pest interaction model produces a trajectory of β t β l β s t with β l considered time invariant this assumption is justified as the fluctuations in insect population are much faster than the dynamics of β l fig 4b and d note further that the population dynamics of the pest are strongly related to climate effects see appendix g table g 1 seidl et al 2016b the model for host pest interactions in 10 is simple and generic but more advanced interactions can be incorporated that consider both for the geometrid moth and the bark beetle case studies the choice of this simple model provides good agreement between data and model results this is due to the fact that foliage and bark production in a given year depends on the passage of a pest in the previous year notwithstanding the good performance of the stylized model the limitations of the lotka volterra equations need to be spelled out for the two considered case studies first the considered model does not consider intraspecific competition nor does it include heterogeneity over the landscape due to spatial variation also spatial density dependence that considers the increasing number of encounters with hosts that have already been infested is not included in the current formulation in fact in the current model the predator prey interactions result in cycles of the predator and prey population that are followed indefinitely in reality owing to persistent disturbances and changes of the ecosystem the predator and prey populations would not exhibit regular cycles but considerably more stochastic behavior on that account the predator prey model should be used with caution and the model is meaningful mostly for short term predictions appendix d percolation probability through a habitat patch at the small scale level we can derive from the available data the probability β s that an infestation percolates to the boundaries of a habitat patch the available fine scale grid data represents a forest stand as a regular lattice graph which encourages the use of percolation theory often applied in the context of disease spread and forest fires the edges in the lattice graph are marked with a transition probability q specifying the likelihood that an infested raster cell can contaminate the neighbouring cells within the patch we model the small scale infestation rate as β s kθ q where k encapsulates conditions related to host susceptibility such as tree vigor or tree size and age effects the factor θ q is the probability that a pest pervades through the habitat patch referred to as percolation probability grimmett 1999 since the percolation probability θ q is hard to obtain analytically as a function of the network size we resort to simulations considering an l l square lattice and approximate the percolation probability by a logistic function as θ q 1 1 exp k p q q c with q c the critical threshold the value of q the likelihood that adjacent grid cells get infested can be estimated from the available data and is subsequently used to compute θ q appendix e epidemic threshold in the multi scale network model based on the network dynamics formulated in eq 5 we observe that p t 0 is an equilibrium point of eq 5 and the asymptotic stability in the neighbourhood of this stationary point gives rise to the epidemic threshold chakrabarti et al 2008 in order to prove asymptotic stability in a discrete time system the eigenvalues of the jacobian evaluated at the stationary point need to have an absolute value smaller than one this leads to the necessary conditions of the epidemic threshold in eq 1 of the main document chakrabarti et al 2008 the sufficiency of the epidemic threshold can be proven based on the following bound 11 ζ i t j n i 1 β l β s p j t 1 1 β l β s j n i p j t 1 using this bound we can find a linear approximation of the set of non linear difference equations 5 which can be written in vector form as 12 p t β l β s a 1 δ i p t 1 the linearised system is asymptotically stable if the modules of all eigenvalues of the system matrix s β l β s a 1 δ i are smaller than one which leads to 13 β l β s δ 1 λ 1 a where λ 1 a represents the spectral radius of a i e the supremum of the absolute value of the eigenvalues of a appendix f epidemic threshold in a random landscape topology when the location of all habitat patches is known the patches can be described by a deterministic network for which the epidemic threshold is given by eq 1 of the main document it is however also relevant to make statistical statements about regions with comparable or rather disparate distance distributions between habitat patches in this case we resort to a stochastic characterization by means of a random geometric graph rgg in an rgg the nodes follow a spatial point process while links are drawn between the nodes that lie within the dispersal range of the pest the large scale network can be modelled as the graph g v e with v x i x i π f where πf represents a poisson point process ppp with density μ the edge set is given by e x i x j r x i x j r and r the dispersal capability the spectral radius of an rgg can be bound by λ 1 a lμr 2 with l a positive constant below the epidemic threshold in an rgg characterized by the density and the dispersal capability is therefore given by 14 β l β s δ 1 l μ r 2 1 λ 1 a this result illustrates the dependence of the epidemic threshold on the patch density and the dispersal capability and is important to determine which landscape topologies have high risk for the spread of pests bound on spectral radius of rgg the bound of the spectral radius can be found based on the sequence of spectral moments preciado and jadbabaie 2009 to avoid boundary effects in the network typically a d dimensional torus is chosen on which the network is laid out we are interested in poisson point processes over a square area and therefore the constant l has been determined based on simulations l 2 2247 fig f 7 the spectral radius is depicted as a function of the expected degree together with an upper bound of the form λ 1 a cμr 2 fig f 7 as the expected degree in an rgg is given by e d μ π r 2 the spectral radius is depicted as a function of e d for moderate values of the expected degree the upper bound is shown to be tight appendix g sensitivity analysis we present here the sensitivity of the model with respect to the small scale effects fig g 8 the baseline case uses the following parameters a bl 0 81 b bl 4 85 c bl 0 04 and d bl 0 72 we note that the all parameters of the predator prey model are negative this is due to using the available data on infested trees as a proxy for the prey whereas the fraction of infested trees represents in reality the complement of the prey overview of network parameters and their climate dependency

et al 2019 stocks and fluxes also vary locally as a function of stand structure soil type and drainage successional trajectories topography past fire severity and climate deluca and boisvenue 2012 lemprière et al 2013 van bellen et al 2010 by the end of the century 2071 2100 annual mean temperatures in the canadian boreal region are expected to increase by 3 3 to 5 4 c relative to the period 1961 1990 gauthier et al 2014 price et al 2013 this is expected to change boreal fire regimes ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change 2007 leading to shorter fire return intervals more intense and severe fires and longer fire seasons boulanger et al 2013 2014 flannigan et al 2009 climate change may also affect boreal carbon balance through a number of biophysical mechanisms some of which can be attributable to increased temperature and changes in water availability both of which could lead to changes in tree growth and decomposition rates girardin et al 2015 price et al 2013 as well as alterations to the fire regime characteristics including the fire return interval fri fire intensity and severity bergeron et al 2004 bhatti et al 2001 boulanger et al 2013 2014 these changes would have direct impacts on ecosystem structure and function bergeron et al 2010 kashian et al 2006 kasischke et al 1995 leading to changes in the magnitude and distribution of boreal c stocks kasischke et al 1994 kurz et al 2013 for example warmer temperatures linked with climate change are likely to increase black spruce growth rates in some regions of the boreal forest of north america where precipitation increases could compensate for increasing evaporative stress induced by warmer temperatures d orangeville et al 2016 gauthier et al 2014 price et al 2013 in contrast girardin et al 2015 and dhital et al 2015 indicate that water limitations and heat stress expected under global warming may reduce boreal black spruce tree growth organic c decomposition rates are also expected to be affected by climate change davidson and janssens 2006 microbial decomposition of soil organic matter som is sensitive to temperature therefore global warming could lead to a net increase of c release to the atmosphere davidson and janssens 2006 deluca and boisvenue 2012 forecasting climate change impacts on c stocks and fluxes in boreal forests requires accounting for the interactions between changing fire regimes forest composition tree growth and mortality and c sequestration and decomposition rates this calls for coupled models of stand dynamics fire and c stocks and fluxes all sensitive to climate or annual weather conditions as rupp et al 2002 remarked the uncertainty of future disturbance rates in the boreal forest and their effects of energy partitioning and carbon exchange chapin et al 2000 demands ecological models that accurately portray transient ecosystem dynamics indeed for applications such as national carbon accounting transient responses are of particular interest our study area is in the managed boreal forests of québec canada and our long term modelling objectives are to apply the integrated model developed here to link forest management actions to ecological indicators beyond carbon e g wildlife habitat these requirements impose constraints on spatial resolution representation of vegetation structure and the specifics of the carbon model that few existing models satisfy in particular the carbon budget model of the canadian forest sector cbm cfs3 kurz et al 2009 has been developed for canadian boreal forests and we would consider it appropriate for management applications in canada the vegetation dynamics model alfresco rupp et al 2002 has recently been integrated into a more complex suite of ecological models that simulate carbon stocks pastick et al 2017 the alfresco vegetation model represents transitions between a small number of vegetation classes at a current resolution of 1 km2 and so lacks the structural detail and spatial resolution needed for forest management applications or to model relations between size class structure and fire behavior miquelajauregui et al 2016 the dynamic global vegetation model mc1 bachelet et al 2005 lenihan et al 2008 has been used for similar purposes as in pastick et al 2017 and similarly uses a small set of vegetation classes their table 1 and much lower spatial resolution 0 5 latitude by 0 5 longitude pastick et al 2017 or bachelet et al 2005 are parameterized for alaska not the eastern boreal forests of québec and neither use a carbon model closely related to cbm cfs3 to our knowledge the simulation study most closely meeting our needs is that of boiffin 2004 who used a version of the landis ii forest succession model scheller et al 2007 coupled with the model century succession extension scheller et al 2011 to model carbon dynamics which is structurally similar to cbm cfs3 the model resolution of 4 ha would be sufficient for our intended applications but the vegetation growth dynamics model would be less so it is parameterized in terms of tree species traits taken from aubin et al 2012 or past model parameterizations neither the model parameters nor outputs are related to forest mensuration data for this study we adapted the model of miquelajauregui et al 2019 this is a diameter class structured population model of stand growth and mortality caswell 2001 coupled with a model of boreal soil c dynamics based on cbm cfs3 which links standing biomass to dom carbon pools via mortality living biomass turnover and temperature dependent decay rates these components were integrated with a patch level model of fire mortality miquelajauregui et al 2016 that simulates vertical fuels distribution the transition of surface to crown fires and conifer overstory tree mortality from sampled patch level fire intensities the stand model is initialized from forestry sample plot data and the empirical growth and mortality models are based on analysis of repeated measurements of such plot data miquelajauregui et al 2019 estimated changes to equilibrium c stocks and fluxes of boreal black spruce forests in québec under predicted end of century fire regimes to this model we added climate sensitivity to the growth process in this study we estimate the transient responses of black spruce forest carbon stocks and fluxes under projected 21st century climate change using existing climate forecasts and spatial temporal forecasts of the fire regime parameters boulanger et al 2013 historical and simulated air temperature and precipitation derived from the weather simulator biosim régnière et al 2014 were used to drive historical and future forest growth decomposition rates and c dynamics we hypothesized that shorter fire return intervals combined with increased temperatures will reduce black spruce forests c stocks due to reduced tree growth and biomass accumulation rates increased organic matter combustion and fire related overstory tree mortality and increased organic c decomposition rates we simulated short term c dynamics under four climatic periods 1980 2010 historical henceforth 2010 2040 20140 2070 and

to just above zero in the south environment canada 2015 the dominant disturbance type is crown fires which are usually large and severe johnson 1992 other natural disturbances that occur in the canadian boreal forest include outbreaks of defoliating insects permafrost melting and windstorms gauthier et al 2014 we do not account for these processes here the black spruce feathermoss bioclimatic domain lies on the canadian shield a vast area of mostly precambrian rocks covered by glacial tills of various thicknesses rowe 1972 soils are mostly humo ferric podzols soil

and fire intensity data tree diameter distributions used to initialize simulated forest patches come from the inventory plot data obtained by the québec ministère des forêts de la faune et des parcs mffp 2008 mono specific plots were defined as those were a single species contributed more than 75 of the total basal area mffp 2008 a total of 2495 mono specific black spruce forest inventory plots with characteristic mesic glacial till soils were selected for the simulation experiment fig 1 an historical forest fire database 1994 2010 was provided by the société de protection des forêts contre le feu sopfeu 2012 the province of québec s forest fire management agency fire attributes include the date of detection fire location and the fuel type at detection a final mapped size and the canadian forest fire weather index system forestry canada fire danger group 1992 drought code dc and head fire intensity hfi for the first day of burning a total of 1111 fires for the black spruce fuel type c 2 hirsch 1996 within the study region were selected 2 2 2 historical and future weather data the stem growth model eq 2 requires inputs of weather data we used downscaled climate data generated for each inventory plot location using biosim v10 3 2 23 régnière et al 2014 covering the four consecutive 30 year climatic periods from 1980 to 2100 the first period 1980 2010 is considered the historical period biosim simulates daily weather data by matching georeferenced sources of historical and simulated future climate normals to a set of locations and adjusting for differences in latitude longitude and elevation boulanger et al 2013 simulated daily data were averaged to annual values for each inventory location and used in eq 2 to estimate annual growth indices biosim monthly historical climate normal data came from 74 meteorological stations in eastern canada fig 1 future weather records were derived from the canadian global circulation model 4 0 canadian earth system

that does not include any specific climate mitigation target in our study area this scenario projects a 5 2 c increase in mean annual temperature mat fig a1 in the appendix and 24 increase in mean may to august cumulative precipitation by 2100 relative to the historical period table 1 2 2 3 historical and future boreal fire return interval boulanger et al 2013 developed maps of historical and future fire regime attributes for eastern canada under the ipcc sres a2 or business as usual scenario we used these maps to delineate zones of homogeneous fri for each of four climatic periods we intersected these maps to define regions with unique fri temporal pathways in terms of changes in fri over the four periods table 2 we then assigned a pathway to each inventory plot based on its spatial location thirty two unique fri pathways were identified but only five were selected for the simulation experiment we chose these five fri pathways based on their spatial contiguity their representativeness within the study area e g number of inventory plots within each pathway and their capacity to capture the historical and projected spatio temporal variability in fire return intervals within the black spruce feather moss domain boulanger et al 2013 the fri pathways were also expected to capture systematic factors such as climate that potentially affect fri for example fri pathways 1 and 2 influenced by a maritime climate have historical fri s longer than 916 years whereas pathways 3 4 and 5 with a continental climate have fri s shorter than 783 years table 2 by 2070 the five fri pathways became shorter compared to their historical reference however decreases in fri were more pronounced for pathways 2 and 3 and moderate for pathways 1 and 5 table 2 by 2100 pathways 1 3 and 4 had fris shorter than 400 years and pathways 2 and 4 shorter than 170 years table 2 in effect the fri pathways represent spatial temporal forecasts of changes in fire regime conditional on projections of future climate 2 3 model design the simulation model has three interacting modules patch dynamics fire and carbon dynamics fig 2 the modules were written in r version 2 15 0 r development core team 2012 the model operates at the scale of 1 0 ha and an annual time step all mathematical equations used in the model can be found in table a1 in the appendix the code can be accessed through github https github com yosunemiquela climatechange 2 3 1 patch dynamics module the patch dynamics module is a diameter class structured demographic model with an annual time step there are fifteen diameter at breast height dbh classes of 2 0 cm width from 1 to 3 to 29 31 cm the model maintains a count of the number of stems in each size class patches are initialised from inventory sample plots the state of the patch at time step t 1 is calculated by multiplying the number of live trees in each diameter class at time t by a matrix of time varying transition probabilities that incorporate class specific growth mortality and recruitment rates miquelajauregui et al 2019 fig 2 2 3 1 1 black spruce climate growth modelling annual transition probabilities from one size class to the next are estimated from the expected size class duration assuming a geometric waiting time caswell 2001 expected durations are estimated by dividing stage widths 2 0 cm by mean annual diameter increments cm yr 1 the number of trees in each dbh class that advance to the next class is sampled from a binomial distribution given the predicted annual transition probability and the number of trees in the class annual diameter increments are estimated using a modification of the individual tree basal area growth rate model of ne twigs teck and hilt 1991 ne twigs has been used to predict forest stand development bankowski et al 1996 weiskittel et al 2016 it predicts stem growth as a function of stem dbh a site index parameter and a competition modifier teck and hilt 1991 dhital et al 2015 modified the ne twigs basal area growth equation in order to incorporate climate change into growth and yield projections to do so the growth equation s site index parameter originally a constant was replaced by a growth index gi that varies annually as a function of climatic conditions dhital et al 2015 lapointe garant et al 2010 1 b a g r t g i t b 1 1 exp 1 b 2 d b h t exp b 3 b a l t where bagr is the predicted basal area growth rate at time t gi is the annual growth index dbh is the diameter at breast height bal the total basal area in larger diameter classes is the competition modifier the values of b1 b2 and b3 were fixed to 0 0008 0 0549 and 0 012 respectively as estimated in teck and hilt 1991 we convert from basal area to diameter growth rates using eq 4 of teck and hilt 1991 we modeled gi using dhital et al 2015 2 g i t β 0 β 1 t m a x f e b β 2 t m a x f e b 2 β 3 t m i n a u g β 4 t m i n j u n a u g β 5 t m i n j u n a u g 2 β 6 p s e p t 1 β 7 p

black spruce specific parameters dhital et al 2015 their table 1 2 3 1 2 background mortality and understory recruitment rates background mortality was modeled using artémis a distance independent individual tree mortality model fortin and langevin 2010 in artémis annual mortality probabilities are calculated as a function of dbh and the total basal area in larger diameter classes fortin and langevin 2010 mortality was not directly influenced by climate but indirectly in that tree sizes reflect growth rates for small diameter trees the annual mortality probability was fixed at 0 02 matthias et al 2003 the number of trees dying in each dbh class was sampled from a binomial distribution given the predicted class mortality probability and the number of trees in the class recruitment rates into mature stands were modeled as in miquelajauregui et al 2019 2 3 2 fire module the fire module simulates the occurrence of fires their behaviour and their direct effects on canopy tree mortality surface fuel combustion and post fire regeneration fires are initiated annually with probability p 1 fri when a fire occurs the patch level hfi and dc are sampled from the historical forest fire database and used as inputs to model vertical fire spread and fire severity the fire module simulates the development of high intensity crown fires from low intensity surface fires using approximations of the physical conditions limiting the initiation and spread of a crown fire miquelajauregui et al 2016 empirical relations between hfi scorch height bark thickness and the percent of crown scorched are used to calculate fire caused mortality miquelajauregui et al 2016 combustion of live biomass and dom c is also simulated in the fire module as in miquelajauregui et al 2019 with proportions of fluxes to the atmosphere given in table 3 post fire regeneration rates follow greene and johnson s 1999 which was modelled as a function of black spruce pre fire basal area and the optimal seedbed availability after a fire among other variables table a1 all equations are stated in table a1 in the appendix for details and supporting material please refer to miquelajauregui et al 2016 and miquelajauregui et al 2019 2 3 3 carbon dynamics module the c dynamics module implements components of the carbon budget model of the canadian forest sector cbm cfs3 kurz et al 2009 a carbon accounting model used by the government of canada for international reporting purposes boisvenue et al 2012 deluca and boisvenue 2012 kurz et al 2009 cbm cfs3 accurately estimates forest c stocks for canada s forest regions hagemann et al 2010 kurz et al 2009 2 3 3 1 carbon pools biomass turnover and decay dynamics we tracked carbon content mg c ha 1 in five live biomass pools and nine dead organic matter dom pools kurz et al 2009 table 3 aboveground and belowground live biomass components were calculated by diameter class using dbh allometric equations chen et al 2004 lambert et al 2005 ouimet et al 2008 multiplied by the number of trees in each class summed over classes and converted to mass of c at a rate of 0 5 hagemann et al 2010 tree component specific litterfall and turnover rates representative of the canadian boreal shield were taken from kurz et al 2009 to calculate annual biomass c transfers from each living pool to one or more dom pools hilger et al 2012 kurz and apps 1999 kurz et al 2009 biomass components of annual tree mortality are distributed amongst the dom pools with rates described in miquelajauregui et al 2019 decomposition of dom c pools was modelled using temperature dependent decay rates that determine the annual proportion of c that is released to the atmosphere or transferred to other dom pools kurz et al 2009 table 4 the decay rate atki for dom pool k in year t at location i is 3 a t k i b d r k t e m p m o d t k i s t a n d m o d where bdr k is the base decay rate for carbon pool k tempmod tkti is the temperature modifier for pool k in year t at location i and standmod is a stand modifier we used the cbm cfs3 default value for standmod of one the temperature modifier tempmod increases the decay rate for mat s above a reference mean annual temperature as 4 t e m p m o d t k i e m a t t i r e f t e m p ln q 10 k 0 1 where mat ti is the mean annual temperature in year t at location i reftemp is the reference temperature of 10 c and q10 k is the coefficient of temperature sensitivity of the decomposition rate for pool k relative to a 10 c increase in temperature davidson and janssens 2006 for boreal dom c pools q10 takes values between 1 0 to 2 65 kurz et al 2009 their table 4 a q10 of 1 0 as for the bg slow carbon pool indicates thermal independence davidson and janssens 2006 the base cbm cfs3 uses a fixed mat for the boreal shield of 0 36 c kull et al 2011 to account for the effects of climate change on soil decomposition rates we used annual values of mat sampled from the historical and projected temperature distributions for each location 2 3 3 2 carbon stocks and fluxes total ecosystem carbon stocks were estimated annually ate the patch level as the sum of live biomass and dom c pools mg c ha 1 total live biomass c stocks were calculated as the sum of the five live carbon pools total dom c stocks were calculated as the sum of the nine dom c pools including mineral soil c we also calculated organic layer mineral soil and woody debris c stocks as in miquelajauregui et al 2019 ecosystem c fluxes of net primary productivity npp heterotrophic respiration rh net ecosystem production nep and net biome production nbp were estimated annually at the patch level mg c ha 1 yr 1 we calculated npp from biomass difference between consecutive years plus replacement of above and belowground biomass turnover kurz et al 2013 stinson et al 2011 rh was calculated as the sum of decomposition losses to the atmosphere from all dom pools net ecosystem production nep npp rh is the annual net loss or gain of carbon from an ecosystem chen et al 2002 an ecosystem is considered a carbon sink when nep is greater than 0 and a carbon source otherwise ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change 2007 boisvenue et al 2012 kurz et al 2013 net biome production nbp is calculated as nep minus lc the episodic emissions of c to the atmosphere due to fire boisvenue et al 2016 kurz et al 2013 2 4 model validation we carefully verified the implementation of all mathematical formulae in each model component for model validation we compared simulated and empirical annual rates of change in the live tree component of aboveground biomass mg c ha 1 year 1 we used an independent sample of inventory plots having two repeated measurements at a 10 year interval mffp 2008 we selected 122 mono specific black spruce plots on characteristic mesic till soils located within the black spruce feathermoss bioclimatic domain these plots were not used in model calibration or evaluation for each plot we distributed the initial and final measured diameters of all trees 9 1 cm dbh to vectors of stem counts by 2 cm dbh classes scaled to 1 ha as used in the stand dynamics model initial and final aboveground live tree c biomass was calculated for each plot using the methodology explained in section 2 3 1 1 to estimate empirical rates of change we substracted the initial from the final values and divided by ten simulated estimates were obtained by applying the stand dynamics model under average historical climate conditions we ran the stand dynamics model for twenty years without recruitment and fire calculated initial and final aboveground live tree biomass densities and divided the difference by 20 the stochastic diameter growth model inherently underestimated short term changes in size class structure even if predicted and actual diameter growth rates are the same as a result 10 year simulations starting from initial conditions would underestimate biomass growth relative to the empirical estimates based on the 10 year remeasurements we used a 20 year simulation period to partially compensate for this effect 2 5 simulation experiment and analysis we performed a simulation experiment to estimate transient responses of carbon stocks and fluxes in boreal black spruce forests to the regional climate warming scenario introduced above climate warming acts through spatially variable changes in fri in tree growth rates and soil carbon decomposition rates in order to account for zonal variation in dom c stocks and fluxes within the black spruce domain miquelajauregui et al 2019 we first generated mean initial dom c conditions under historical weather table 1 period a and fri table 2 period a for each of the five fri pathways fig 1 we used a spin up procedure in which 1000 random patches were sampled from the plot data for each of the five fri pathways table 2 these fri pathways were expected to capture the spatial and temporal variation in historical and projected fire regimes over the study region patch dynamics and disturbances were simulated under the historical fri and historical weather data for the plot locations the model was run for 4800 years as in miquelajauregui et al 2019 a duration sufficient to reach approximate equilibrium hagemann et al 2010 dom c stocks were then averaged over all runs for each fri pathway table a2 in the appendix to evaluate short term changes in boreal ecosystem c storage in response to variation in fri due to climate change we ran 1000 replicates for each fri pathway table 2 for a total of 5000 observations each simulation was run for 120 years covering the four consecutive 30 year climatic periods tables 1 2 for each replicate one inventory plot for the given fri pathway was selected at random patch attributes and live c pools were then initialized from the selected plot as in miquelajauregui et al 2019 dead organic matter c pools were initialized from the estimated zonal means table a2 in the appendix given the plot location a sequence of downscaled annual weather variables table 1 was sampled from the simulated weather data generated by biosim these annual weather variables covering the four 30 year climatic periods were used in eqs 1 2 and 4 to calculate annual growth and decomposition rates for each year a fire was initiated with probability p 1 fri where fri was determined by the plot s pathway and simulation year table 2 fri was constant within each 30 year period regional indicators for each fri pathway and 30 year climatic period were then calculated as means over the 1000 replicate simulation runs of 120 years we calculated the mean rate of change in c stocks mg c ha 1 yr 1 over each 30 year climatic period as f i 30 where i and f are the periods initial and final values respectively we also calculated the mean percent change in c stocks over each period as 100 f i i to identify where in the study region the greatest changes in black spruce forest carbon stocks may be expected we mapped the mean change in ecosystem c for each climatic period in order to determine the relative effects of historical and projected fri s on boreal c stocks we also present results of a similar simulation experiment where only fri changed over time suppressing the effects of climate change on tree growth and dom decomposition rates 3 results initial dom c stocks conditions for each fri pathway are reported in table a2 in the appendix additional results on the effect of changes in fri over time suppressing the effects of climate change on tree growth and dom decomposition rates are shown in fig a2 the mean simulated and empirical rates of aboveground live tree c biomass change were 0 23 and 0 29 mg c ha 1 yr 1 respectively fig a4 over the sample of 122 remeasured plots our model underestimated the empirical rates by 21 overall we conclude that our model adequately represents the average biomass dynamics in mono specific black spruce stands 3

and d fig a1 relative to the historical period a the mean increases from periods a to b b to c and c to d are 1 7 c 2 0 c and 2 7 c respectively modelled decomposition rates for most dom c pools will increase accordingly fig a3 the only exception is the most stable soil c pool bg slow for which decay rates are reportedly temperature independent kurz et al 2009 their table 4 given our downscaled annual weather variables table 1 black spruce growth indices within our study region will remain relatively constant over periods a and b but will decline markedly in period c and again in period d fig 3 the simulated mean historical growth index over all fri pathways was 13 8 m gi eq 2 but declined to an average of 9 4 m in 2071 2100 fig 3 3 2 short term responses of boreal c stocks to climate

climate fig 4 a f overall dom pools increased during period a relative to initial conditions but then decreased during the subsequent periods fig 4b live biomass pools tended to increase over period a except for fri pathway 1 but then declined during the three subsequent periods fig 4c net primary productivity was lowest 2 1 mg c ha 1 year 1 for pathway 1 under the 2071 2100 climatic period and greatest 3 4 mg c ha 1 year 1 for pathway 5 under the historical climate fig 5 a heterotrophic respiration was highest for pathway 5 under the historical climate and lowest for pathway 1 and 4 under the period 2071 2100 3 4 and 2 8 mg c ha 1 year 1 respectively fig 5b under historical climate simulations yielded positive mean nep values of 0 02 0 01 and 0 01 mg c ha 1 year 1 for pathways 2 3 and 5 whereas negative values were obtained for pathways 1 and 4 0 12 and 0 09 mg c ha 1 year 1 respectively fig 5c for all fri pathways nep and nbp transitioned to negative values by the end of period b and continued to decrease over periods c and d fig 5c d total ecosystem c stocks increased in average up to 6 by 2010 with subsequent average reductions of 5 7 and 10 by 2040 2070 and 2100 respectively table a3 in the appendix dom pools declined steadily for all fri pathways fig 3b dom c decreased in average 2 by 2040 for an overall dom c loss of nearly 9 over period d fig 4b table a3 total live biomass c stocks decreased nearly 16 by the end of 2100 fig 4c table a3 organic and woody debris c stocks had similar average trends for these pools the mean c losses were up to 14 and 21 by the end of 2100 respectively fig 4d e table a3 mineral soil c stocks increased up to 1 and 0 8 during period a and b respectively and decreased 1 by the end of 2100 fig 4f table a3 we found considerable temporal and geographic variation in total ecosystem c mean periodic percent changes mg c ha 1 among fri pathways but with no evident longitudinal and latitudinal pattern fig 6 mean annual rate of change mg c ha 1 year 1 in total ecosystem c increased in magnitude and became more negative for periods b c and d relative to period a fig 7 mean annual gain rates were 0 17 to 0 45 mg c ha 1 year 1 in period a whereas mean annual loss rates were 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mg c ha 1 year 1 in periods b c and d respectively fig 7 4 discussion and conclusions 4 1 short term responses of boreal forest c stocks and fluxes to climate change in the boreal forest soil carbon storage depends on the long term balance between vegetative c inputs from litterfall and root turnover and c outputs derived from organic matter decomposition laganière et al 2013 climate change could influence boreal c stocks by altering the ecological processes driving these fluxes price et al 2013 van bellen et al 2010 specific mechanisms proposed for boreal black spruce forest include changes in the capacity of trees to grow and sequester atmospheric carbon girardin et al 2015 changes in dead organic matter decomposition rates deluca and boisvenue 2012 and changes in fire regime boulanger et al 2013 2014 evaluating the net effects of climate change on regional dynamics requires the use of ecological models such as the one we present in this manuscript that include the main driving processes and their climate sensitivities in this paper we present an integrated model of black spruce patch dynamics forest carbon dynamics and fire regime the patch dynamics model is a diameter class structured matrix population model the carbon model tracks the amount of c in several live and dead organic matter dom pools carbon dynamics is simulated by a matrix of transfer rates among pools and from dom pools to the atmosphere live biomass pools and inputs from the living to dead c pools are derived from the patch structure diameter growth and mortality the fire module simulates the direct effects of fire on tree mortality combustion of biomass and dom and post fire regeneration climate change will likely affect c storage in boreal black spruce forests through changes in the capacity of trees to grow and sequester atmospheric carbon girardin et al 2015 the rate of dom decomposition deluca and boisvenue 2012 and through modifications to the fire regime boulanger et al 2013 this study indicates that the short term effect of climate change on black spruce forest growth will be substantially negative fig 3 we predicted a reduction black spruce growth index declined in average 32 by 2071 2100 these findings are consistent with other empirical studies and model projections beck et al 2011 dhital et al 2015 girardin et al 2015 which concluded that increases in surface air temperature and changes in the precipitation regime could hinder the capacity of boreal black spruce to grow and assimilate atmospheric carbon d orangeville et al 2016 likewise the increase in air temperature projected under future climate may lead to relative changes in decomposition rates which could alter boreal c balance davidson and janssens 2006 xu et al 2014 for example several lab and field experiments provide evidence of the distinct temperature sensitivities among soil c pools in boreal forest soils davidson and janssens 2006 van cleve et al 1990 our simulations suggest that decay rates of the most labile soil c pools e g ag very fast and ag slow fig a3 in the appendix are temperature sensitive whereas decomposition rates of the more stable and recalcitrant soil c e g bg slow fig a3 in the appendix are not finally the expected changes in the boreal fire regime across north america over the forthcoming decades are a result of the more fire conducive weather linked with climate change bergeron et al 2010 boulanger et al 2014 de groot et al 2003 in particular shorter fire return intervals are projected for some parts of the boreal forest of north america boisvenue et al 2012 boulanger et al 2013 oris et al 2014 such a shortening in fri will affect boreal vegetation dynamics forest structure and the boreal carbon balance boulanger et al 2013 kurz et al 2008 means of all aggregate simulated c pools and all c fluxes varied among climatic periods and fri pathways the effect of period is clearly temporal attributable to increases in mean annual temperature over the 120 year timeframe and to changes in other weather variables also affecting stem growth not reported although the relative short term changes in boreal c stocks and fluxes vary with fri pathways the main trend is temporal figs 4 6 table a3 the effect of fri pathway indicates a spatial component of variation this is attributable at least in part to spatial variation in the sequence of periodic fri values however spatial variation in factors such as spin up dom c conditions e g table a2 or temporal trends in annual weather variables may also contribute the present study can not distinguish these effects our simulations suggest a declining trend over time for boreal ecosystem c storage this decline started very early before 2040 climatic period b and continued over periods c and d fig 4a the expected ecosystem c storage reductions are the result of the decreases in black spruce growth combined with the c losses from increasing fire disturbance and increasing decomposition rates as projected air temperature increased other modelling results from canadian boreal forests also suggest that reductions in total boreal forest carbon stocks are likely to be associated with warmer future climate and higher burn rates chaste et al 2019 miquelajauregui et al 2019 in our simulation experiments changed climatic conditions i e elevated temperature and warming induced fire activity were associated to reductions in most of the modelled c pools except for mineral soil c stock fig 4 our results suggest that nearly 40 and 14 of the c stored in the total live biomass and dom pools respectively could be lost by the end of the 21st century table a3 fig 4b c lower plant derived c inputs to the soil due to reduced plant productivity fig 3 deluca and boisvenue 2012 girardin et al 2015 enhanced temperature sensitive decomposition rates of belowground soil c pools fig a3 and higher overstory tree mortality and organic matter combustion associated to higher fire activity linked with climate change boulanger et al 2013 chaste et al 2019 explain the observed temporal patterns in c stocks losses along climatic periods the weak response of the mineral soil c stock to elevated temperature and increased fri observed in this study reflect with empirical evidence from forest soils that indicate lower temperature sensitivity for decomposition of the most stable c pools davidson and janssens 2006 van cleve et al 1990 our simulated short term responses in c stocks might differ were other factors controlling decomposition rates had been included in our modelling framework for example the climate driven hydrologic balance among drainage precipitation and evapotranspiration as well as other environmental constraints such as dom chemical and physical protection have shown to influence dom decomposition conant et al 2011 davidson and janssens 2006 deluca and boisvenue 2012 schmidt et al 2011 complementary simulation results without accounting for the temperature and precipitation effects on growth and decomposition suggest that fri will be the main driver of ecosystem c change during the first half of the 21st century figs 4 a2 however the relative effect of decreasing fri differs among c pools for example simulated dom c stocks showed a weaker response to fri than did total ecosystem and live biomass c stocks fig a2 this might be because we used historical values of hfi and dc to derive fire vertical propagation fire derived tree mortality and organic matter combustion both net primary productivity and heterotrophic respiration decline from one period to the next resulting in overall reductions in nep net ecosystem production and net biome production also decline but positive mean values were found for the historical period that is based on nep our simulation results suggest a marked and widespread change from c sink to c source which has already started and will persist at least until 2100 studies in boreal black spruce forests suggest negative impacts of high temperatures and increased warming induced fire activity on npp with projected reductions up to 11 by the end of the 21st century ma et al 2011 girardin et al 2015 chaste et al 2019 reductions in plant derived c inputs to the soil associated with lower npp could explain the observed decrease in rh fig 5a the weak temporal response of heterotrophic respiration could be also associated to the slow decomposition rates of the mineral soil c stock figs 5b a3 the expected mean annual loss rates in ecosystem carbon could exacerbate nep reductions as losses of dom increase field and modelling studies boiffin 2004 price et al 1999 have also shown that increased temperature could increase dom decomposition rates for an overall decrease in boreal ecosystem c storage by as much as 13 19 over the next 200 500 years our findings suggest such losses will be nearly exceeded by the end of the 21st century the capacity of québec s boreal black spruce forest to sequester and store organic c may be degraded even over the next few decades due to climate change 4 2 boreal forest carbon management under global warming in canada federal provincial and local governments have established targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ghg canada s target for 2020 is 17 below the 2005 level lemprière et al 2013 mitigation strategies to control boreal c storage could possibly contribute to meeting these targets several forest management activities can be implemented to increase boreal c storage lemprière et al 2013 extending rotations reduction of regeneration delays planting seeding fertilization and control of competing vegetation and herbivory can accelerate the transition from c source to sink lemprière et al 2013 managing boreal forests for c sequestration will require to explicitly account for soil carbon when developing forest management plans and offseting schemes boisvenue et al 2012 deluca and boisvenue 2012 increasing c storage in harvested wood products hwps by increasing the use of long lived hwps reducing emissions by substituting wood for fossil intensive poducts and using biomass as bioenergy area potential strategies by which the canadian boreal forest can aid ghg mitigation lemprière et al 2013 our modelling approach has the potential of quantifying and mapping the location and timing of changes in boreal black spruce c stocks the results of this study could help delineating effective mitigation portafolios and develop alternative mitigation strategies lemprière et al 2013 4 3 model limitations and future research our model estimated the combined effect of climate on stand growth soil decomposition rates and fire return interval we did not attempt to quantify the relative importance of the individual factors the variation among fri pathways alone table 2 fig a2 is enough to show that relative importance must vary both in time and space this could be studied with the existing model by means of more comprehensive experiments several aspects of the fire module could be further developed climate warming may affect other aspects of the fire regime besides fri for example the future distribution of fire intensities may change because we sampled from historical distributions we are likely underestimating the effects of changing fire regimes on ecosystem c storage our fire model implies that the rate of burning varies little among years conditional on fri however there is important interannual variation in boreal fire activity which has been related to shifts among oceanic atmospheric circulation regimes boulanger et al 2013 girardin et al 2009 tian et al 1998 the present study was based on a single climate change scenario a more comprehensive study using climate ensembles would allow the present model to account for some components of forecasting error our study was restricted to boreal black spruce forests more comprehensive models of ecosystem c dynamics could be developed by integrating more vegetation types e g hardwood forests and other conifer species and by accounting for spatial variation in site characteristics such as moisture and nutrient regimes finally there are many processes that were not included in this study such as warming induced changes in the distribution of conifer tree species soil microbial diversity and activity as well as processes involving biochar production and effects of different natural disturbance types such as insects pathogens and anthropogenic influences such as management regimes boulanger et al 2013 girardin et al 2009 schmidt et al 2011 the carbon dynamics model presented here emulates the cbm cfs3 kurz et al 2009 soil models as the cbm cfs3 are generally structured around pools of organic compounds with decomposition rates modified by empirical relations to soil temperature schmidt et al 2011 although these models have proven extremely useful for understanding general patterns of soil carbon accumulation extrapolation of decomposition rates into a future warmer world based on observations of current temperature sensitivities is inadequate davidson and janssens 2006 moreover these models have not yet incorporated the main mechanistic representations of the processes that govern som stability conant et al 2011 schmidt et al 2011 for example nutrient availability may alter microbial community composition and activity which in turn will alter the rate of som degradation schmidt et al 2011 soil water availability for instance controls decomposition of som through direct effects on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon pools reichstein et al 2005 neither of these environmental drivers controlling som decomposition are currently accounted for in the cbm cfs3 therefore they should be explicitly incorporated if we want to accurately inform predictions and

24998,boreal forest ecosystems play a significant role in the global c cycle over the current century these forests are expected to undergo one of the largest increases in temperatures climate change is expected to affect boreal c storage through changes in fire regimes tree growth and decomposition rates we developed a diameter size structured model coupled with a boreal soil c dynamics model and a fire effects model to investigate the short term responses of boreal carbon storage to climate change we applied this model to 1 0 ha patches of monospecific black spruce stands under four climatic periods 1980 2010 2010 2040 2040 2070 and 2070 2100 forest inventory and historical fire intensity records representative of our study area were used to calibrate the model historical and future fire return interval fri maps and projected weather data estimated by canesm2 rcp8 5 climate scenario were used to drive historical and future disturbance frequency forest growth decomposition rates and c dynamics black spruce trees showed amplified decreases in growth and temperature sensitive decomposition rates of soil c pools were enhanced as projected air temperature increased this study indicates that the short term effects of climate change on black spruce forests productivity and c storage are substantially negative in our simulation experiments ecosystem c storage was reduced by 10 by the end of 2100 we predicted a marked and widespread change from c sink to c source which has already started and will persist at least until 2100 the results of this study indicate that black spruce forest of northern québec could be losing their capacity to sequester and store organic c over the next coming decades due to climate change keywords boreal forest fire return interval climate change carbon stocks forest inventory fire intensity fire severity cmb cfs3 1 introduction the boreal forest biome stores approximately 272 pg of carbon 1 pg 1 billion tonnes in above and belowground biomass and as dead organic matter dom it is responsible for 20 of the total carbon c sequestrated annually by forest ecosystems pan et al 2011 and therefore could greatly influence the global c balance deluca and boisvenue 2012 lemprière et al 2013 price et al 2013 in canada black spruce picea mariana mill b s p forests are the largest boreal forest component by area bergeron et al 2010 fire alters c storage in these forests by killing much of the live conifer biomass brassard and chen 2006 kashian et al 2006 consuming pre fire organic layers which in turn affect seedbed availability and post fire regeneration boiffin and munson 2013 mean carbon stocks and fluxes are therefore sensitive to fire regime parameters such as the mean interval between fires boulanger et al 2013 miquelajauregui et al 2019 stocks and fluxes also vary locally as a function of stand structure soil type and drainage successional trajectories topography past fire severity and climate deluca and boisvenue 2012 lemprière et al 2013 van bellen et al 2010 by the end of the century 2071 2100 annual mean temperatures in the canadian boreal region are expected to increase by 3 3 to 5 4 c relative to the period 1961 1990 gauthier et al 2014 price et al 2013 this is expected to change boreal fire regimes ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change 2007 leading to shorter fire return intervals more intense and severe fires and longer fire seasons boulanger et al 2013 2014 flannigan et al 2009 climate change may also affect boreal carbon balance through a number of biophysical mechanisms some of which can be attributable to increased temperature and changes in water availability both of which could lead to changes in tree growth and decomposition rates girardin et al 2015 price et al 2013 as well as alterations to the fire regime characteristics including the fire return interval fri fire intensity and severity bergeron et al 2004 bhatti et al 2001 boulanger et al 2013 2014 these changes would have direct impacts on ecosystem structure and function bergeron et al 2010 kashian et al 2006 kasischke et al 1995 leading to changes in the magnitude and distribution of boreal c stocks kasischke et al 1994 kurz et al 2013 for example warmer temperatures linked with climate change are likely to increase black spruce growth rates in some regions of the boreal forest of north america where precipitation increases could compensate for increasing evaporative stress induced by warmer temperatures d orangeville et al 2016 gauthier et al 2014 price et al 2013 in contrast girardin et al 2015 and dhital et al 2015 indicate that water limitations and heat stress expected under global warming may reduce boreal black spruce tree growth organic c decomposition rates are also expected to be affected by climate change davidson and janssens 2006 microbial decomposition of soil organic matter som is sensitive to temperature therefore global warming could lead to a net increase of c release to the atmosphere davidson and janssens 2006 deluca and boisvenue 2012 forecasting climate change impacts on c stocks and fluxes in boreal forests requires accounting for the interactions between changing fire regimes forest composition tree growth and mortality and c sequestration and decomposition rates this calls for coupled models of stand dynamics fire and c stocks and fluxes all sensitive to climate or annual weather conditions as rupp et al 2002 remarked the uncertainty of future disturbance rates in the boreal forest and their effects of energy partitioning and carbon exchange chapin et al 2000 demands ecological models that accurately portray transient ecosystem dynamics indeed for applications such as national carbon accounting transient responses are of particular interest our study area is in the managed boreal forests of québec canada and our long term modelling objectives are to apply the integrated model developed here to link forest management actions to ecological indicators beyond carbon e g wildlife habitat these requirements impose constraints on spatial resolution representation of vegetation structure and the specifics of the carbon model that few existing models satisfy in particular the carbon budget model of the canadian forest sector cbm cfs3 kurz et al 2009 has been developed for canadian boreal forests and we would consider it appropriate for management applications in canada the vegetation dynamics model alfresco rupp et al 2002 has recently been integrated into a more complex suite of ecological models that simulate carbon stocks pastick et al 2017 the alfresco vegetation model represents transitions between a small number of vegetation classes at a current resolution of 1 km2 and so lacks the structural detail and spatial resolution needed for forest management applications or to model relations between size class structure and fire behavior miquelajauregui et al 2016 the dynamic global vegetation model mc1 bachelet et al 2005 lenihan et al 2008 has been used for similar purposes as in pastick et al 2017 and similarly uses a small set of vegetation classes their table 1 and much lower spatial resolution 0 5 latitude by 0 5 longitude pastick et al 2017 or bachelet et al 2005 are parameterized for alaska not the eastern boreal forests of québec and neither use a carbon model closely related to cbm cfs3 to our knowledge the simulation study most closely meeting our needs is that of boiffin 2004 who used a version of the landis ii forest succession model scheller et al 2007 coupled with the model century succession extension scheller et al 2011 to model carbon dynamics which is structurally similar to cbm cfs3 the model resolution of 4 ha would be sufficient for our intended applications but the vegetation growth dynamics model would be less so it is parameterized in terms of tree species traits taken from aubin et al 2012 or past model parameterizations neither the model parameters nor outputs are related to forest mensuration data for this study we adapted the model of miquelajauregui et al 2019 this is a diameter class structured population model of stand growth and mortality caswell 2001 coupled with a model of boreal soil c dynamics based on cbm cfs3 which links standing biomass to dom carbon pools via mortality living biomass turnover and temperature dependent decay rates these components were integrated with a patch level model of fire mortality miquelajauregui et al 2016 that simulates vertical fuels distribution the transition of surface to crown fires and conifer overstory tree mortality from sampled patch level fire intensities the stand model is initialized from forestry sample plot data and the empirical growth and mortality models are based on analysis of repeated measurements of such plot data miquelajauregui et al 2019 estimated changes to equilibrium c stocks and fluxes of boreal black spruce forests in québec under predicted end of century fire regimes to this model we added climate sensitivity to the growth process in this study we estimate the transient responses of black spruce forest carbon stocks and fluxes under projected 21st century climate change using existing climate forecasts and spatial temporal forecasts of the fire regime parameters boulanger et al 2013 historical and simulated air temperature and precipitation derived from the weather simulator biosim régnière et al 2014 were used to drive historical and future forest growth decomposition rates and c dynamics we hypothesized that shorter fire return intervals combined with increased temperatures will reduce black spruce forests c stocks due to reduced tree growth and biomass accumulation rates increased organic matter combustion and fire related overstory tree mortality and increased organic c decomposition rates we simulated short term c dynamics under four climatic periods 1980 2010 historical henceforth 2010 2040 20140 2070 and

to just above zero in the south environment canada 2015 the dominant disturbance type is crown fires which are usually large and severe johnson 1992 other natural disturbances that occur in the canadian boreal forest include outbreaks of defoliating insects permafrost melting and windstorms gauthier et al 2014 we do not account for these processes here the black spruce feathermoss bioclimatic domain lies on the canadian shield a vast area of mostly precambrian rocks covered by glacial tills of various thicknesses rowe 1972 soils are mostly humo ferric podzols soil classification working group 1998 characterized by a relatively thin surface organic layer and deep mineral soils deluca and boisvenue 2012 laganière et al 2013 2 2 data 2 2 1 forest inventory plot and fire intensity data tree diameter distributions used to initialize simulated forest patches come from the inventory plot data obtained by the québec ministère des forêts de la faune et des parcs mffp 2008 mono specific plots were defined as those were a single species contributed more than 75 of the total basal area mffp 2008 a total of 2495 mono specific black spruce forest inventory plots with characteristic mesic glacial till soils were selected for the simulation experiment fig 1 an historical forest fire database 1994 2010 was provided by the société de protection des forêts contre le feu sopfeu 2012 the province of québec s forest fire management agency fire attributes include the date of detection fire location and the fuel type at detection a final mapped size and the canadian forest fire weather index system forestry canada fire danger group 1992 drought code dc and head fire intensity hfi for the first day of burning a total of 1111 fires for the black spruce fuel type c 2 hirsch 1996 within the study region were selected 2 2 2 historical and future weather data the stem growth model eq 2 requires inputs of weather data we used downscaled climate data generated for each inventory plot location using biosim v10 3 2 23 régnière et al 2014 covering the four consecutive 30 year climatic periods from 1980 to 2100 the first period 1980 2010 is considered the historical period biosim simulates daily weather data by matching georeferenced sources of historical and simulated future climate normals to a set of locations and adjusting for differences in latitude longitude and elevation boulanger et al 2013 simulated daily data were averaged to annual values for each inventory location and used in eq 2 to estimate annual growth indices biosim monthly

future fire regime attributes for eastern canada under the ipcc sres a2 or business as usual scenario we used these maps to delineate zones of homogeneous fri for each of four climatic periods we intersected these maps to define regions with unique fri temporal pathways in terms of changes in fri over the four periods table 2 we then assigned a pathway to each inventory plot based on its spatial location thirty two unique fri pathways were identified but only five were selected for the simulation experiment we chose these five fri pathways based on their spatial contiguity their representativeness within the study area e g number of inventory plots within each pathway and their capacity to capture the historical and projected spatio temporal variability in fire return intervals within the black spruce feather moss domain boulanger et al 2013 the fri pathways were also expected to capture systematic factors such as climate that potentially affect fri for example fri pathways 1 and 2 influenced by a maritime climate have historical fri s longer than 916 years whereas pathways 3 4 and 5 with a continental climate have fri s shorter than 783 years table 2 by 2070 the five fri pathways became shorter compared to their historical reference however decreases in fri were more pronounced for pathways 2 and 3 and moderate for pathways 1 and 5 table 2 by 2100 pathways 1 3 and 4 had fris shorter than 400 years and pathways 2 and 4 shorter than 170 years table 2 in effect the fri pathways represent spatial temporal forecasts of changes in fire regime conditional on projections of future climate 2 3 model design the simulation model has three interacting modules patch dynamics fire and carbon dynamics fig 2 the modules were written in r version 2 15 0 r development core team 2012 the model operates at the scale of 1 0 ha and an annual time step all mathematical equations used in the model can be found in table a1 in the appendix the code can be accessed through github https github com yosunemiquela climatechange 2 3 1 patch dynamics module the patch dynamics module is a diameter class structured demographic model with an annual time step there are fifteen diameter at breast height dbh classes of 2 0 cm width from 1 to 3 to 29 31 cm the model maintains a count of the number of stems in each size class patches are initialised from inventory sample plots the state of the patch at time step t 1 is calculated by multiplying the number of live trees in each diameter class at time t by a matrix of time varying transition probabilities that incorporate class specific growth mortality and recruitment rates miquelajauregui et al 2019 fig 2 2 3 1 1 black spruce climate growth modelling annual transition probabilities from one size class to the next are estimated from the expected size class duration assuming a geometric waiting time caswell 2001 expected durations are estimated by dividing stage widths 2 0 cm by mean annual diameter increments cm yr 1 the number of trees in each dbh class that advance to the next class is sampled from a binomial distribution given the predicted annual transition probability and the number of trees in the class annual diameter increments are estimated using a modification of the individual tree basal area growth rate model of ne twigs teck and hilt 1991 ne twigs has been used to predict forest stand development bankowski et al 1996 weiskittel et al 2016 it predicts stem growth as a function of stem dbh a site index parameter and a competition modifier teck and hilt 1991 dhital et al 2015 modified the ne twigs basal area growth equation in order to incorporate climate change into growth and yield projections to do so the growth equation s site index parameter originally a constant was replaced by a growth index gi that varies annually as a function of climatic conditions dhital et al 2015 lapointe garant et al 2010 1 b a g r t g i t b 1 1 exp 1 b 2 d b h t exp b 3 b a l t where bagr is the predicted basal area growth rate at time t gi is the annual growth index dbh is the diameter at breast height bal the total basal area in larger diameter classes is the competition modifier the values of b1 b2 and b3 were fixed to 0 0008 0 0549 and 0 012 respectively as estimated in teck and hilt 1991 we convert from basal area to diameter growth rates using eq 4

individual tree mortality model fortin and langevin 2010 in artémis annual mortality probabilities are calculated as a function of dbh and the total basal area in larger diameter classes fortin and langevin 2010 mortality was not directly influenced by climate but indirectly in that tree sizes reflect growth rates for small diameter trees the annual mortality probability was fixed at 0 02 matthias et al 2003 the number of trees dying in each dbh class was sampled from a binomial distribution given the predicted class mortality probability and the number of trees in the class recruitment rates into mature stands were modeled as in miquelajauregui et al 2019 2 3 2 fire module the fire module simulates the occurrence of fires their behaviour and their direct effects on canopy tree mortality surface fuel combustion and post fire regeneration fires are initiated annually with probability p 1 fri when a fire occurs the patch level hfi and dc are sampled from the historical forest fire database and used as inputs to model vertical fire spread and fire severity the fire module simulates the development of high intensity crown fires from low intensity surface fires using approximations of the physical conditions limiting the initiation and spread of a crown fire miquelajauregui et al 2016 empirical relations between hfi scorch height bark thickness and the percent of crown scorched are used to calculate fire caused mortality miquelajauregui et al 2016 combustion of live biomass and dom c is also simulated in the fire module as in miquelajauregui et al 2019 with proportions of fluxes to the atmosphere given in table 3 post fire regeneration rates follow greene and johnson s 1999 which was modelled as a function of black spruce pre fire basal area

estimates forest c stocks for canada s forest regions hagemann et al 2010 kurz et al 2009 2 3 3 1 carbon pools biomass turnover and decay dynamics we tracked carbon content mg c ha 1 in five live biomass pools and nine dead organic matter dom pools kurz et al 2009 table 3 aboveground and belowground live biomass components were calculated by diameter class using dbh allometric equations chen

specific litterfall and turnover rates representative of the canadian boreal shield were taken from kurz et al 2009 to calculate annual biomass c transfers from each living pool to one or more dom pools hilger et al 2012 kurz and apps 1999 kurz et al 2009 biomass components of annual tree mortality are distributed amongst the dom pools with rates described in miquelajauregui et al 2019 decomposition of dom c pools was modelled using temperature dependent decay rates that determine the annual proportion of c that is released to the atmosphere or transferred to other dom pools kurz et al 2009 table 4 the decay rate atki for dom pool k in year t at location i is 3 a t k i b d r k t e m p m o d t k i s t a n d m o d where bdr k is the base decay rate for carbon pool k tempmod tkti is the temperature modifier for pool k in year t at location i and standmod is a stand modifier we used the cbm cfs3 default value for standmod of one the temperature modifier tempmod increases the decay rate for mat s above a reference mean annual temperature as 4 t e m p m o d t k i e m a t t i r e f t e m p ln q 10 k 0 1 where mat ti is the mean annual temperature in year t at location i reftemp is

cfs3 uses a fixed mat for the boreal shield of 0 36 c kull et al 2011 to account for the effects of climate change on soil decomposition rates we used annual values of mat sampled from the historical and projected temperature distributions for each location 2 3 3 2 carbon stocks and fluxes total ecosystem carbon stocks were estimated annually ate the patch level as the sum of live biomass and dom c pools mg c ha 1 total live biomass c stocks were calculated as the sum of the five live carbon pools total dom c stocks were calculated as the sum of the nine dom c pools including mineral soil c we also calculated organic layer mineral soil and woody debris c stocks as in miquelajauregui et al 2019 ecosystem c fluxes of net primary productivity npp heterotrophic respiration rh net ecosystem production nep and net biome production nbp were estimated annually at the patch level mg c ha 1 yr 1 we calculated npp from biomass difference between consecutive years plus replacement of above and

al 2013 2 4 model validation we carefully verified the implementation of all mathematical formulae in each model component for model validation we compared simulated and empirical annual rates of change in the live tree component of aboveground biomass mg c ha 1 year 1 we used an independent sample of inventory plots having two repeated measurements at a 10 year interval mffp 2008 we selected 122 mono specific black spruce plots on characteristic mesic till soils located within the black spruce feathermoss bioclimatic domain these plots were not used in model calibration or evaluation for each plot we distributed the initial and final measured diameters of all trees 9 1 cm dbh to vectors of stem counts by 2 cm dbh classes scaled to 1 ha as used in the stand dynamics model initial and final aboveground live tree c biomass was calculated for each plot using the methodology explained in section 2 3 1 1 to estimate empirical rates of change we substracted the initial from the final values and divided by ten simulated estimates were obtained by applying the stand dynamics model under average historical climate conditions we ran the stand dynamics model for twenty years without recruitment and fire calculated initial and final aboveground live tree biomass densities and divided the difference by 20 the stochastic diameter growth model inherently underestimated short term changes in size class structure even if predicted and actual diameter growth rates are the same as a result 10 year simulations starting from initial conditions would underestimate biomass growth relative to the empirical estimates based on the 10 year remeasurements we used a 20 year simulation period to partially compensate for this effect 2 5 simulation experiment and analysis we performed a simulation experiment to estimate transient responses of carbon stocks and fluxes in boreal black spruce forests to the regional climate warming scenario introduced above climate warming acts through spatially variable changes in fri in tree growth rates and soil carbon decomposition rates in order to account for zonal variation in dom c stocks and fluxes within the black spruce domain miquelajauregui et al 2019 we first generated mean initial dom c conditions under historical weather table 1 period a and fri table 2 period a for each of the five fri pathways fig 1 we used a spin up procedure in which 1000 random patches were sampled from the plot data for each of the five fri pathways table 2 these fri pathways were expected to capture the spatial and temporal variation in historical and projected fire regimes over the study region patch dynamics and disturbances were simulated under the historical fri and historical weather data for the plot locations the model was run for 4800 years as in miquelajauregui et al 2019 a duration sufficient to reach approximate equilibrium hagemann et al 2010 dom c stocks were then averaged over all runs for each fri pathway table a2 in the appendix to evaluate short term changes in boreal ecosystem c storage in response to variation in fri due to climate change we ran 1000 replicates for each fri pathway table 2 for a total of 5000 observations each simulation was run for 120 years covering the four consecutive 30 year climatic periods tables 1 2 for each replicate one inventory plot for the given fri pathway was selected at random patch attributes and live c pools were then initialized from the selected plot as in miquelajauregui et al 2019 dead organic matter c pools were initialized from the estimated zonal means table a2 in the appendix given the plot location a sequence of downscaled annual weather variables table 1 was sampled from the simulated weather data generated by biosim these annual weather variables covering the four 30 year climatic periods were used in eqs 1 2 and 4 to calculate annual growth and decomposition rates for each year a fire was initiated with probability p 1 fri where fri was determined by the plot s pathway and simulation year table 2 fri was constant within each 30 year period regional indicators for each fri pathway and 30 year climatic period were then calculated as means over the 1000 replicate simulation runs of 120 years we calculated the mean rate of change in c stocks mg c ha 1 yr 1 over each 30 year climatic period as f i 30 where i and f are the periods initial and final values respectively we also calculated the mean percent change in c stocks over each period as 100 f i i to identify where in the study region the greatest changes in black spruce forest carbon stocks may be expected we mapped the mean change in ecosystem c for each climatic period in order to determine the relative effects of historical and projected fri s on boreal c stocks we also present results of a similar simulation experiment where only fri changed over time suppressing the effects of climate change on tree growth and dom decomposition rates 3 results initial dom c stocks conditions for each fri pathway are reported in table a2 in the appendix additional results on the effect of changes in fri over time suppressing the effects of climate change on tree growth and dom decomposition rates are shown in fig a2 the mean simulated and empirical rates of aboveground live tree c biomass change were 0 23 and 0 29 mg c ha 1 yr 1 respectively fig a4 over the sample of 122 remeasured plots our model underestimated the empirical rates by 21 overall we conclude that our model adequately represents the average biomass dynamics in mono specific black spruce stands 3 1 black spruce growth and organic matter decomposition rates under climate change our climate change scenario and weather simulations imply that mean annual temperatures will increase in period b c and d fig a1 relative to the historical period a the mean increases from periods a to b b to c and c to d are 1 7 c 2 0 c and 2 7 c respectively modelled decomposition rates for most dom c pools will increase accordingly fig a3 the only exception is the most stable soil c pool bg slow for which decay rates are reportedly temperature independent kurz et al 2009 their table 4 given our downscaled annual weather variables table 1 black spruce growth indices within our study region will remain relatively constant over periods a and b but will decline markedly in period c and again in period d fig 3 the simulated mean historical growth index over all fri pathways was 13 8 m gi eq 2 but declined to an average of 9 4 m in 2071 2100 fig 3 3 2 short term responses of boreal c stocks to climate change total ecosystem dom live biomass organic layer woody debris and mineral soil mean c stocks were highest 258 4 201 3 60 3 50 2 46 1 and 100 5 mg c ha 1 for pathways 1 and 2 under the historical climate fig 4 a f overall dom pools increased during period a relative to initial conditions but then decreased during the subsequent periods fig 4b live biomass pools tended to increase over period a except for fri pathway 1 but then declined during the three subsequent periods fig 4c net primary productivity was lowest 2 1 mg c ha 1 year 1 for pathway 1 under the 2071 2100 climatic period and greatest 3 4 mg c ha 1 year 1 for pathway 5 under the historical climate fig 5 a heterotrophic respiration was highest for pathway 5 under the historical climate and lowest for pathway 1 and 4 under the period 2071 2100 3 4 and 2 8 mg c ha 1 year 1 respectively fig 5b under historical climate simulations yielded positive mean nep values of 0 02 0 01 and 0 01 mg c ha 1 year 1 for pathways 2 3 and 5 whereas negative values were obtained for pathways 1 and 4 0 12 and 0 09 mg c ha 1 year 1 respectively fig 5c for all fri pathways nep and nbp transitioned to negative values by the end of period b and continued to decrease over periods c and d fig 5c d total ecosystem c stocks increased in average up to 6 by 2010 with subsequent average reductions of 5 7 and 10 by 2040 2070 and 2100 respectively table a3 in the appendix dom pools declined steadily for all fri pathways fig 3b dom c decreased in average 2 by 2040 for an overall dom c loss of nearly 9 over period d fig 4b table a3 total live biomass c stocks decreased nearly 16 by the end of 2100 fig 4c table a3 organic and woody debris c stocks had similar average trends for these pools the mean c losses were up to 14 and 21

forest c stocks and fluxes to climate change in the boreal forest soil carbon storage depends on the long term balance between vegetative c inputs from litterfall and root turnover and c outputs derived from organic matter decomposition laganière et al 2013 climate change could influence boreal c stocks by altering the ecological processes driving these fluxes price et al 2013 van bellen et al 2010 specific mechanisms proposed for boreal black spruce forest include changes in the capacity of trees to grow and sequester atmospheric carbon girardin et al 2015 changes in dead organic matter decomposition rates deluca and boisvenue 2012 and changes in fire regime boulanger et al 2013 2014 evaluating the net effects of climate change on regional dynamics requires the use of ecological models such as the one we present in this manuscript that include the main driving processes and their climate sensitivities in this paper we present an integrated model of black spruce patch dynamics forest carbon dynamics and fire regime the patch dynamics model is a diameter class structured matrix population model the carbon model tracks the amount of c in several live and dead organic matter dom pools carbon dynamics is simulated by a matrix of transfer rates among pools and from dom pools to the atmosphere live biomass pools and inputs from the living to dead c pools are derived from the patch structure diameter growth and mortality the fire module simulates the direct effects of fire on tree mortality combustion of biomass and dom and post fire regeneration climate change will likely affect c storage in boreal black spruce forests through changes in the capacity of trees to grow and sequester atmospheric carbon girardin et al 2015 the rate of dom decomposition deluca and boisvenue 2012 and through modifications to the fire regime boulanger et al 2013 this study indicates that the short term effect of climate change on black spruce forest growth will be substantially negative fig 3 we predicted a reduction black spruce growth index declined in average 32 by 2071 2100 these findings are consistent with other empirical studies and model projections beck et al 2011 dhital et al 2015 girardin et al 2015 which concluded that increases in surface air temperature and changes in the precipitation regime could hinder the capacity of boreal black spruce to grow and assimilate atmospheric carbon d orangeville et al 2016 likewise the increase in air temperature projected under future climate may lead to relative changes in decomposition rates which could alter boreal c balance davidson and janssens 2006 xu et al 2014 for example several lab and field experiments provide evidence of the distinct temperature sensitivities among soil c pools in boreal forest soils davidson and janssens 2006 van cleve et al 1990 our simulations suggest that decay rates of the most labile soil c pools e g ag very fast and ag slow fig a3 in the appendix are temperature sensitive whereas decomposition rates of the more stable and recalcitrant soil c e g bg slow fig a3 in the appendix are not finally the expected changes in the boreal fire regime across north america over the forthcoming decades are a result of the more fire conducive weather linked with climate change bergeron et al 2010 boulanger et al 2014 de groot et al 2003 in particular shorter fire return intervals are projected for some parts of the boreal forest of north america boisvenue et al 2012 boulanger et al 2013 oris et al 2014 such a shortening in fri will affect boreal vegetation dynamics forest structure and the boreal carbon balance boulanger et al 2013 kurz et al 2008 means of all aggregate simulated c pools and all c fluxes varied among climatic periods and fri pathways the effect of period is clearly temporal attributable to increases in mean annual temperature over the 120 year timeframe and to changes in other weather variables also affecting stem growth not reported although the relative short term changes in boreal c stocks and fluxes vary with fri pathways the main trend is temporal figs 4 6 table a3 the effect of fri pathway indicates a spatial component of variation this is attributable at least in part to spatial variation in the sequence of periodic fri values however spatial variation in factors such as spin up dom c conditions e g table a2 or temporal trends in annual weather variables may also contribute the present study can not distinguish these effects our simulations suggest a declining trend over time for boreal ecosystem c storage this decline started very early before 2040 climatic period b and continued over periods c and d fig 4a the expected ecosystem c storage reductions are the result of the decreases in black spruce growth combined with the c losses from increasing fire disturbance and increasing decomposition rates as projected air temperature increased other modelling results from canadian boreal forests also suggest that reductions in total boreal forest carbon stocks are likely to be associated with warmer future climate and higher burn rates chaste et al 2019 miquelajauregui et al 2019 in our simulation experiments changed climatic conditions i e elevated temperature and warming induced fire activity were associated to reductions in most of the modelled c pools except for mineral soil c stock fig 4 our results suggest that nearly 40 and 14 of the c stored in the total live biomass and dom pools respectively could be lost by the end of the 21st century table a3 fig 4b c lower plant derived c inputs to the soil due to reduced plant productivity fig 3 deluca and boisvenue 2012 girardin et al 2015 enhanced temperature sensitive decomposition rates of belowground soil c pools fig a3 and higher overstory tree mortality and organic matter combustion associated to higher fire activity linked with climate change boulanger et al 2013 chaste et al 2019 explain the observed temporal patterns in c stocks losses along climatic periods the weak response of the mineral soil c stock to elevated temperature and increased fri observed in this study reflect with empirical evidence from forest soils that indicate lower temperature sensitivity for decomposition of the most stable c pools davidson and janssens 2006 van cleve et al 1990 our simulated short term responses in c stocks might differ were other factors controlling decomposition rates had been included in our modelling framework for example the climate driven hydrologic balance among drainage precipitation and evapotranspiration as well as other environmental constraints such as dom chemical and physical protection have shown to influence dom decomposition conant et al 2011 davidson and janssens 2006 deluca and boisvenue 2012 schmidt et al 2011 complementary simulation results without accounting for the temperature and precipitation effects on growth and decomposition suggest that fri will be the main driver of ecosystem c change during the first half of the 21st century figs 4 a2 however the relative effect of decreasing fri differs among c pools for example simulated dom c stocks showed a weaker response to fri than did total ecosystem and live biomass c stocks fig a2 this might be because we used historical values of hfi and dc to derive fire vertical propagation fire derived tree mortality and organic matter combustion both net primary productivity and heterotrophic respiration decline from one period to the next resulting in overall reductions in nep net ecosystem production and net biome production also decline but positive mean values were found for the historical period that is based on nep our simulation results suggest a marked and widespread change from c sink to c source which has already started and will persist at least until 2100 studies in boreal black spruce forests suggest negative impacts of high temperatures and increased warming induced fire activity on npp with projected reductions up to 11 by the end of the 21st century ma et al 2011 girardin et al 2015 chaste et al 2019 reductions in plant derived c inputs to the soil associated with lower npp could explain the observed decrease in rh fig 5a the weak temporal response of heterotrophic respiration could be also associated to the slow decomposition rates of the mineral soil c stock figs 5b a3 the expected mean annual loss rates in ecosystem carbon could exacerbate nep reductions as losses of dom increase field and modelling studies boiffin 2004 price et al 1999 have also shown that increased temperature could increase dom decomposition rates for an overall decrease in boreal ecosystem c storage by as much as 13 19 over the next 200 500 years our findings suggest such losses will be nearly exceeded by the end of the 21st century the capacity of québec s boreal black spruce forest to sequester and store organic c may be degraded even over the next few decades due to climate change 4 2 boreal forest carbon management under global warming in canada federal provincial and local governments have established targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ghg canada s target for 2020 is 17 below the 2005 level lemprière et al 2013 mitigation strategies to control boreal c storage could possibly contribute to meeting these targets several forest management activities can be implemented to increase boreal c storage lemprière et al 2013 extending rotations reduction of regeneration delays planting seeding fertilization and control of competing vegetation and herbivory can accelerate the transition from c source to sink lemprière et al 2013 managing boreal forests for c sequestration will require to explicitly account for soil carbon when developing forest management plans and offseting schemes boisvenue et al 2012 deluca and boisvenue 2012 increasing c storage in harvested wood products hwps by increasing the use of long lived hwps reducing emissions by substituting wood for fossil intensive poducts and using biomass as bioenergy area potential strategies by which the canadian boreal forest can aid ghg mitigation lemprière et al 2013 our modelling approach has the potential of quantifying and mapping the location and timing of changes in boreal black spruce c stocks the results of this study could help delineating effective mitigation portafolios and develop alternative mitigation strategies lemprière et al 2013 4 3 model limitations and future research our model estimated the combined effect of climate on stand growth soil decomposition rates and fire return interval we did not attempt to quantify the relative importance of the individual factors the variation among fri pathways alone table 2 fig a2 is enough to show that relative importance must vary both in time and space this could be studied with the existing model by means of more comprehensive experiments several aspects of the fire module could be further developed climate warming may affect other aspects of the fire regime besides fri for example the future distribution of fire intensities may change because we sampled from historical distributions we are likely underestimating the effects of changing fire regimes on ecosystem c storage our fire model implies that the rate of burning varies little among years conditional on fri however there is important interannual variation in boreal fire activity which has been related to shifts among oceanic atmospheric circulation regimes boulanger et al 2013 girardin et al 2009 tian et al 1998 the present study was based on a single climate change scenario a more comprehensive study using climate ensembles would allow the present model to account for some components of forecasting error our study was restricted to boreal black spruce forests more comprehensive models of ecosystem c dynamics could be developed by integrating more vegetation types e g hardwood forests and other conifer species and by accounting for spatial variation in site characteristics such as moisture and nutrient regimes finally there are many processes that were not included in this study such as warming induced changes in the distribution of conifer tree species soil microbial diversity and activity as well as processes involving biochar production and effects of different natural disturbance types such as insects pathogens and anthropogenic influences such as management regimes boulanger et al 2013 girardin et al 2009 schmidt et al 2011 the carbon dynamics model presented here emulates the cbm cfs3 kurz et al 2009 soil models as the cbm cfs3 are generally structured around pools of organic compounds with decomposition rates modified by empirical relations to soil temperature schmidt et al 2011 although these models have proven extremely useful for understanding general patterns of soil carbon accumulation extrapolation of decomposition rates into a future warmer world based on observations of current temperature sensitivities is inadequate davidson and janssens 2006 moreover these models have not yet incorporated the main mechanistic representations of the processes that govern som stability conant et al 2011 schmidt et al 2011 for example nutrient availability may alter microbial community composition and activity which in turn will alter the rate of som degradation schmidt et al 2011 soil water availability for instance controls decomposition of som through direct effects on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon pools reichstein et al 2005 neither of these environmental drivers controlling som decomposition are currently accounted for in the cbm cfs3 therefore they should be explicitly incorporated if we want to accurately inform predictions and

24999,benthic invertebrates play important roles in aquatic ecosystems and their distribution are significantly affected by substrate conditions such as substrate type particle size and riverbed stability traditional research mainly uses statistical methods based on field observation to analyze the relationship between benthic invertebrate distribution and environmental factors while lacking the consideration of growth process mechanism meanwhile the effect of bed surface morphology on benthic invertebrate biomass has rarely been evaluated quantitatively for shallow lakes this study newly develops a benthic invertebrate biomass dynamic model bibdm which is coupled to hydrodynamic and bed surface morphology models simultaneously considering the processes of growth excretion and predation the ripple height which represents bed surface morphology is adopted as key parameter in the growth equation the proposed model was applied to lake taihu which is the third largest shallow lake in china corbicula fluminea the largest biomass species of benthic invertebrates in lake taihu was selected as the research object the model performs well in reproducing the temporal biomass growth process and the spatial simulation also shows good agreement with the observed data meanwhile results confirm the importance of bed surface morphology on benthic invertebrates with the correlation coefficient of 0 81 between the biomass and the ripple height the proposed model could be used to evaluate the effect of environmental factors on the benthic invertebrate growth process moreover the model is highly capable of applying to other species with corresponding environmental factor as the key parameter keywords benthic invertebrates bed surface morphology biomass dynamic model lake taihu corbicula fluminea 1 introduction benthic invertebrates which live at the bottom of rivers lakes reservoirs and estuaries play an important role in the aquatic ecosystems as key species in food chains and food webs i e feeding on phytoplankton bacteria and organic debris biswas et al 2009 vaughn and hakenkamp 2010 and being prey to higher class animals such as fish choat 1982 nisikawa and colin 2000 zimmer et al 2010 some benthic invertebrate larvae use fish as their hosts to obtain nutrients kappes and haase 2012 terui and miyazaki 2015 the feeding behavior can reduce bloom and improve water transparency and quality phelps 1994 li et al 2010 some benthic invertebrates have a certain degree of bioavailability of heavy metals in the water and riverbed by fixing heavy metal elements and avoiding secondary heavy metal pollution caused by sediment suspension brzozowska et al 2012 lei et al 2016 meanwhile they can be used as bio indicators to reflect and evaluate hydrodynamic conditions connectivity characteristic of rivers and water quality conditions beauger et al 2006 suthar et al 2009 craig et al 2012 traditional studies have mainly been based on field observation data from natural rivers and lakes to analyze statistical laws governing the relationship between benthic invertebrate biomass and environmental variables cai et al 2012 alexandridis et al 2017 the environmental variables of concern are divided into hydrodynamic conditions water depth flow velocity and substrate and water quality conditions temperature salinity dissolved oxygen ph and toxicity sousa et al 2009 allen and vaughn 2010 huang et al 2016b however these statistical methods cannot be used to simulate and predict the spatial distribution of benthic invertebrates as they cannot reflect the influence of various factors on the growth processes or mechanisms in aquatic ecosystems the eutrophic dynamics model for phytoplankton has been widely used to simulate the algal bloom geider et al 1997 bonachela et al 2011 for a better knowledge of the aquatic ecosystem it becomes necessary to develop a growth model centered on benthic invertebrates among the environmental variables substrate conditions are regarded as one of the most important factors affecting the distribution of benthic invertebrates quinlan et al 2015 the riverbed substrate is the growing and breeding habitat of benthic invertebrates providing the nutrients oxygen and shelter strayer et al 1997 wwf 2009 previous studies primarily focused on the effects of type stability and heterogeneity of substrate on benthic invertebrates pan et al 2016 these studies mainly involved river beds comprised of a wide range of particle sizes from fine sediment to cobble and gravel zhang et al 2017 and the proportion of fine sediment was selected as the indicator rabení et al 2005 however for shallow lakes in plain regions substrate particle size tends to be within a smaller range the above characterizes show less difference in space in contrast bed surface morphology driven by hydrodynamic and substrate conditions might be an important factor for the benthic invertebrates ripple height which quantitatively characterized bed surface morphology would be more suitable than the particle size distribution in reflecting the overall characteristics of the substrate although previous studies have introduced a relationship between buried depth and the abundance of benthic invertebrates was introduced the results are qualitative chen et al 2017 and further research effort is needed to provide reliable quantitative results in the shallow lakes of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in china corbicula fluminea which belongs to the bivalvia class of mollusca is the dominant species comprising the largest biomass among all benthic invertebrate species also being an economically important species cai et al 2012 corbicula fluminea is referred to as asian clam i e a non indigenous invasive species with strong spread ability on the american and european continents elliott et al 2008 rosa et al 2014 with the construction involved in hydraulic projects the hydrodynamic and sediment conditions have changed drastically dewson et al 2007 wang et al 2017 dai et al 2017 leading to variations in bed surface morphology which in turn affects the habitat environment of growth and reproduction of corbicula fluminea this study describes the newly developed benthic invertebrate biomass dynamic model bibdm which is coupled with hydrodynamics bed surface morphology and water quality models with a focus on the model applicability to lakes in plain regions where benthic invertebrates are widely distributed the effect of bed surface morphology is analyzed in detail the proposed model was applied to lake taihu which is the third largest shallow lake in china to study the distribution of corbicula fluminea the relationship between bed surface morphology and the biomass of corbicula fluminea and the spatial distribution of corbicula fluminea are quantitatively presented the results of this study can be used to better describe the quantitative effects of environmental factors on benthic invertebrates to predict and evaluate the impact of engineering projects on aquatic ecology and to restore and protect the benthic invertebrate habitat in a manner backed by sufficient data 2 model overview 2 1 hydrodynamic and riverbed morphology model hydrodynamic calculations for shallow lakes are dominated by two dimensional reynolds average navier stokes model composed of continuity and momentum equations huang et al 2016a the effect of wind driven wave is taken into account by including radiation stress gradients and enhancing the bed shear stress in the momentum equations continuity equation 1 z t h u x h v y 0 momentum equations 2 u t u u x v u y g z x τ b x τ s x ρ h ν t 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 f x v t u v x v v y g z y τ b y τ

gravity ρ is the density of water vt is the turbulent viscosity coefficient τbx τby τsx and τsy are bed shear stresses and wind driven water surface shear stresses in the x and y directions respectively fx and fy are the wind induced forces determined from the gradients of radiation stress in the x and y directions respectively under the influence of bottom flow the substrate sediment particles might exhibit regular motion resulting in certain shape which is defined as bed surface morphology the riverbed morphology shows strongly correlation with the hydrodynamic characteristics and substrate properties and the ripple height is usually selected as an important representative parameter fig 1 based on the field data of yangtze river basin in china zhang et al 1961 proposed a semi empirical formula to estimate the ripple height under the specific water depth mean flow velocity and substrate size conditions eq 3 is suitable for water depth ranging from 0 06 to 18 3 m mean flow velocity ranging from 0 08 to 2 2 m s and substrate size ranging from 0 09 to 2 2 mm 3 h s h 0 086 u g h h d 1 4 where hs is the ripple height u is mean flow velocity d is the substrate particle size u g h represents the froude number h d represents the relative smoothness recent research has shown that flocculation is prominent for fine sediment cui 2018 lai et al 2018 the substrate particle size in eq 3 should be modified as follow 4 d f f f l o c d 50 where df is the flocculation particle size ffloc is an integrated coefficient of the physical chemical and biological flocculation actions d50 is the median size of sediment particles 2 2 benthic invertebrate biomass dynamic model bibdm biomass dynamic models are generally characterized by an equilibrium equation uehinger et al 1996 proposed a periphyton growth model in which the growth rate is limited by the biomass itself the bibdm adopts the structure of the above model simulates a biomass increment period of benthic invertebrates considering the processes of growth excretion and predation the model assumes that all benthic invertebrates experience complete growing processes which are affected by hydrodynamic and water quality conditions 5 d b d t g e p where b is the biomass g representing the wet weight of benthic invertebrates and g g day 1 e g day 1 and p g day 1 are the growth excretion and predation terms respectively the growth term g is expressed as a logistic equation with limiting factors of the nutrient availability and the size of living spaces the excretion term e is assumed to be affected by dissolved oxygen concentration the predation term p is assumed to be proportional to the benthic invertebrate biomass including predation by fish and capture by humans 6 g g max b n n k i n v n 1 1 k i n v b b f h r o f q u a 7 e exc b f d o 8 p f t e m pr e 1 pr e 2 b where gmax is the maximum specific growing rate defined as a constant n is the nutrient source for benthic invertebrates including the phytoplankton bacteria and organic debris kinv n is the inverse half saturation coefficient limited by nutrient source kinv b is the inverse half saturation coefficient limited by the size of living spaces and the term 1 1 kinv b b reflects the competition between benthic invertebrates implying competition increases with an increase in biomass exc is the natural excretion rate defined as a constant pre1 and pre2 are the rates of predation by fish and capture by human defined as constants respectively finally fhro is the coefficient reflecting the hydrodynamic effect on biomass growth which integrates several hydrodynamic factors including water depth coefficient fdep flow velocity coefficient fvel and substrate coefficient fsub analogously fqua is the coefficient reflecting the effect of water quality on biomass growth which integrates several water quality factors including water temperature coefficient ftem ph coefficient fph salinity coefficient fsal and toxic coefficient ftox and fdo is the coefficient corresponding to the dissolved oxygen concentration the expressions of fhro and fqua are as follows 9 f h r o f d e p f v e l f s u b 10 f q u a f t e m f p h f s a l f t o x according to ecological niche theory hirzel and lay 2008 each benthic invertebrate species exists within a specific range of environmental conditions usually the niche curves comprise a single peak i e the benthic invertebrate biomass firstly increases as the given environmental gradient increases and then decreases after reaching the optimum value based on the eulerian eulerian habitat selection eehs method fang et al 2016 dai et al 2016 the factors in eqs 9 and 10 are obtained by solving the 0th order boltzmann equation 11 f f a c t v f f a c x f f a c f f a c f a c 0 where the subscript fac represents a specific factor of hydrodynamics or water quality ffac is the corresponding coefficient and ffac is the virtual driven force exerted on benthic invertebrates for the given factor then the function of ffac can be expressed as follow 12 f f a c α f a c f a c 3 e β f a c f a c 2 γ f a c where αfac βfac and γfac are parameters which must be determined for specific species fig 2 shows an example of function curves corresponding to eq 12 by changing the values of αfac βfac and γfac the range of the function curve can be adjusted in other words this curve can be used to reflect the different ecological niche supported by each environmental factor to facilitate a more intuitive understanding of the theoretical model fig 3 shows a conceptual diagram of the bibdm the upper part represents the water and the lower part represents the river bed showing the bed surface morphology the left part shows the hydrodynamic and water quality conditions which are considered in the bibdm model the right part shows the structure of the bibdm centered on benthic invertebrates 3 description of study region the study region lake taihu is one of the five largest freshwater lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river located at 30 25 40 n 31 32 58 n 119 52 32 e 120 36 10 e the maximum length and width of lake taihu are approximately 68 5 and 56 0 km with a surface area of 2338 km2 and an average depth of 1 89 m cai et al 2012 fig 4 shows the sketch map of lake taihu and its location in the yangtze river basin usually the whole domain is divided into 8 zones including zhushan bay meiliang bay gonghu bay west littoral zone south littoral zone east littoral zone east lake taihu and central area huang et al 2016a though more than 200 influent effluent channels surround lake taihu the rivers with small quantities have little influence on the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the lake compared with a total storage capacity of 4 48 109 m3 of the whole lake li et al 2014 the flow field of lake taihu is primarily determined by wind induced current zhou 2011 according to the long term meteorological data recorded the lake taihu area is mainly dominated by southeastern wind in summer and northwestern wind in winter with an average wind speed of 3 5 m s qin et al 2006 numerous benthic invertebrates compose amount of biomass in lake taihu benthic sampling data was seasonally collected at field observations shown in fig 4 by the taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research tller from 15th february 2007 to 15th november 2008 cai et al 2010 2012 sites of 3 5 8 16 18 19 20 21 22 24 25 27 and 30 were further frequently investigated every month from december 2006 to november 2007 cai 2010 nearly 40 species of benthic invertebrates have been recorded mainly including oligochaeta chironomidae gastropod and bivalvia among these benthic species corbicula fluminea is the most abundant species contributing the most significant part to the whole biomass cai et al 2012 therefore corbicula fluminea in lake taihu was selected as an application of the bibdm the life span of corbicula fluminea in lake taihu is almost one year including reproduction stage larvae stage juvenile stage adult stage and then captured as economical species by human fig 5 the reproduction stage of corbicula fluminea starts in the beginning of may and reaches the peak in june and july the biomass of corbicula fluminea increases rapidly until september and then the adult individuals are harvested with biomass distinctly decreasing cai 2010 4 model calibration and verification 4 1 hydrodynamic and riverbed morphology calculation 4 1 1 hydrodynamic and substrate parameters the entire computational domain was divided into 180 180 orthogonal grids with spacing of δx δy 400 m for each cell water depth of lake taihu was measured by taihu basin authority huang et al 2016a as shown in fig 6 the boundary condition of hydrodynamic model was set as closed boundary due to the negligible influence of the inflow and outflow of the rivers the initial flow velocity was set as 0 m s for each grid the bed surface morphology in shallow lakes with weak hydrodynamic condition is generally formed under an anomalously large wind field such as a storm surge preliminary calculation showed that the common wind with speed of 3 5 m s could not form the apparent bed surface morphology thus the recorded wind field of typhoon 9711 happened in august 1997 was selected as the calculation condition with an average wind speed of 8 m s and an average wind direction of 135 zhou et al 2011 the hydrodynamic model was finally calculated based on a free water surface which was driven by a constant 8 m s wind in the southeast direction the median particle sizes d50 in lake taihu is considered as 0 017 mm for the whole area huang et al 2016a which needed to consider the effect of flocculation action cui 2018 carried out the flocculation experiment under the conditions where d50 is 8 5 μm and flow velocity is 0 1 m s which resulted in a flocculation particle size of 85 μm and the flocculation coefficient of 10 with the similar hydrodynamic condition this research adopted 10 as the integrated flocculation coefficient i e the flocculation particle size df was set as 0 170 mm 4 1 2 hydrodynamic model verification fig 7 shows the comparison between the observed and simulated flow fields the recorded flow field during typhoon 9711 in fig 7 a was observed by tller zhou 2011 a large clockwise annular current occurred in the west littoral zone along with three counter clockwise circular currents in the east littoral zone and gonghu bay which were mainly caused by the wind direction and lake topography the flow field in fig 7 b was simulated under the constant 8 m s southeast wind the magnitude of the flow velocity and the flow field distribution are generally in agreement with the observed data and the simulation results appropriately reproduce the circular lake currents 4 1 3 riverbed morphology results the bed surface morphology in lake taihu was calculated based on the result of flow field and water depth distribution fig 8 the calculated ripple height in lake taihu is at the scale of centimeter scale ranging from 0 to 5 0 cm the larger ripple height occurs in the west and east littoral zones where the hydrodynamic conditions are relatively stronger and several spots have the ripple height of more than 3 0 cm while in east lake taihu the ripple height is generally between 0 to 1 5 cm with shallow water depth and weak flow conditions since ripple height in centimeter is two orders of magnitude smaller than the water depth in meter field investigations of bed surface morphology are difficult based on the verified hydrodynamic results the calculated riverbed morphology with semi empirical formula could be acceptable in subsequent research 4 2 bibdm calculation 4 2 1 bibdm parameters the quantitative description of the effect of ripple height on benthic invertebrate biomass was achieved by f b s m α b s m h s 3 e β b s m h s 2 γ b s m corbicula fluminea mainly occurs within 20 0 cm under the shallow bed surface with especially preference between 2 0 and 10 0 cm quinlan et al 2015 the median value 6 0 cm was preliminarily supposed as the optimum ripple height and 0 18 was preliminarily supposed as the minimum value as shown in fig 9 a the corresponding values of αbsm βbsm and γbsm were fitted as 0 0195 0 046 and 0 18 respectively the coefficients might need appropriate adjustment within an alternation of above assumptions to meet the best bibdm result the influence of water temperature on benthic invertebrates was analogously characterized through f t e m α t e m t 3 e β t e m t 2 γ t e m corbicula fluminea belongs to eurythermic species with an optimum water temperature range of 24 32 and it usually stops food uptake under 5 in lake taihu cai 2010 based on the above range the values of αtem βtem and γtem for corbicula fluminea were fitted as 0 00022 0 0021 and 0 05 respectively fish predation liveness also exhibits a response to water temperature the similar function was determined with the coefficients 0 000182 0 0021 and 0 22 implying that fish has the same optimum temperature with corbicula fluminea and better tolerance to low temperature fig 9 b this bed surface morphology condition adopted for this application was constant thus fbsm only varied in space with the distribution of ripple height but kept constant in time series water temperature in lake taihu ranges from 2 5 to 32 5 with a maximum value occurs in august however the spatial difference of water temperature in lake taihu is almost negligible dai 2013 thus this study adopted the same time series of ftem for the whole lake as shown in fig 10 on both sides of the maximum temperature ftem achieve peak values twice in june and september phytoplankton contributes 85 of the total food intake for corbicula fluminea in lake taihu cao et al 2000 due to the high eutrophication level of lake taihu xu et al 2010 the amount of phytoplankton would not be the limiting factor for benthic invertebrate growth thus the nutrient term n n kinv n was simplified set as 1 0 in addition based on the purpose of this research other parameters in eqs 6 7 and 8 were not considered and the related parameters were set as 1 0 4 2 2 bibdm calibration field observed data of the referred 13 monthly observation sites was used for model calibration only the mean biomass among these sites every month was available cai 2010 lacking of the separate data presentation of each site besides the coefficient test implied that the influence of the initial value on the simulation process could eliminate after 3 months thus we set the uniform data 85 g as start for the whole sites and simulate a year as preparation process then the biomass data at the last moment of preparation process were adopted as the initial values for the formal simulation of a new cycle from december 2006 to november 2007 the sensitivity of the influence of each parameter on the growth process were firstly analyzed and then the coefficients were adjusted one by one to meet the better simulation result uehlinger et al 1996 the proportional relation of gmax and exc was approximately settled as 0 05 sousa et al 2008 kinv b and pre1 were adjusted to meet the same maximum biomass with the observed data on 15th september to characterize the sharp decrease of biomass affected by human s capture we supposed 10 days fishing process from 16th september to 25th september and pre2 was fitted the coefficients of the growth equation were calibrated and listed in table 1 the columns in fig 11 presents the monthly observed data and the dotted lines show the average value of the simulated biomass among field sites including fishing process or not the biomass of corbicula fluminea significantly increases from may peaks in the middle of september and then decreases which was well reproduced by the bibdm therefore the calibrated coefficients could be employed for follow up research 4 2 3 bibdm results the spatial distribution of corbicula fluminea in lake taihu was simulated with the calibrated model from february 2007 to november 2008 fig 12 a presents the field observed biomass data in 29 sites which were collected on 15th of february may august and november in 2007 and 2008 and shown as annually averaged value of eight times sampling the biomass value of observed sites ranged from 5 to 300 g with significant difference in spatial distribution fig 12 b presents the average biomass value of the same moments as seasonally sampling with a range between 5 and 600 g for the whole lake the larger biomass positions of the simulated result mainly occur in the south western zone and the surrounding of central area while the smaller biomass positions mainly occur in east lake taihu and northern bays which are consistent with observed data further quantitative comparison between the field observed and simulated data indicate a good performance of the bibdm fig 13 the sites in zhushan bay and meiliang bay show relatively poor accuracy and the observed value are much smaller than simulated value these two bays undergo the most severe eutrophic problem where the lower dissolved oxygen concentration might limit the growth process of corbicula fluminea this application mainly focuses on the effect of bed surface morphology at the scale of the whole lake lacking sight of more environment factors the bibdm has taken dissolved oxygen into account and further research with an attention of the partial lake might analyze the effect of dissolved oxygen in detail 5 model discussion statistical methods could only present the benthic invertebrate data and environment factor data at specific moment though some studies have simulated the benthic invertebrates with food web model zhang and liu 2014 the benthic invertebrates were not the research emphasis and the quantitative analysis kept missing a better understanding of the dynamic relationship between environment factors and benthic invertebrate growth process remains necessary two scenarios are presented to analyze the influence of environment factors on benthic invertebrate growth process fig 14 s1 represents the current situation in gonghu bay where the ripple height has an average value of approximately 1 0 cm and keeps constant in time s2 was proposed based on the future water diversion projects supposing that the ripple height gradually varies between 1st april and 1st october due to the changing flow process the biomass increment rate responds immediately and synchronously to the ripple height variation fig 14 a while the biomass would not change suddenly and the maximum biomass occurs a month later than the moment of largest ripple height occurs fig 14 b thus we can grasp the temporal lag between the environment factor variation and the response of benthic invertebrates however the biomass accumulated process in time series could not be obtained by statistic method meanwhile fig 14 b shows that the improved bed surface morphology condition could lead to the biomass reaching its maximum in advance but the advance time would not be too long and it is still around the middle of september which is consistent with the results of parameter sensitivity analysis the temporal cycle of benthic invertebrate growth process is mainly affected by the time series of variable water temperature moreover the correlation between the ripple height and field observed biomass of corbicula fluminea is shown in fig 15 with a correlation coefficient of r2 0 81 confirming that the riverbed morphology plays indeed key role in leading to the spatial difference of the benthic invertebrate distribution as bed surface morphology is very difficult to measure in lakes previous studies paid less attention to quantitatively analyze its effect on benthic invertebrate biomass the riverbed morphology might affect the flow turbulence which will in turn affect the food availability and the dissolved oxygen concentration mcnair et al 1997 sukhodolov et al 2015 the riverbed morphology can also provide shelters for benthic invertebrates avoiding the large scale of eroding action by the flowing water hart and merz 1998 gibbins et al 2007 the physical features of the river bed can support varieties of habitat characteristics thus the riverbed morphology would have a significant impact on the abundance of benthic invertebrates this study adopted a relative ripple height formula and verified hydrodynamic results to represent the bed surface morphology characterized its quantitative influence and considered as the key parameter of the bibdm which donates the high accuracy of the results 6 conclusion in the present study a dynamic model bibdm of growth excretion and predation processes for benthic invertebrates is developed the bibdm is coupled to hydrodynamic and bed surface morphology models which could take into account a variety of hydro environment factors then the proposed model is applied to simulate the biomass of corbicula fluminea in lake taihu and the temporal process and spatial distribution of corbicula fluminea are well reproduced the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the benthic invertebrate biomass exhibits highly correlation with the ripple height with a correlation coefficient of 0 81 indicating that the riverbed morphology is the important influence factor on benthic invertebrates and the spatial distribution of the biomass is mainly driven by bed surface morphology 2 comparing the growth processes of benthic invertebrates under different bed morphology surface conditions it is found that the riverbed morphology characterizes would significantly affect the maximum biomass the period to reach the maximum value is also affected by the riverbed morphology but not as obvious as the effect of temperature time process moreover the model is highly capable of being applied to simulate other species with considering appropriate environmental parameters in the growth equation the model can also be used to predict the benthic invertebrate biomass variation under the changing

24999,benthic invertebrates play important roles in aquatic ecosystems and their distribution are significantly affected by substrate conditions such as substrate type particle size and riverbed stability traditional research mainly uses statistical methods based on field observation to analyze the relationship between benthic invertebrate distribution and environmental factors while lacking the consideration of growth process mechanism meanwhile the effect of bed surface morphology on benthic invertebrate biomass has rarely been evaluated quantitatively for shallow lakes this study newly develops a benthic invertebrate biomass dynamic model bibdm which is coupled to hydrodynamic and bed surface morphology models simultaneously considering the processes of growth excretion and predation the ripple height which represents bed surface morphology is adopted as key parameter in the growth equation the proposed model was applied to lake taihu which is the third largest shallow lake in china corbicula fluminea the largest biomass species of benthic invertebrates in lake taihu was selected as the research object the model performs well in reproducing the temporal biomass growth process and the spatial simulation also shows good agreement with the observed data meanwhile results confirm the importance of bed surface morphology on benthic invertebrates with the correlation coefficient of 0 81 between the biomass and the ripple height the proposed model could be used to evaluate the effect of environmental factors on the benthic invertebrate growth process moreover the model is highly capable of applying to other species with corresponding environmental factor as the key parameter keywords benthic invertebrates bed surface morphology biomass dynamic model lake taihu corbicula fluminea 1 introduction benthic invertebrates which live at the bottom of rivers lakes reservoirs and estuaries play an important role in the aquatic ecosystems as key species in food chains and food webs i e feeding on phytoplankton bacteria and organic debris biswas et al 2009 vaughn and hakenkamp 2010 and being prey to higher class animals such as fish choat 1982 nisikawa and colin 2000 zimmer et al 2010 some benthic invertebrate larvae use fish as their hosts to obtain nutrients kappes and haase 2012 terui and miyazaki 2015 the feeding behavior can reduce bloom and improve water transparency and quality phelps 1994 li et al 2010 some benthic invertebrates have a certain degree of bioavailability of heavy metals in the water and riverbed by fixing heavy metal elements and avoiding secondary heavy metal pollution caused by sediment suspension brzozowska et al 2012 lei et al 2016 meanwhile they can be used as bio indicators to reflect and evaluate hydrodynamic conditions connectivity characteristic of rivers and water quality conditions beauger et al 2006 suthar et al 2009 craig et al 2012 traditional studies have mainly been based on field observation data from natural rivers and lakes to analyze statistical laws governing the relationship between benthic invertebrate biomass and environmental variables cai et al 2012 alexandridis et al 2017 the environmental variables of concern are divided into hydrodynamic conditions water depth flow velocity and substrate and water quality conditions temperature salinity dissolved oxygen ph and toxicity sousa et al 2009 allen and vaughn 2010 huang et al 2016b however these statistical methods cannot be used to simulate and predict the spatial distribution of benthic invertebrates as they cannot reflect the influence of various factors on the growth processes or mechanisms in aquatic ecosystems the eutrophic dynamics model for phytoplankton has been widely used to simulate the algal bloom geider et al 1997 bonachela et al 2011 for a better knowledge of the aquatic ecosystem it becomes necessary to develop a growth model centered on benthic invertebrates among the environmental variables substrate conditions are regarded as one of the most important factors affecting the distribution of benthic invertebrates quinlan et al 2015 the riverbed substrate is the growing and breeding habitat of benthic invertebrates providing the nutrients oxygen and shelter strayer et al 1997 wwf 2009 previous studies primarily focused on the effects of type stability and heterogeneity of substrate on benthic invertebrates pan et al 2016 these studies mainly involved river beds comprised of a wide range of particle sizes from fine sediment to cobble and gravel zhang et al 2017 and the proportion of fine sediment was selected as the indicator rabení et al 2005 however for shallow lakes in plain regions substrate particle size tends to be within a smaller range the above characterizes show less difference in space in contrast bed surface morphology driven by hydrodynamic and substrate conditions might be an important factor for the benthic invertebrates ripple height which quantitatively characterized bed surface morphology would be more suitable than the particle size distribution in reflecting the overall characteristics of the substrate although previous studies have introduced a relationship between buried depth and the abundance of benthic invertebrates was introduced the results are qualitative chen et al 2017 and further research effort is needed to provide reliable quantitative results in the shallow lakes of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in china corbicula fluminea which belongs to the bivalvia class of mollusca is the dominant species comprising the largest biomass among all benthic invertebrate species also being an economically important species cai et al 2012 corbicula fluminea is referred to as asian clam i e a non indigenous invasive species with strong spread ability on the american and european continents elliott et al 2008 rosa et al 2014 with the construction involved in hydraulic projects the hydrodynamic and sediment conditions have changed drastically dewson et al 2007 wang et al 2017 dai et al 2017 leading to variations in bed surface morphology which in turn affects the habitat environment of growth and reproduction of corbicula fluminea this study describes the newly developed benthic invertebrate biomass dynamic model bibdm which is coupled with hydrodynamics bed surface morphology and water quality models with a focus on the model applicability to lakes in plain regions where benthic invertebrates are widely distributed the effect of bed surface morphology is analyzed in detail the proposed model was applied to lake taihu which is the third largest shallow lake in china to study the distribution of corbicula fluminea the relationship between bed surface morphology and the biomass of corbicula fluminea and the spatial distribution of corbicula fluminea are quantitatively presented the results of this study can be used to better describe the quantitative effects of environmental factors on benthic invertebrates to predict and evaluate the impact of engineering projects on aquatic ecology and to restore and protect the benthic invertebrate habitat in a manner backed by sufficient data 2 model overview 2 1 hydrodynamic and riverbed morphology model hydrodynamic calculations for shallow lakes are dominated by two dimensional reynolds average navier stokes model composed of continuity and momentum equations huang et al 2016a the effect of wind driven wave is taken into account by including radiation stress gradients and enhancing the bed shear stress in the momentum equations continuity equation 1 z t h u x h v y 0 momentum equations 2 u t u u x v u y g z x τ b x τ s x ρ h ν t 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 f x v t u v x v v y g z y τ b y τ

gravity ρ is the density of water vt is the turbulent viscosity coefficient τbx τby τsx and τsy are bed shear stresses and wind driven water surface shear stresses in the x and y directions respectively fx and fy are the wind induced forces determined from the gradients of radiation stress in the x and y directions respectively under the influence of bottom flow the substrate sediment particles might exhibit regular motion resulting in certain shape which is defined as bed surface morphology the riverbed morphology shows strongly correlation with the hydrodynamic characteristics and substrate properties and the ripple height is usually selected as an important representative parameter fig 1 based on the field data of yangtze river basin in china zhang et al 1961 proposed a semi empirical formula to estimate the ripple height under the specific water depth mean flow velocity and substrate size conditions eq 3 is suitable for water depth ranging from 0 06 to 18 3 m mean flow velocity ranging from 0 08 to 2 2 m s and substrate size ranging from 0 09 to 2 2 mm 3 h s h 0 086 u g h h d 1 4 where hs is the ripple height u is mean flow velocity d is the substrate particle size u g h represents the froude number h d represents the relative smoothness recent research has shown that flocculation is prominent for fine sediment cui 2018 lai et al 2018 the substrate particle size in eq 3 should be modified as follow 4 d f f f l o c d 50 where df is the flocculation particle size ffloc is an integrated coefficient of the physical chemical and biological flocculation actions d50 is the median size of sediment particles 2 2 benthic invertebrate biomass dynamic model bibdm biomass dynamic models are generally characterized by an equilibrium equation uehinger et al 1996 proposed a periphyton growth model in which the growth rate is limited by the biomass itself the bibdm adopts the structure of the above model simulates a biomass increment period of benthic invertebrates considering the processes of growth excretion and predation the model assumes that all benthic invertebrates experience complete growing processes which are affected by hydrodynamic and water quality conditions 5 d b d t g e p where b is the biomass g representing the wet weight of benthic invertebrates and g g day 1 e g day 1 and p g day 1 are the growth excretion and predation terms respectively the growth term g is expressed as a logistic equation with limiting factors of the nutrient availability and the size of living spaces the excretion term e is assumed to be affected by dissolved oxygen concentration the predation term p is assumed to be proportional to the benthic invertebrate biomass including predation by fish and capture by humans 6 g g max b n n k i n v n 1 1

including the phytoplankton bacteria and organic debris kinv n is the inverse half saturation coefficient limited by nutrient source kinv b is the inverse half saturation coefficient limited by the size of living spaces and the term 1 1 kinv b b reflects the competition between benthic invertebrates implying competition increases with an increase in biomass exc is the natural excretion rate defined as a constant pre1 and pre2 are the rates of predation by fish and capture by human defined as constants respectively finally fhro is the coefficient reflecting the hydrodynamic effect on biomass growth which integrates several hydrodynamic factors including water depth coefficient fdep flow velocity coefficient fvel and substrate coefficient fsub analogously fqua is the coefficient reflecting the effect of water quality on biomass growth which integrates several water quality factors including water temperature coefficient ftem ph coefficient fph salinity coefficient fsal and toxic coefficient ftox and fdo is the coefficient corresponding to the dissolved oxygen concentration the expressions of fhro and fqua are as follows 9 f h r o f d e p f v e l f s u b 10 f q u a f t e m f p h f s a l f t o x according to ecological niche theory hirzel and lay 2008 each benthic invertebrate species exists within a specific range of environmental conditions usually the niche curves comprise a single peak i e the benthic invertebrate biomass firstly increases as the given environmental gradient increases and then decreases after reaching the optimum value based on the eulerian eulerian habitat selection eehs method fang et al 2016 dai et al 2016 the factors in eqs 9 and 10 are obtained by solving the 0th order boltzmann equation 11 f f a c t v f f a c x f f a c f f a c f a c 0 where the subscript fac represents a specific factor of hydrodynamics or water quality ffac is the corresponding coefficient and ffac is the virtual driven force exerted on benthic invertebrates for the given factor then the function of ffac can be expressed as follow 12 f f a c α f a c f a c 3 e β f a c f a c 2 γ f a c where αfac βfac and γfac are parameters which must be determined for specific species fig 2 shows an example of function curves corresponding to eq 12 by changing the values of αfac βfac and γfac the range of the function curve can be adjusted in other words this curve can be used to reflect the different ecological niche supported by each environmental factor to facilitate a more intuitive understanding of the theoretical model fig 3 shows a conceptual diagram of the bibdm the upper part represents the water and the lower part represents the river bed showing the bed surface morphology the left part shows the hydrodynamic and water quality conditions which are considered in the bibdm model the right part shows the structure of the bibdm centered on benthic invertebrates 3 description of study region the study region lake taihu is one of the five largest freshwater lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river located at 30 25 40 n 31 32 58 n 119 52 32 e 120 36 10 e the maximum length and width of lake taihu are approximately 68 5 and 56 0 km with a surface area of 2338 km2 and an average depth of 1 89 m cai et al 2012 fig 4 shows the sketch map of lake taihu and its location in the yangtze river basin usually the whole domain is divided into 8 zones including zhushan bay meiliang bay gonghu bay west littoral zone south littoral zone east littoral zone east lake taihu and central area huang et al 2016a though more than 200 influent effluent channels surround lake taihu the rivers with small quantities have little influence on the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the lake compared with a total storage capacity of 4 48 109 m3 of the whole lake li et al 2014 the flow field of lake taihu is primarily determined by wind induced current zhou 2011 according to the long term meteorological data recorded the lake taihu area is mainly dominated by southeastern wind in summer and northwestern wind in winter with an average wind speed of 3 5 m s qin et al 2006 numerous benthic invertebrates compose amount of biomass in lake taihu benthic sampling data was seasonally collected at field observations shown in fig 4 by the taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research tller from 15th february 2007 to 15th november 2008 cai et al 2010 2012 sites of 3 5 8 16 18 19 20 21 22 24 25 27 and 30 were further frequently investigated every month from december 2006 to november 2007 cai 2010 nearly 40 species of benthic invertebrates have been recorded mainly including oligochaeta chironomidae gastropod and bivalvia among these benthic species corbicula fluminea is the most abundant species contributing the most significant part to the whole biomass cai et al 2012 therefore corbicula fluminea in lake taihu was selected as an application of the bibdm the life span of corbicula fluminea in lake taihu is almost one year including reproduction stage larvae stage juvenile stage adult stage and then captured as economical species by human fig 5 the reproduction stage of corbicula fluminea starts in the beginning of may and reaches the peak in june and july the biomass of corbicula fluminea increases rapidly until september and then the adult individuals are harvested with biomass distinctly decreasing cai 2010 4 model calibration and verification 4 1 hydrodynamic and riverbed morphology calculation 4 1 1 hydrodynamic and substrate parameters the entire computational domain was divided into 180 180 orthogonal grids with spacing of δx δy 400 m for each cell water depth of lake taihu was measured by taihu basin authority huang et al 2016a as shown in fig 6 the boundary condition of hydrodynamic model was set as closed boundary due to the negligible influence of the inflow and outflow of the rivers the initial flow velocity was set as 0 m s for each grid the bed surface morphology in shallow lakes with weak hydrodynamic condition is generally formed under an anomalously large wind field such as a storm surge preliminary calculation showed that the common wind with speed of 3 5 m s could not form the apparent bed surface morphology thus the recorded wind field of typhoon 9711 happened in august 1997 was selected as the calculation condition with an average wind speed of 8 m s and an average wind direction of 135 zhou et al 2011 the hydrodynamic model was finally calculated based on a free water surface which was driven by a constant 8 m s wind in the southeast direction the median particle sizes d50 in lake taihu is considered as 0 017 mm for the whole area huang et al 2016a which needed to consider the effect of flocculation action cui 2018 carried out the flocculation experiment under the conditions where d50 is 8 5 μm and flow velocity is 0 1 m s which resulted in a flocculation particle size of 85 μm and the flocculation coefficient of 10 with the similar hydrodynamic condition this research adopted 10 as the integrated flocculation coefficient i e the flocculation particle size df was set as 0 170 mm 4 1 2 hydrodynamic model verification fig 7 shows the comparison between the observed and simulated flow fields the recorded flow field during typhoon 9711 in fig 7 a was observed by tller zhou 2011 a large clockwise annular current occurred in the west littoral zone along with three counter clockwise circular currents in the east littoral zone and gonghu bay which were mainly caused by the wind direction and lake topography the flow field in fig 7 b was simulated under the constant 8 m s southeast wind the magnitude of the flow velocity and the flow field distribution are generally in agreement with the observed data and the simulation results appropriately reproduce the circular lake currents 4 1 3 riverbed morphology results the bed surface morphology in lake taihu was calculated based on the result of flow field and water depth distribution fig 8 the calculated ripple height in lake taihu is at the scale of centimeter scale ranging from 0 to 5 0 cm the larger ripple height occurs in the west and east littoral zones where the hydrodynamic conditions are relatively stronger and several spots have the ripple height of more than 3 0 cm while in east lake taihu the ripple height is generally between 0 to 1 5 cm with shallow water depth and weak flow conditions since ripple height in centimeter is two orders of magnitude smaller than the water depth in meter field investigations of bed surface morphology are difficult based on the verified hydrodynamic results the calculated riverbed morphology with semi empirical formula could be acceptable in subsequent research 4 2 bibdm

fluminea mainly occurs within 20 0 cm under the shallow bed surface with especially preference between 2 0 and 10 0 cm quinlan et al 2015 the median value 6 0 cm was preliminarily supposed as the optimum ripple height and 0 18 was preliminarily supposed as the minimum value as shown in fig 9 a the corresponding values of αbsm βbsm and γbsm were fitted as 0 0195 0 046 and 0 18 respectively the coefficients might need appropriate adjustment within an alternation of above assumptions to meet the best bibdm result the influence of water temperature on benthic invertebrates was analogously characterized through f t e m α t e m t 3 e β t e m t 2 γ t e m corbicula fluminea belongs to eurythermic species with an optimum water temperature range of 24 32 and it usually stops food uptake under 5 in lake taihu cai 2010 based on the above range the values of αtem βtem and γtem for corbicula fluminea were fitted as 0 00022 0 0021 and 0 05 respectively fish predation liveness also exhibits a response to water temperature the similar function was determined with the coefficients 0 000182 0 0021 and 0 22 implying that fish has the same optimum temperature with corbicula fluminea and better tolerance to low temperature fig 9 b this bed surface morphology condition adopted for this application was constant thus fbsm only varied in space with the distribution of ripple height but kept constant in time series water temperature in lake taihu ranges from 2 5 to 32 5 with a maximum value occurs in august however the spatial difference of water temperature in lake taihu is almost negligible dai 2013 thus this study adopted the same time series of ftem for the whole lake as shown in fig 10 on both sides of the maximum temperature ftem achieve peak values twice in june and september phytoplankton contributes 85 of the total food intake for corbicula fluminea in lake taihu cao et al 2000 due to the high eutrophication level of lake taihu xu et al 2010 the amount of phytoplankton would not be the limiting factor for benthic invertebrate growth thus the nutrient term n n kinv n was simplified set as 1 0 in addition based on the purpose of this research other parameters in eqs 6 7 and 8 were not considered and the related parameters were set as 1 0 4 2 2 bibdm calibration field observed data of the referred 13 monthly observation sites was used for model calibration only the mean biomass among these sites every month was available cai 2010 lacking of the separate data presentation of each site besides the coefficient test implied that the influence of the initial value on the simulation process could eliminate after 3 months thus we set the uniform data 85 g as start for the whole sites and simulate a year as preparation process then the biomass data at the last moment of preparation process were adopted as the initial values for the formal simulation of a new cycle from december 2006 to november 2007 the sensitivity of the influence of each parameter on the growth process were firstly analyzed and then the coefficients were adjusted one by one to meet the better simulation result uehlinger et al 1996 the proportional relation of gmax and exc was approximately settled as 0 05 sousa et al 2008 kinv b and pre1 were adjusted to meet the same maximum biomass with the observed data on 15th september to characterize the sharp decrease of biomass affected by human s capture we supposed 10 days fishing process from 16th september to 25th september and pre2 was fitted the coefficients of the growth equation were calibrated and listed in table 1 the columns in fig 11 presents the monthly observed data and the dotted lines show the average value of the simulated biomass among field sites including fishing process or not the biomass of corbicula fluminea significantly increases from may peaks in the middle of september and then decreases which was well reproduced by the bibdm therefore the calibrated coefficients could be employed for follow up research 4 2 3 bibdm results the spatial distribution of corbicula fluminea in lake taihu was simulated with the calibrated model from february 2007 to november 2008 fig 12 a presents the field observed biomass data in 29 sites which were collected on 15th of february may august and november in 2007 and 2008 and shown as annually averaged value of eight times sampling the biomass value of observed sites ranged from 5 to 300 g with significant difference in spatial distribution fig 12 b presents the average biomass value of the same moments as seasonally sampling with a range between 5 and 600 g for the whole lake the larger biomass positions of the simulated result mainly occur in the south western zone and the surrounding of central area while the smaller biomass positions mainly occur in east lake taihu and northern bays which are consistent with observed data further quantitative comparison between the field observed and simulated data indicate a good performance of the bibdm fig 13 the sites in zhushan bay and meiliang bay show relatively poor accuracy and the observed value are much smaller than simulated value these two bays undergo the most severe eutrophic problem where the lower dissolved oxygen concentration might limit the growth process of corbicula fluminea this application mainly focuses on the effect of bed surface morphology at the scale of the whole lake lacking sight of more environment factors the bibdm has taken dissolved oxygen into account and further research with an attention of the partial lake might analyze the effect of dissolved oxygen in detail 5 model discussion statistical methods could only present the benthic invertebrate data and environment factor data at specific moment though some studies have simulated the benthic invertebrates with food web model zhang and liu 2014 the benthic invertebrates were not the research emphasis and the quantitative analysis kept missing a better understanding of the dynamic relationship between environment factors and benthic invertebrate growth process remains necessary two scenarios are presented to analyze the influence of environment factors on benthic invertebrate growth process fig 14 s1 represents the current situation in gonghu bay where the ripple height has an average value of approximately 1 0 cm and keeps constant in time s2 was proposed based on the future water diversion projects supposing that the ripple height gradually varies between 1st april and 1st october due to the changing flow process the biomass increment rate responds immediately and synchronously to the ripple height variation fig 14 a while the biomass would not change suddenly and the maximum biomass occurs a month later than the moment of largest ripple height occurs fig 14 b thus we can grasp the temporal lag between the environment factor variation and the response of benthic invertebrates however the biomass accumulated process in time series could not be obtained by statistic method meanwhile fig 14 b shows that the improved bed surface morphology condition could lead to the biomass reaching its maximum in advance but the advance time would not be too long and it is still around the middle of september which is consistent with the results of parameter sensitivity analysis the temporal cycle of benthic invertebrate growth process is mainly affected by the time series of variable water temperature moreover the correlation between the ripple height and field observed biomass of corbicula fluminea is shown in fig 15 with a correlation coefficient of r2 0 81 confirming that the riverbed morphology plays indeed key role in leading to the spatial difference of the benthic invertebrate distribution as bed surface morphology is very difficult to measure in lakes previous studies paid less attention to quantitatively analyze its effect on benthic invertebrate biomass the riverbed morphology might affect the flow turbulence which will in turn affect the food availability and the dissolved oxygen concentration mcnair et al 1997 sukhodolov et al 2015 the riverbed morphology can also provide shelters for benthic invertebrates avoiding the large scale of eroding action by the flowing water hart and merz 1998 gibbins et al 2007 the physical features of the river bed can support varieties of habitat characteristics thus the riverbed morphology would have a significant impact on the abundance of benthic invertebrates this study adopted a relative ripple height formula and verified hydrodynamic results to represent the bed surface morphology characterized its quantitative influence and considered as the key parameter of the bibdm which donates the high accuracy of the results 6 conclusion in the present study a dynamic model bibdm of growth excretion and predation processes for benthic invertebrates is developed the bibdm is coupled to hydrodynamic and bed surface morphology models which could take into account a variety of hydro environment factors then the proposed model is applied to simulate the biomass of corbicula fluminea in lake taihu and the temporal process and spatial distribution of corbicula fluminea are well reproduced the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the benthic invertebrate biomass exhibits highly correlation with the ripple height with a correlation coefficient of 0 81 indicating that the riverbed morphology is the important influence factor on benthic invertebrates and the spatial distribution of the biomass is mainly driven by bed surface morphology 2 comparing the growth processes of benthic invertebrates under different bed morphology surface conditions it is found that the riverbed morphology characterizes would significantly affect the maximum biomass the period to reach the maximum value is also affected by the riverbed morphology but not as obvious as the effect of temperature time process moreover the model is highly capable of being applied to simulate other species with considering appropriate environmental parameters in the growth equation the model can also be used to predict the benthic invertebrate biomass variation under the changing
