23335,oblique water entry of different marine structures involve several two phase fluid dynamics phenomena including splash asymmetrical cavity formation and cavity collapse that have been observed in experimental work correct prediction of the applied forces and moments that define the trajectory during water entry is dependent on precise simulation of the mentioned fluid dynamic effects this study investigates and compares the performance of three different algorithms i e a finite volume eulerian b finite difference eulerian c arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale applied in different software codes in order to achieve this goal an experimental task including normal and oblique water entry cases was defined to provide the data set for comparing and verifying performance of these different software packages these experiments have been designed and implemented concentrating on oblique water entry of blunted nose models with various moment of inertia center of gravity and other dynamical properties that affect the water entry problem verification of computational results of the three software are carried out through comparison with the experimental results in two stages firstly the fluid dynamics of splash cavity formation and its collapse for normal water entry of a sphere are compared between experimental and three software numerical results it is shown that two of the codes i e a and b as defined above cannot even predict the much simpler problem of normal water entry problem therefore fail to be a candidate for the more involved problem of oblique water entry i e the second stage of the comparison through comparison with the experimental results it is shown that abaqus software i e the c algorithm is the most capable software among the three compared codes for the correct simulation of the involved fluid dynamic effects therefore the abaqus software is applied for simulation of oblique water entry problem in the second stage and the results are compared with experiments upon comparison of various experimental results with this software output it is shown that the numerical algorithm in this computer program ale can be reliably used to simulate this kind of fluid solid interaction problem and determine the impact forces and moments more precisely even in the extreme angles and velocities of water entry problems keywords water entry oblique impact truncated nose body fluid solid interaction ale method 1 introduction applications of water entry and water impact problems cover areas such as study of applied hydrodynamic forces and moments in the course of design of the diverse marine vehicles such as ships vessels and flying boats problems of water entry and water impact have been the subject of the research as early as the pioneering work of von karman in 1929 von karman 1929 who were concerned with the hydrodynamics of a landing seaplane however the majority of analytic oblique water entry solutions considered were either two dimensional or axisymmetric later on application of potential solution of free surface impact problems for wedges were included in the early work of garabedian 1953 and in a later study of xu et al 2008 as a combined analytical and boundary element method for oblique entry problems they derived the similarity solution under the assumption that the leading and trailing free surfaces separate from the wedge sides either perpendicularly or tangentially a recent review article introduced the work in this area using inviscid incompressible model and bem for fluid solid interactions sun and wu 2014 although the early works concentrated on the extension of the first analytical approaches later on experiments played an important role in illuminating this complex fluid solid interaction problem for wedges and spheres greenhow 1987 a comprehensive experimental investigation of rigid body slamming was performed by dropping flat wedge shaped models with small dead rise angles chuang 1966 a full scale water entry test of a pointed nose objects was conducted and the results were compared with scaled model tests equipped with onboard miniature data acquisition system cole et al 1993 impact loading of prismatic bodies were measured and the effect of tail slamming was studied new et al 1993 more complicated situations such as water entry of spinning spheres and water entry of rigid and deformable bodies were studied by truscott and techet 2009 and nila et al 2012 respectively although more expensive and complex test facility were required in these kind of experimental work the effects of different nose shapes on the trajectory of the projectiles entering water surface are studied in zhang et al 2017 a series of experiments with piv technique was performed for an oblique water entry of wedge shape body russo et al 2018 experimental results with an oblique impact of elliptic paraboloid confirmed the wagner theory yves marie 2014 based on this experiment the theory was developed for the body which can move freely in its six degrees of freedom and may also change its shape over time scolan and korobkin 2015 oblique water entry problem is so complicated that its investigation cannot be handled using analytical methods alone without simplification of the actual problem although various experiments have been reported however oblique water entry of blunted nose objects covering a wide area change of parameters had not been observed in the literature that is carried out in this investigation full scale experiments are not usually feasible due to being expensive and time consuming and scaled model tests are limited by lack of full similarity and inherent limitation of the test equipment therefore resort to numerical simulation is an attracting remedy for the blunt body oblique entry problems which is further studied in the following during and after 80 s numerical simulations also provided grounds for studying this problem ref seddon and moatamedi 2006 gives a through survey of this subject from 1925 to 2003 emphasizing on water impact of aerospace structures one of the main suggestions of seddon and moatamedi 2006 for future investigation in this area was that more experimental and numerical work in oblique water entry is required which is taken in this paper general features of water entry problems were explained in laverty 2005 that will be explained in the next section a recent application of oblique water entry of a circular cylinder body was presented in colicchio et al 2009 application of the msc dytran software for prediction of water entry and trajectory of a blunt nose body was also shown in donea et al 2004 the basis and formulation of arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method as a robust method for dealing with fluid structure problems is comprehensively discussed in this reference analytical derivation of hydrodynamic loading of oblique entry of solid spheres was presented in miloh 1991 two and three dimensional study of normal and oblique entry of simple objects were numerically studied in engle and lewis 2003 kleefsman et al 2005 yang and qiu 2011 2012 yoon and semenov 2009 moore et al 2012 gu et al 2014 iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 abraham et al 2014 however the study of oblique entry of a full nose body in a general situation is not so frequent and wei et al 2012 is one of the rare references in this regard in the above mentioned numerical investigations various discretization methods i e lagrangian and eulerian finite differences finite volumes and finite elements have been used although normal water impact has been explained in more detail in the literature different aspects of oblique water entry problems remain uncovered thoroughly and precise trajectory prediction of the objects seems out of reach or unexplored at least moreover the forces generated during initial moments of water entry and water impact problems can be significantly large and vary according to the shape of the body nose surface properties angle of entry impact velocity and fluid properties such as density viscosity and surface tension to a lesser extent the resulting flow field and the impact forces are also significantly dependent on water free surface deformations and its disintegration with a full nonlinear inter relationship therefore prediction of subsequent body motion is quite difficult due to fluid solid interactions especially when phenomenon such as bounce occurs rabiee et al 2011 this is one of the incentives of the researchers to concentrate on this problem during past decades presently more precise simulation of this problem looks feasible and performance of different numerical algorithms and codes if computed and compared would be valuable and useful additionally using the proper algorithm and the code more understanding of the flow field and body behavior would be provided in water entry conditions that have not studied yet however the choice of the proper numerical method for thorough investigation of such problems remains to be answered this paper is focused on the study of oblique water entry of a blunted nose body at various angles and conditions experimentally and numerically to determine the appropriate software for the correct simulation of such fluid solid interaction problems hence a set of comprehensive experiments have been taken to evaluate the performance of the hopeful code although for the sake of space only some typical comparisons with experimental results have been presented in the article the overall agreement of the chosen software with widely scattered experiments show the appropriateness of the choice 1 1 general features of normal and oblique water entry problems free surface body impact would lead to complex hydrodynamic events such as spray formation air bubble formation enclosure of the water surface and air bubble and finally detachment of the air bubble shown in fig 1 rabiee et al 2010 different phases of flow establishment as explained in laverty 2005 are shock wave phase flow formation phase phase of open and enclosed bubble and the final phase of complete wetness generally water impact problems can be divided into two major categories normal water impact and oblique water impact each of which has its own characteristics in the moment of impact fig 1 a sudden change of pressure gradient is formed on the water surface and the water near and under the body is accelerated downwards body going down in the water air bubble is formed behind it and this bubble is drawn into the water fig 1 b and c spray also would appear on the surface with variable velocity components in a way that the beginning of spray would be radial and outwards fig 1 b and c and by going upwards it moves radially inward fig 1 c and d until water level is connected above the bubble with a dome shape this phenomenon is called surface enclosure yang and qiu 2011 enclosure is one of the most important events during bubble growth and it has an important role in the formation of next bubble this enclosed bubble begins to grow longitudinally and then hydrostatic and dynamic pressure of the surrounding fluid would cause necking fig 1 c and finally rupture fig 1 e of the bubble laverty 2005 initial velocity of spray for low water entry velocities of sphere has been reported equal to 95 percent of impact velocity rabiee et al 2010 however during the oblique impact of a blunted nose object with water surface additional complexities arise 1 in the early impact time water droplets began to splash outward not necessarily tangent to the nose especially for the truncated nose objects water splashes in forward direction fig 2 a 2 the flow starts on the nose surface however it separates detaches in a short distance fig 2 b and 2 c in this region water bulges outward from the nose and the exerted hydrodynamic force is significantly affected by this part of spray 3 subsequently splash sheath would be formed fig 2 c and 2 d this part is the main part of the spray which is connected to water surface and the position of formation of meniscus in the edge of air bubble spray sheath would not have any effect on the body motion after its formation it would not affect shape of bubble until it causes the bubble to be closed 4 the water displaced by the forming air cavity is presented by the spray and some of it is relevant to the raise of water level in a vast surface 5 under some circumstances of water entry bubble enclosure would lead to formation of jet which can be raised to a considerable height above the water laverty 2005 about oblique water entry of bodies with blunt nose it has been proved experimentally that some of the water forming the spray is transferred from still water surface may 1975 after complete submergence of nose water flow would start to separate in a certain angle from the nose but it would not be separated from the main body this would connect bubble wall to the spray sheath under common circumstances surface tension would prevent spray sheath rupture and no hole would be seen in the splash sheath after complete submergence of nose since no extra water would be added to the spray it would get thinner because it is simultaneously stretched due to acceleration in the experimental work performed in this article all of the mentioned events have been observed in fig 2 a to 2 e different stages of water entry of constructed model with truncated nose can be seen 2 experimental tests 2 1 model specification to validate numerical results of oblique impact experiments were designed to throw a variable property model fig 3 and investigate water impact under various conditions in this way a set of test results is provided for comparison with and evaluation of different software results a three piece model made of polyethylene prepared fig 4 to control three variables mass center of mass location and moment of inertia a plumb bob is provided in the cylindrical part of model the bob moving on a steel rod which is threaded in order to set the desired values of the parameters properties of different pieces used in construction of the model are mentioned in table 1 the relevant angles and body coordinates for the following discussion are shown in fig 5 2 2 experimental setup these experiments are performed in a water tank with dimensions of 2500 1200 1200 mm containing still water the shooting mechanism rotates up to 90 therefore different entry pitch angles from tangential up to normal to water surface may be chosen an aluminum cylinder connected to the end of the model with the length of 3 cm fig 4 connects the model to the projecting system that uses compressed air different value of model entry angle velocity magnitude can be chosen by adjusting the projector direction and pressure however exact value of these parameters plus angle of attack can be determined from trajectory data extracted from the images using a high speed video camera sony fs700 linear and angular position of the model can be extracted from different frames of the movie this camera is capable of recording video with speed of 800 frames per second with hd quality that proved to be precise enough for the required accuracy of the results as discussed in following sections subsequently forces and moments acting on the model can be computed from these data as will be explained later in order to have a comprehensive set of tests covering various situations in water entry twenty one test cases have been carried out with different values of mass center of mass location moment of inertia angle of water entry angle of attack and impact velocities some of the conditions of the experiments are briefly presented in table 2 as can be seen from the last 3 columns of this table different values of impact velocity entry angle and angle of attack of the model are produced using different parameters for the flexible model e g plumb bob weight and location ejection model velocity as explained above thanks to the flexible 3 piece model that made various entry conditions mentioned in table 2 possible as an example different frames at different times of test no 5 are shown in fig 6 in this figure all of the stages of water entry including moment of impact onset of water splash quality of spray formation its development and the way air bubble is drawn into the water can be clearly seen 2 3 image processing recorded movies have been imported into tracker image processing software this software can import different formats of videos and converts them into a set of constituting frames and subsequently coordinates of special marker points can be measured using the software tools defining a scale of for the pictures coordinates of center of mass xcg ycg and angular pitch rotations θ of the body with respect to horizontal direction can be measured at different times as shown in the software output window at the left side of fig 7 after classifying the experimental results in three matrices of xcg ycg and θ at different times and various test cases of table 2 the data should be filtered and the velocities and accelerations be extracted three runs carried out for each test case of table 2 and the average of these three runs xcg ycg and θ are reported as the measured values at each instant of time inevitably some deviations from the average values would occur that would be a measure of experimental errors although different effects are present as the error source in comparison of linear and angular positions between experiments and extracted results however the main source is due to displacement and angular position extraction errors taken from the images during the water entry an estimation of this error can be obtained from different runs of the same experiment keeping all conditions constant the variations of x horizontal and θ pitch coordinates for three runs of the test number 5 at different times are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively the vertical model position z varies similarly as of x and is not presented here the error norm used here is the variance with the following definition for any discrete variable x v a r x 1 n 1 n x i μ where n is the number of discrete values of xi and μ is the average of x in the present case n is equal 3 using this definition for the variables shown in figs 8 and 9 variances for horizontal displacement and pitch angle are 1 2 mm and 0 3 respectively note that the error involved with force and moment comparison between experiments and computations would be higher since it requires taking second derivative of position with time that should be carefully handled see fig 10 initial impact velocity components and pitch and angle of attack are estimated from the few frames collected before the model touching the water surface it should be noted that in all of the tests angular velocities were almost zero before the impact that is quite expectable since the aerodynamic forces and moments are negligible while the solid model is free falling in air with small initial angular velocities see figs 11 and 12 it was realized that no noticeable deviations from the vertical plane xz plane occurs and the proposition of 3 degrees of freedom flight would be satisfactory more results from these experiments are presented and discussed at the final section of results of this paper 3 governing equations different formulation and algorithms for solving the flow and solid governing equations are used in the three software packages the first algorithm is based on finite volume formulation for the governing flow equations and the second uses the finite difference method to discretize the partial differential form of equations as the final chosen software i e abaqus applies the ale method and other codes use finite volume and finite difference eulerian method a general formulation of ale method in integral form would encompass other methods and is presented in the following this general formulation takes both forms of lagrangian and eulerian for different values of the parameter mesh velocity as explained in this section the derivation of these equations is fully explained in donea et al 2004 and the same notation is adopted here the general integral formulation of the ale method in terms of conservation of mass momentum and energy for a material volume v t bounded by a smooth closed surface s t are donea et al 2004 t χ v t ρ d v s t ρ c n d s 0 t χ v t ρ v d v s t ρ vc n d s v t σ ρ b d v t χ v t ρ e d v s t ρ e c n d s v t σ v v ρ b d v where ρ v σ b and e represent density material velocity vector cauchy stress tensor specific body force vector and total specific energy respectively in the above formulation χ denotes the reference coordinates with χ meaning holding the reference coordinates fixed also note that the convective velocity c is c v v ˆ in which v ˆ is equal to the velocity of computational grid in convective terms different forms of the flow equations can be obtained via choosing the appropriate value for v ˆ v c 0 for lagrangian and v ˆ 0 c v for eulerian description also the derivation of partial differential equations from the above integral forms as implemented in the second algorithm is a straight forward application of gauss divergence theorem the above formulation can be applied for discretization of problems in fluid dynamic and solid mechanics as well as the medium in this study is incompressible the third equation that is the energy conservation equation is not relevant and the first equation is simplified accordingly however regarding the unsteady and deforming mesh issues this simplified form of the continuity equation also provides guidelines to the geometric conservation law donea et al 2004 3 1 boundary conditions boundary conditions are description independent and same boundary conditions are used in ale as those applied in lagrangian or eulerian descriptions that are v v d o n γ d n σ t o n γ n where v d and t are proposed boundary velocities and tractions respectively n is the unit outward normal to γ n and γ d and γ n are two separate subsets which define the piecewise smooth boundary of the domain if position of some part of the boundary is unknown e g free surface then a combination of both conditions is required the necessary conditions on the fluid structure interface are a no media particle can pass through it and b stresses must be continuous across the surface the first condition i e the kinematical conditions can be expressed as v v s continuity of velocities where subscript s denotes the solid medium note that continuity of stresses is guaranteed if using the weak form of momentum equations donea et al 2004 4 numerical simulations 4 1 a comparison between three software results in this research the results of three different cfd software packages are compared in order to choose the most suitable one there are several software available to solve water impact problem numerically discretizing the domain by generating computational grid cell or elements and discretizing the governing integral or differential equations expressed in eulerian or lagrangin descriptions by different numerical approaches including finite difference finite volume or finite element methods specifications of the tested software are presented in table 3 the strategy for choosing between three software include testing them against normal water entry experiments and investigate if they succeed modeling the main flow behavior as the first step at the second step the quantitative check of the results of the candidate software with experiments would be carried out for first step we choose the normal impact of a two dimensional cylinder as observed by von karman 1929 and colicchio et al 2009 while a 30 cm diameter and 40 cm in length cylinder with a specific gravity equal to 0 62 impacts the water surface the impact speed is 2 55 m s and flow pattern object trajectory and velocity have been reported during water entry this impact problem has been modeled in the three mentioned software and the results of mesh independent solution in terms of phase contours that differentiate between water air and solid are presented as follows the mesh study performed on three different grids from 1 million to 2 million cells and the measures of convergence were based on displacement and body velocities the third mesh is chosen as the mesh independent solution as shown in the above figures software 1 cannot model the splash and cavity formation precisely neither in laminar nor in turbulent solutions in the laminar flow the splash has not been formed and no jet exists although addition of turbulence model k ε two equation model has forced a cavity to be formed but the general shape of the free surface and splash does not match the experimental data in software 2 however the agreement is getting better the free surface shape has become more accurate while still the splash shape is not correctly presented note that again this is a turbulent solution using a two equation model see fig 13 but software 3 can predict the flow pattern more accurately compared to the other two software results this program with the help of finite element formulation and coupled eulerian lagrangian approach is able to predict the correct behavior of flow a closer look at fig 14 compares the 3 software differences with experiments in more detail the latter figure compares experimental and different numerical flow pattern at t 0 1s as can be seen in fig 14 a the first software cannot predict any separation point and therefore air cavity in the laminar case fig 14 b shows the same software but in turbulent case predicts wrong separation point and no jet like splash which is not acceptable at all same situation prevails for the second software i e wrong separation point but with more damping of the jet fig 14 c fig 14 d shows that only the third software has the capability to realize the phenomena involved with normal water impact problems i e correct separation position and jet like splash around the body it should be mentioned that this agreement prevails with the experiments carried out by the present author shown in fig 1 and reported in rabiee et al 2010 the conclusion would be that some codes cannot even predict the much simpler problem of normal water entry problem therefore fail to be a candidate for more involved problem of oblique water entry this discrepancy of two codes includes the inability to model the basic and important events such as separation point of the free jet the water spray and the size and collapse of the cavity through comparison with the experimental results it is shown that the third software i e abaqus software is the most capable software among the three compared codes regarding the above conclusion the third software is used to study the oblique entry problem presented in the former section and comparison of the results with experiments will be presented although numerical simulations of several cases of table 2 are carried out only one of them is discussed in detail here for the sake of brevity the comparison and more experimental test case are presented afterwards 5 comparison of numerical and experimental results for oblique water entry numerical simulation has been performed for some of the conducted test cases shown in table 2 in this section results of the numerical simulation and experiment of test no 3 are compared the test conditions include the entry velocity of 5 7 m s angle of entry of 10 and angle of attack of 2 3 the mesh independent solution obtained after increasing the mesh numbers from three million in three steps and reaching 6 000 000 eulerian cells for water domain that includes 15000 tetrahedral cells for meshing of the model surface fig 15 the measures of convergence of mesh study are based on displacement and body velocities and the third mesh results is chosen as the mesh independent solution this simulation has been performed on a computer with an 8 core processor intel 3 ghz accommodating 24 gigabytes of memory for approximately 40 h to simulate about 0 08 s of initial motion of the model in the water fig 16 shows numerical solution of free surface and video frames obtained during test no 3 at different times note that a section of volume fraction of different phases are shown as numerical results and are not exactly the free surface shape seen in video frames to provide another view of three dimensional water surface the last frame of fig 16 i e at time 0 055 s is shown differently fig 16 shows that in all instances of time the agreement of splash sheath and separation line on model are satisfactory actually numerical solution agreement with other cases of table 2 remains the same which increases confidence on numerical simulation using this software it should be noticed that other commercial software examined in this study are incapable of producing such agreements with experiments and produced unacceptable results not of any value to be shown here the coordinates of center of mass at different times obtained from experiments and numerical solution for this test case are shown in figs 17 and 18 the agreement is quite good this agreement is also true for the pitch angle vs time shown in fig 19 this figure shows oscillation of experimental pitch data about a time varying mean that is due to errors of extracting pitch data from video frames 0 3 deg rms however the time varying mean predictions using the software are satisfactory 5 1 various test cases of water entry the results of two tests are presented here to provide insight on the effect of change of various parameters involved although only the empirical results are shown the agreement of third software i e the abaqus software remained satisfactory the water entry of body was studied at two froude numbers 8 41 and 16 3 water entry angles of these cases are 30 and the angle of attacks are 0 7 and 9 which contain two extreme cases the results are shown in the following figures as the reference length is constant in the above tests froude number only represents the entry velocity although the variation of the axial force coefficient in fig 20 and fig 23 is almost negligible with of angle of attack but the normal force and pitching moment coefficients shown in above figures vary to some noticeable extent with angle of attack this is true for both froude numbers one interesting point is the remarkable different behavior for positive angle of attack i e 7 deg figs 21 and 22 show normal force and pitching moment coefficients respectively at lower froude number and figs 24 and 25 show the same at higher froude number this distinct behavior at positive angle of attack 7 can be attributed to the vertical force at the nose of the body during the initial stages of water entry that tends to return the body toward the free surface regarding the coordinate system shown in fig 5 these arguments are substantiated with the negative direction of normal force almost upward in figs 21 and 23 and positive pitching moment nose up in figs 22 and 25 although more discussion can be put forward to connect this force change with the flow field we refrain from doing this for the sake of space reminding that other interesting behavior seen among the results also deserve more investigation perhaps in other studies 6 conclusions the main purpose of this study was to determine the suitable numerical software for simulation of oblique water entry of objects to provide data for evaluation of three software codes a set of experiments were designed and implemented concentrating on oblique water entry of a truncated nose model these experiments covered a range of varying parameters such as velocity angle of attack etc it is shown that some codes cannot even predict the much simpler problem of normal water entry of a cylinder therefore fail to be a candidate for more involved problem of oblique water entry this discrepancy of two codes includes the inability to model the basic and important events such as separation point of the free jet the water spray and the size and collapse of the cavity through comparison with the experimental results it is shown that abaqus software is the most capable software among the three compared codes additionally using the abaqus software for the simulation of the oblique water entry problems it was noticed that main flow phenomena effects such as splash and cavity formation and consequently dynamic behavior of the solid body trajectory and force are realistically modeled in addition to qualitative and visual affirmation of phenomena such as splash sheaths of the flow as well as separation of flow on different walls of the body also quantitative affirmations were shown for displacement and angular position of the body therefore it may be concluded that the chosen software is a satisfactory tool for simulations of oblique water entry problems and determination of impact forces moments that resulted in almost identical model trajectory one important area for further investigation is to find the connection between capable physical models and numerical algorithms and real world flow behavior in this kind of problems second important extension that might be useful if this kind of performance evaluation be applied for other problems of fluid body impact such as wave body impact problems

forces are also significantly dependent on water free surface deformations and its disintegration with a full nonlinear inter relationship therefore prediction of subsequent body motion is quite difficult due to fluid solid interactions especially when phenomenon such as bounce occurs rabiee et al 2011 this is one of the incentives of the researchers to concentrate on this problem during past decades presently more precise simulation of this problem looks feasible and performance of different numerical algorithms and codes if computed and compared would be valuable and useful additionally using the proper algorithm and the code more understanding of the flow field and body behavior would be provided in water entry conditions that have not studied yet however the choice of the proper numerical method for thorough investigation of such problems remains to be answered this paper is focused on the study of oblique water entry of a blunted nose body at various angles and conditions experimentally and numerically to determine the appropriate software for the correct simulation of such fluid solid interaction problems hence a set of comprehensive experiments have been taken to evaluate the performance of the hopeful code although for the sake of space only some typical comparisons with experimental results have been presented in the article the overall agreement of the chosen software with widely scattered experiments show the appropriateness of the choice 1 1 general features of normal and oblique water entry problems free surface body impact would lead to complex hydrodynamic events such as spray formation air bubble formation enclosure of the water surface and air bubble and finally detachment of the air bubble shown in fig 1 rabiee et al 2010 different phases of flow establishment as explained in laverty 2005 are shock wave phase flow formation phase phase of open and enclosed bubble and the final phase of complete wetness generally water impact problems can be divided into two major categories normal water impact and oblique water impact each of which has its own characteristics in the moment of impact fig 1 a sudden change of pressure gradient is formed on the water surface and the water near and under the body is accelerated downwards body going down in the water air bubble is formed behind it and this bubble is drawn into the water fig 1 b and c spray also would appear on the surface with variable velocity components in a way that the beginning of spray would be radial and outwards fig 1 b and c and by going upwards it moves radially inward fig 1 c and d until water level is connected above the bubble with a dome shape this phenomenon is called surface enclosure yang and qiu 2011 enclosure is one of the most important events during bubble growth and it has an important role in the formation of next bubble this enclosed bubble begins to grow longitudinally and then hydrostatic and dynamic pressure of the surrounding fluid would cause necking fig 1 c and finally rupture fig 1 e of the bubble laverty 2005 initial velocity of spray for low water entry velocities of sphere has been reported equal to 95 percent of impact velocity rabiee et al 2010 however during the oblique impact of a blunted nose object with water surface additional complexities arise 1 in the early impact time water droplets began to splash outward not necessarily tangent to the nose especially for the truncated nose objects water splashes in forward direction fig 2 a 2 the flow starts on the nose surface however it separates detaches in a short distance fig 2 b and 2 c in this region water bulges outward from the nose and the exerted hydrodynamic force is significantly affected by this part of spray 3 subsequently splash sheath would be formed fig 2 c and 2 d this part is the main part of the spray which is connected to water surface and the position of formation of meniscus in the edge of air bubble spray sheath would not have any effect on the body motion after its formation it would not affect shape of bubble until it causes the bubble to be closed 4 the water displaced by the forming air cavity is presented by the spray and some of it is relevant to the raise of water level in a vast surface 5 under some circumstances of water entry bubble enclosure would lead to formation of jet which can be raised to a considerable height above the water laverty 2005 about oblique water entry of bodies with blunt nose it has been proved experimentally that some of the water forming the spray is transferred from still water surface may 1975 after complete submergence of nose water flow would start to separate in a certain angle from the nose but it would not be separated from the main body this would connect bubble wall to the spray sheath under common circumstances surface tension would prevent spray sheath rupture and no hole would be seen in the splash sheath after complete submergence of nose since no extra water would be added to the spray it would get thinner because it is simultaneously stretched due to acceleration in the experimental work performed in this article all of the mentioned events have been observed in fig 2 a to 2 e different stages of water entry of constructed model with truncated nose can be seen 2 experimental tests 2 1 model specification to validate numerical results of oblique impact experiments were designed to throw a variable property model fig 3 and investigate water impact under various conditions in this way a set of test results is provided for comparison with and evaluation of different software results a three piece model made of polyethylene prepared fig 4 to control three variables mass center of mass location and moment of inertia a plumb bob is provided in the cylindrical part of model the bob moving on a steel rod which is threaded in order to set the desired values of the parameters properties of different pieces used in construction of the model are mentioned in table 1 the relevant angles and body coordinates for the following discussion are shown in fig 5 2 2 experimental setup these experiments are performed in a water tank with dimensions of 2500 1200 1200 mm containing still water the shooting mechanism rotates up to 90 therefore different entry pitch angles from tangential up to normal to water surface may be chosen an aluminum cylinder connected to the end of the model with the length of 3 cm fig 4 connects the model to the projecting system that uses compressed air different value of model entry angle velocity magnitude can be chosen by adjusting the projector direction and pressure however exact value of these parameters plus angle of attack can be determined from trajectory data extracted from the images using a high speed video camera sony fs700 linear and angular position of the model can be extracted from different frames of the movie this camera is capable of recording video with speed of 800 frames per second with hd quality that proved to be precise enough for the required accuracy of the results as discussed in following sections subsequently forces and moments acting on the model can be computed from these data as will be explained later in order to have a comprehensive set of tests covering various situations in water entry twenty one test cases have been carried out with different values of mass center of mass location moment of inertia angle of water entry angle of attack and impact velocities some of the conditions of the experiments are briefly presented in table 2 as can be seen from the last 3 columns of this table different values of impact velocity entry angle and angle of attack of the model are produced using different parameters for the flexible model e g plumb bob weight and location ejection model velocity as explained above thanks to the flexible 3 piece model that made various entry conditions mentioned in table 2 possible as an example different frames at different times of test no 5 are shown in fig 6 in this figure all of the stages of water entry including moment of impact onset of water splash quality of spray formation its development and the way air bubble is drawn into the water can be clearly seen 2 3 image processing recorded movies have been imported into tracker image processing software this software can import different formats of videos and converts them into a set of constituting frames and subsequently coordinates of special marker points can be measured using the software tools defining a scale of for the pictures coordinates of center of mass xcg ycg and angular pitch rotations θ of the body with respect to horizontal direction can be measured at different times as shown in the software output window at the left side of fig 7 after classifying the experimental results in three matrices of xcg ycg and θ at different times and various test cases of table 2 the data should be filtered and the velocities and accelerations be extracted three runs carried out for each test case of table 2 and the average of these three runs xcg ycg and θ are reported as the measured values at each instant of time inevitably some deviations from the average values would occur that would be a measure of experimental errors although different effects are present as the error source in comparison of linear and angular positions between experiments and extracted results however the main source is due to displacement and angular position extraction errors taken from the images during the water entry an estimation of this error can be obtained from different runs of the same experiment keeping all conditions constant the variations of x horizontal and θ pitch coordinates for three runs of the test number 5 at different times are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively the vertical model position z varies similarly as of x and is not presented here the error norm used here is the variance with the following definition for any discrete variable x v a r x 1 n 1 n x i μ where n is the number of discrete values of xi and μ is the average of x in the present case n is equal 3 using this definition for the variables shown in figs 8 and 9 variances for horizontal displacement and pitch angle are 1 2 mm and 0 3 respectively note that the error involved with force and moment comparison between experiments and computations would be higher since it requires taking second derivative of position with time that should be carefully handled see fig 10 initial impact velocity components and pitch and angle of attack are estimated from the few frames collected before the model touching the water surface it should be noted that in all of the tests angular velocities were almost zero before the impact that is quite expectable since the aerodynamic forces and moments are negligible while the solid model is free falling in air with small initial angular velocities see figs 11 and 12 it was realized that no noticeable deviations from the vertical plane xz plane occurs and the proposition of 3 degrees of freedom flight would be satisfactory more results from these experiments are presented and discussed at the final section of results of this paper 3 governing equations different formulation and algorithms for solving the flow and solid governing equations are used in the three software packages the first algorithm is based on finite volume formulation for the governing flow equations and the second uses the finite difference method to discretize the partial differential form of equations as the final chosen software i e abaqus applies the ale method and other codes use finite volume and finite difference eulerian method a general formulation of ale method in integral form would encompass other methods and is presented in the following this general formulation takes both forms of lagrangian and eulerian for different values of the parameter mesh velocity as explained in this section the derivation of these equations is fully explained in donea et al 2004 and the same notation is adopted here the general integral formulation of the ale method in terms of conservation of mass momentum and energy for a material volume v t bounded by a smooth closed surface s t are donea et al 2004 t χ v t ρ d v s t ρ c n d s 0 t χ v t ρ v d v s t ρ vc n d s v t σ ρ b d v t χ v t ρ e d v s t ρ e c n d s v t σ v v ρ b d v where ρ v σ b and e represent density material velocity vector cauchy stress tensor specific body force vector and total specific energy respectively in the above formulation χ denotes the reference coordinates with χ meaning holding the reference coordinates fixed also note that the convective velocity c is c v v ˆ in which v ˆ is equal to the velocity of computational grid in convective terms different forms of the flow equations can be obtained via choosing the appropriate value for v ˆ v c 0 for lagrangian and v ˆ 0 c v for eulerian description also the derivation of partial differential equations from the above integral forms as implemented in the second algorithm is a straight forward application of gauss divergence theorem the above formulation can be applied for discretization of problems in fluid dynamic and solid mechanics as well as the medium in this study is incompressible the third equation that is the energy conservation equation is not relevant and the first equation is simplified accordingly however regarding the unsteady and deforming mesh issues this simplified form of the continuity equation also provides guidelines to the geometric conservation law donea et al 2004 3 1 boundary conditions boundary conditions are description independent and same boundary conditions are used in ale as those applied in lagrangian or eulerian descriptions that are v v d o n γ d n σ t o n γ n where v d and t are proposed boundary velocities and tractions respectively n is the unit outward normal to γ n and γ d and γ n are two separate subsets which define the piecewise smooth boundary of the domain if position of some part of the boundary is unknown e g free surface then a combination of both conditions is required the necessary conditions on the fluid structure interface are a no media particle can pass through it and b stresses must be continuous across the surface the first condition i e the kinematical conditions can be expressed as v v s continuity of velocities where subscript s denotes the solid medium note that continuity of stresses is guaranteed if using the weak form of momentum equations donea et al 2004 4 numerical simulations 4 1 a comparison between three software results in this research the results of three different cfd software packages are compared in order to choose the most suitable one there are several software available to solve water impact problem numerically discretizing the domain by generating computational grid cell or elements and discretizing the governing integral or differential equations expressed in eulerian or lagrangin descriptions by different numerical approaches including finite difference finite volume or finite element methods specifications of the tested software are presented in table 3 the strategy for choosing between three software include testing them against normal water entry experiments and investigate if they succeed modeling the main flow behavior as the first step at the second step the quantitative check of the results of the candidate software with experiments would be carried out for first step we choose the normal impact of a two dimensional cylinder as observed by von karman 1929 and colicchio et al 2009 while a 30 cm diameter and 40 cm in length cylinder with a specific gravity equal to 0 62 impacts the water surface the impact speed is 2 55 m s and flow pattern object trajectory and velocity have been reported during water entry this impact problem has been modeled in the three mentioned software and the results of mesh independent solution in terms of phase contours that differentiate between water air and solid are presented as follows the mesh study performed on three different grids from 1 million to 2 million cells and the measures of convergence were based on displacement and body velocities the third mesh is chosen as the mesh independent solution as shown in the above figures software 1 cannot model the splash and cavity formation precisely neither in laminar nor in turbulent solutions in the laminar flow the splash has not been formed and no jet exists although addition of turbulence model k ε two equation model has forced a cavity to be formed but the general shape of the free surface and splash does not match the experimental data in software 2 however the agreement is getting better the free surface shape has become more accurate while still the splash shape is not correctly presented note that again this is a turbulent solution using a two equation model see fig 13 but software 3 can predict the flow pattern more accurately compared to the other two software results this program with the help of finite element formulation and coupled eulerian lagrangian approach is able to predict the correct behavior of flow a closer look at fig 14 compares the 3 software differences with experiments in more detail the latter figure compares experimental and different numerical flow pattern at t 0 1s as can be seen in fig 14 a the first software cannot predict any separation point and therefore air cavity in the laminar case fig 14 b shows the same software but in turbulent case predicts wrong separation point and no jet like splash which is not acceptable at all same situation prevails for the second software i e wrong separation point but with more damping of the jet fig 14 c fig 14 d shows that only the third software has the capability to realize the phenomena involved with normal water impact problems i e correct separation position and jet like splash around the body it should be mentioned that this agreement prevails with the experiments carried out by the present author shown in fig 1 and reported in rabiee et al 2010 the conclusion would be that some codes cannot even predict the much simpler problem of normal water entry problem therefore fail to be a candidate for more involved problem of oblique water entry this discrepancy of two codes includes the inability to model the basic and important events such as separation point of the free jet the water spray and the size and collapse of the cavity through comparison with the experimental results it is shown that the third software i e abaqus software is the most capable software among the three compared codes regarding the above conclusion the third software is used to study the oblique entry problem presented in the former section and comparison of the results with experiments will be presented although numerical simulations of several cases of table 2 are carried out only one of them is discussed in detail here for the sake of brevity the comparison and more experimental test case are presented afterwards 5 comparison of numerical and experimental results for oblique water entry numerical simulation has been performed for some of the conducted test cases shown in table 2 in this section results of the numerical simulation and experiment of test no 3 are compared the test conditions include the entry velocity of 5 7 m s angle of entry of 10 and angle of attack of 2 3 the mesh independent solution obtained after increasing the mesh numbers from three million in three steps and reaching 6 000 000 eulerian cells for water domain that includes 15000 tetrahedral cells for meshing of the model surface fig 15 the measures of convergence of mesh study are based on displacement and body velocities and the third mesh results is chosen as the mesh independent solution this simulation has been performed on a computer with an 8 core processor intel 3 ghz accommodating 24 gigabytes of memory for approximately 40 h to simulate about 0 08 s of initial motion of the model in the water fig 16 shows numerical solution of free surface and video frames obtained during test no 3 at different times note that a section of volume fraction of different phases are shown as numerical results and are not exactly the free surface shape seen in video frames to provide another view of three dimensional water surface the last frame of fig 16 i e at time 0 055 s is shown differently fig 16 shows that in all instances of time the agreement of splash sheath and separation line on model are satisfactory actually numerical solution agreement with other cases of table 2 remains the same which increases confidence on numerical simulation using this software it should be noticed that other commercial software examined in this study are incapable of producing such agreements with experiments and produced unacceptable results not of any value to be shown here the coordinates of center of mass at different times obtained from experiments and numerical solution for this test case are shown in figs 17 and 18 the agreement is quite good this agreement is also true for the pitch angle vs time shown in fig 19 this figure shows oscillation of experimental pitch data about a time varying mean that is due to errors of extracting pitch data from video frames 0 3 deg rms however the time varying mean predictions using the software are satisfactory 5 1 various test cases of water entry the results of two tests are presented here to provide insight on the effect of change of various parameters involved although only the empirical results are shown the agreement of third software i e the abaqus software remained satisfactory the water entry of body was studied at two froude numbers 8 41 and 16 3 water entry angles of these cases are 30 and the angle of attacks are 0 7 and 9 which contain two extreme cases the results are shown in the following figures as the reference length is constant in the above tests froude number only represents the entry velocity although the variation of the axial force coefficient in fig 20 and fig 23 is almost negligible with of angle of attack but the normal force and pitching moment coefficients shown in above figures vary to some noticeable extent with angle of attack this is true for both froude numbers one interesting point is the remarkable different behavior for positive angle of attack i e 7 deg figs 21 and 22 show normal force and pitching moment coefficients respectively at lower froude number and figs 24 and 25 show the same at higher froude number this distinct behavior at positive angle of attack 7 can be attributed to the vertical force at the nose of the body during the initial stages of water entry that tends to return the body toward the free surface regarding the coordinate system shown in fig 5 these arguments are substantiated with the negative direction of normal force almost upward in figs 21 and 23 and positive pitching moment nose up in figs 22 and 25 although more discussion can be put forward to connect this force change with the flow field we refrain from doing this for the sake of space reminding that other interesting behavior seen among the results also deserve more investigation perhaps in other studies 6 conclusions the main purpose of this study was to determine the suitable numerical software for simulation of oblique water entry of objects to provide data for evaluation of three software codes a set of experiments were designed and implemented concentrating on oblique water entry of a truncated nose model these experiments covered a range of varying parameters such as velocity angle of attack etc it is shown that some codes cannot even predict the much simpler problem of normal water entry of a cylinder therefore fail to be a candidate for more involved problem of oblique water entry this discrepancy of two codes includes the inability to model the basic and important events such as separation point of the free jet the water spray and the size and collapse of the cavity through comparison with the experimental results it is shown that abaqus software is the most capable software among the three compared codes additionally using the abaqus software for the simulation of the oblique water entry problems it was noticed that main flow phenomena effects such as splash and cavity formation and consequently dynamic behavior of the solid body trajectory and force are realistically modeled in addition to qualitative and visual affirmation of phenomena such as splash sheaths of the flow as well as separation of flow on different walls of the body also quantitative affirmations were shown for displacement and angular position of the body therefore it may be concluded that the chosen software is a satisfactory tool for simulations of oblique water entry problems and determination of impact forces moments that resulted in almost identical model trajectory one important area for further investigation is to find the connection between capable physical models and numerical algorithms and real world flow behavior in this kind of problems second important extension that might be useful if this kind of performance evaluation be applied for other problems of fluid body impact such as wave body impact problems 
23336,in this paper we extend the non breaking second order corrected focused wave experimental results of sriram et al 2015 in a numerical wave tank based on hos in the presence of wind the wind is modelled using the modified jeffrey s sheltering mechanism kharif et al 2008 we take care to preserve the consistency of application of pressure terms in the hybrid stokesian hos formulations when applying wind we confirm the results of kharif et al 2008 i e the focusing points in presence of wind show an amplification of the measure wave heights although no discernible shifting of focusing location is observed however compared to kharif et al 2008 the sheltering mechanism is found to be very weak since it depends on exceedance of a threshold slope based on constant steepness or constant amplitude spectrum the energy flux to local phase celerity b x both in absence and presence of the aforementioned wind model for the detection of onset of wave breaking barthelemy et al 2015b saket et al 2017b are reported moreover in the absence of wind if b x is used as parameter the onset of wave breaking then for intermediate water wave groups its threshold should be close to 0 9 computations based on kurnia and van groesen 2014 keywords focused waves jeffrey s sheltering high order spectral method onset of breaking 1 introduction a reality for all the port facilities ship and ocean structures is that they have to be designed for extreme wave loads due to their expected periodical exposure to the extreme wave events as such the investigation of the occurrence of extreme wave events is a topic of active research with multiple interesting facets and lines of inquiry one of the many reasons for the occurence of extreme wave events may be due to the result of focusing on wave energy on a very narrow area of the sea surface recent advances in satellite imagery rosenthal and lehner 2008 and post facto analysis of the numerous past disasters has confirmed that there is indeed a presence of very high steep waves occasionally emerging from the seas and then disappearing not only are they found in a natural sea state but also in shallow waters as has recently been confirmed nikolkina and didenkulova 2011 this class of extreme wave events based on wave wave interactions is typically referred to as a freak or rogue waves in the literature these are waves or wave groups that may not necessarily be associated with rough weather conditions however some of these conditions can create a steep wave event of considerable elevation lasting for a very short duration this sudden magnified elevation has led to many documented accidents on the other hand the steepness of the rogue wave amplifies the effect of nonlinearity in wave structure interactions hence a study of nonlinearity is pertinent in such cases kharif and pelinovsky 2003 nonlinearity in water waves can be classified in two forms strong and weak strong nonlinearity in water waves leads to enhanced role of viscosity and is routinely associated with wave breaking however a great deal of water wave behaviour can be explained by weak form of nonlinear equations in fact weak nonlinearity typically precludes strongly nonlinear behaviour rainey 2007 the weakly nonlinear form of wave equations is based upon the representation of the solution as an asymptotically ordered series the ordering is based upon a steepness parameter representative of the steepness of the physical wave in such a scenario the dominant low order solutions forces the high order solutions through a mode coupling approach in this framework of weak nonlinearity freak or rogue wave mechanisms have been studied in this paper in general for the safe and economic operation of coastal structures and various sea going vessels these structures must be tested for the response under extreme waves particularly the freak ones usually this testing is to be done in a wave flume this way the concerned mechanism is isolated and simulated in the wave flume for a detailed study of the generated extreme waves and their effects the mechanisms of such focusing can be of following type viz geometrical spatio temporal dispersion bathymetry wave current interactions wind effects modulation instabilities etc kharif and pelinovsky 2003 however it must be realised that the generation of the extreme waves in the flume is not a trivial issue even in the absence of the structure the generation and study of kinematics of these extreme waves is complex due to the nonlinearity involved moreover one has to wisely decide whether to simulate the regular wave conditions or random wave tests with different wave components in a wave spectrum the former doesn t necessarily represent the extreme wave events while the latter does but only if the test is long enough this is because in the random case the extreme cases occur very rarely in the time series meaning that realisation of the extreme events is possible only for a very long simulation duration this requirement means that one should employ a combination of passive and active wave absorption control techniques to minimise reflection at the far walls away from the wavemaker in the wave flume grilli and horrillo 1997 among the many mechanisms for freak waves studied by various workers the most common class of mechanisms studied is spatio temporal dispersion kharif and pelinovsky 2003 this class aims to produce a localised focusing in the physical space and time three variants of this class have been reported by chaplin 1996 viz group celerity method reverse dispersion method and phase speed celerity method each of these variants have their merits and de merits with respect to their effectiveness in the type of wave groups they form and are employed for we refer the reader to chaplin 1996 for a detailed review in this paper however we employ the third variant i e the phase speed method due to its simplicity and ease of replication this method can be easily simulated in the wave flume this method was first proposed by longuet higgins who specified a range of wave components primary components and synchronized their initial phases in such a way to produce a constructive interference at a given spatial location and a specified time this constructive interference focuses the various components energies thus producing an extreme wave event subsequently rapp and melville 1990 used this mechanism for their experimental investigation of breaking waves many other workers have used this mechanism for breaking process or its interactions in finite water depth kway et al 1998 adcock and taylor 2009 li et al 2015 kharif and pelinovsky 2003 as well for a recent review of breaking wave process with this mechanism the reader is referred to perlin et al 2013 although the abovementioned mechanism is based upon a linear constructive interference due to concentration of energy in the focused area a local rise in the steepness is expected this increase in turn accentuates the nonlinear interactions that were otherwise suppressed in the linear case baldock et al 1996 have shown that the nonlinear interactions among the components will produce higher crests along with the underlying kinematics of crest steepening in general the more the influence of the nonlinear interaction among the primary components the greater is the generation and influence of the super harmonic and sub harmonic components in the final wave field longuet higgins 1970 longuet higgins and stewart 1964 the super harmonic components i e the high frequency components will sharpen the crests while flattening the troughs in the wave field on the other hand sub harmonic components i e the low frequency ones are responsible for the global perturbations in the mean water level hence for producing focused wave packets wherein nonlinearity plays a major role a correct reproduction of super and sub harmonics is pertinent this is however easier said than done a detailed review of the second order wavemaker theory hughes 1993 unequivocally finds that linear paddle displacement of the wavemaker in a wave flume apart from generating the sub and super harmonic component also generates a spurious free wave component hudspeth and sulisz 1991 hence the suppression of spurious free wave component should be effected by modifying the wavemaking signal schäffer 1996 due to the fact that linear wavemaking is dependent upon the linear dispersion relationship the suppression signal has to be applied at higher orders instead of laboratory experiments it is also quite possible to simulate these extreme cases in a numerical wave tanks nwt the two main formulations in this regard have traditionally been the fully nonlinear potential theory fnpt and navier stokes ns equations the former is relatively computationally efficient than the latter although the latter is quite well suited to breaking processes than the former this has prompted studies that use hybrid coupling between the two wherein the computational efficiency of fnpt is exploited in areas away from breaking where ns equations are employed within the context of focused waves in nwts many studies can be cited see sriram et al 2015 for a list however except for sriram et al 2015 all of them used linear control signals for the wavemaker and compared their results according to linear or second order results the paddle motion in this paper is however based upon a second order corrected signal schäffer 1996 as reported in sriram et al 2015 for the purpose of comparisons with the numerical model we report the output of linear signals as well we simulate extreme wave events in nwts wherein we employ an extension of a numerical model for surface waves called high order spectral hos method dommermuth and yue 1987 west et al 1987 this method relies upon weak asymptotically ordered series expansion of the wave field it differs from the classical stokes expansion in the sense that perturbations are performed in the local physical space as opposed to the functional space for stokes expansion this flexibility eases computations of arbitrary ordered expansions of the wave field moreover the trial functions at each order of expansion are simply taken the same as basis functions of the fourier series in this way fast fourier transforms cooley and tukey 1965 can be deployed for computations thus making large simulations computationally feasible with reasonable costs however a reformulation of the hos method is required to extend its applicability to non periodic boundary value problems like a numerical wave tank nwt for a discussion on the details of hos method along with its extension to a numerical wave tank nwt the reader is referred to section 3 the results of the simulation have been obtained by deploying an open source computer code called hos nwt ducrozet et al 2012 this code has been modified accordingly for the purpose of this study furthermore following sriram et al 2015 we employ wavemaking signals developed by schäffer 1996 for irregular waves in order to suppress the spurious free wave generation that pollute the nonlinear interaction among the primary components using the mechanical generation of water waves by a piston type paddle in hos nwt along with these control signals to the wavemaker we are able to maintain the one to one correspondence between the hos nwt results and laboratory experiments of sriram et al 2015 this allows us to extensively validate hos nwt with the non breaking cases of sriram et al 2015 henceforth referred to as sr15 going further we then simulate these non breaking cases in hos nwt in presence of a wind model to see their evolution as a case of wind wave interaction this is in the same line of investigation as in kharif et al 2008 therein the authors tested a range of focused waves in a wave flume in the presence of wind it was shown that jeffrey s modified sheltering mechanism jeffreys 1925 gave much better results in case of the growth of focused waves in kharif et al 2008 as such this study also uses jeffrey s modified sheltering mechanism as the wind model in the investigation of wind wave interactions for focused waves the point of difference between this study and kharif et al 2008 is the method of focusing while kharif et al 2008 used the group celerity method for a chirped type gaussian wave packet this study uses a constant steepness spectrum with phase speed method for focusing see section 5 for details apart from this methodology this study tries to answer three key questions firstly the modifications in hos nwt theory are explored so as to order the pressure generated by jeffrey s sheltering mechanism in a stokesian manner for the wave making potential section 3 3 secondly the effect of using a constant steepness spectrum versus a comparable constant amplitude spectrum with regards to the strength of energy transfer from the sheltering mechanism this aspect is closely related to the observed wave height amplifications in presence of wind and is treated as a facet of this question thirdly sr15 experiments present us with a dataset that is free of spurious wave usually present in linear wavemaking when used for large surface elevations this gives us an opportunity to study the differences in the role of subharmonic setdown and interactions among the superharmonics to explore this subject we first try to study the feasibility of recreating the wave groups of sr15 in hos nwt apart from these three questions we also try to document the local phase celerity to local surface velocity ratio to identify their usage to predict focusing locations and the onset of breaking for deep and intermediate wave groups along the lines of seiffert and ducrozet 2016 seiffert et al 2017 the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the background and theoretical underpinnings of wind wave interaction specifically the schematics of the jeffrey s modified sheltering mechanism this is followed by detailed mathematical formulations of the numerical model of hos nwt in section 3 the detailed formulae for jeffrey s modified sheltering mechanism consistent with the numerical model are presented in section 4 the exact set up and values of the numerical parameters of hos nwt are then documented in section 6 finally in sections 7 and 8 the key results are summarised and conclusions for the study drawn up 2 the wind wave model the mechanism of the generation of wind waves has been described by miles shearing theory miles 1957 the mechanism is a result of rayleighs equation used for describing the evolution of weak inviscid perturbations in a parallel shear flow at the critical height over the water surface where the wind velocity with respect to a frame moving with the phase velocity of the wave train vanishes rayleighs equation becomes singular hence the curvature of the mean wind profile governs an instability mechanism that drives the energy exchange from the wind to the water surface the pressure changes over the water surface having a wave train as a result of this mechanism inducing a form drag over the wave the reader is referred to belcher and hunt 1998 for a thorough review of wind wave interaction models for short duration rogue wave events it has however been argued that form drag induced by the changing pressure is better described by jeffrey s sheltering mechanism instead of miles theory touboul et al 2008 it has been argued by touboul et al 2008 that this possible mechanism is about three times stronger than miles in case of focused waves wherein the ideal situation for the dominance of this mechanism has been created jeffreys sheltering mechanism jeffreys 1925 was the first plausible mechanism to explain the necessary shift of the atmospheric pressure required for an energy transfer from the wind to the waves this mechanism assumes the wind blowing impinging the windward side of a steep wave train and separating at the leeward side of the steepest crest and then further reattaching as a vortex on the windward side of the following wave this vortex creates a pressure imbalance between the windward and leeward sides of the water surface and is responsible for the form drag a piv study of wind flow on the leeward side of the breaking waves by reul et al 1999 supports the hypothesis of the sheltering mechanism the case for jeffrey s mechanism is further strengthened by the demonstration that air flow separation is responsible for large increments in the form drag banner 1990 for the application of jeffrey s mechanism in numerical models the local steepness of the waveform must be monitored in order to detect a steep wave event this is achieved by setting a threshold local wave slope which activates the sheltering mechanism whenever the local slope exceeds this value kharif et al 2008 since the pressure drag is borne out of an attached vortex on the leeward side of the wave profile jeffrey s sheltering mechanism is applied over the full extent of the steep wave i e between the two successive zero upcrossings that contain the extent of the wave exceeding the threshold slope julien touboul private communications this methodology is referred to as modified sheltering mechanism in this paper 3 mathematical formulations for hos nwt 3 1 governing equations we consider a two dimensional problem of propagating water waves in finite depth and closed by lateral non periodic boundaries of a wave flume the domain d x y boundary on the left is enclosed by the piston type wavemaker while the right lateral boundary is formed by the right wall of the flume as shown in fig 1 the origin of the coordinate system lies at the undisturbed free surface of the fluid with x direction towards the wave propagating direction and y direction as the wave elevation the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible while the flow motion is assumed irrotational allowing the fluid velocity u to be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential function ϕ x y t i e u ϕ x ϕ y as a consequence of the fluid incompressibility the potential function satisfies laplaces equation and the governing field equation is given by 1 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 0 d x y the vertical boundary of the water wave problem is characterized by the following three equations viz the bottom boundary condition 2 the kinematic free surface boundary condition 3 and the dynamic free surface boundary condition 4 2 ϕ y 0 y h 3 η t ϕ x η x ϕ y 0 y η x t 4 ϕ t 1 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ y 2 g η p a ρ w 0 y η x t herein y η x t is the free surface representation g is the acceleration due to gravity p a is the pressure at the free surface and ρ w the density of water the effect of surface tension is assumed to be negligible as such the dynamic free surface boundary condition 4 corresponds merely to pressure continuity across the free surface at the lateral boundaries we have 5 ϕ x d x d t x x y t 6 ϕ x 0 x l where l is length of the wave flume and x y t is the movement of the piston type wavemaker with time t for the purpose of free surface dynamics the dimensions of the above problem can be reduced by the introduction of free surface velocity i e ϕ s x t ϕ x η x t t equations 3 and 4 can then be written in the form of zakharov representation i e 7 η t ϕ s x η x w w ˆ η 2 8 ϕ s t g η 1 2 ϕ s x 2 w 2 2 w 2 ˆ 2 η 2 p a ρ w in the above equations the operator x refers to horizontal derivative in the free surface coordinate system and w refers to the vertical velocity at the free surface i e w ϕ y y η x t in equations 7 and 8 the reader is referred to schaffer 2008 for the discussion regarding relationship between the vertical velocity w and its usage viz w ˆ and w 2 ˆ in 7 and 8 respectively 3 2 extension of hos to non periodic boundaries the classical hos method dommermuth and yue 1987 west et al 1987 employs periodic basis functions for a rectangular domain thus making it extremely efficient for free and periodic lateral boundary conditions however the main testing facility for ocean engineering problems are the wave flumes the boundaries of these flumes along with their wavemakers do not conform to lateral periodic boundaries for a one to one correspondence between the testing flume and simulations in a numerical wave tank it is necessary that the exact boundaries of the testing flume are numerically simulated in the numerical wave tank as such it becomes highly challenging to adapt the hos method to a wave flume while preserving its fast computational efficiency this was first handled by agnon and bingham 1999 using the concept of the additional potential ϕ a d d which is added to the periodic spectral potential ϕ s p e c to obtain the total non periodic potential ϕ this can be written as 9 ϕ ϕ s p e c ϕ a d d in order to solve for the total potential ϕ the additional potential ϕ a d d must be solved first the additional potential then becomes a forcing term in equations 7 and 8 when rearranged the forcing term is then used to solve for the spectral potential ϕ s p e c in the classical hos manner agnon and bingham 1999 idea has been adapted by bonnefoy et al 2006a b for a spectral formulation based numerical wave tank later on ducrozet et al 2012 extended this model to include hos formulations 3 3 hos nwt the numerical model described by ducrozet et al 2012 is a hybrid of stokes type formulation along with hos model the former is used to calculate the wavemaking addition potential ϕ a d d while hos type formulations describe the evolution of the waveform at arbitrary order in the physical space ducrozet et al 2012 in their paper have referred hos type formulations as high order spectral tank host formulations which is the basis of computer code hos nwt the host formulation is modification of equations 7 and 8 in the following decomposed form due to equation 9 i e 10 η t ϕ s p e c s x η x w 2 w ˆ 2 η x 2 ϕ a d d x η x ϕ a d d y 11 ϕ s p e c s t g η 1 2 ϕ s p e c s x 2 w 2 2 w ˆ 2 η x 2 p a ρ w ϕ s p e c s x ϕ a d d x ϕ a d d t 1 2 ϕ a d d x 2 ϕ a d d y 2 in the above host formulation equations viz 10 and 11 it must be noted that w is calculated with respect to ϕ s p e c from the above equations it becomes evident that ϕ a d d that in order to determine η and ϕ s p e c s at each timestep ϕ a d d must be computed beforehand in order to compute ϕ a d d we look at the stokes type expansion of the wavemaker problem i e 12 ϕ x y t ϕ 1 x y t ϕ 2 x y t ϕ 3 x y t 13 η x t η 1 x t η 2 x t η 3 x t 14 x y t x 1 y t x 2 y t x 3 y t 15 p a x t p a 1 x t p a 2 x t p a 3 x t where ϕ i η i x i and p a i are terms of order in a stokes type expansion further note that η and p a is not further expanded in hos zakharov type expansion as opposed to stokes type dommermuth and yue 1987 expanding each ϕ i about y 0 in a taylor series expansion substituting them back in equations 1 6 and then rearranging the according to their stokes order we have until third order of expansion ducrozet et al 2012 16 2 ϕ i x 2 2 ϕ i y 2 0 o n d x y 17 ϕ i y 0 y h 18 ϕ i x 0 x l 19 ϕ i x x i t a i o n x 0 20 η i t ϕ i y b i o n y 0 21 ϕ i t g η i p a i ρ w c i o n y 0 for i 1 2 3 since pressure p a i on the free surface is exactly known it is not expanded about y 0 and thus the terms containing vertical derivative of pressure profile at y 0 are avoided for the expressions a i at i 1 2 3 we have a 1 0 a 2 x 1 2 ϕ 1 x 2 x 1 y ϕ 1 y a 3 x 2 2 ϕ 1 x 2 x 1 2 ϕ 2 x 2 x 1 2 2 3 ϕ 1 x 3 ϕ 1 y x 2 y ϕ 2 y x 1 y similarly for the expressions b i and c i at i 1 2 we have b 1 0 c 1 0 b 2 η 1 2 ϕ 1 y 2 η 1 x ϕ 1 x c 2 η 1 2 ϕ 1 t y 1 2 ϕ 1 x 2 ϕ 1 y 2 the next step is to use agnon and bingham 1999 expansion i e ϕ i ϕ a d d i ϕ s p e c i i 1 2 note that host formulations equations 10 11 at third order of wave making require ϕ a d d ϕ a d d 1 ϕ a d d 2 ϕ a d d 3 having obtained ϕ a d d 1 and ϕ a d d 2 ϕ a d d 3 can be obtained from equation 19 for i 3 as such the expressions for b 3 and c 3 are not required as a check against the correctness of the equations setting p a i 0 i e the usual no wind case will recover back the equations in hughes 1993 the formulations of ducrozet et al 2012 use the pressure term formulations as local function designed to absorb the incoming energy at the opposing end of wavemaker and therefore take a specific form in their paper we have however kept the generalised form as it should appear in host formulations subsequently localised wind pressure is calculated whenever localised sheltering mechanism is activated see section 4 next ϕ s p e c is spectrally expanded in the following form 22 ϕ s p e c i x y t n 0 n x ϕ n i t cosh k n y h cosh k n h cos k n x y 0 where k n n π l this implies that ϕ s p e c is expanded in terms of the sloshing modes of wavetank and hence satisfies neumann conditions at the wall of the flume x 0 and x l the above expression also implies that the bottom boundary condition for ϕ s p e c is also satisfied on the other hand for the resolution of ϕ a d d similarity between equations 19 and 20 is noted exploiting this similarity bonnefoy et al 2006a have expanded the domain to include what they call as a unified wavemaker the added domain d a d d consists of the reflection of domain d x y about y 0 followed by the vertical translation of the reflected image such that the total depth of the domain d a d d is h a d d h bonnefoy et al 2006a ducrozet et al 2012 the reflected and the original wavemaker are smoothly connected for a continuous solution to ϕ a d d bonnefoy et al 2006a this construction is followed by writing the spectral expansion of ϕ a d d i as 23 ϕ a d d i x y t p 0 n y α p i t cosh k p l x cosh k p l cos k p y h y 0 where k p p π h a d d h this implies that ϕ a d d i satisfies the neumann boundary conditions at y h y h a d d and x l the coefficients α i t are obtained from the wavemaker boundary conditions at each order i it must be noted that only the boundaries of d a d d are used to evaluate ϕ a d d the reader is referenced to ducrozet et al 2012 section 3 1 3 for the details of the numerical algorithm of hos nwt at each time step the numerical beach feature of hos nwt is turned off in this study as the effects of reflection remain far off from the focusing location in this study 4 modified jeffrey s sheltering mechanism following the discussion in section 2 the wind pressure according to jeffreys 1925 can be related to the local wave slope as 24 p j e f f ρ a s u c 2 η x where ρ a is density of air s is the sheltering coefficient u is the wind velocity and c is the phase velocity of the wave this wind pressure is applied to equation 8 whenever the local slope exceeds a threshold value η x thresh since jeffreys sheltering mechanism is based upon a non separated vortex on the leeward side of the facing slope the effect of the vortex on the pressure is supposed to be felt over one local wavelength of the waveform this observation is in conformity with the piv results of reul et al 1999 as discussed in section 2 as a result equation 24 is locally applied over one wavelength whenever within that wavelength the threshold slope is exceeded following kharif et al 2008 the sheltering coefficient s is taken as 0 5 while the threshold slope η x thresh is taken as 0 35 in this paper it can be observed from the form of equation 24 that a wind velocity less than the phase celerity u c can substantially increase the amplification in the energy content of a focusing wave as compared to a situation when u c 0 however it is expected that in such a case the strength of the shed vortex will be limited resulting in a very weak sheltering coefficient as such s 0 5 represents a saturated value of the sheltering coefficients for u c 0 the total free surface pressure is given as p a p j e f f and used along with host formulation the extension of these formulae to stokes order is likewise p a i p j e f f i at each order for each of the investigated constant steepness spectra the phase speed is taken as the linear phase speed of the central frequency of the spectrum given the modification in the original hos nwt code has been made in a way such that pressure term plays a consistent role in the expansions both in stokesian orders and hos orders see expansions of a i b i and c i in section 3 3 5 methodology for wave generation the phase speed method relies on the linear superposition of wave components constructively to achieve focusing according to linear theory the wave surface elevation can be written as 25 η x t j 1 n f a j cos k j x ω j t β j where a j is the amplitude of the jth wave components k j is the jth wave number ω j is the wave angular frequency 2 π f j f j being frequency and β j is the phase shift n f is the total number of wave frequency components k j and ω j are related by the dispersion relation ω j 2 g k j tanh k j h following sr15 we choose the spectrum as constant steepness spectrum hence the a j s can be determined from s k j a j j where s is the constant steepness of the spectrum the piston paddle motions can be determined from the biesel s linear transfer function while β j depend upon the desired focusing location x t and time t t it has however been shown by hudspeth and sulisz 1991 that with a finite amplitude of paddle motion apart from the desired waveform and the bound harmonics a spurious free wave is also generated in order to suppress this spurious wave generation schäffer 1996 has provided second order transfer functions in the form of a double infinite series for the details and discussion of the complete second order corrected application of schäffer 1996 to sr15 experiments the reader is refered to sriram et al 2015 6 numerical setup following sr15 the length of the wavetank taken is l 110 m while still water depth is h 0 7 m for all our cases the domain d a d d is discretized with n x horizontal modes and 2 n y vertical modes where n x 1357 and n y 65 the resolution of the vertical geometry of the wavemaker n y is based upon the recommendations of bonnefoy et al 2006b while a numerical convergence gives us the appropriate n x see section 7 1 thus for the numerical model the limiting time step is based upon the minimum of either the cfl condition or the stability of the runge kutta time marching scheme for the stability of the algorithm we keep the sampling frequency of the output well below these recommended values it must be noted that the time step actually varies since we adopt the adaptive time marching algorithm of cash and karp 1990 the numerical model of hos nwt needs input of the wave maker motion at each order we pre calculate the wavemaker motions at each stokes order including the leading and trailing time ramps according to the sampling frequency documented in sr15 thereafter these motions are stored in a spline form and interpolated at each time step of the adaptive time marching scheme note that the nonlinear stokes order of the wave maker used to calculate ϕ a d d is different from hos order which is taken all over as a constant i e m 5 with full dealiasing the order of wave making in this study is either taken as linear or second order corrected each case studied in this paper is signified by a central frequency f c the bandwidth factor δ f f c the number of wave components n f the gain factor g a where π g a k c a c the time of focusing t t and the order of wave making see table 1 for details the focusing point for all considered cases is taken as x t 21 m for the modified jeffrey s sheltering mechanism the threshold local wave slope is taken as 0 35 while the sheltering coefficient is taken as 0 5 kharif et al 2008 the relevant non breaking cases of sr15 considered are tested for four following wind velocities viz 2 m s 4 m s 6 m s and 8 m s it must be noted that in many of documented and undocumented cases of sr15 the maximum local slope does not exceed the local threshold slope for modified jeffrey s model and as such these are not included in the study of wind wave interactions we are applying this wind model only to the non breaking cases of sr15 however for the instances of high wind speed it is expected that wave breaking would occur thus the onset of wave breaking has to be identified by a threshold parameter as hos models are incapable of identifying this phenomenon unfortunately there is hardly any agreement on such a threshold parameter and its form among researchers chalikov and babanin 2012 however in our study we found that a simple kinematic parameter b x see section 7 4 for discussions based on local water particle velocity on the free surface versus the local waveform velocity separates out sr15 non breaking cases from breaking ones at the onset of wave breaking the simulations are stopped 7 results and discussion 7 1 numerical convergence in this section we present the numerical convergence tests for the choice of horizontal modes n x for hos order of m 5 the case f068b20028 is chosen as representative for a non breaking test case while the case f068b20034 is tested for convergence representative of a breaking wave group four values of n x have been chosen viz 513 1025 1357 and 2049 modes for non breaking wave group fig 2 shows the convergence of probe readings close to the focusing point the convergence achieved with n x as 1357 is within 1 2 of sr15 experiments except for a slight phase difference with regards to the breaking wave group the simulation is stopped when onset of wave breaking is detected see section 7 4 fig 4 shows the variance of the probe elevation time series as function of probe location for non breaking case f068b20028 the convergence improves as the mode number increases on the other hand for case f068b20034 the very low values with respect to sr15 experiments are due to premature stoppage of simulations when the breaking onset is detected herein as well for n x 513 it can be seen that convergence has been achieved implying that more or less breaking onset is detected at roughly same time and location fig 3 documents the rise of the onset of breaking parameter with each of the modes it is seen that n x 513 underpredicts the parameter threshold and thereafter considerable phase difference is observed between sr15 probes readings with respect to hos nwt for other values however the breaking onset parameter is in close proximity to one another along with very little difference prior to exceedance of breaking threshold as a result n x 1357 is chosen as an optimal value with respect to the appropriate resolution of the wave groups and computational time this value is of the same order as used by seiffert et al 2017 in their studies 7 2 validation of hos nwt this section discusses the validation of the numerical model for the cases as documented in sr15 in total 26 wave groups with a constant steepness spectrum and focusing based upon phase velocity mechanism have been validated including breaking and non breaking wave groups table 1 lists all the wave packets validated in this study including wave groups that were not extensively documented in sriram et al 2015 fig 5 shows the comparison between the wavemaker signal and probe elevations at x x t 16 165 m for case f068b20028 w068nb2 in sr15 a slight variation in the initial and final time ramps has been adopted for hos nwt when compared to sr15 cases due to numerical issues the experimental time ramps have a c1 discontinuity which can t be used with hos as a result a function of the form provided in chiang et al 2005 equation 15 4 3 is used in hos for time ramps overall the wavemaker signals and probe measurements away from the focusing point show a good agreement with sr15 cases figs 6 and 7 shows the comparisons of the energy spectral density esd spectrum of the probe farthest off from the focusing region x x t 16 165 m for central frequencies of 0 68 h z and 1 08 h z these esd spectra have been obtained by fitting a 40 sec tukey tapered cosine window around the maximum of the highest surface elevations measured by the wave probe it can be seen that the spectra of both the central frequencies in the region of primary wave components shows a very good match between sr15 experiments and hos nwt simulations since sr15 experiments have been conducted for a range of bandwidth δ f f c 0 5 0 75 1 0 the general trend of the spectra with respect to the difference between the linear and second order corrected measurements is that the second order corrected ones show a clear demarcation between the primary sub and super harmonic wave components this is particularly exemplified for the smallest bandwidth δ f f c 0 5 where the dips at the ends of primary wave band separates them out from the sub and super harmonics increasing the bandwidth of the free waves means that they overlap with the sub and superharmonic frequencies and therefore the observations are not so clearly demarcated sriram et al 2015 comparison of the hos nwt simulations and sr15 experiments in sub and super harmonic wave bands show only a qualitative match i e compared to linear wave making second order corrected wave making shows relative increase in the sub harmonic energetics but the effect is relatively smudged compared to sr15 experiments one important difference between the second order corrected signals in hos nwt versus sr15 experiments has been that while experiments in sr15 show a complete elimination of free spurious waves when subject to wavemaking signals based on schäffer 1996 theory probe measurements in hos nwt show that spurious waves still remain although they are significantly diminished in fact the strength of spurious wave in linearly generated waves are greater in hos nwt as compared to sr15 so the second order signal in case of hos nwt incorrectly estimates the spurious content and therefore the correction to it applied by second order signal is apparently not enough at this point of time it is not clear whether this small difference is due to the different nature of the initial ramps deployed in hos nwt and sr15 or is it due to the computational issues in hos theory in order to confirm the above mentioned differences in hos nwt and sr15 s order corrections we adopt the methodology of sr15 to differentiate between primary sub and super harmonics sriram et al 2015 section 4 1 2 from their methodology the subharmonic frequencies as classified as those below f l o w while super harmonics as those above f h i g h see table 1 fig 8 shows the differences in the surface elevation contributions from selected sub harmonic components scaled by a factor of 5 in both linear case f068a10019 and second order case f068a20019 wavemaking sriram et al 2015 with respect to non breaking wave groups the simulated hos nwt cases clearly show a shifting of the focusing location away from the theoretical focusing baldock et al 1996 fig 9 shows the typical evolution of maximum downcrossing wave heights near to the focusing points prior to the focusing point the measurements of hos nwt and sr15 follow a similar pattern the experimental packets of sr15 however seem to be dominated by viscosity as focusing points are approached hos nwt is based on potential theory and therefore viscosity is unaccounted for in these models fig 10 gives a sense of the maximum crest to trough measurements given at the probes for hos nwt simulations vis avis the experimental measurements of sr15 for all non breaking cases far from the focusing points the results agree within 5 of each other while closer to the focusing point the measurements of hos nwt are confined to within 8 of the experimental results the main outliers outside this range here come from two cases in hos nwt simulations viz f108c10030 and f108c20030 the outlying results come from an abrupt attentuation of downcrossing crest to trough heights near x x t 0 6 m and x x t 0 85 m as confirmed by fig 11 figs 12 and 13 show a comparison between probe measurements and corresponding one sided esd spectra of hos nwt and sr15 cases close to focusing locations for the case f068b20028 fig 14 show the comparison of the same case for the selected wave probes corresponding to sriram et al 2015 locations with hos nwt with regards to the evolution of the wave spectrum from pre to post focusing stage the spectra of these locations establishes the leakage of energy from the primary components to higher frequencies 1 0 h z and lower frequencies 0 4 h z confirming the findings of sr15 7 3 testing jeffrey s modified sheltering in hos nwt following the discussion in sections 2 and 4 the modified sheltering mechanism is tested for the evolution of wave group generated by group velocity mechanism see 5 in hos nwt the tested wave group is similar to the documented wave group in touboul et al 2006 with η x thresh taken as 0 5 for wind speeds of 4 m s and 6 m s the linear rate of frequency modulation for this wave group is continued for 23 5 sec with maximum frequency as 1 85 hz and minimum frequency as 0 80 hz the amplification factor for a near constant amplitude 0 0084 m wave group thus generated is plotted against the length of the wave tank in fig 15 the threshold for a wave breaking parameter in the study by touboul et al 2006 was taken as local wave slope exceeding tan 30 0 58 as such if this criterion is applied to wind speed of 6 m s the wave group breaks which is not observed in touboul et al 2006 however the difference turns out to be minor since re running the simulation with criterion as just above 0 6 allows the simulation to run for full length of time thus we find qualitative equivalence with the important conclusions of touboul et al 2006 viz the wave height of the group is amplified in presence of wind without a substantial shifting of focusing location along the wind direction see fig 15 7 4 onset of wave breaking since hos models are based upon the eulerian form of free surface boundary conditions they are unable to model a breaking wave scenario in most cases for a plunging type wave group the computations will usually break down at the first instance of singularity in the taylor expansions about the mean surface according to our experience with the simulations even this observation does not hold true for marginal plunging cases this is because in such cases a local steepening before plunging is aliased with high order modes in hos without a numerical blow up geometric parameters based on notion of wave slope are also not robust enough these notions can be based upon the exact local wave slope observed touboul et al 2006 or a wave by wave analysis of the observed waveform saket et al 2017b the threshold from these are generally deduced from limit on the wave slope of a stokes wave however there are wide variations in their computations and applicability in the literature e g touboul et al 2006 and barthelemy et al 2015a however onset of wave breaking is primarily a local phenomenon and therefore stokes limit probably serves as a necessary but not a sufficient limit this is also borne out in our simulations see table 2 for local slope and s c computations thus a parameter which captures the local nature of the onset of wave breaking along with dynamic considerations of energy flux is to be preferred over simple geometric parameters to this effect many researchers have concentrated over the local flux of energy beneath the wave surface many studies see stansell and macfarlane 2002 and references cited therein have tried to quantify the ratio of local dynamic flux with respect to the local waveform velocity as a dynamic parameter for predicting onset of wave breaking in absence of dynamic wind pressure this parameter reduces to a kinematic parameter b x comparing the local surface velocity of the water particle to the local waveform velocity a major issue in the calculation of local phase velocities is the myriad ways it can be calculated this issue has been extensively discussed in a recent study by seiffert et al 2017 and includes techniques like local crest tracking and the formula suggested by fedele 2014 with respect to numerical and physical experiments of barthelemy et al 2015a and saket et al 2017b the local phase velocity is obtained from a crest tracking technique due to computational issues the aforementioned techniques are considered inadequate seiffert et al 2017 as a result seiffert et al 2017 have suggested the method of kurnia and van groesen 2014 as the most consistent and computationally superior to all others considered a critique of the approach of kurnia and van groesen 2014 equation 26 is that the formulation is limited to 2d wave groups and only serves as an approximation to exact local phase velocity moreover seiffert et al 2017 also point out that in some cases the slowdown of the wave group prior to focusing is over estimated the local wave form velocity c x can be computed from the imaginary part of hilbert analytic signal of the surface elevation ℍ η kurnia and van groesen 2014 as 26 c x x t g tanh k x t h k x t k x t 1 η 2 ℍ η 2 η ℍ η x ℍ η η x thus b x u x c x where u x is the local horizontal water particle velocity at the free surface recent experiments as well as numerical studies for deep water waves barthelemy et al 2015b saket et al 2017b simulations have suggested the threshold for this parameter to be 0 85 the experiments by saket et al have recently been validated in hos nwt by seiffert and ducrozet 2016 for deep water groups using equation 26 the excellent performance of b x in predicting the onset of the wave breaking seems to be be due to the fact that a local focusing of a wave group slows down the local crest velocity substantially 20 from those predicted by stokes theory baldock et al 1996 banner et al 2014 while there is a spurt in the local particle velocity at the crest the theoretical study on deep water waves by fedele 2014 explains this phenomenon as a consequence of the dispersion relationship which for narrow banded groups can be explained within the framework of schrodinger s equation the role of nonlinearity seems to set an upper bound towards this slowdown fedele 2014 banner et al 2014 following focusing the local crest velocity again accelerates leading to a typical forward backward leaning of the local waveform since b x is essentially a local parameter this study also employs this parameter for the prediction of onset of wave breaking although the constant steepness spectra used in this study are rather intermediate f c 0 68 h z and deep water f c 1 08 h z wave groups for these conditions the threshold for b x is determined by calculating this parameter for all breaking and non breaking conditions of sr15 the maximum b x observed for a non breaking case of sr15 is for f c 0 68 hz and is approximately 0 882 while all of the breaking packets cross the threshold of 0 9 conservatively the breaking threshold based upon b x is taken as 0 9 fig 16 shows the typical observed rise in the maximum value of b x with respect to time for non breaking and breaking wave groups in general in accordance with sriram et al 2015 it is observed that the spurious waves in linear wavemaking make the focusing more susceptible to breaking during the computation of b x it has been noted that the maximal values for each time step show an occasional local peak this computational anomaly is not present if the simulations are run for even higher hos order e g m 11 however the higher order runs are computationally expensive and are avoided in most cases as such this occasional spurt has been ignored unless it crosses the breaking threshold b x 0 9 in which case the simulation is re run for higher orders the source of this anomaly needs to be investigated further in addition to this it is also observed that the grid location of maximum b x is close to the observed focusing location of a non breaking wave group in sr15 however the reported breaking locations in sr15 are not in accordance with the location of exceedance of threshold b x it should be noted that the b x is used as a parameter to predict the onset of wave breaking as such the onset location could be vastly different from the visual observation of breaking as reported in sr15 moreover the study in sr15 didn t focus upon the characterisation of wave breaking in cases considered therein table 2 summarises the various wave breaking diagnostics for all cases of sr15 in absence of wind in conformity with seiffert and ducrozet 2016 b x for deep water breaking wave groups exceeds 0 85 this value is in accordance with barthelemy et al 2015a and saket et al 2017b even though the methodology for the calculation of local phase velocity is different with respect to breaking onset for intermediate wave groups a preprint of experimental results by saket et al 2017a claim this value to be 0 835 this is lower than the value claimed by barthelemy et al 2015b i e 0 85 in this study the onset of wave breaking parameter b x for intermediate water depth is upper bounded by 0 9 for the non breaking case f068c20030 in table 2 the maximum observed value for b x is 0 88 this is however greater than barthelemy s it is known that for a given frequency the water waves slowdown as they move into shallower waters but they also become more susceptible to breaking hence it is not completely clear at this moment as to reason behind the discrepancy between this study and saket s recent experiments by saket et al 2017b suggest that the threshold doesn t change much in presence of wind forcing although the presence of wind seems to have a calming effect raising the threshold by 2 as such b x 0 9 is taken as the threshold parameter for the onset of wave breaking in presence of wind as well 7 5 focusing in presence of wind table 2 documents the maximum local slope observed in the evolution of the wave packets in absence of wind since jeffrey s modified sheltering mechanism is incumbent upon local exceedance of wave slope above a threshold value 0 35 that means in only a few of sr15 cases in which the maximum local wave slope is greater than the threshold value are of interest the selected wave packets are further documented in tables 3 6 for wind speed 2 m s 4 m s 6 m s and 8 m s respectively these selected wave groups have their bandwidth ratio δ f f c greater than 0 5 the simulations in hos nwt are stopped whenever the maximum value of b x see saket et al 2017b for definition of b x in presence of non trivial surface pressure exceeds 0 9 signifying the onset of wave breaking the localised nature of the sheltering mechanism in space as well as time means that the mechanism kicks in only during the focusing stages the focusing stages are however dominated by short wave modes and therefore higher local wave steepness the energy transfer from the wind to the wave form therefore seem to favour the higher modes as observed in the spectral energy distribution based on fourier transforms as observed by baldock et al 1996 the fourier basis functions are of very limited value due to their globalised nature for processing a localised time series like a focusing wave as such the fourier spectra figs 19 and 20 in absence of wind is only very nominally different from that in presence of wind figs 21 and 22 show a short time fourier transform stft for two probes one each for case f068b20028 and f108c20030 respectively the stft is based on a half overlapping blackman window of about 5 s and sampling rate of 50 hz it can be seen from the heat map of esd that the mechanism favours the higher frequencies just above 2 hz but remains very weak with regards to non breaking cases b x 0 9 and probe locations far off from the theoretical focusing point x t the esd spectrum of the simulated wave groups doesn t change since the modified sheltering mechanism is inactive see fig 17 for case f068c10030 close to the theoretical focusing location it is observed that the increase in wind speeds amplifies the energy content in the spectrum the nature of modified sheltering mechanism means that the energy transfer happens in short bursts of cyclical rise and fall of crest slope and is hence very weak the cyclical activity of sheltering mechanism is observed to differ in two forms in the first one where threshold slope rises and falls in one cycle while in another energy transferred in a prior cycle of activity of sheltering mechanism is enough to overshoot the threshold slope in the next cycle in a manner similar to group celerity focusing fig 18 the weakness of the energy transfer mechanism led to questions over whether the focusing methodology i e group celerity versus phase speed focusing or the usage of type of spectra constant amplitude versus constant steepnes is responsible in order to verify that one needs to simulate the same groups with the same focusing heights in either of the combinations while monitoring the rise of maximum grid slope in case of focusing methodology this is not exactly possible this is because the linear principles of group celerity methods predict an infinite focusing elevation rising as t t t 1 2 kharif et al 2009 while phase celerity method predicts a finite elevation inspite of this inexact translatability efforts were made to simulate a near constant amplitude wave packet the same in section 7 3 using both methodologies in absence of wind it was observed that close to focusing time the pattern of rise in total energy and maximum grid slope of both the wave groups was very similar this observation more or less eliminated the possibility of variations between the focusing methods in case of usage of constant steepness versus the constant amplitude both spectra were simulated using phase celerity methods in absence of wind for the case f108b20020 this meant that wave group corresponding to constant amplitude spectrum would possess approximately 84 of energy of the wave group corresponding to constant steepness spectrum based upon linear calculations however as documented in fig 23 one can see that a constant amplitude sustains larger slopes for larger duration than constant steepness spectrum hence the slope exceedances above the threshold slope for the modified sheltering mechanism would be stronger and longer in constant amplitude than constant steepness spectrum this means that the energy transfer via the work done on the free surface by the pressure form drag will be low and hence the amplification would also be limited in duration for a constant steepness spectra thus explaining the weakness of energy transfer mechanism shifting back to focusings in presence of wind we observe that for wind speed of 8 m s the rise in energy levels can happen over two cycles and is responsible for the marked difference in the timings of the activity of the sheltering mechanism with respect to wind speed of 6 m s in addition to a jump in energy levels itself the jump in energy levels is linear or stepped wise linear depending upon whether the transfer happens over one or two cycles of exceeding thresholds respectively when these cycles coincide with the wavemaking duration the rise in energy looks rippled see fig 24 although sheltering mechanism is stronger than miles mechanism the short duration of its activity means that in order to transfer substantial energy to a focusing mechanism the threshold slope must be crossed repeatedly since in sr15 experiments the wave groups were designed to reach the focusing only once or twice within a wave group modulation the maximum total energy transferred is of the order of 5 only only groups close to the onset of breaking see a rapid rise in energy levels while for others still higher wind speeds 8 m s can be sustained without breaking these values of wind speeds are highly unlikely and therefore not investigated the combination of non linear interactions within the wave components in conjunction with energy transfer from sheltering mechanism means that the effect of wind pressure is felt across all components however there seems to be a difference in the intermediate and deep water group behaviour with regards to wave groups the data can only be analysed for restricted wind speeds as onset of breaking in higher wind speeds stops the simulations prematurely the deductions from the observed behaviour can hence only be inferred from groups classified as non breaking b x 0 9 for wave groups in intermediate water depth f c 0 68 h z a difference in the behaviour of surface elevation contributions from subharmonic frequencies on one hand and due to primary and superharmonics is apparent the frequencies classified below f l o w are dominated by the dynamics of set down while those above are dominated by the focusing mechanism fig 19 shows the influence of wind on frequency spectra close to focusing locations for case f068b20028 the influence of wind on setdown is observed to be minimal while the focusing in primary and superharmonics do get amplified but very weakly fig 25 as a result the amplification in downcrossing wave heights is observed to be of the order of 1 cm only in general in the absence of wind the evolution of spectrum in the focusing and defocusing stages transfers energy from above f l o w to smoothen the spectrum across the superharmonics the sheltering mechanism simply modifies the energy content during this process but not the energy transfer mechanism itself in all these processes the frequencies below f l o w remain unaffected the spurious free wave in the linear wavemaking processing crosses the focusing location before the focusing process and is also unaffected by the sheltering mechanism with regards to deep water wave groups f c 1 08 h z a key difference from intermediate groups is that the strength of the setdown is markedly small about 5 10 times smaller in absence of wind the conformity of deep water simulations in hos nwt with sr15 cases is better with regards to contributions from subharmonics in the absence of strong setdown the dynamics of all frequencies including the subharmonics is governed across the spectrum by non linearity of the spectrum with minimal effect from the water depth the spectrum structure varies as there are two focusing defocusing stages with different characteristic steepness in each of these stages although spectrum evolution in both stages show a similar behaviour figs 20 and 27 figs 26 and 27 document the rise of maximal crest to trough wave heights registered by wave probe measurements along the length of the tank it can be observed from figs 26 and 27 and tables 2 6 that the actual focusing location in presence of wind remains the same within one or two grid points of the focusing in absence of wind with defocusing slightly delayed for linear wavemaking the role of wind is therefore limited to the amplification of amplitudes only and any effect on the local phase celerity is not discernible this observation is in line with the numerical results of touboul et al 2006 the shift in focusing location in presence of wind in experimental results of kharif et al 2008 is therefore due to the wind induced currents roughly 2 3 of wind speeds on which the waveform seems to ride with regards to breaking cases b x 0 9 the location of exceedance of the threshold is closer to the focusing location this is however an artifact of the localised nature of the modified sheltering mechanism since the breaking location is unknown the maximal of b x is not enough in predicting the breaker type or the visibly developed location of breaking the rate of rise of b x is related to the rate of energy input and should be related to energy dissipation per unit length of breaker fronts drazen et al 2008 this investigation is however beyond the scope of this study and shall be attempted in future 8 conclusion second order corrected wave groups based on schäffer 1996 theory of wave making have been used in sr15 to study focusing in wave groups with a constant steepness spectrum this study uses numerical simulations in hos nwt to corroborate both the corrected and uncorrected wave groups studied in sr15 furthermore the focusing in the same groups have been studied in wind speeds of 2 8 m s the wind model is based upon jeffrey s modified sheltering mechanism which has been argued to be more dominant for rogue waves arising out of focusing mechanism kharif et al 2008 the effect of the sheltering mechanism is primarily in the amplification of maximal crest to trough wave heights near the focusing location there seems to be no discernible shift in focusing location in presence of wind when compared to its absence moreover the energy transfer post focusing seem to be dominated by high frequencies these observations coupled with the fact that b x for non breaking waves reaches its maximum near focusing location means that the local phase celerity doesn t change under the influence of the sheltering mechanism the modified sheltering mechanism is however found to be very weak as it is dependent on short bursts of crossing of threshold slopes the investigations show that a comparable constant amplitude spectrum sustains the exceedance of slopes over a larger period of time as opposed to constant steepness spectra used in sr15 experiments and this study as such wave groups corresponding to a constant steepness spectra contain over a cycle or two of bursts of exceedance of threshold slope and thus the sheltering mechanism is not able to transfer substantial energy to these wave groups during the simulation time however it is completely possible that over a larger period of time multiple events of crossing of threshold slope occur given that the wave groups are periodic in space and time a difference in spectrum evolution of intermediate and deep water groups studied are also observed subharmonic frequencies in the intermediate groups are relatively unaffected by an energy transfer happening across the frequency spectra at various locations in the focusing defocusing stage on the other hand almost all of the spectrum is affected by the energy transfer for the deep water groups the addition of sheltering mechanism to this process only amplifies the energy levels but doesn t seem to affect the transfer towards higher frequencies in the focusing defocusing cycle with regards to breaking waves it has been observed in these wave groups that the onset of breaking is signified whenever b x exceeds a threshold of 0 9 in absence of any wind forcing the same threshold is kept for classifying waves groups as breaking and non breaking the sheltering mechanism for strong winds is observed to turn the marginal wave groups towards the onset of breaking acknowledgements the authors would like to thank dr guillaume ducrozet lheea ecn nantes france for providing the open source code hos nwt which has been modified by the authors for

23336,in this paper we extend the non breaking second order corrected focused wave experimental results of sriram et al 2015 in a numerical wave tank based on hos in the presence of wind the wind is modelled using the modified jeffrey s sheltering mechanism kharif et al 2008 we take care to preserve the consistency of application of pressure terms in the hybrid stokesian hos formulations when applying wind we confirm the results of kharif et al 2008 i e the focusing points in presence of wind show an amplification of the measure wave heights although no discernible shifting of focusing location is observed however compared to kharif et al 2008 the sheltering mechanism is found to be very weak since it depends on exceedance of a threshold slope based on constant steepness or constant amplitude spectrum the energy flux to local phase celerity b x both in absence and presence of the aforementioned wind model for the detection of onset of wave breaking barthelemy et al 2015b saket et al 2017b are reported moreover in the absence of wind if b x is used as parameter the onset of wave breaking then for intermediate water wave groups its threshold should be close to 0 9 computations based on kurnia and van groesen 2014 keywords focused waves jeffrey s sheltering high order spectral method onset of breaking 1 introduction a reality for all the port facilities ship and ocean structures is that they have to be designed for extreme wave loads due to their expected periodical exposure to the extreme wave events as such the investigation of the occurrence of extreme wave events is a topic of active research with multiple interesting facets and lines of inquiry one of the many reasons for the occurence of extreme wave events may be due to the result of focusing on wave energy on a very narrow area of the sea surface recent advances in satellite imagery rosenthal and lehner 2008 and post facto analysis of the numerous past disasters has confirmed that there is indeed a presence of very high steep waves occasionally emerging from the seas and then disappearing not only are they found in a natural sea state but also in shallow waters as has recently been confirmed nikolkina and didenkulova 2011 this class of extreme wave events based on wave wave interactions is typically referred to as a freak or rogue waves in the literature these are waves or wave groups that may not necessarily be associated with rough weather conditions however some of these conditions can create a steep wave event of considerable elevation lasting for a very short duration this sudden magnified elevation has led to many documented accidents on the other hand the steepness of the rogue wave amplifies the effect of nonlinearity in wave structure interactions hence a study of nonlinearity is pertinent in such cases kharif and pelinovsky 2003 nonlinearity in water waves can be classified in two forms strong and weak strong nonlinearity in water waves leads to enhanced role of viscosity and is routinely associated with wave breaking however a great deal of water wave behaviour can be explained by weak form of nonlinear equations in fact weak nonlinearity typically precludes strongly nonlinear behaviour rainey 2007 the weakly nonlinear form of wave equations is based upon the representation of the solution as an asymptotically ordered series the ordering is based upon a steepness parameter representative of the steepness of the physical wave in such a scenario the dominant low order solutions forces the high order solutions through a mode coupling approach in this framework of weak nonlinearity freak or rogue wave mechanisms have been studied in this paper in general for the safe and economic operation of coastal structures and various sea going vessels these structures must be tested for the response under extreme waves particularly the freak ones usually this testing is to be done in a wave flume this way the concerned mechanism is isolated and simulated in the wave flume for a detailed study of the generated extreme waves and their effects the mechanisms of such focusing can be of following type viz geometrical spatio temporal dispersion bathymetry wave current interactions wind effects modulation instabilities etc kharif and pelinovsky 2003 however it must be realised that the generation of the extreme waves in the flume is not a trivial issue even in the absence of the structure the generation and study of kinematics of these extreme waves is complex due to the nonlinearity involved moreover one has to wisely decide whether to simulate the regular wave conditions or random wave tests with different wave components in a wave spectrum the former doesn t necessarily represent the extreme wave events while the latter does but only if the test is long enough this is because in the random case the extreme cases occur very rarely in the time series meaning that realisation of the extreme events is possible only for a very long simulation duration this requirement means that one should employ a combination of passive and active wave absorption control techniques to minimise reflection at the far walls away from the wavemaker in the wave flume grilli and horrillo 1997 among the many mechanisms for freak waves studied by various workers the most common class of mechanisms studied is spatio temporal dispersion kharif and pelinovsky 2003 this class aims to produce a localised focusing in the physical space and time three variants of this class have been reported by chaplin 1996 viz group celerity method reverse dispersion method and phase speed celerity method each of these variants have their merits and de merits with respect to their effectiveness in the type of wave groups they form and are employed for we refer the reader to chaplin 1996 for a detailed review in this paper however we employ the third variant i e the phase speed method due to its simplicity and ease of replication this method can be easily simulated in the wave flume this method was first proposed by longuet higgins who specified a range of wave components primary components and synchronized their initial phases in such a way to produce a constructive interference at a given spatial location and a specified time this constructive interference focuses the various components energies thus producing an extreme wave event subsequently rapp and melville 1990 used this mechanism for their experimental investigation of breaking waves many other workers have used this mechanism for breaking process or its interactions in finite water depth kway et al 1998 adcock and taylor 2009 li et al 2015 kharif and pelinovsky 2003 as well for a recent review of breaking wave process with this mechanism the reader is referred to perlin et al 2013 although the abovementioned mechanism is based upon a linear constructive interference due to concentration of energy in the focused area a local rise in the steepness is expected this increase in turn accentuates the nonlinear interactions that were otherwise suppressed in the linear case baldock et al 1996 have shown that the nonlinear interactions among the components will produce higher crests along with the underlying kinematics of crest steepening in general the more the influence of the nonlinear interaction among the primary components the greater is the generation and influence of the super harmonic and sub harmonic components in the final wave field longuet higgins 1970 longuet higgins and stewart 1964 the super harmonic components i e the high frequency components will sharpen the crests while flattening the troughs in the wave field on the other hand sub harmonic components i e the low frequency ones are responsible for the global perturbations in the mean water level hence for producing focused wave packets wherein nonlinearity plays a major role a correct reproduction of super and sub harmonics is pertinent this is however easier said than done a detailed review of the second order wavemaker theory hughes 1993 unequivocally finds that linear paddle displacement of the wavemaker in a wave flume apart from generating the sub and super harmonic component also generates a spurious free wave component hudspeth and sulisz 1991 hence the suppression of spurious free wave component should be effected by modifying the wavemaking signal schäffer 1996 due to the fact that linear wavemaking is dependent upon the linear dispersion relationship the suppression signal has to be applied at higher orders instead of laboratory experiments it is also quite possible to simulate these extreme cases in a numerical wave tanks nwt the two main formulations in this regard have traditionally been the fully nonlinear potential theory fnpt and navier stokes ns equations the former is relatively computationally efficient than the latter although the latter is quite well suited to breaking processes than the former this has prompted studies that use hybrid coupling between the two wherein the computational efficiency of fnpt is exploited in areas away from breaking where ns equations are employed within the context of focused waves in nwts many studies can be cited see sriram et al 2015 for a list however except for sriram et al 2015 all of them used linear control signals for the wavemaker and compared their results according to linear or second order results the paddle motion in this paper is however based upon a second order corrected signal schäffer 1996 as reported in sriram et al 2015 for the purpose of comparisons with the numerical model we report the output of linear signals as well we simulate extreme wave events in nwts wherein we employ an extension of a numerical model for surface waves called high order spectral hos method dommermuth and yue 1987 west et al 1987 this method relies upon weak asymptotically ordered series expansion of the wave field it differs from the classical stokes expansion in the sense that perturbations are performed in the local physical space as opposed to the functional space for stokes expansion this flexibility eases computations of arbitrary ordered expansions of the wave field moreover the trial functions at each order of expansion are simply taken the same as basis functions of the fourier series in this way fast fourier transforms cooley and tukey 1965 can be deployed for computations thus making large simulations computationally feasible with reasonable costs however a reformulation of the hos method is required to extend its applicability to non periodic boundary value problems like a numerical wave tank nwt for a discussion on the details of hos method along with its extension to a numerical wave tank nwt the reader is referred to section 3 the results of the simulation have been obtained by deploying an open source computer code called hos nwt ducrozet et al 2012 this code has been modified accordingly for the purpose of this study furthermore following sriram et al 2015 we employ wavemaking signals developed by schäffer 1996 for irregular waves in order to suppress the spurious free wave generation that pollute the nonlinear interaction among the primary components using the mechanical generation of water waves by a piston type paddle in hos nwt along with these control signals to the wavemaker we are able to maintain the one to one correspondence between the hos nwt results and laboratory experiments of sriram et al 2015 this allows us to extensively validate hos nwt with the non breaking cases of sriram et al 2015 henceforth referred to as sr15 going further we then simulate these non breaking cases in hos nwt in presence of a wind model to see their evolution as a case of wind wave interaction this is in the same line of investigation as in kharif et al 2008 therein the authors tested a range of focused waves in a wave flume in the presence of wind it was shown that jeffrey s modified sheltering mechanism jeffreys 1925 gave much better results in case of the growth of focused waves in kharif et al 2008 as such this study also uses jeffrey s modified sheltering mechanism as the wind model in the investigation of wind wave interactions for focused waves the point of difference between this study and kharif et al 2008 is the method of focusing while kharif et al 2008 used the group celerity method for a chirped type gaussian wave packet this study uses a constant steepness spectrum with phase speed method for focusing see section 5 for details apart from this methodology this study tries to answer three key questions firstly the modifications in hos nwt theory are explored so as to order the pressure generated by jeffrey s sheltering mechanism in a stokesian manner for the wave making potential section 3 3 secondly the effect of using a constant steepness spectrum versus a comparable constant amplitude spectrum with regards to the strength of energy transfer from the sheltering mechanism this aspect is closely related to the observed wave height amplifications in presence of wind and is treated as a facet of this question thirdly sr15 experiments present us with a dataset that is free of spurious wave usually present in linear wavemaking when used for large surface elevations this gives us an opportunity to study the differences in the role of subharmonic setdown and interactions among the superharmonics to explore this subject we first try to study the feasibility of recreating the wave groups of sr15 in hos nwt apart from these three questions we also try to document the local phase celerity to local surface velocity ratio to identify their usage to predict focusing locations and the onset of breaking for deep and intermediate wave groups along the lines of seiffert and ducrozet 2016 seiffert et al 2017 the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the background and theoretical underpinnings of wind wave interaction specifically the schematics of the jeffrey s modified sheltering mechanism this is followed by detailed mathematical formulations of the numerical model of hos nwt in section 3 the detailed formulae for jeffrey s modified sheltering mechanism consistent with the numerical model are presented in section 4 the exact set up and values of the numerical parameters of hos nwt are then documented in section 6 finally in sections 7 and 8 the key results are summarised and conclusions for the study drawn up 2 the wind wave model the mechanism of the generation of wind waves has been described by miles shearing theory miles 1957 the mechanism is a result of rayleighs equation used for describing the evolution of weak inviscid perturbations in a parallel shear flow at the critical height over the water surface where the wind velocity with respect to a frame moving with the phase velocity of the wave train vanishes rayleighs equation becomes singular hence the curvature of the mean wind profile governs an instability mechanism that drives the energy exchange from the wind to the water surface the pressure changes over the water surface having a wave train as a result of this mechanism inducing a form drag over the wave the reader is referred to belcher and hunt 1998 for a thorough review of wind wave interaction models for short duration rogue wave events it has however been argued that form drag induced by the changing pressure is better described by jeffrey s sheltering mechanism instead of miles theory touboul et al 2008 it has been argued by touboul et al 2008 that this possible mechanism is about three times stronger than miles in case of focused waves wherein the ideal situation for the dominance of this mechanism has been created jeffreys sheltering mechanism jeffreys 1925 was the first plausible mechanism to explain the necessary shift of the atmospheric pressure required for an energy transfer from the wind to the waves this mechanism assumes the wind blowing impinging the windward side of a steep wave train and separating at the leeward side of the steepest crest and then further reattaching as a vortex on the windward side of the following wave this vortex creates a pressure imbalance between the windward and leeward sides of the water surface and is responsible for the form drag a piv study of wind flow on the leeward side of the breaking waves by reul et al 1999 supports the hypothesis of the sheltering mechanism the case for jeffrey s mechanism is further strengthened by the demonstration that air flow separation is responsible for large increments in the form drag banner 1990 for the application of jeffrey s mechanism in numerical models the local steepness of the waveform must be monitored in order to detect a steep wave event this is achieved by setting a threshold local wave slope which activates the sheltering mechanism whenever the local slope exceeds this value kharif et al 2008 since the pressure drag is borne out of an attached vortex on the leeward side of the wave profile jeffrey s sheltering mechanism is applied over the full extent of the steep wave i e between the two successive zero upcrossings that contain the extent of the wave exceeding the threshold slope julien touboul private communications this methodology is referred to as modified sheltering mechanism in this paper 3 mathematical formulations for hos nwt 3 1 governing equations we consider a two dimensional problem of propagating water waves in finite depth and closed by lateral non periodic boundaries of a wave flume the domain d x y boundary on the left is enclosed by the piston type wavemaker while the right lateral boundary is formed by the right wall of the flume as shown in fig 1 the origin of the coordinate system lies at the undisturbed free surface of the fluid with x direction towards the wave propagating direction and y direction as the wave elevation the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible while the flow motion is assumed irrotational allowing the fluid velocity u to be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential function ϕ x y t i e u ϕ x ϕ y as a consequence of the fluid incompressibility the potential function satisfies laplaces equation and the governing field equation is given by 1 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 0 d x y the vertical boundary of the water wave problem is characterized by the following three equations viz the bottom boundary condition 2 the kinematic free surface boundary condition 3 and the dynamic free surface boundary condition 4 2 ϕ y 0 y h 3 η t ϕ x η x ϕ y 0 y η x t 4 ϕ t 1 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ y 2 g η p a ρ w 0 y η x t herein y η x t is the free surface representation g is the acceleration due to gravity p a is the pressure at the free surface and ρ w the density of water the effect of surface tension is assumed to be negligible as such the dynamic free surface boundary condition 4 corresponds merely to pressure continuity across the free surface at the lateral boundaries we have 5 ϕ x d x d t x x y t 6 ϕ x 0 x l where l is length of the wave flume and x y t is the movement of the piston type wavemaker with time t for the purpose of free surface dynamics the dimensions of the above problem can be reduced by the introduction of free surface velocity i e ϕ s x t ϕ x η x t t equations 3 and 4 can then be written in the form of zakharov representation i e 7 η t ϕ s x η x w w ˆ η 2 8 ϕ s t g η 1 2 ϕ s x 2 w 2 2 w 2 ˆ 2 η 2 p a ρ w in the above equations the operator x refers to horizontal derivative in the free surface coordinate system and w refers to the vertical velocity at the free surface i e w ϕ y y η x t in equations 7 and 8 the reader is referred to schaffer 2008 for the discussion regarding relationship between the vertical velocity w and its usage viz w ˆ and w 2 ˆ in 7 and 8 respectively 3 2 extension of hos to non periodic boundaries the classical hos method dommermuth and yue 1987 west et al 1987 employs periodic basis functions for a rectangular domain thus making it extremely efficient for free and periodic lateral boundary conditions however the main testing facility for ocean engineering problems are the wave flumes the boundaries of these flumes along with their wavemakers do not conform to lateral periodic boundaries for a one to one correspondence between the testing flume and simulations in a numerical wave tank it is necessary that the exact boundaries of the testing flume are numerically simulated in the numerical wave tank as such it becomes highly challenging to adapt the hos method to a wave flume while preserving its fast computational efficiency this was first handled by agnon and bingham 1999 using the concept of the additional potential ϕ a d d which is added to the periodic spectral potential ϕ s p e c to obtain the total non periodic potential ϕ this can be written as 9 ϕ ϕ s p e c ϕ a d d in order to solve for the total potential ϕ the additional potential ϕ a d d must be solved first the additional potential then becomes a forcing term in equations 7 and 8 when rearranged the forcing term is then used to solve for the spectral potential ϕ s p e c in the classical hos manner agnon and bingham 1999 idea has been adapted by bonnefoy et al 2006a b for a spectral formulation based numerical wave tank later on ducrozet et al 2012 extended this model to include hos formulations 3 3 hos nwt the numerical model described by ducrozet et al 2012 is a hybrid of stokes type formulation along with hos model the former is used to calculate the wavemaking addition potential ϕ a d d while hos type formulations describe the evolution of the waveform at arbitrary order in the physical space ducrozet et al 2012 in their paper have referred hos type formulations as high order spectral tank host formulations which is the basis of computer code hos nwt the host formulation is modification of equations 7 and 8 in the following decomposed form due to equation 9 i e 10 η t ϕ s p e c s x η x w 2 w ˆ 2 η x 2 ϕ a d d x η x ϕ a d d y 11 ϕ s p e c s t g η 1 2 ϕ s p e c s x 2 w 2 2 w ˆ 2 η x 2 p a ρ w ϕ s p e c s x ϕ a d d x ϕ a d d t 1 2 ϕ a d d x 2 ϕ a d d y 2 in the above host formulation equations viz 10 and 11 it must be noted that w is calculated with respect to ϕ s p e c from the above equations it becomes evident that ϕ a d d that in order to determine η and ϕ s p e c s at each timestep ϕ a d d must be computed beforehand in order to compute ϕ a d d we look at the stokes type expansion of the wavemaker problem i e 12 ϕ x y t ϕ 1 x y t ϕ 2

further note that η and p a is not further expanded in hos zakharov type expansion as opposed to stokes type dommermuth and yue 1987 expanding each ϕ i about y 0 in a taylor series expansion substituting them back in equations 1 6 and then rearranging the according to their stokes order we have until third order of expansion ducrozet et al 2012 16 2 ϕ i x 2 2 ϕ i y 2 0 o n d x y 17 ϕ i y

about y 0 and thus the terms containing vertical derivative of pressure profile at y 0 are avoided for the expressions a i at i 1 2 3 we have a 1 0 a 2 x 1 2 ϕ 1 x 2 x 1 y ϕ 1 y a 3 x 2 2 ϕ 1 x 2 x 1 2 ϕ 2 x 2 x 1 2 2 3 ϕ 1 x 3 ϕ 1 y x 2 y ϕ 2 y x 1 y similarly for the expressions b i and c i at i 1 2 we have b 1 0 c 1 0 b 2 η 1 2 ϕ 1 y 2 η 1 x ϕ 1 x c 2 η 1 2 ϕ 1 t y 1 2 ϕ 1 x 2 ϕ 1 y 2 the next step is to use agnon and bingham 1999 expansion i e ϕ i ϕ a d d i ϕ s p e c i i 1 2 note that host formulations equations 10 11 at third order of wave making require ϕ a d d ϕ a d d 1 ϕ a d d 2 ϕ a d d 3 having obtained ϕ a d d 1 and ϕ a d d 2 ϕ a d d 3 can be obtained from equation 19 for i 3 as such the expressions for b 3 and c 3 are not required as a check against the correctness of the equations setting p a i 0 i e the usual no wind case will recover back the equations in hughes 1993 the formulations of ducrozet et al 2012 use the pressure term formulations as local function designed to absorb the incoming energy at the opposing end of wavemaker and therefore take a specific form in their paper we have however kept the generalised form as it should appear in host formulations subsequently localised wind pressure is calculated whenever localised sheltering mechanism is activated see section 4 next ϕ s p e c is spectrally expanded in the following form 22 ϕ s p e c i x y t n 0 n x ϕ n i t cosh k n y h cosh k n h cos k n x y 0 where k n n π l this implies that ϕ s p e c is expanded in terms of the sloshing modes of wavetank and hence satisfies neumann conditions at the wall of the flume x 0 and x l the above expression also implies that the bottom boundary condition for ϕ s p e c is also satisfied on the other hand for the resolution of ϕ a d d similarity between equations 19 and 20 is noted exploiting this similarity bonnefoy et al 2006a have expanded the domain to include what they call as a unified wavemaker the added domain d a d d consists of the reflection of domain d x y about y 0 followed by the vertical translation of the reflected image such that the total depth of the domain d a d d is h a d d h bonnefoy et al 2006a ducrozet et al 2012 the reflected and the original wavemaker are smoothly connected for a continuous solution to ϕ a d d bonnefoy et al 2006a this construction is followed by writing the spectral expansion of ϕ a d d i as 23 ϕ a d d i x y t p 0 n y α p i t cosh k p l x cosh k p l cos k p y h y 0 where k p p π h a d d h this implies that ϕ a d d i satisfies the neumann boundary conditions at y h y h a d d and x l the coefficients α i t are obtained from the wavemaker boundary conditions at each order i it must be noted that only the boundaries of d a d d are used to evaluate ϕ a d d the reader is referenced to ducrozet et al 2012 section 3 1 3 for the details of the numerical algorithm of hos nwt at each time step the numerical beach feature of hos nwt is turned off in this study as the effects of reflection remain far off from the focusing location in this study 4 modified jeffrey s sheltering mechanism following the discussion in section 2 the wind pressure according to jeffreys 1925 can be related to the local wave slope as 24 p j e f f ρ a s u c 2 η x where ρ a is density of air s is the sheltering coefficient u is the wind velocity and c is the phase velocity of the wave this wind pressure is applied to equation 8 whenever the local slope exceeds a threshold value η x thresh since jeffreys sheltering mechanism is based upon a non separated vortex on the leeward side of the facing slope the effect of the vortex on the pressure is supposed to be felt over one local wavelength of the waveform this observation is in conformity with the piv results of reul et al 1999 as discussed in section 2 as a result equation 24 is locally applied over one wavelength whenever within that wavelength the threshold slope is exceeded following kharif et al 2008 the sheltering coefficient s is taken as 0 5 while the threshold slope η x thresh is taken as 0 35 in this paper it can be observed from the form of equation 24 that a wind velocity less than the phase celerity u c can substantially increase the amplification in the energy content of a focusing wave as compared to a situation when u c 0 however it is expected that in such a case the strength of the shed vortex will be limited resulting in a very weak sheltering coefficient as such s 0 5 represents a saturated value of the sheltering coefficients for u c 0 the total free surface pressure is given as p a p j e f f and used along with host formulation the extension of these formulae to stokes order is likewise p a i p j e f f i at each order for each of the investigated constant steepness spectra the phase speed is taken as the linear phase speed of the central frequency of the spectrum given the modification in the original hos nwt code has been made in a way such that pressure term plays a consistent role in the expansions both in stokesian orders and hos orders see expansions of a i b i and c i in section 3 3 5 methodology for wave generation the phase speed method relies on the linear superposition of wave components constructively to achieve focusing according to linear theory the wave surface elevation can be written as 25 η x t j 1 n f a j cos k j x ω j t β j where a j is the amplitude of the jth wave components k j is the jth wave number ω j is the wave angular frequency 2 π f j f j being frequency and β j is the phase shift n f is the total number of wave frequency components k j and ω j are related by the dispersion relation ω j 2 g k j tanh k j h following sr15 we choose the spectrum as constant steepness spectrum hence the a j s can be determined from s k j a j j where s is the constant steepness of the spectrum the piston paddle motions can be determined from the biesel s linear transfer function while β j depend upon the desired focusing location x t and time t t it has however been shown by hudspeth and sulisz 1991 that with a finite amplitude of paddle motion apart from the desired waveform and the bound harmonics a spurious free wave is also generated in order to suppress this spurious wave generation schäffer 1996 has provided second order transfer functions in the form of a double infinite series for the details and discussion of the complete second order corrected application of schäffer 1996 to sr15 experiments the reader is refered to sriram et al 2015 6 numerical setup following sr15 the length of the wavetank taken is l 110 m while still water depth is h 0 7 m for all our cases the domain d a d d is discretized with n x horizontal modes and 2 n y vertical modes where n x 1357 and n y 65 the resolution of the vertical geometry of the wavemaker n y is based upon the recommendations of bonnefoy et al 2006b while a numerical convergence gives us the appropriate n x see section 7 1 thus for the numerical model the limiting time step is based upon the minimum of either the cfl condition or the stability of the runge kutta time marching scheme for the stability of the algorithm we keep the sampling frequency of the output well below these recommended values it must be noted that the time step actually varies since we adopt the adaptive time marching algorithm of cash and karp 1990 the numerical model of hos nwt needs input of the wave maker motion at each order we pre calculate the wavemaker motions at each stokes order including the leading and trailing time ramps according to the sampling frequency documented in sr15 thereafter these motions are stored in a spline form and interpolated at each time step of the adaptive time marching scheme note that the nonlinear stokes order of the wave maker used to calculate ϕ a d d is different from hos order which is taken all over as a constant i e m 5 with full dealiasing the order of wave making in this study is either taken as linear or second order corrected each case studied in this paper is signified by a central frequency f c the bandwidth factor δ f f c the number of wave components n f the gain factor g a where π g a k c a c the time of focusing t t and the order of wave making see table 1 for details the focusing point for all considered cases is taken as x t 21 m for the modified jeffrey s sheltering mechanism the threshold local wave slope is taken as 0 35 while the sheltering coefficient is taken as 0 5 kharif et al 2008 the relevant non breaking cases of sr15 considered are tested for four following wind velocities viz 2 m s 4 m s 6 m s and 8 m s it must be noted that in many of documented and undocumented cases of sr15 the maximum local slope does not exceed the local threshold slope for modified jeffrey s model and as such these are not included in the study of wind wave interactions we are applying this wind model only to the non breaking cases of sr15 however for the instances of high wind speed it is expected that wave breaking would occur thus the onset of wave breaking has to be identified by a threshold parameter as hos models are incapable of identifying this phenomenon unfortunately there is hardly any agreement on such a threshold parameter and its form among researchers chalikov and babanin 2012 however in our study we found that a simple kinematic parameter b x see section 7 4 for discussions based on local water particle velocity on the free surface versus the local waveform velocity separates out sr15 non breaking cases from breaking ones at the onset of wave breaking the simulations are stopped 7 results and discussion 7 1 numerical convergence in this section we present the numerical convergence tests for the choice of horizontal modes n x for hos order of m 5 the case f068b20028 is chosen as representative for a non breaking test case while the case f068b20034 is tested for convergence representative of a breaking wave group four values of n x have been chosen viz 513 1025 1357 and 2049 modes for non breaking wave group fig 2 shows the convergence of probe readings close to the focusing point the convergence achieved with n x as 1357 is within 1 2 of sr15 experiments except for a slight phase difference with regards to the breaking wave group the simulation is stopped when onset of wave breaking is detected see section 7 4 fig 4 shows the variance of the probe elevation time series as function of probe location for non breaking case f068b20028 the convergence improves as the mode number increases on the other hand for case f068b20034 the very low values with respect to sr15 experiments are due to premature stoppage of simulations when the breaking onset is detected herein as well for n x 513 it can be seen that convergence has been achieved implying that more or less breaking onset is detected at roughly same time and location fig 3 documents the rise of the onset of breaking parameter with each of the modes it is seen that n x 513 underpredicts the parameter threshold and thereafter considerable phase difference is observed between sr15 probes readings with respect to hos nwt for other values however the breaking onset parameter is in close proximity to one another along with very little difference prior to exceedance of breaking threshold as a result n x 1357 is chosen as an optimal value with respect to the appropriate resolution of the wave groups and computational time this value is of the same order as used by seiffert et al 2017 in their studies 7 2 validation of hos nwt this section discusses the validation of the numerical model for the cases as documented in sr15 in total 26 wave groups with a constant steepness spectrum and focusing based upon phase velocity mechanism have been validated including breaking and non breaking wave groups table 1 lists all the wave packets validated in this study including wave groups that were not extensively documented in sriram et al 2015 fig 5 shows the comparison between the wavemaker signal and probe elevations at x x t 16 165 m for case f068b20028 w068nb2 in sr15 a slight variation in the initial and final time ramps has been adopted for hos nwt when compared to sr15 cases due to numerical issues the experimental time ramps have a c1 discontinuity which can t be used with hos as a result a function of the form provided in chiang et al 2005 equation 15 4 3 is used in hos for time ramps overall the wavemaker signals and probe measurements away from the focusing point show a good agreement with sr15 cases figs 6 and 7 shows the comparisons of the energy spectral density esd spectrum of the probe farthest off from the focusing region x x t 16 165 m for central frequencies of 0 68 h z and 1 08 h z these esd spectra have been obtained by fitting a 40 sec tukey tapered cosine window around the maximum of the highest surface elevations measured by the wave probe it can be seen that the spectra of both the central frequencies in the region of primary wave components shows a very good match between sr15 experiments and hos nwt simulations since sr15 experiments have been conducted for a range of bandwidth δ f f c 0 5 0 75 1 0 the general trend of the spectra with respect to the difference between the linear and second order corrected measurements is that the second order corrected ones show a clear demarcation between the primary sub and super harmonic wave components this is particularly exemplified for the smallest bandwidth δ f f c 0 5 where the dips at the ends of primary wave band separates them out from the sub and super harmonics increasing the bandwidth of the free waves means that they overlap with the sub and superharmonic frequencies and therefore the observations are not so clearly demarcated sriram et al 2015 comparison of the hos nwt simulations and sr15 experiments in sub and super harmonic wave bands show only a qualitative match i e compared to linear wave making second order corrected wave making shows relative increase in the sub harmonic energetics but the effect is relatively smudged compared to sr15 experiments one important difference between the second order corrected signals in hos nwt versus sr15 experiments has been that while experiments in sr15 show a complete elimination of free spurious waves when subject to wavemaking signals based on schäffer 1996 theory probe measurements in hos nwt show that spurious waves still remain although they are significantly diminished in fact the strength of spurious wave in linearly generated waves are greater in hos nwt as compared to sr15 so the second order signal in case of hos nwt incorrectly estimates the spurious content and therefore the correction to it applied by second order signal is apparently not enough at this point of time it is not clear whether this small difference is due to the different nature of the initial ramps deployed in hos nwt and sr15 or is it due to the computational issues in hos theory in order to confirm the above mentioned differences in hos nwt and sr15 s order corrections we adopt the methodology of sr15 to differentiate between primary sub and super harmonics sriram et al 2015 section 4 1 2 from their methodology the subharmonic frequencies as classified as those below f l o w while super harmonics as those above f h i g h see table 1 fig 8 shows the differences in the surface elevation contributions from selected sub harmonic components scaled by a factor of 5 in both linear case f068a10019 and second order case f068a20019 wavemaking sriram et al 2015 with respect to non breaking wave groups the simulated hos nwt cases clearly show a shifting of the focusing location away from the theoretical focusing baldock et al 1996 fig 9 shows the typical evolution of maximum downcrossing wave heights near to the focusing points prior to the focusing point the measurements of hos nwt and sr15 follow a similar pattern the experimental packets of sr15 however seem to be dominated by viscosity as focusing points are approached hos nwt is based on potential theory and therefore viscosity is unaccounted for in these models fig 10 gives a sense of the maximum crest to trough measurements given at the probes for hos nwt simulations vis avis the experimental measurements of sr15 for all non breaking cases far from the focusing points the results agree within 5 of each other while closer to the focusing point the measurements of hos nwt are confined to within 8 of the experimental results the main outliers outside this range here come from two cases in hos nwt simulations viz f108c10030 and f108c20030 the outlying results come from an abrupt attentuation of downcrossing crest to trough heights near x x t 0 6 m and x x t 0 85 m as confirmed by fig 11 figs 12 and 13 show a comparison between probe measurements and corresponding one sided esd spectra of hos nwt and sr15 cases close to focusing locations for the case f068b20028 fig 14 show the comparison of the same case for the selected wave probes corresponding to sriram et al 2015 locations with hos nwt with regards to the evolution of the wave spectrum from pre to post focusing stage the spectra of these locations establishes the leakage of energy from the primary components to higher frequencies 1 0 h z and lower frequencies 0 4 h z confirming the findings of sr15 7 3 testing jeffrey s modified sheltering in hos nwt following the discussion in sections 2 and 4 the modified sheltering mechanism is tested for the evolution of wave group generated by group velocity mechanism see 5 in hos nwt the tested wave group is similar to the documented wave group in touboul et al 2006 with η x thresh taken as 0 5 for wind speeds of 4 m s and 6 m s the linear rate of frequency modulation for this wave group is continued for 23 5 sec with maximum frequency as 1 85 hz and minimum frequency as 0 80 hz the amplification factor for a near constant amplitude 0 0084 m wave group thus generated is plotted against the length of the wave tank in fig 15 the threshold for a wave breaking parameter in the study by touboul et al 2006 was taken as local wave slope exceeding tan 30 0 58 as such if this criterion is applied to wind speed of 6 m s the wave group breaks which is not observed in touboul et al 2006 however the difference turns out to be minor since re running the simulation with criterion as just above 0 6 allows the simulation to run for full length of time thus we find qualitative equivalence with the important conclusions of touboul et al 2006 viz the wave height of the group is amplified in presence of wind without a substantial shifting of focusing location along the wind direction see fig 15 7 4 onset of wave breaking since hos models are based upon the eulerian form of free surface boundary conditions they are unable to model a breaking wave scenario in most cases for a plunging type wave group the computations will usually break down at the first instance of singularity in the taylor expansions about the mean surface according to our experience with the simulations even this observation does not hold true for marginal plunging cases this is because in such cases a local steepening before plunging is aliased with high order modes in hos without a numerical blow up geometric parameters based on notion of wave slope are also not robust enough these notions can be based upon the exact local wave slope observed touboul et al 2006 or a wave by wave analysis of the observed waveform saket et al 2017b the threshold from these are generally deduced from limit on the wave slope of a stokes wave however there are wide variations in their computations and applicability in the literature e g touboul et al 2006 and barthelemy et al 2015a however onset of wave breaking is primarily a local phenomenon and therefore stokes limit probably serves as a necessary but not a sufficient limit this is also borne out in our simulations see table 2 for local slope and s c computations thus a parameter which captures the local nature of the onset of wave breaking along with dynamic considerations of energy flux is to be preferred over simple geometric parameters to this effect many researchers have concentrated over the local flux of energy beneath the wave surface many studies see stansell and macfarlane 2002 and references cited therein have tried to quantify the ratio of local dynamic flux with respect to the local waveform velocity as a dynamic parameter for predicting onset of wave breaking in absence of dynamic wind pressure this parameter reduces to a kinematic parameter b x comparing the local surface velocity of the water particle to the local waveform velocity a major issue in the calculation of local phase velocities is the myriad ways it can be calculated this issue has been extensively discussed in a recent study by seiffert et al 2017 and includes techniques like local crest tracking and the formula suggested by fedele 2014 with respect to numerical and physical experiments of barthelemy et al 2015a and saket et al 2017b the local phase velocity is obtained from a crest tracking technique due to computational issues the aforementioned techniques are considered inadequate seiffert et al 2017 as a result seiffert et al 2017 have suggested the method of kurnia and van groesen 2014 as the most consistent and computationally superior to all others considered a critique of the approach of kurnia and van groesen 2014 equation 26 is that the formulation is limited to 2d wave groups and only serves as an approximation to exact local phase velocity moreover seiffert et al 2017 also point out that in some cases the slowdown of the wave group prior to focusing is over estimated the local wave form velocity c x can be computed from the imaginary part of hilbert analytic signal of the surface elevation ℍ η kurnia and van groesen 2014 as 26 c x x t g tanh k x t h k x t k x t 1 η 2 ℍ η 2 η ℍ η x ℍ η η x thus b x u x c x where u x is the local horizontal water particle velocity at the free surface recent experiments as well as numerical studies for deep water waves barthelemy et al 2015b saket et al 2017b simulations have suggested the threshold for this parameter to be 0 85 the experiments by saket et al have recently been validated in hos nwt by seiffert and ducrozet 2016 for deep water groups using equation 26 the excellent performance of b x in predicting the onset of the wave breaking seems to be be due to the fact that a local focusing of a wave group slows down the local crest velocity substantially 20 from those predicted by stokes theory baldock et al 1996 banner et al 2014 while there is a spurt in the local particle velocity at the crest the theoretical study on deep water waves by fedele 2014 explains this phenomenon as a consequence of the dispersion relationship which for narrow banded groups can be explained within the framework of schrodinger s equation the role of nonlinearity seems to set an upper bound towards this slowdown fedele 2014 banner et al 2014 following focusing the local crest velocity again accelerates leading to a typical forward backward leaning of the local waveform since b x is essentially a local parameter this study also employs this parameter for the prediction of onset of wave breaking although the constant steepness spectra used in this study are rather intermediate f c 0 68 h z and deep water f c 1 08 h z wave groups for these conditions the threshold for b x is determined by calculating this parameter for all breaking and non breaking conditions of sr15 the maximum b x observed for a non breaking case of sr15 is for f c 0 68 hz and is approximately 0 882 while all of the breaking packets cross the threshold of 0 9 conservatively the breaking threshold based upon b x is taken as 0 9 fig 16 shows the typical observed rise in the maximum value of b x with respect to time for non breaking and breaking wave groups in general in accordance with sriram et al 2015 it is observed that the spurious waves in linear wavemaking make the focusing more susceptible to breaking during the computation of b x it has been noted that the maximal values for each time step show an occasional local peak this computational anomaly is not present if the simulations are run for even higher hos order e g m 11 however the higher order runs are computationally expensive and are avoided in most cases as such this occasional spurt has been ignored unless it crosses the breaking threshold b x 0 9 in which case the simulation is re run for higher orders the source of this anomaly needs to be investigated further in addition to this it is also observed that the grid location of maximum b x is close to the observed focusing location of a non breaking wave group in sr15 however the reported breaking locations in sr15 are not in accordance with the location of exceedance of threshold b x it should be noted that the b x is used as a parameter to predict the onset of wave breaking as such the onset location could be vastly different from the visual observation of breaking as reported in sr15 moreover the study in sr15 didn t focus upon the characterisation of wave breaking in cases considered therein table 2 summarises the various wave breaking diagnostics for all cases of sr15 in absence of wind in conformity with seiffert and ducrozet 2016 b x for deep water breaking wave groups exceeds 0 85 this value is in accordance with barthelemy et al 2015a and saket et al 2017b even though the methodology for the calculation of local phase velocity is different with respect to breaking onset for intermediate wave groups a preprint of experimental results by saket et al 2017a claim this value to be 0 835 this is lower than the value claimed by barthelemy et al 2015b i e 0 85 in this study the onset of wave breaking parameter b x for intermediate water depth is upper bounded by 0 9 for the non breaking case f068c20030 in table 2 the maximum observed value for b x is 0 88 this is however greater than barthelemy s it is known that for a given frequency the water waves slowdown as they move into shallower waters but they also become more susceptible to breaking hence it is not completely clear at this moment as to reason behind the discrepancy between this study and saket s recent experiments by saket et al 2017b suggest that the threshold doesn t change much in presence of wind forcing although the presence of wind seems to have a calming effect raising the threshold by 2 as such b x 0 9 is taken as the threshold parameter for the onset of wave breaking in presence of wind as well 7 5 focusing in presence of wind table 2 documents the maximum local slope observed in the evolution of the wave packets in absence of wind since jeffrey s modified sheltering mechanism is incumbent upon local exceedance of wave slope above a threshold value 0 35 that means in only a few of sr15 cases in which the maximum local wave slope is greater than the threshold value are of interest the selected wave packets are further documented in tables 3 6 for wind speed 2 m s 4 m s 6 m s and 8 m s respectively these selected wave groups have their bandwidth ratio δ f f c greater than 0 5 the simulations in hos nwt are stopped whenever the maximum value of b x see saket et al 2017b for definition of b x in presence of non trivial surface pressure exceeds 0 9 signifying the onset of wave breaking the localised nature of the sheltering mechanism in space as well as time means that the mechanism kicks in only during the focusing stages the focusing stages are however dominated by short wave modes and therefore higher local wave steepness the energy transfer from the wind to the wave form therefore seem to favour the higher modes as observed in the spectral energy distribution based on fourier transforms as observed by baldock et al 1996 the fourier basis functions are of very limited value due to their globalised nature for processing a localised time series like a focusing wave as such the fourier spectra figs 19 and 20 in absence of wind is only very nominally different from that in presence of wind figs 21 and 22 show a short time fourier transform stft for two probes one each for case f068b20028 and f108c20030 respectively the stft is based on a half overlapping blackman window of about 5 s and sampling rate of 50 hz it can be seen from the heat map of esd that the mechanism favours the higher frequencies just above 2 hz but remains very weak with regards to non breaking cases b x 0 9 and probe locations far off from the theoretical focusing point x t the esd spectrum of the simulated wave groups doesn t change since the modified sheltering mechanism is inactive see fig 17 for case f068c10030 close to the theoretical focusing location it is observed that the increase in wind speeds amplifies the energy content in the spectrum the nature of modified sheltering mechanism means that the energy transfer happens in short bursts of cyclical rise and fall of crest slope and is hence very weak the cyclical activity of sheltering mechanism is observed to differ in two forms in the first one where threshold slope rises and falls in one cycle while in another energy transferred in a prior cycle of activity of sheltering mechanism is enough to overshoot the threshold slope in the next cycle in a manner similar to group celerity focusing fig 18 the weakness of the energy transfer mechanism led to questions over whether the focusing methodology i e group celerity versus phase speed focusing or the usage of type of spectra constant amplitude versus constant steepnes is responsible in order to verify that one needs to simulate the same groups with the same focusing heights in either of the combinations while monitoring the rise of maximum grid slope in case of focusing methodology this is not exactly possible this is because the linear principles of group celerity methods predict an infinite focusing elevation rising as t t t 1 2 kharif et al 2009 while phase celerity method predicts a finite elevation inspite of this inexact translatability efforts were made to simulate a near constant amplitude wave packet the same in section 7 3 using both methodologies in absence of wind it was observed that close to focusing time the pattern of rise in total energy and maximum grid slope of both the wave groups was very similar this observation more or less eliminated the possibility of variations between the focusing methods in case of usage of constant steepness versus the constant amplitude both spectra were simulated using phase celerity methods in absence of wind for the case f108b20020 this meant that wave group corresponding to constant amplitude spectrum would possess approximately 84 of energy of the wave group corresponding to constant steepness spectrum based upon linear calculations however as documented in fig 23 one can see that a constant amplitude sustains larger slopes for larger duration than constant steepness spectrum hence the slope exceedances above the threshold slope for the modified sheltering mechanism would be stronger and longer in constant amplitude than constant steepness spectrum this means that the energy transfer via the work done on the free surface by the pressure form drag will be low and hence the amplification would also be limited in duration for a constant steepness spectra thus explaining the weakness of energy transfer mechanism shifting back to focusings in presence of wind we observe that for wind speed of 8 m s the rise in energy levels can happen over two cycles and is responsible for the marked difference in the timings of the activity of the sheltering mechanism with respect to wind speed of 6 m s in addition to a jump in energy levels itself the jump in energy levels is linear or stepped wise linear depending upon whether the transfer happens over one or two cycles of exceeding thresholds respectively when these cycles coincide with the wavemaking duration the rise in energy looks rippled see fig 24 although sheltering mechanism is stronger than miles mechanism the short duration of its activity means that in order to transfer substantial energy to a focusing mechanism the threshold slope must be crossed repeatedly since in sr15 experiments the wave groups were designed to reach the focusing only once or twice within a wave group modulation the maximum total energy transferred is of the order of 5 only only groups close to the onset of breaking see a rapid rise in energy levels while for others still higher wind speeds 8 m s can be sustained without breaking these values of wind speeds are highly unlikely and therefore not investigated the combination of non linear interactions within the wave components in conjunction with energy transfer from sheltering mechanism means that the effect of wind pressure is felt across all components however there seems to be a difference in the intermediate and deep water group behaviour with regards to wave groups the data can only be analysed for restricted wind speeds as onset of breaking in higher wind speeds stops the simulations prematurely the deductions from the observed behaviour can hence only be inferred from groups classified as non breaking b x 0 9 for wave groups in intermediate water depth f c 0 68 h z a difference in the behaviour of surface elevation contributions from subharmonic frequencies on one hand and due to primary and superharmonics is apparent the frequencies classified below f l o w are dominated by the dynamics of set down while those above are dominated by the focusing mechanism fig 19 shows the influence of wind on frequency spectra close to focusing locations for case f068b20028 the influence of wind on setdown is observed to be minimal while the focusing in primary and superharmonics do get amplified but very weakly fig 25 as a result the amplification in downcrossing wave heights is observed to be of the order of 1 cm only in general in the absence of wind the evolution of spectrum in the focusing and defocusing stages transfers energy from above f l o w to smoothen the spectrum across the superharmonics the sheltering mechanism simply modifies the energy content during this process but not the energy transfer mechanism itself in all these processes the frequencies below f l o w remain unaffected the spurious free wave in the linear wavemaking processing crosses the focusing location before the focusing process and is also unaffected by the sheltering mechanism with regards to deep water wave groups f c 1 08 h z a key difference from intermediate groups is that the strength of the setdown is markedly small about 5 10 times smaller in absence of wind the conformity of deep water simulations in hos nwt with sr15 cases is better with regards to contributions from subharmonics in the absence of strong setdown the dynamics of all frequencies including the subharmonics is governed across the spectrum by non linearity of the spectrum with minimal effect from the water depth the spectrum structure varies as there are two focusing defocusing stages with different characteristic steepness in each of these stages although spectrum evolution in both stages show a similar behaviour figs 20 and 27 figs 26 and 27 document the rise of maximal crest to trough wave heights registered by wave probe measurements along the length of the tank it can be observed from figs 26 and 27 and tables 2 6 that the actual focusing location in presence of wind remains the same within one or two grid points of the focusing in absence of wind with defocusing slightly delayed for linear wavemaking the role of wind is therefore limited to the amplification of amplitudes only and any effect on the local phase celerity is not discernible this observation is in line with the numerical results of touboul et al 2006 the shift in focusing location in presence of wind in experimental results of kharif et al 2008 is therefore due to the wind induced currents roughly 2 3 of wind speeds on which the waveform seems to ride with regards to breaking cases b x 0 9 the location of exceedance of the threshold is closer to the focusing location this is however an artifact of the localised nature of the modified sheltering mechanism since the breaking location is unknown the maximal of b x is not enough in predicting the breaker type or the visibly developed location of breaking the rate of rise of b x is related to the rate of energy input and should be related to energy dissipation per unit length of breaker fronts drazen et al 2008 this investigation is however beyond the scope of this study and shall be attempted in future 8 conclusion second order corrected wave groups based on schäffer 1996 theory of wave making have been used in sr15 to study focusing in wave groups with a constant steepness spectrum this study uses numerical simulations in hos nwt to corroborate both the corrected and uncorrected wave groups studied in sr15 furthermore the focusing in the same groups have been studied in wind speeds of 2 8 m s the wind model is based upon jeffrey s modified sheltering mechanism which has been argued to be more dominant for rogue waves arising out of focusing mechanism kharif et al 2008 the effect of the sheltering mechanism is primarily in the amplification of maximal crest to trough wave heights near the focusing location there seems to be no discernible shift in focusing location in presence of wind when compared to its absence moreover the energy transfer post focusing seem to be dominated by high frequencies these observations coupled with the fact that b x for non breaking waves reaches its maximum near focusing location means that the local phase celerity doesn t change under the influence of the sheltering mechanism the modified sheltering mechanism is however found to be very weak as it is dependent on short bursts of crossing of threshold slopes the investigations show that a comparable constant amplitude spectrum sustains the exceedance of slopes over a larger period of time as opposed to constant steepness spectra used in sr15 experiments and this study as such wave groups corresponding to a constant steepness spectra contain over a cycle or two of bursts of exceedance of threshold slope and thus the sheltering mechanism is not able to transfer substantial energy to these wave groups during the simulation time however it is completely possible that over a larger period of time multiple events of crossing of threshold slope occur given that the wave groups are periodic in space and time a difference in spectrum evolution of intermediate and deep water groups studied are also observed subharmonic frequencies in the intermediate groups are relatively unaffected by an energy transfer happening across the frequency spectra at various locations in the focusing defocusing stage on the other hand almost all of the spectrum is affected by the energy transfer for the deep water groups the addition of sheltering mechanism to this process only amplifies the energy levels but doesn t seem to affect the transfer towards higher frequencies in the focusing defocusing cycle with regards to breaking waves it has been observed in these wave groups that the onset of breaking is signified whenever b x exceeds a threshold of 0 9 in absence of any wind forcing the same threshold is kept for classifying waves groups as breaking and non breaking the sheltering mechanism for strong winds is observed to turn the marginal wave groups towards the onset of breaking acknowledgements the authors would like to thank dr guillaume ducrozet lheea ecn nantes france for providing the open source code hos nwt which has been modified by the authors for

23337,in the fields of naval architecture and ocean engineering applications floating platforms or multi hull vessels with very different geometrical appearance have been designed to meet their mission requirements many objects were built by composing a number of sub objects in an arbitrary way because of the high flexibility available for the construction work because the composition of the sub objects normally are not arranged along a certain direction in a fixed sequence it could be sometimes troublesome for computing the hydrostatic data of such objects in order to facilitate this computation more easily and flexibly a method has been developed in this paper which was derived from the simple principles of an exact pressure integration over triangles for getting the total buoyancy force vector and the static equilibrium condition between the buoyancy force and the weight of the floating object the triangles thereby were generated by triangulation of the surfaces representing a whole floating object finally applications on a high speed trimaran hull and a floating kuroshio current turbine were conducted for demonstrating the merit of this method the placement of water compartments and free surface effects were further analysed to evaluate the changing ballast conditions for hydrostatic and transitional stabilities keywords hydrostatics and stability static pressure integration surface triangulation trimaran floating kuroshio turbine 1 introduction ship terminology defined a hull geometry in three orthogonal directions bodyplan waterplan and sheerplan these plans are related to stations waterlines and buttocks correspondingly on which an offset table is constructed it is a common format to define a hull geometry and to analyse its hydrostatics and stability performance the analysis involves area and volumetric properties and also static properties such as moment moment of inertia and centre of buoyancy etc so that a numerical integration method for processing geometries is needed just before the fast development of computer technology in recent decades different integration methods have been widely applied such as trapezoidal or simpson s methods which can be easily founded in a series of well known naval architecture textbooks such as barrass and derrett 2006 biran and pulido 2013 dudszus and danckwardt 1982 kobylinski and kastner 2003 lewis 1988 and rawson and tupper 2001 these methods are applicable to regular shapes whose geometrical changes along a longitudinal direction are smooth in addition the shape has to be presented in a well structured format an offset table for ships can meet these requirements however the main deficiency of this integration approach is that the volumetric properties are calculated by integrating area properties which are again by integrating line properties the double integral operation can accumulate errors from insufficient resolution of the offset table and from the numerical methods so modern ocean structures involving abrupt geometrical changes for instance multi hull vessels and ocean platforms suffered difficulties to evaluate their performances in the traditional way nevertheless most offshore units are structured by simple mathematical geometries for example rectangular box cylinder sphere and prism analytical solutions for area and volumetric properties bronshtein et al 1997 exist for such geometrical components that the whole properties can be calculated by summation or parallel axis theorem paul 1979 but this is not the case for other shapes beyond simple mathematical expressions also in the case of determining the transverse statical stability an approach by making a distinction of small and large angles of heel is usually given in the aforementioned textbooks the reason to take the approach is due to the fact that the waterlines with different heel angles may cut the stepwise cross sections in different manners if the heel angle is small the resulting intersection point of a waterline and the ship side can be assumed to be vertical wall sided in this case a simplified relationship can be easily derived between the transverse stability and the heeling angle for large angles of heel precise results can also be gotten by more elaborately formulated equations this method shows however a disadvantage with two separate steps which is kind of annoying some analytical formulation for arbitrary 2d shape and implementations in matlab wu 2005 duan et al 2015 have been done and can provide accurate results however a more general three dimensional method with single integrated computing process is inevitable to calculate hydrostatic properties of an arbitrary configuration of geometry on the other hand the determination of floating states for bodies subject to external loads in some scenarios requires a root finding process in other words this process finds the position and orientation of a watertight body so that all forces and moments are balanced usually the matrix methods was used to calculate the floating states zhao lin 1985 kopecky 2007 for each iteration the waterplan area centre of floatation moment of inertia displacement volume and centre of buoyancy are calculated and filled in the jacobian matrix not only the computational workload is high but also those geometrical properties might suffer inaccuracies in the traditional approach as described apart from the gradient based solver another method of nonlinear programming used to calculate the floating state of ships was proposed ma et al 2003 2007 it established the absolute value of the total recovery arm as the objective function to ensure that the displacement is equal to the weight as the constraint condition and the optimization of the mathematical model for the design variables is the draft compared with the traditional matrix method the method in each iteration does not need to calculate the surface properties instead just calculating the tilts of displacement volume and centre of buoyancy and hence reducing amount of calculation greatly but the nonlinearity of hydrostatic properties requires some remeshing techniques lee lee 2016 others treated this optimization problem by the genetic arithmetic lu et al 2005 2006 jin et al 2007 in which the free float calculation is summed up as a multi objective constraint optimization problem according to the free floating condition of ships since it is based on the calculation of surface expression it does not need a given initial iteration point only the total weight and centre of gravity of the ship are need in addition it uses the draught pitch angle and roll angle as the design variables directly without the calculation of the tangent value of the dip angle compared with other iterative methods it is more accurate than the methods based on two dimensional representation to summarize the drawbacks of current geometrical process for hydrostatics are the erroneous double integration of offset tables and limited analytical solutions for mathematical shapes the former further reduces the performance of determining floating states the present method derives the analytical solution to hydrostatic pressure for triangulated surfaces which avoids numerical integration and breaks the limitation of mathematical shapes the overhead of the proposed method is the additional triangulation operation which is another topic about surface grid preparing and to present large numbers of triangles of a body requires relatively larger files to store and also higher memory usage 2 methodology 2 1 surface triangulation and intersection in computer aided geometry modelling a surface is usually presented in parametric form i e u and v direction in unit domains piegl and tiller 2013 gallier 2000 isoparametric curves are easy to extract from a surface by holding one parameter constant simply interleave the isoparametric curves in u and v directions a structure grid can be obtained triangulating the structured grid into triangle panels is connecting diagonal vertexes of each cell as shown in fig 1 advanced controls such as aspect ratio maximum edge length and maximum deviation from surface are on demand the closed hull surface and compartment geometry are triangulated with normal directions point into fluids geometrically speaking the waterplans of a floating body and the free surface inside a compartment in calm water are intersections of a flat plane and 3d closed surfaces since these surfaces are triangulated it is the problem that intersects triangles with a plane four conditions is illustrated in fig 2 and an intersection exist in case ii and case iii where h represents the immersed or above depth in out of water an intersected segment must be a straight line starts and ends on the edges of the triangle which are also straight lines so the calculation of the end points of this line is simply by calculating an intersection of a plane and line segments of the triangle edges after obtaining the end points on the edges in case iii the immersed triangle is a special case of case i that one edge lies on the plane for case ii the immersed part is a quadrilateral which can be further divided into two sub triangles both reduced to case i so the immersed part of a triangulated surface can be represented as a set of triangles which will be resolved hydrostatic pressures a special case that a triangle lies perfectly on the plane the case v in fig 2 and generate a jump of waterplan change will be specifically treated in the following section this condition does not effect on the pressure since its water head is zero the outcome of the intersection of a plane and a closed meshed surface is one or several planar polygons as shown in fig 3 the polygon contour is constructed by n vertices and n linear segments and the x and y are the coordinates of vertices the area properties including enclosing area a centre of polygon c x and c y and moments of inertia about the polygon centre in x and y directions i x and i y are analytically calculated by eqs 1 3 the values in y direction are obtained by swapping the terms in the first parenthesis x to y in eq 2 and y to x in eq 3 these equations are derived from 2d triangle properties which constitutes the basic element of a polygon 1 a 1 2 i 0 n 1 x i y i 1 x i 1 y i 2 c x 1 6 a i 1 n 1 x i x i 1 x i y i 1 x i 1 y i 3 i x 1 12 i 1 i n 1 y 2 i y i y i 1 y 2 i 1 x i y i 1 x i 1 y i 2 2 hydrostatic pressure the overall pressure of the floating body is by summing up pressure of each immersed triangle j which can be formulated in its parametric form in 3d space a position vector r on the triangle is expressed as eq 4 where u and v are parameters defined in 0 1 and 0 1 u domains r 0 r 1 and r 2 are the vertices of the triangle r 01 and r 02 are vectors from r 0 to the other two vertices the pressure acting on r is proportional to the water depth from free surface of which elevation is zero in the present setup the water density is ρ so the water head is the z component of r denoted a scalar r z integrating the pressure over the triangle domain and get eq 5 the pressure force can be calculated simply by multiplying the depth of the centroid of the triangle r c and triangle area we can go through a lengthier derivation of the moment and enforcing it zero to find the position where an equivalent point pressure force acting on as in appendix this result is written in eq 6 and the terms in the brackets are defined as the force centre r f as shown in fig 4 4 r u v r 0 r 01 u r 02 v 5 p j a ρ g r u v z n j d a j ρ g r c z n j a j 6 m j ρ g a j 1 12 r c z 9 r c z r c r 0 z r 0 r 1 z r 1 r 2 z r 2 n j ρ g a j 1 12 r c z r f n j 2 3 statical stability the calculation of hydrostatic data of a ship is necessary to obtain its hydrostatic performance the calculations include areas centroids moments of inertia of areas volumes and centres of volume these properties are plotted as functions of draught in curves which are displacement v longitudinal centres of floatation lcf and buoyancy lcb waterplan area a w vertical centre of buoyance vcb and metacentre km km l displacement is calculated by archimedes principle which the displaced fluid weight is equal to the total pressure force calculated by eq 5 area properties of floatation plane is the intersection contour of the geometry set of triangles and a flat plane eq 7 is used to calculate metacentre radii bm t and bm l respectively in longitudinal and transverse directions where i x and i y are the moments of inertia of floatation plane already defined in eq 3 7 b m t i x v b m l i y v however the above equation is derived based on the assumptions of small angle inclination and on the vertical wall assumption fig 5 defines the inclination angle ө wall tangent angle φ and half breadth y 0 at the waterplan intersection for arbitrary geometries the vertical wall condition is seldom met so it is necessary to derive the applicability of eq 7 for non vertical wall condition i e φ is not a right angle it is going to prove the area of the shaded triangle approaches zero for small angle inclination ө tends to0 in the enlarged view of this shaded triangle in fig 5 the sine rule states that the triangle area is 8 area 1 2 y 0 tan θ s sin 90 θ 1 2 y 0 tan θ y 0 tan θ sin 90 φ sin φ θ sin 90 θ 1 2 y 0 2 tan 2 θ cos θ cos φ sin φ cos θ cos φ sin θ for small angle inclination ө tan ө ө sin ө ө and cos ө 1 so 9 area 1 2 y 0 2 θ 2 cos φ sin φ θ cos φ the vertical wall condition φ 90 the area directly becomes zero which is the basis of deriving equation 7 also the fraction is finite to justify the area approaches zero except φ 0 the horizontal tangent if we take this condition in the above equation 10 area 1 2 y 0 2 θ 2 1 θ 1 2 y 0 2 θ so even at the extreme the area will not be singular instead it becomes zero when applying the small angle inclination to conclude equation 7 is applicable at any occasion as the waterplan exists this implies that the waterplan properties should always be single valued and hence the volumetric properties are first order differentiable if all the triangles do not perfectly lie on the horizontal plane at any occasions the described requirement is satisfied and then the waterplan properties can be calculated otherwise the program will give a warning message and calculate the average values of both conditions of existence and nonexistence of perfectly on plane triangles the averaging treatment guarantees the applicability of euler s method for solving balance condition 2 4 free surface effect of internal fluids to deal with partially filled compartments two problems should be addressed the compartment model is the same as the triangulated surface but in the normal direction inwards so that the hydrostatic procedure is identical as prescribed except the internal waterplan elevation and the containing fluid density ρ in are separately configured according to filled rate of each compartment when compartments are filled with certain amounts of fluids the total weight and centre of mass are changed so that a new equilibrium should be found this is done in an iterative manner since the centres of mass of compartments are also functions of the trim angle the iteration algorithm is by solving euler s method updating sinkage and trim step by step within each step bi section method is used to find the fluid level of each compartment for a given volume and trim angle after the equilibrium is achieved the free surface effect is then corrected during the procedure to find the internal fluid levels the intersection contour of an inclined plane and compartment geometry also a set of triangles is found then the moments of inertia of this small free surface plane about transverse i x and longitudinal axis i y are calculated the virtual centre of gravity is calculated according to eq 11 the location of a compartment affects the total centre of gravity while the free surface correction only depends on the shape of the free surface in the compartments 11 g

conducted by using commercial software orca3d on rhinoceros cad platform to evaluate its hydrostatics against various draft and stability curves at design condition the principal dimensions of this vessel is listed in table 1 at its design draft which submerges the side hulls partially the ship weight is 1400 tons the baseline of side hulls is 2 5 m above the keel line and the bottom stern shape of the main hull is a wedge the two geometrical features will make the hydrostatic curves bent very sharply alone draught the origin is set at the transom stern of the main hull towards bow a horizontal cylinder compartment at midship in the main hull shown in fig 6 the volume of the cylinder is 317 m3 the whole hull form is triangulated into 7150 vertexes and 11854 panels and the compartments are done in the same way as well the cylinder compartment blue uses 1225 vertexes and 2256 triangles the trimaran s hydrostatic properties are calculated at its even keel condition the draught is from 0 8 m to 7 0 m with 0 1 m stepped the longitudinal metacentric height km l waterplan area a w and displacement v are drawn in dashed curves in fig 7 reading the upper scale units while the other four lcf lcb kb and km are drawn in solid curves reading the lower scale units black squares are the three dashed values computed by orca3d and black crosses are four solid values two results agree with each other very well the differences across the entire draft domain are less than 1 except the displacement is slightly overpredicted at deep draught this might be due to the different methods computing the displacement orca3d follows integrating waterplan areas respect to draft which is prone to accumulate errors to deeper draught on the other hand the present method uses analytical solution to obtain buoyant volume back to the characteristics of this trimaran there are two sharp cusps on the km l curve at 1 5 m draught this is the critical draught depth that breaks the waterplan into two contours as shown in fig 8 the stern area of the wedge abruptly occurs and also increases waterplan area sharply another effect is the longitudinal centre of floatation moves toward stern which also makes a bent on lcf the other unsmooth position is at 2 5 m where the side hulls begin to touch water because the side waterplans are placed away from center line small areas can create large moment of inertias transversally on the transverse metacentre curve km the value dramatically increases after 2 5 m draught and shows a trimaran s characteristics of high stability at its maximum of 19 m the volumetric properties kb lcb and v in contrast are smooth the second validation metric is the statical stability curve at design condition the initial displacement is 1400 tons lcg was set as lcb to keep even keel position the heel angle was calculated from 0 to 90 stepped 2 5 during the evaluation process displacement and lcg were kept constant so that sinkage and trim were dynamically balanced under various heel angles fig 9 compares the results of present method solid and dashed curves and orca3d crosses and squares the righting lever in meters were plotted on the left axis and the trim angle in degrees were on the right we can see very high accuracy of the present method the maximum difference of righting lever is less than 0 7 and of trim angle is 1 5 lower than orca3d only at high heel angles the trim angle is the outcome of balanced of lcg and lcb for the latter which is also a volumetric property the present method uses analytical solution to resolve center of buoyant force r f without erroneous integration approach 3 2 ballast conditions the design ship centre of gravity is set at 35 78 m 0 0 m 7 5 m according to its design specifications at even keel condition the light ship weight is 1400t configurations of the compartment filled ratio is from zero empty to 1 0 full 0 1 stepped because of a known total volume of this compartment water level inside is solved at a given volume of fluid and then updating the overall centre of gravity to find the equilibrium trim angle until the pitch moment converges to zero fig 10 plots trim angle sinkage and overall longitudinal centre of gravity versus filling ratio since the compartment is located in front of midship the ballast water causes lcg moved forward and further trimmed by bow sinkage increased due to the increment of the ballast fig 11 plots vcg vcb km and free surface effect kg v the ballast also lowed the centre of gravity down due to the location of the compartment increment in sinkage resulted in the raise of buoyancy centre the maximum free surface effect occurred at about half filled ratio where the free surface area is maximum the gm eff though is decreased by the ballast but the overall effect of ballast increased gm 3 3 floating kuroshio turbine to demonstrate the capability of the present method for highly irregular multibody the floating kuroshio turbine fkt is an incentive design of the offshore renewable energy program in taiwan fkt is designed for avoiding environmental loads during the typhoon season fig 12 shows its construction components and table 2 lists its principal dimensions fkt is composed of four parts nacelle white rotors orange buoy blue and struts yellow and red fkt is moored at the tips of the nacelle to the seabed which means the rotors are downwind the shape of the buoy is a large foil and has nine compartments as shown in fig 13 by controlling seawater pumping in out across of the compartments fkt is allowed to adjust its immersion depth and trim angle so that it not only keeps even position but dives deeply to prevent waves induced by typhoons and floats for maintenance operation the foil shape of the buoy also provides hydrodynamic lift forces under uneven position the proposed hydrostatic method was extended further for fkt which is subjected to mooring and hydrodynamic forces in additional to the operation condition the transitional stability during the launching process is evaluated in the following sections under normal operation and steady kuroshio current fkt is expected to align with the current direction without yaw and roll due to its downwind design this simplified the degree of motion to 2d vertical plane motion i e surge heave and pitch steady position and trim angle are then the result of balance of the total force and pitching moment demonstrated in fig 14 the four forces in the diagram are gravity force g buoyancy force b mooring force t and hydrodynamic force f without the free surface effect under normal operation the hydrodynamic force f of the whole body and rotors are functions of trim angle and were evaluated by time consuming cfd software in advance this term is treated as an external force interpolated from table 3 the buoyancy force is calculated by the present method while we are going to obtain a steady solution the mooring force t is assumed always the same magnitude of the sum of the other three but in opposite direction so that the total force is zero so the remaining unknown the trim angle is solved iteratively for the total moment reaches zero as well it is not going to discuss the complex mooring mechanics but simply assume the mooring line is a rigid rope without bending or stretching and pinned onto the seabed at depth 200 m as long as the length of the rope is given the relative position of fkt to the pin is just a trigonometric operation in the non filled ballast conditions the center of gravity of ballast water is also a function of trim treated as the same way as in the trimaran case the ballast control follows the steps all empty compartments then pump water into the fore compartments until full then transfer the ballast from fore compartments to the aft finally pump the ballast out from the aft compartments until empty and return to the initial condition table 4 lists the results where a b c stands for the filling ratio of the compartments it can show the variations of total weight and centre of gravity during each step the ballast water increased the total weight and raised kg in the transferring step trim angle was dramatically increased which provided an angle of attack of the buoy hence an upward lift force pulled the body closer to sea surface for the deepest immersion the fore compartments were full this is physically correct since the most ballast pressed on the fore part and thus made the buoy generating a negative lift and forced the body down it is clearly shown in fig 15 that to avoid the wavy surface in typhoon the ballast should be moved forward while for the maintenance it is moved backward then pumped out the other scenario of fkt is the launching process which should be conducted at calm sea condition without current the rotors are locked in position and the mooring line is loose so there are no hydrodynamic and mooring forces initially fkt with empty compartments is floating evenly on the sea surface by pumping the ballast in the fore and aft compartments simultaneously but with different rates fkt will sink evenly until fully submerge during this diving process fkt should acquire sufficient hydrostatic stability in both longitudinal and transverse directions so that a disturbance would not flip the body this is termed as the transitional stability which is critical for submarines so there are one ballast control way for even position which is solved first then the determination of its transitional stability i e gm versus submergence is conducted the free surface effect caused by the partially filled compartments during the process is counted the same way as in the trimaran case fig 16 defines the centres of gravity kg buoyancy kb and metacentres km l and km t fig 17 plots the immersed depth and lcg in meters on the left axis against the total ballast water filling ratio from empty 0 95 just reaches neutral balance of buoyancy and gravity forces as the thickness of the bouy is not large an additional 0 5 m draft from its initial position caused full submergence the blue curve is the fore to aft compartment filling ratio on the right axis and it indicates that ballast pumped into the aft compartments should be faster than into the fore at the beginning for an even keel position until 40 total ballast moment the pumping rates inverse under this control fkt retains even keeled during its diving process then the longitudinal and transversal stabilities were calculated at each sinkage position for a full submerged condition the floatation plane vanishes i e bm and bm l are zeros shown in figs 18 and 19 that the metacentres collide with buoyancy centres at 95 total filling ratio also as the increment of submergence by pumping ballast into the above buoy the centres of gravity and buoyancy were both raised an interesting note about the free surface effect is that the virtual centres of gravity were maximized at half ballast condition this appears to be caused by the maximum waterplan area inside the buoy at it 50 filling ratio last but not least the transversal stability is considerably larger than longitudinal one not only due to the aspect ratio of the buoy is relative low but also contribution of the transversal bulkheads which reduce the moment of waterplan area by nine times 4 conclusions the study presents a general method to calculate hydrostatic performance based on the analytical solution of static pressure on a triangle arbitrary surface configurations only require closed volume are triangulated and intersected with different calm water levels the waterplan area properties are analytically treated as planar polygons multi hull ship is demonstrated and validated by its hydrostatic performance at different drafts and statical stability at design condition compartment is also modelled in the same way as hull surface but only flip its surface normal direction inwards ballast fluid can be controlled via a filled ratio the level inside the compartment and a new equilibrium trim and sinkage are solved iteratively finally the free surface effect is corrected and stated as a virtual centre of gravity that is above the original one and hence reduced stability the other demonstrating example the floating kuroshio turbine the irregular body shape is composed of different parts fkt is subjected to two additional forces the hydrodynamic forces and mooring line the proposed method showed its capability of dealing with such a complex problem to determine its balanced position and trim angle which are critical references in the preliminary design stage an extensive usage of the method is to calculate the transition stability during a launching process of fkt like a submarine fkt is controlled by a buoyancy engine which pumps ballast water in out of the compartments the controlling procedure for keeping fkt even keel is obtained then its stabilities during the diving process are calculated appendix mathematical derivations for the analytical solution of hydrostatic pressure on a fully submerged triangle are described three non colinear positional vectors r0 r1 and r2 present the vertices of a triangle as fig a 1 below fig a 1 parametric representation of a triangle fig a 1 then define two vectors r 01 and r 02 from r 0 to the other two vertices a 1 r 01 r 1 r 0 a 2 r 02 r 2 r 0 then the triangle can be presented in parametric form as eq a 3 and differentiate r respect to u and v for later use eq a 4 a 3 r u v r 0 r 01 u r 02 v for 0 u 1 and 0 v 1 u a 4 r u v u r u r 01 r u v v r v r 02 and we use subscript z represents the z component of a position vector the water head is the z component of r denoted a scalar r z the pressure force p on the triangle is the integration of every infinitesimal element over the entire parametric domain as a 5 p p d a u 0 u 1 v 0 v 1 u ρ g r u v z n u v r 01 r 02 d v d u where the normal of the triangle is a 6 n r 01 r

23337,in the fields of naval architecture and ocean engineering applications floating platforms or multi hull vessels with very different geometrical appearance have been designed to meet their mission requirements many objects were built by composing a number of sub objects in an arbitrary way because of the high flexibility available for the construction work because the composition of the sub objects normally are not arranged along a certain direction in a fixed sequence it could be sometimes troublesome for computing the hydrostatic data of such objects in order to facilitate this computation more easily and flexibly a method has been developed in this paper which was derived from the simple principles of an exact pressure integration over triangles for getting the total buoyancy force vector and the static equilibrium condition between the buoyancy force and the weight of the floating object the triangles thereby were generated by triangulation of the surfaces representing a whole floating object finally applications on a high speed trimaran hull and a floating kuroshio current turbine were conducted for demonstrating the merit of this method the placement of water compartments and free surface effects were further analysed to evaluate the changing ballast conditions for hydrostatic and transitional stabilities keywords hydrostatics and stability static pressure integration surface triangulation trimaran floating kuroshio turbine 1 introduction ship terminology defined a hull geometry in three orthogonal directions bodyplan waterplan and sheerplan these plans are related to stations waterlines and buttocks correspondingly on which an offset table is constructed it is a common format to define a hull geometry and to analyse its hydrostatics and stability performance the analysis involves area and volumetric properties and also static properties such as moment moment of inertia and centre of buoyancy etc so that a numerical integration method for processing geometries is needed just before the fast development of computer technology in recent decades different integration methods have been widely applied such as trapezoidal or simpson s methods which can be easily founded in a series of well known naval architecture textbooks such as barrass and derrett 2006 biran and pulido 2013 dudszus and danckwardt 1982 kobylinski and kastner 2003 lewis 1988 and rawson and tupper 2001 these methods are applicable to regular shapes whose geometrical changes along a longitudinal direction are smooth in addition the shape has to be presented in a well structured format an offset table for ships can meet these requirements however the main deficiency of this integration approach is that the volumetric properties are calculated by integrating area properties which are again by integrating line properties the double integral operation can accumulate errors from insufficient resolution of the offset table and from the numerical methods so modern ocean structures involving abrupt geometrical changes for instance multi hull vessels and ocean platforms suffered difficulties to evaluate their performances in the traditional way nevertheless most offshore units are structured by simple mathematical geometries for example rectangular box cylinder sphere and prism analytical solutions for area and volumetric properties bronshtein et al 1997 exist for such geometrical components that the whole properties can be calculated by summation or parallel axis theorem paul 1979 but this is not the case for other shapes beyond simple mathematical expressions also in the case of determining the transverse statical stability an approach by making a distinction of small and large angles of heel is usually given in the aforementioned textbooks the reason to take the approach is due to the fact that the waterlines with different heel angles may cut the stepwise cross sections in different manners if the heel angle is small the resulting intersection point of a waterline and the ship side can be assumed to be vertical wall sided in this case a simplified relationship can be easily derived between the transverse stability and the heeling angle for large angles of heel precise results can also be gotten by more elaborately formulated equations this method shows however a disadvantage with two separate steps which is kind of annoying some analytical formulation for arbitrary 2d shape and implementations in matlab wu 2005 duan et al 2015 have been done and can provide accurate results however a more general three dimensional method with single integrated computing process is inevitable to calculate hydrostatic properties of an arbitrary configuration of geometry on the other hand the determination of floating states for bodies subject to external loads in some scenarios requires a root finding process in other words this process finds the position and orientation of a watertight body so that all forces and moments are balanced usually the matrix methods was used to calculate the floating states zhao lin 1985 kopecky 2007 for each iteration the waterplan area centre of floatation moment of inertia displacement volume and centre of buoyancy are calculated and filled in the jacobian matrix not only the computational workload is high but also those geometrical properties might suffer inaccuracies in the traditional approach as described apart from the gradient based solver another method of nonlinear programming used to calculate the floating state of ships was proposed ma et al 2003 2007 it established the absolute value of the total recovery arm as the objective function to ensure that the displacement is equal to the weight as the constraint condition and the optimization of the mathematical model for the design variables is the draft compared with the traditional matrix method the method in each iteration does not need to calculate the surface properties instead just calculating the tilts of displacement volume and centre of buoyancy and hence reducing amount of calculation greatly but the nonlinearity of hydrostatic properties requires some remeshing techniques lee lee 2016 others treated this optimization problem by the genetic arithmetic lu et al 2005 2006 jin et al 2007 in which the free float calculation is summed up as a multi objective constraint optimization problem according to the free floating condition of ships since it is based on the calculation of surface expression it does not need a given initial iteration point only the total weight and centre of gravity of the ship are need in addition it uses the draught pitch angle and roll angle as the design variables directly without the calculation of the tangent value of the dip angle compared with other iterative methods it is more accurate than the methods based on two dimensional representation to summarize the drawbacks of current geometrical process for hydrostatics are the erroneous double integration of offset tables and limited analytical solutions for mathematical shapes the former further reduces the performance of determining floating states the present method derives the analytical solution to hydrostatic pressure for triangulated surfaces which avoids numerical integration and breaks the limitation of mathematical shapes the overhead of the proposed method is the additional triangulation operation which is another topic about surface grid preparing and to present large numbers of triangles of a body requires relatively larger files to store and also higher memory usage 2 methodology 2 1 surface triangulation and intersection in computer aided geometry modelling a surface is usually presented in parametric form i e u and v direction in unit domains piegl and tiller 2013 gallier 2000 isoparametric curves are easy to extract from a surface by holding one parameter constant simply interleave the isoparametric curves in u and v directions a structure grid can be obtained triangulating the structured grid into triangle panels is connecting diagonal vertexes of each cell as shown in fig 1 advanced controls such as aspect ratio maximum edge length and maximum deviation from surface are on demand the closed hull surface and compartment geometry are triangulated with normal directions point into fluids geometrically speaking the waterplans of a floating body and the free surface inside a compartment in calm water are intersections of a flat plane and 3d closed surfaces since these surfaces are triangulated it is the problem that intersects triangles with a plane four conditions is illustrated in fig 2 and an intersection exist in case ii and case iii where h represents the immersed or above depth in out of water an intersected segment must be a straight line starts and ends on the edges of the triangle which are also straight lines so the calculation of the end points of this line is simply by calculating an intersection of a plane and line segments of the triangle edges after obtaining the end points on the edges in case iii the immersed triangle is a special case of case i that one edge lies on the plane for case ii the immersed part is a quadrilateral which can be further divided into two sub triangles both reduced to case i so the immersed part of a triangulated surface can be represented as a set of triangles which will be resolved hydrostatic pressures a special case that a triangle lies perfectly on the plane the case v in fig 2 and generate a jump of waterplan change will be specifically treated in the following section this condition does not effect on the pressure since its water head is zero the outcome of the intersection of a plane and a closed meshed surface is one or several planar polygons as shown in fig 3 the polygon contour is constructed by n vertices and n linear segments and the x and y are the coordinates of vertices the area properties including enclosing area a centre of polygon c x and c y and moments of inertia about the polygon centre in x and y directions i x and i y are analytically calculated by eqs 1 3 the values in y direction are obtained by swapping the terms in the first parenthesis x to y in eq 2 and y to x in eq 3 these equations are derived from 2d triangle properties which constitutes the basic element of a polygon 1 a 1 2 i 0 n 1 x i y i 1 x i 1 y i 2 c x 1 6 a i 1 n 1 x i x i 1 x i y i 1 x i 1 y i 3 i x 1 12 i 1 i n 1 y 2 i y i y i 1 y 2 i 1 x i y i 1 x i 1 y i 2 2 hydrostatic pressure the overall pressure of the floating body is by summing up pressure of each immersed triangle j which can be formulated in its parametric form in 3d space a position vector r on the triangle is expressed as eq 4 where u and v are parameters defined in 0 1 and 0 1 u domains r 0 r 1 and r 2 are the vertices of the triangle r 01 and r 02 are vectors from r 0 to the other two vertices the pressure acting on r is proportional to the water depth from free surface of which elevation is zero in the present setup the water density is ρ so the water head is the z component of r denoted a scalar r z integrating the pressure over the triangle domain and get eq 5 the pressure force can be calculated simply by multiplying the depth of the centroid of the triangle r c and triangle area we can go through a lengthier derivation of the moment and enforcing it zero to find the position where an equivalent point pressure force acting on as in appendix this result is written in eq 6 and the terms in the brackets are defined as the force centre r f as shown in fig 4 4 r u v r 0 r 01 u r 02 v 5 p j a ρ g r u v z n j d a j ρ g r c z n j a j 6 m j ρ g a j 1 12 r c z 9 r c z r c r 0 z r 0 r 1 z r 1 r 2 z r 2 n j ρ g a j 1 12 r c z r f n j 2 3 statical stability the calculation of hydrostatic data of a ship is necessary to obtain its hydrostatic performance the calculations include areas centroids moments of inertia of areas volumes and centres of volume these properties are plotted as functions of draught in curves which are displacement v longitudinal centres of floatation lcf and buoyancy lcb waterplan area a w vertical centre of buoyance vcb and metacentre km km l displacement is calculated by archimedes principle which the displaced fluid weight is equal to the total pressure force calculated by eq 5 area properties of floatation plane is the intersection contour of the geometry set of triangles and a flat plane eq 7 is used to calculate metacentre radii bm t and bm l respectively in longitudinal and transverse directions where i x and i y are the moments of inertia of floatation plane already defined in eq 3 7 b m t i x v b m l i y v however the above equation is derived based on the assumptions of small angle inclination and on the vertical wall assumption fig 5 defines the inclination angle ө wall tangent angle φ and half breadth y 0 at the waterplan intersection for arbitrary geometries the vertical wall condition is seldom met so it is necessary to derive the applicability of eq 7 for non vertical wall condition i e φ is not a right angle it is going to prove the area of the shaded triangle approaches zero for small angle inclination ө tends to0 in the enlarged view of this shaded triangle in fig 5 the sine rule states that the triangle area is 8 area 1 2 y 0 tan θ s sin 90 θ 1 2 y 0 tan θ y 0 tan θ sin 90 φ sin φ θ sin 90 θ 1 2 y 0 2 tan 2 θ cos θ cos φ sin φ cos θ cos φ sin θ for small angle inclination ө tan ө ө sin ө ө and cos ө 1 so 9 area 1 2 y 0 2 θ 2 cos φ sin φ θ cos φ the vertical wall condition φ 90 the area directly becomes zero which is the basis of deriving equation 7 also the fraction is finite to justify the area approaches zero except φ 0 the horizontal tangent if we take this condition in the above equation 10 area 1 2 y 0 2 θ 2 1 θ 1 2 y 0 2 θ so even at the extreme the area will not be singular instead it becomes zero when applying the small angle inclination to conclude equation 7 is applicable at any occasion as the waterplan exists this implies that the waterplan properties should always be single valued and hence the volumetric properties are first order differentiable if all the triangles do not perfectly lie on the horizontal plane at any occasions the described requirement is satisfied and then the waterplan properties can be calculated otherwise the program will give a warning message and calculate the average values of both conditions of existence and nonexistence of perfectly on plane triangles the averaging treatment guarantees the applicability of euler s method for solving balance condition 2 4 free surface effect of internal fluids to deal with partially filled compartments two problems should be addressed the compartment model is the same as the triangulated surface but in the normal direction inwards so that the hydrostatic procedure is identical as prescribed except the internal waterplan elevation and the containing fluid density ρ in are separately configured according to filled rate of each compartment when compartments are filled with certain amounts of fluids the total weight and centre of mass are changed so that a new equilibrium should be found this is done in an iterative manner since the centres of mass of compartments are also functions of the trim angle the iteration algorithm is by solving euler s method updating sinkage and trim step by step within each step bi section method is used to find the fluid level of each compartment for a given volume and trim angle after the equilibrium is achieved the free surface effect is then corrected during the procedure to find the internal fluid levels the intersection contour of an inclined plane and compartment geometry also a set of triangles is found then the moments of inertia of this small free surface plane about transverse i x and longitudinal axis i y are calculated the virtual centre of gravity is calculated according to eq 11 the location of a compartment affects the total centre of gravity while the free surface correction only depends on the shape of the free surface in the compartments 11 g v t ρ i n i x ρ v g v l ρ i n i y ρ v 3 computational examples 3 1 validation with trimaran in the presented study a 100 m high speed trimaran is selected as a validation example the benchmark was conducted by using commercial software orca3d on rhinoceros cad platform to evaluate its hydrostatics against various draft and stability curves at design condition the principal dimensions of this vessel is listed in table 1 at its design draft which submerges the side hulls partially the ship weight is 1400 tons the baseline of side hulls is 2 5 m above the keel line and the bottom stern shape of the main hull is a wedge the two geometrical features will make the hydrostatic curves bent very sharply alone draught the origin is set at the transom stern of the main hull towards bow a horizontal cylinder compartment at midship in the main hull shown in fig 6 the volume of the cylinder is 317 m3 the whole hull form is triangulated into 7150 vertexes and 11854 panels and the compartments are done in the same way as well the cylinder compartment blue uses 1225 vertexes and 2256 triangles the trimaran s hydrostatic properties are calculated at its even keel condition the draught is from 0 8 m to 7 0 m with 0 1 m stepped the longitudinal metacentric height km l waterplan area a w and displacement v are drawn in dashed curves in fig 7 reading the upper scale units while the other four lcf lcb kb and km are drawn in solid curves reading the lower scale units black squares are the three dashed values computed by orca3d and black crosses are four solid values two results agree with each other very well the differences across the entire draft domain are less than 1 except the displacement is slightly overpredicted at deep draught this might be due to the different methods computing the displacement orca3d follows integrating waterplan areas respect to draft which is prone to accumulate errors to deeper draught on the other hand the present method uses analytical solution to obtain buoyant volume back to the characteristics of this trimaran there are two sharp cusps on the km l curve at 1 5 m draught this is the critical draught depth that breaks the waterplan into two contours as shown in fig 8 the stern area of the wedge abruptly occurs and also increases waterplan area sharply another effect is the longitudinal centre of floatation moves toward stern which also makes a bent on lcf the other unsmooth position is at 2 5 m where the side hulls begin to touch water because the side waterplans are placed away from center line small areas can create large moment of inertias transversally on the transverse metacentre curve km the value dramatically increases after 2 5 m draught and shows a trimaran s characteristics of high stability at its maximum of 19 m the volumetric properties kb lcb and v in contrast are smooth the second validation metric is the statical stability curve at design condition the initial displacement is 1400 tons lcg was set as lcb to keep even keel position the heel angle was calculated from 0 to 90 stepped 2 5 during the evaluation process displacement and lcg were kept constant so that sinkage and trim were dynamically balanced under various heel angles fig 9 compares the results of present method solid and dashed curves and orca3d crosses and squares the righting lever in meters were plotted on the left axis and the trim angle in degrees were on the right we can see very high accuracy of the present method the maximum difference of righting lever is less than 0 7 and of trim angle is 1 5 lower than orca3d only at high heel angles the trim angle is the outcome of balanced of lcg and lcb for the latter which is also a volumetric property the present method uses analytical solution to resolve center of buoyant force r f without erroneous integration approach 3 2 ballast conditions the design ship centre of gravity is set at 35 78 m 0 0 m 7 5 m according to its design specifications at even keel condition the light ship weight is 1400t configurations of the compartment filled ratio is from zero empty to 1 0 full 0 1 stepped because of a known total volume of this compartment water level inside is solved at a given volume of fluid and then updating the overall centre of gravity to find the equilibrium trim angle until the pitch moment converges to zero fig 10 plots trim angle sinkage and overall longitudinal centre of gravity versus filling ratio since the compartment is located in front of midship the ballast water causes lcg moved forward and further trimmed by bow sinkage increased due to the increment of the ballast fig 11 plots vcg vcb km and free surface effect kg v the ballast also lowed the centre of gravity down due to the location of the compartment increment in sinkage resulted in the raise of buoyancy centre the maximum free surface effect occurred at about half filled ratio where the free surface area is maximum the gm eff though is decreased by the ballast but the overall effect of ballast increased gm 3 3 floating kuroshio turbine to demonstrate the capability of the present method for highly irregular multibody the floating kuroshio turbine fkt is an incentive design of the offshore renewable energy program in taiwan fkt is designed for avoiding environmental loads during the typhoon season fig 12 shows its construction components and table 2 lists its principal dimensions fkt is composed of four parts nacelle white rotors orange buoy blue and struts yellow and red fkt is moored at the tips of the nacelle to the seabed which means the rotors are downwind the shape of the buoy is a large foil and has nine compartments as shown in fig 13 by controlling seawater pumping in out across of the compartments fkt is allowed to adjust its immersion depth and trim angle so that it not only keeps even position but dives deeply to prevent waves induced by typhoons and floats for maintenance operation the foil shape of the buoy also provides hydrodynamic lift forces under uneven position the proposed hydrostatic method was extended further for fkt which is subjected to mooring and hydrodynamic forces in additional to the operation condition the transitional stability during the launching process is evaluated in the following sections under normal operation and steady kuroshio current fkt is expected to align with the current direction without yaw and roll due to its downwind design this simplified the degree of motion to 2d vertical plane motion i e surge heave and pitch steady position and trim angle are then the result of balance of the total force and pitching moment demonstrated in fig 14 the four forces in the diagram are gravity force g buoyancy force b mooring force t and hydrodynamic force f without the free surface effect under normal operation the hydrodynamic force f of the whole body and rotors are functions of trim angle and were evaluated by time consuming cfd software in advance this term is treated as an external force interpolated from table 3 the buoyancy force is calculated by the present method while we are going to obtain a steady solution the mooring force t is assumed always the same magnitude of the sum of the other three but in opposite direction so that the total force is zero so the remaining unknown the trim angle is solved iteratively for the total moment reaches zero as well it is not going to discuss the complex mooring mechanics but simply assume the mooring line is a rigid rope without bending or stretching and pinned onto the seabed at depth 200 m as long as the length of the rope is given the relative position of fkt to the pin is just a trigonometric operation in the non filled ballast conditions the center of gravity of ballast water is also a function of trim treated as the same way as in the trimaran case the ballast control follows the steps all empty compartments then pump water into the fore compartments until full then transfer the ballast from fore compartments to the aft finally pump the ballast out from the aft compartments until empty and return to the initial condition table 4 lists the results where a b c stands for the filling ratio of the compartments it can show the variations of total weight and centre of gravity during each step the ballast water increased the total weight and raised kg in the transferring step trim angle was dramatically increased which provided an angle of attack of the buoy hence an upward lift force pulled the body closer to sea surface for the deepest immersion the fore compartments were full this is physically correct since the most ballast pressed on the fore part and thus made the buoy generating a negative lift and forced the body down it is clearly shown in fig 15 that to avoid the wavy surface in typhoon the ballast should be moved forward while for the maintenance it is moved backward then pumped out the other scenario of fkt is the launching process which should be conducted at calm sea condition without current the rotors are locked in position and the mooring line is loose so there are no hydrodynamic and mooring forces initially fkt with empty compartments is floating evenly on the sea surface by pumping the ballast in the fore and aft compartments simultaneously but with different rates fkt will sink evenly until fully submerge during this diving process fkt should acquire sufficient hydrostatic stability in both longitudinal and transverse directions so that a disturbance would not flip the body this is termed as the transitional stability which is critical for submarines so there are one ballast control way for even position which is solved first then the determination of its transitional stability i e gm versus submergence is conducted the free surface effect caused by the partially filled compartments during the process is counted the same way as in the trimaran case fig 16 defines the centres of gravity kg buoyancy kb and metacentres km l and km t fig 17 plots the immersed depth and lcg in meters on the left axis against the total ballast water filling ratio from empty 0 95 just reaches neutral balance of buoyancy and gravity forces as the thickness of the bouy is not large an additional 0 5 m draft from its initial position caused full submergence the blue curve is the fore to aft compartment filling ratio on the right axis and it indicates that ballast pumped into the aft compartments should be faster than into the fore at the beginning for an even keel position until 40 total ballast moment the pumping rates inverse under this control fkt retains even keeled during its diving process then the longitudinal and transversal stabilities were calculated at each sinkage position for a full submerged condition the floatation plane vanishes i e bm and bm l are zeros shown in figs 18 and 19 that the metacentres collide with buoyancy centres at 95 total filling ratio also as the increment of submergence by pumping ballast into the above buoy the centres of gravity and buoyancy were both raised an interesting note about the free surface effect is that the virtual centres of gravity were maximized at half ballast condition this appears to be caused by the maximum waterplan area inside the buoy at it 50 filling ratio last but not least the transversal stability is considerably larger than longitudinal one not only due to the aspect ratio of the buoy is relative low but also contribution of the transversal bulkheads which reduce the moment of waterplan area by nine times 4 conclusions the study presents a general method to calculate hydrostatic performance based on the analytical solution of static pressure on a triangle arbitrary surface configurations only require closed volume are triangulated and intersected with different calm water levels the waterplan area properties are analytically treated as planar polygons multi hull ship is demonstrated and validated by its hydrostatic performance at different drafts and statical stability at design condition compartment is also modelled in the same way as hull surface but only flip its surface normal direction inwards ballast fluid can be controlled via a filled ratio the level inside the compartment and a new equilibrium trim and sinkage are solved iteratively finally the free surface effect is corrected and stated as a virtual centre of gravity that is above the original one and hence reduced stability the other demonstrating example the floating kuroshio turbine the irregular body shape is composed of different parts fkt is subjected to two additional forces the hydrodynamic forces and mooring line the proposed method showed its capability of dealing with such a complex problem to determine its balanced position and trim angle which are critical references in the preliminary design stage an extensive usage of the method is to calculate the transition stability during a launching process of fkt like a submarine fkt is controlled by a buoyancy engine which pumps ballast water in out of the compartments the controlling procedure for keeping fkt even keel is obtained then its stabilities during the diving process are calculated appendix mathematical derivations for the analytical solution of hydrostatic pressure on a fully submerged triangle are described three non colinear positional vectors r0 r1 and r2 present the vertices of a triangle as fig a 1 below fig a 1 parametric representation of a triangle fig a 1 then define two vectors r 01 and r 02 from r 0 to the other two vertices a 1 r 01 r 1 r 0 a 2 r 02 r 2 r 0 then the triangle can be presented in parametric form as eq a 3 and differentiate r respect to u and v for later use eq a 4 a 3 r u v r 0 r 01 u r 02 v for 0 u 1 and 0 v 1 u a 4 r u v u r u r 01 r u v v r v r 02 and we use subscript z represents the z component of a position vector the water head is the z component of r denoted a scalar r z the pressure force p on the triangle is the integration of every infinitesimal element over the entire parametric domain as a 5 p p d a u 0 u 1 v 0 v 1 u ρ g r u v z n u v r 01 r 02 d v d u where the normal of the triangle is a 6 n r 01 r

assumed as a harmonic shape in the following form 32 q t q e ω t where q and ω represent eigenvector and eigenvalue of the system and because the system is non conservative the eigenvalue ω generally is a complex quantity the imaginary and real parts of eigenvalue can be observed as the natural frequency and decaying rate of the system respectively substituting eq 32 into eq 30 the standard

the determinant of eq 34 provides the system characteristic equation according to the sign of the real and imaginary parts of the complex eigenvalue the stability and type of instability zones can be determined in fact for pipes containing fluid flow with supported ends pitchfork bifurcation leading to divergence is the predictable form of instability for a cantilever system however the pipe may lose its stability at sufficiently high flow velocity via a hopf bifurcation leading to flutter bahaadini and hosseini 2016b hosseini and bahaadini 2016 kheiri et al 2014 4 results and discussion a numerical study is carried out to examine the vibration and instability behavior of the fluid conveying composite pipe with four symmetric lay ups by considering the effects of elastic supports at the free end the solution of this problem through the extended galerkin approach is obtained here by eight modes j 8 also it should be noted that four composite layers are considered n l 4 moreover the critical velocities corresponding to flutter and divergence are presented and the stability and instability regions are predicted for various fiber orientation angle size of fiber volume fraction of fiber elastic boundary conditions and structural damping in all calculations the geometrical and material properties of the composite pipe conveying fluid are presented in table 1 in order to validate the present analysis of a classical isotropic pipe containing fluid flow the variations of critical flutter velocity with dimensionless mass fluid ratio obtained by the current solution are compared with those of gregory and paidoussis 1966 as shown in fig 2 an excellent agreement is observed which confirms the validity as well as the efficiency of the present analysis it should be noted that in order to compare the results with those of gregory and paidoussis 1966 the influences of the elastic supported at the free end and structural damping coefficient are assumed to be neglected in addition the comparison of the critical fluid velocities of the classical isotropic pipe are presented in table 2 and fig 3 for different boundary conditions against results presented by paidoussis 1998 and ni et al 2011 it is observed that the suggested model is actually in good agreement with previous models the dynamical behavior of the composite cantilever pipe as a function of dimensionless flow velocity u is demonstrated by the argand diagram in fig 4 a through d for different symmetric lay ups the evolution of the dimensionless complex eigenvalues of the lowest four modes are schemed for β 0 5 k l k t 0 it is should be noted that the positive value of real part of non dimensional eigenvalues means that the system is unstable but the negative one is related to a stable system when a real part of the eigenvalue changes its sign from negative to positive two important types of instability occurs whenever for i m ω 0 the system loses its stability by flutter and for i m ω 0 the system loses its stability by divergence in fig 4 a through c it is assumed that the symmetric lay ups are 0 4 0 90 s and 45 45 s respectively while the coefficient structural damping is α 0 it is shown in fig 4 a for fluid velocity u 9 33 the flow induces damping in four modes with negative real part of eigenvalues re ω 0 while for higher value of fluid velocity u the real part of the third mode begins to increase and eventually becomes positive at u u c f 9 33 this physically denotes the composite cantilever pipe loses its stability via a hopf bifurcation leading to the third mode flutter similarly in fig 4 b and c dynamic instability or flutter which in this case is commonly referred to as single mode flutter occurs in the third mode of the system at u u c f 6 82 and u u c f 5 16 respectively as it can be observed in fig 4 d the symmetric lay up 45 45 s decreases the stiffness of the composite pipe and consequently predicts the critical flutter velocity will be smaller than those predicted by the 0 90 s and 0 4 lay ups in the case of symmetric lay up 45 45 s for β 0 5 k l k t 0 and α 0 001 composite clamped free pipe loses stability via a hopf bifurcation leading to the second mode flutter it is observed that for α 0 001 the second mode locus bends upwards and crosses the axis to instability at u u c f 5 15 while the third mode locus moves towards lower negative real part of eigenvalues in order to investigate the influence of elastic boundary condition on the instability behavior the eigenvalue curves are depicted in fig 5 for composite pipe as a function of fluid velocity it is worth mention that by setting free end spring constants to zero or infinity e g if k t 0 k l and k l k t the clamped free boundary condition with k l 0 k t 0 can turn to the clamped pinned and clamped clamped boundary conditions respectively fig 5 depicts the effect of elastic boundary conditions on the variation of imaginary and real parts of dimensionless eigenvalues versus dimensionless fluid velocity corresponding to the lowest eigenvalues according to fig 5 it is observed that an increase in the fluid velocity decreases the lowest eigenvalues of composite pipes it is also observed that for composite clamped clamped pipe the imaginary part of eigenvalue is larger than the clamped free boundary condition in addition the clamped free and clamped clamped pipe conveying fluid are stable at lowest eigenvalues for 45 45 s lay up β 0 5 and α 0 001 to investigate the flutter behavior of fluid conveying composite pipe the stability diagram of pipe with three cases of lay ups is illustrated in fig 6 the lay ups are given by case1 0 4 lay up case2 0 90 s lay up case3 45 45 s lay up the variation of fiber orientation angles in each layer can also change material property and have a large influence on bending stiffness of the composite pipe it is observed that the case1 has the greatest stable region in comparison with other cases it should be noted that the velocities below the flutter velocity the vibrational motion would eventually decay at velocities above the flutter velocity any initial dynamic structural disturbance will grow thus the fluid conveying composite pipe with symmetric lay up 45 45 s will lose its stability at lower velocity of fluid compared with other cases fig 7 shows variation of the critical flutter velocities under springs constant at the free end with consideration of structural damping in term of changes in fiber orientation angle it is assumed that the fiber orientation angles are changed for different θ in θ θ s lay up it is observed that as fiber orientation angle increases the values of critical flutter velocities sharply decrease and reach to the fiber angle of θ 75 0 and have minimum values in the range of 80 0 θ 90 0 this is because bending stiffness of composite pipe has the smallest one which is 80 0 θ 90 0 moreover it can be observed that an increase in the value of structural damping the flutter velocity and frequency of the system decrease for the sake of completeness the effect of fiber orientation angle on the flutter boundaries for different θ in θ ψ s are given in fig 8 where k l k t 100 β 0 5 and α 0 001 it is indicated that by increasing the fiber angle θ the flutter velocity and flutter frequency of the system decrease as a result the minimum flutter velocity and flutter frequency of composite pipe occur at higher fiber angles of θ 90 0 and ψ 90 0 fig 9 a and b respectively illustrate the influence of the mass fluid ratio on the critical flutter velocity and flutter frequency of the system with respect to structural damping coefficient it can be observed that increasing the structural damping coefficient will increase the critical flutter velocity of the system at lower mass fluid ratio β 0 28 this is due to the fact that the structural damping has a stabilizing effect due to energy dissipation for higher value of mass fluid ratio as the structural damping increases critical flutter velocity decreases and instability region of the system accurse at lower velocity in addition it is seen that the critical frequency leading to flutter instability decreases as the structural damping increases over the whole range of mass fluid ratio depending on the values of the fluid velocity and linear translate spring at the free end occurrence of divergence or flutter instability or both instabilities are possible the critical fluid velocity as a function of spring constant is depicted in fig 10 for k t 0 α 0 and three cases of fiber orientation angles it is observed that the composite pipe loses its stability via flutter for low translational spring constant while at high value of k l the system loses its stability by both divergence and flutter in fig 10 it is also seen that both critical flutter and divergence velocities of composite pipe with 45 45 s lay up are lower than other cases flutter configurations of a cantilever composite pipe with 45 45 s lay up for k l k t 0 α 0 and different mass fluid ratio have been plotted in fig 12 a through c it is observed that the flutter configuration is strongly dependent on mass fluid ratio at u u c f it is noted that the first second third and fourth eigenvalues are defined as the oscillatory configurations with no node single node two nodes and three nodes respectively fig 11 a through c indicate the flutter configuration for β 0 1 β 0 4 and β 0 7559 where there are single node two nodes and three nodes respectively besides fig 12 have illustrated the effect of composite lay ups on the flutter configuration of a cantilever pipe conveying fluid for k l k t 0 α 0 and β 0 5 it is seen that the flutter configurations occur on the third eigenvalue as they have two nodes based on the halpin tsai micromechanics model in appendix a the stability map and the variations of the critical fluid velocity for flutter phenomenon of composite cantilever pipe with respect to size of fiber l d have been illustrated in fig 13 it is shown that the increase of l d tend to increase the critical flutter velocity and the stable area because the l d tends to increase the stiffness of the structures and to make them stiffer the effects of the volume fraction composite lay up and wall thickness on the critical flutter velocity in fig 13 a through c respectively for k l k t 100 α 0 001 and β 0 5 in fig 13 a it is demonstrated that the critical flutter velocity increases as the volume fraction increases in the other hand the results show that adding a small amount of fiber into matrix can significantly increase the stable area of the system the influences of orientation fiber and size of fiber on the critical flutter velocity have been observed in fig 13 b it is found that the flutter boundary of composite pipe with 0 4 lay up is strongly dependent on l d while it is weakly dependent on l d for composite pipe with 45 45 s lay up furthermore it is observed from fig 13 c that critical flutter velocity of the system decreases with an increases wall thickness 5 conclusion in this study the flutter and divergence instability of fluid conveying composite thin walled pipes subjected to elastic boundary conditions at the free end were investigated the equation of motion as well as associated boundary conditions were obtained by extended hamilton s principle the extended galerkin method was applied to truncate the governing partial differential equation into a set of ordinary differential equations by the eigenvalue problem of the ordinary differential equations the eigenvalues and critical fluid velocities for composite pipe were calculated by numerical method various parametric studies were performed to investigate divergence and flutter instabilities of the system by the effects of fiber orientation angles volume fraction of fiber size of fiber mass fluid ratio structural damping and elastic boundary conditions the major outcomes of this study were the critical fluid velocity decreases with increasing structural damping coefficient for higher values of mass ratios the composite thin walled pipes became unstable in the form of either divergence or flutter with the increasing fluid velocities and linear translation spring constant at the free end it was found that by increasing the mass ratio and translational spring the results predicted by 45 45 s lay up gets smaller to those obtained by the 0 90 s and 0 4 lay ups furthermore it was revealed that by increasing the value of θ in θ ψ s lay up the critical flutter velocities and frequencies of the system decrease the critical flutter velocity of composite pipe with 0 4 lay up is strongly dependent on l d while it is weakly dependent on l d for composite pipe with 45 45 s lay up furthermore the stable zone increases with increasing l d and volume fraction of fiber appendix a based on the halpin tsai micromechanics model the effective young s modulus and shear modulus of

conducted vibration analyses of the pipe made of fgm in current work stability analysis of composite thin walled cantilever pipe containing fluid flow is studied besides the effects of fiber orientation angle volume fraction of fiber symmetric composite lay up size of fiber and elastic boundary conditions on eigenvalue and critical fluid velocity of the system have been investigated cantilever pipe conveying fluid systems by the addition of spring supports may lose stability by both flutter and divergence therefore it has been a subject of great interest and a challenging research topic over the past few decades chen and fan 1987 studied the cantilever pipe additionally supported at the free end by a translational spring it was found that the dynamic interaction of the pipe and the spring may render the system unstable in the form of divergence or flutter depending on the spring stiffness several studies were conducted to examine the effect of spring support on the vibration and stability of pipe conveying fluid see for example noah and hopkins 1980 edelstein and chen 1985 sugiyama et al 1985 païdoussis et al 2007 ghayesh and païdoussis 2010 ghayesh et al 2011

wavelets finite element method to examine the numerical solutions for the vibration analysis of composite pipes kim and lee 2014 investigated the divergence and flutter behavior of beck s type of laminated box beams with symmetric and non symmetric lay ups subjected to a subtangential force nevertheless all the above mentioned studies was restricted in the problem of fluid conveying pipes made of isotropic materials for pipes containing fluid flow made of composite materials little information is available for example the vibration of composite natural gas pipelines has been investigated by zou et al 2005 they examined the effects of various parameters such as the laminate lay up fluid s velocity and pressure pipe s pre tensioning force and wall configuration on the natural frequencies in other words the available literature review indicates that there is no work which studied the effects of fiber orientation angle volume fraction of fiber symmetric composite lay up size of fiber

assumed as a harmonic shape in the following form 32 q t q e ω t where q and ω represent eigenvector and eigenvalue of the system and because the system is non conservative the eigenvalue ω generally is a complex quantity the imaginary and real parts of eigenvalue can be observed as the natural frequency and decaying rate of the system respectively substituting eq 32 into eq 30 the standard

the determinant of eq 34 provides the system characteristic equation according to the sign of the real and imaginary parts of the complex eigenvalue the stability and type of instability zones can be determined in fact for pipes containing fluid flow with supported ends pitchfork bifurcation leading to divergence is the predictable form of instability for a cantilever system however the pipe may lose its stability at sufficiently high flow velocity via a hopf bifurcation leading to flutter bahaadini and hosseini 2016b hosseini and bahaadini 2016 kheiri et al 2014 4 results and discussion a numerical study is carried out to examine the vibration and instability behavior of the fluid conveying composite pipe with four symmetric lay ups by considering the effects of elastic supports at the free end the solution of this problem through the extended galerkin approach is obtained here by eight modes j 8 also it should be noted that four composite layers are considered n l 4 moreover the critical velocities corresponding to flutter and divergence are presented and the stability and instability regions are predicted for various fiber orientation angle size of fiber volume fraction of fiber elastic boundary conditions and structural damping in all calculations the geometrical and material properties of the composite pipe conveying fluid are presented in table 1 in order to validate the present analysis of a classical isotropic pipe containing fluid flow the variations of critical flutter velocity with dimensionless mass fluid ratio obtained by the current solution are compared with those of gregory and paidoussis 1966 as shown in fig 2 an excellent agreement is observed which confirms the validity as well as the efficiency of the present analysis it should be noted that in order to compare the results with those of gregory and paidoussis 1966 the influences of the elastic supported at the free end and structural damping coefficient are assumed to be neglected in addition the comparison of the critical fluid velocities of the classical isotropic pipe are presented in table 2 and fig 3 for different boundary conditions against results presented by paidoussis 1998 and ni et al 2011 it is observed that the suggested model is actually in good agreement with previous models the dynamical behavior of the composite cantilever pipe as a function of dimensionless flow velocity u is demonstrated by the argand diagram in fig 4 a through d for different symmetric lay ups the evolution of the dimensionless complex eigenvalues of the lowest four modes are schemed for β 0 5 k l k t 0 it is should be noted that the positive value of real part of non dimensional eigenvalues means that the system is unstable but the negative one is related to a stable system when a real part of the eigenvalue changes its sign from negative to positive two important types of instability occurs whenever for i m ω 0 the system loses its stability by flutter and for i m ω 0 the system loses its stability by divergence in fig 4 a through c it is assumed that the symmetric lay ups are 0 4 0 90 s and 45 45 s respectively while the coefficient structural damping is α 0 it is shown in fig 4 a for fluid velocity u 9 33 the flow induces damping in four modes with negative real part of eigenvalues re ω 0 while for higher value of fluid velocity u the real part of the third mode begins to increase and eventually becomes positive at u u c f 9 33 this physically denotes the composite cantilever pipe loses its stability via a hopf bifurcation leading to the third mode flutter similarly in fig 4 b and c dynamic instability or flutter which in this case is commonly referred to as single mode flutter occurs in the third mode of the system at u u c f 6 82 and u u c f 5 16 respectively as it can be observed in fig 4 d the symmetric lay up 45 45 s decreases the stiffness of the composite pipe and consequently predicts the critical flutter velocity will be smaller than those predicted by the 0 90 s and 0 4 lay ups in the case of symmetric lay up 45 45 s for β 0 5 k l k t 0 and α 0 001 composite clamped free pipe loses stability via a hopf bifurcation leading to the second mode flutter it is observed that for α 0 001 the second mode locus bends upwards and crosses the axis to instability at u u c f 5 15 while the third mode locus moves towards lower negative real part of eigenvalues in order to investigate the influence of elastic boundary condition on the instability behavior the eigenvalue curves are depicted in fig 5 for composite pipe as a function of fluid velocity it is worth mention that by setting free end spring constants to zero or infinity e g if k t 0 k l and k l k t the clamped free boundary condition with k l 0 k t 0 can turn to the clamped pinned and clamped clamped boundary conditions respectively fig 5 depicts the effect of elastic boundary conditions on the variation of imaginary and real parts of dimensionless eigenvalues versus dimensionless fluid velocity corresponding to the lowest eigenvalues according to fig 5 it is observed that an increase in the fluid velocity decreases the lowest eigenvalues of composite pipes it is also observed that for composite clamped clamped pipe the imaginary part of eigenvalue is larger than the clamped free boundary condition in addition the clamped free and clamped clamped pipe conveying fluid are stable at lowest eigenvalues for 45 45 s lay up β 0 5 and α 0 001 to investigate the flutter behavior of fluid conveying composite pipe the stability diagram of pipe with three cases of lay ups is illustrated in fig 6 the lay ups are given by case1 0 4 lay up case2 0 90 s lay up case3 45 45 s lay up the variation of fiber orientation angles in each layer can also change material property and have a large influence on bending stiffness of the composite pipe it is observed that the case1 has the greatest stable region in comparison with other cases it should be noted that the velocities below the flutter velocity the vibrational motion would eventually decay at velocities above the flutter velocity any initial dynamic structural disturbance will grow thus the fluid conveying composite pipe with symmetric lay up 45 45 s will lose its stability at lower velocity of fluid compared with other cases fig 7 shows variation of the critical flutter velocities under springs constant at the free end with consideration of structural damping in term of changes in fiber orientation angle it is assumed that the fiber orientation angles are changed for different θ in θ θ s lay up it is observed that as fiber orientation angle increases the values of critical flutter velocities sharply decrease and reach to the fiber angle of θ 75 0 and have minimum values in the range of 80 0 θ 90 0 this is because bending stiffness of composite pipe has the smallest one which is 80 0 θ 90 0 moreover it can be observed that an increase in the value of structural damping the flutter velocity and frequency of the system decrease for the sake of completeness the effect of fiber orientation angle on the flutter boundaries for different θ in θ ψ s are given in fig 8 where k l k t 100 β 0 5 and α 0 001 it is indicated that by increasing the fiber angle θ the flutter velocity and flutter frequency of the system decrease as a result the minimum flutter velocity and flutter frequency of composite pipe occur at higher fiber angles of θ 90 0 and ψ 90 0 fig 9 a and b respectively illustrate the influence of the mass fluid ratio on the critical flutter velocity and flutter frequency of the system with respect to structural damping coefficient it can be observed that increasing the structural damping coefficient will increase the critical flutter velocity of the system at lower mass fluid ratio β 0 28 this is due to the fact that the structural damping has a stabilizing effect due to energy dissipation for higher value of mass fluid ratio as the structural damping increases critical flutter velocity decreases and instability region of the system accurse at lower velocity in addition it is seen that the critical frequency leading to flutter instability decreases as the structural damping increases over the whole range of mass fluid ratio depending on the values of the fluid velocity and linear translate spring at the free end occurrence of divergence or flutter instability or both instabilities are possible the critical fluid velocity as a function of spring constant is depicted in fig 10 for k t 0 α 0 and three cases of fiber orientation angles it is observed that the composite pipe loses its stability via flutter for low translational spring constant while at high value of k l the system loses its stability by both divergence and flutter in fig 10 it is also seen that both critical flutter and divergence velocities of composite pipe with 45 45 s lay up are lower than other cases flutter configurations of a cantilever composite pipe with 45 45 s lay up for k l k t 0 α 0 and different mass fluid ratio have been plotted in fig 12 a through c it is observed that the flutter configuration is strongly dependent on mass fluid ratio at u u c f it is noted that the first second third and fourth eigenvalues are defined as the oscillatory configurations with no node single node two nodes and three nodes respectively fig 11 a through c indicate the flutter configuration for β 0 1 β 0 4 and β 0 7559 where there are single node two nodes and three nodes respectively besides fig 12 have illustrated the effect of composite lay ups on the flutter configuration of a cantilever pipe conveying fluid for k l k t 0 α 0 and β 0 5 it is seen that the flutter configurations occur on the third eigenvalue as they have two nodes based on the halpin tsai micromechanics model in appendix a the stability map and the variations of the critical fluid velocity for flutter phenomenon of composite cantilever pipe with respect to size of fiber l d have been illustrated in fig 13 it is shown that the increase of l d tend to increase the critical flutter velocity and the stable area because the l d tends to increase the stiffness of the structures and to make them stiffer the effects of the volume fraction composite lay up and wall thickness on the critical flutter velocity in fig 13 a through c respectively for k l k t 100 α 0 001 and β 0 5 in fig 13 a it is demonstrated that the critical flutter velocity increases as the volume fraction increases in the other hand the results show that adding a small amount of fiber into matrix can significantly increase the stable area of the system the influences of orientation fiber and size of fiber on the critical flutter velocity have been observed in fig 13 b it is found that the flutter boundary of composite pipe with 0 4 lay up is strongly dependent on l d while it is weakly dependent on l d for composite pipe with 45 45 s lay up furthermore it is observed from fig 13 c that critical flutter velocity of the system decreases with an increases wall thickness 5 conclusion in this study the flutter and divergence instability of fluid conveying composite thin walled pipes subjected to elastic boundary conditions at the free end were investigated the equation of motion as well as associated boundary conditions were obtained by extended hamilton s principle the extended galerkin method was applied to truncate the governing partial differential equation into a set of ordinary differential equations by the eigenvalue problem of the ordinary differential equations the eigenvalues and critical fluid velocities for composite pipe were calculated by numerical method various parametric studies were performed to investigate divergence and flutter instabilities of the system by the effects of fiber orientation angles volume fraction of fiber size of fiber mass fluid ratio structural damping and elastic boundary conditions the major outcomes of this study were the critical fluid velocity decreases with increasing structural damping coefficient for higher values of mass ratios the composite thin walled pipes became unstable in the form of either divergence or flutter with the increasing fluid velocities and linear translation spring constant at the free end it was found that by increasing the mass ratio and translational spring the results predicted by 45 45 s lay up gets smaller to those obtained by the 0 90 s and 0 4 lay ups furthermore it was revealed that by increasing the value of θ in θ ψ s lay up the critical flutter velocities and frequencies of the system decrease the critical flutter velocity of composite pipe with 0 4 lay up is strongly dependent on l d while it is weakly dependent on l d for composite pipe with 45 45 s lay up furthermore the stable zone increases with increasing l d and volume fraction of fiber appendix a based on the halpin tsai micromechanics model the effective young s modulus and shear modulus of composite pipe can be obtained as bellow affdl and kardos 1976 a 1 e 11 1 ξ l η l v f 1 η l v f e m e 22 1 ξ t η t v f 1 η t v f e m g 12 1 1 η v f g m where a 2 η l e f e m 1 e f e m ξ l ξ l 2 l d 40

23339,offshore platforms with ship like hull structures have relatively low roll damping moment in this paper variations of roll reduction appendages based on increasing damping strategy are proposed the appendages are an ordinary bilge keel a newly adopted variation involving extended platforms with ship like hull structures such as drillships or reversed flaps and a stinger type to validate the roll damping performance of newly designed appendages a series of free decay data for the roll motion in calm water and in regular waves are obtained from towing tank tests the free decay data for the roll motion is analyzed using a linear plus quadratic damping method as well as an alternative method based on the hilbert transform in order to overcome the possible problem of nonlinearity for non conventional roll stabilizers the hilbert transform technique has the advantage over polynomial damping models for not assuming the form of the roll characteristics a comparison of the analysis methods for the different appendages is carried out for linear nonlinear and equivalent linear damping methods the results are crosschecked in regular beam waves for different amplitudes near their resonant frequencies from the experimental analysis the linear and nonlinear roll characteristics for various appendages are discussed keywords roll damping drillship hilbert transform quadratic damping nonlinear damping 1 introduction over the last decades many studies have been conducted concerning roll reduction or stabilization as well as a roll performance estimation method for ships and offshore structures however high nonlinearity in roll characteristics leads to complexity and difficulty for research in the field of roll motion even now excessive roll motion is a significant issue for many ships and offshore structures offshore platforms such as drillship have a relatively large length to beam ratio to take advantage of mobility that causes low damping performance both the dynamic stability and operability of drillship have a close relationship with the characteristics of roll motion ship roll reduction or stabilization has a long history and can be divided into two categories the first is the roll reduction or stabilization method and the second is the evaluation or modeling method of the roll performance in this study among various roll reduction methods the investigation is focused on passive roll damping devices such as a bilge keel and the analysis method for roll damping roll motion and related topics have been studied since the late mid 1800 s starting with froude 1981 between the end of the 1950 s and the 80 s a japanese group e g tanaka 1961 kato 1965 and ikeda et al 1978 studied roll damping based on theory numerical calculation and experimentation and suggested an empirical formula including the effect of a bilge keel particularly himeno 1981 summarized these studies and ikeda et al 2004 suggested a modified model the dynamic roll characteristic has been one of the most central topics in seakeeping study however owing to the complexity induced by high nonlinearity potential flow methods cannot solve the roll motion issue effectively up to date many research groups have adopted various methodologies including the advanced experimental method empirical formula or computational fluid dynamics cfd one of the topics is related to the characteristics of roll motion for bare hull and with different appendages another branch of the research has been focused on the analysis method for roll damping which includes higher polynomial roll damping model finite differential model or hyperbola model recently cfd based analyses have been used for the analysis of local phenomena e g vortex shedding around bilge keels yeung et al 1997 yeung 2002 several authors have studied roll damping experimentally with particle image velocimetry piv for local flow visualization aloisio and felice 2006 bassler et al 2007 oliveira and fernandes 2012 another branch of this field of study is roll damping modeling oliveira and fernandes 2014 used the bi linear or hyperbola fitting method and agarwal 2015 used fractional differential equation fde instead of ordinary differential equation ode in addition several joint industry projects jips for floating production storage and offloading fpso such as the clarom jip ledoux et al 2004 or non linear roll jip rezende 2012 have been initiated all these methods have advantages and or limitations especially for newer hull designs or non typical appendages in terms of shape and size the ordinary method for a typical design has not been fully validated yet damping in the second order ode for motion is usually treated as a quadratic model and it is widely accepted that this generally accommodates ordinary cases well however as recently stated by oliveira and fernandes 2014 the above quadratic modeling cannot be fully fit extended bilge keel examples an empirical formula was also constructed based upon the database and usual shape series data therefore the physical interpretation based on the empirical formula for newer appendages may not produce accurate insights when designing a new appendage more general tools or scopes for identifying the characteristics of dynamic systems are needed in this study the performance of the original model in roll and the efficiency of a passive appendage for increasing roll damping are evaluated using the experimental results to capture the nonlinear roll characteristics of the ship shaped platform with and without appendages in the zero speed condition more reliably systematic towing tank model test programs are required and nonlinear analyses methods are examined to produce the experimental results the test layout with wire and soft spring is adopted to minimize the unexpected drift due to yaw and sway and their coupling with roll the time series for the roll motion is measured for free decay of roll in calm water and for harmonic oscillatory motion in regular beam waves and is analyzed based on the 1 dof roll motion equation from repeated free decay roll tests with different appendages the nonlinear characteristics are analyzed using different methods for crosscheck purposes the high order polynomial damping model proposed by froude 1981 and the hilbert transform ht method feldman 1994 lewandowski 2011 kim and park 2015 the ht is adopted for a series of experiments including non typical appendages because the ht method can show instantaneous damping and restoring moments the ht method has been studied with regard to signal processing by feldman 1994 as well as others and this method has been adopted for ship and offshore research by a few authors lewandowski 2011 kim and park 2015 these analysis methods are adopted for the free decay experimental results based on the 1 dof equation for roll motion these results are compared to the roll motion responses measured in various wave frequencies and amplitudes the appendage performance regarding the roll motion can be evaluated by fourier analysis motion responses show corresponding results with roll damping from the free decay test from the experimental analysis linear and nonlinear roll characteristics and possible parameters related to roll motion responses are discussed roll damping from the free decay roll test conducted with various appendages can be used to estimate the performance relating to the roll motion to analyze the nonlinear nature of the roll damping characteristic 2 theoretical background two series of experiment including the free decay test in calm water and the seakeeping test in regular beam waves are carried out in order to evaluate the roll damping coefficients of bare hull with and without appendages since the roll signal from the free decay test generally lies within a narrow banded frequency and roll viscous damping has nonlinear characteristics two different analysis methods are applied to crosscheck the nonlinearity of the test result the high order polynomial model proposed by froude and a more sophisticated method based on the hilbert transform 2 1 analysis of nonlinear damping free roll decay test in this analysis the decoupled 1 dof equation of motion is considered for roll motion as equation 1 and the experimental scheme is also set to satisfy this condition 1 ϕ b ϕ ϕ i i a c ϕ ϕ i i a ϕ ϕ 2 b ϕ c ϕ 0 where i is the moment of inertia i a is the added moment of inertia b ϕ and c ϕ are the roll damping and restoring function respectively here c becomes ω n 2 where ω n means the roll natural frequency 2 1 1 high order polynomial method the main difference between the high order polynomial method and the hilbert transform is whether the method pre assumes the form of the roll damping or not as well known the high order polynomial method assumes the damping term b is the polynomial function of roll velocity including the linear and nonlinear terms as below 2 ϕ 2 b ϕ c ϕ 0 where b ϕ b 1 ϕ b 2 ϕ ϕ b 3 ϕ 3 in the free decay test a small decrement between each cycle due to small damping may be assumed therefore the roll angle can be modeled as a harmonic function i e ϕ t ϕ a cos ω t where ϕ a is the average amplitude in one or a half roll period and ω is motion frequency in the half cycle of a roll decay signal the decrement in total energy can be assumed to be solely induced by energy dissipation with damping the total energy e t o t a l and time derivative of the total energy d e t o t a l d t can be written as equations 3 and 4 respectively then the change of total energy in a half roll decay cycle can be obtained from equation 5 see fig 1 a furthermore the energy dissipation for a half cycle e d i s s i p a t i o n can be estimated by the mean value as shown in equation 6 since the change of total energy must be the energy dissipation equation 7 can be led that is the linear coefficient b 1 and quadratic coefficient b

no assumption like the polynomial function approximation constant oscillation frequency or restoring moment in this approach only the harmonic oscillation vibration signal and narrow banded signal are assumed then the hilbert transform of the original time series y t is defined as below 8 y ˆ t 1 π p v y τ t τ d τ here p v means cauchy principle value then let s define a complex combination of original signal and the hilbert transformed signal such as 9 y t y t i y ˆ t a t e i ψ t where the envelope a t and phase ψ t are instantaneous values the original signal and the hilbert transformed signal can be written as y t a t cos ψ t and y ˆ t a t sin ψ t furthermore we can write 10 a t y 2 t y ˆ 2 t ψ t arctan y ˆ t y t ω t d ψ d t im y t y t 11 y y a a i ψ y y a a ψ 2 2 i a a ψ i ψ where ω t is the instantaneous angular frequency of the signal if h t and ω y t are slowly varying the characteristics of the equation of motion 12 can be solved using the hilbert transform 12 y 2 h t y ω y 2 t y 0 13 y 2 h t y ω y 2 t y y a a ω 2 ω y 2 t 2 h t a a i 2 a a ω ω 2 h t ω 0 for a lightly damped system the free response in the frequency domain will lie in a narrow band near the natural frequency hence the above condition may be satisfied from the above relationship the damping characteristic and restoring characteristic can be obtained as follows 14 h t a a ω 2 ω ω y 2 t ω 2 a a 2 a 2 a 2 a ω a ω the damping coefficients can be obtained by applying the quadratic fitting of h t as the above relationships show the coefficients are related to the envelope and instantaneous frequency of the original signal and the hilbert transformed signal and their time derivatives during this process no assumption is given to the non linearity therefore a more precise analysis for the free decay tests can be made for the high nonlinear problems 2 1 3 linear equivalent damping to compare the analysis method quantitatively a linearized equivalent damping model is also considered as well known the linearized equivalent damping b e q and relative damping coefficient to critical damping ζ are defined as follows 15 ϕ 2 b e q ϕ c ϕ ϕ 2 ζ ω n ϕ ω n 2 ϕ 0 16 b e q b 1 8 3 π ω ϕ a b 2 the equivalent damping can be obtained by adopting the damping comments obtained either hilbert transform approach or polynomial fitting method fig 2 shows the schematic comparison between the hilbert transform and the polynomial roll damping model and their conversion to the linear equivalent damping 2 2 motions in regular beam waves for roll motion in beam waves the vibration from both the natural frequency and wave encounter frequency cause an amplitude modulation in the time series of roll displacements this phenomenon may be reduced by pre oscillation with the wave excitation frequency before the wave approaches however in this experiment such reduction scheme is not adopted although there is a slow growth of amplitude during transient wave making the impact itself cannot be fully avoided therefore during the post processing the fourier transform is used to extract the rao during the steady phase an example of convergence test results for the roll motion response in regular beam waves and incident wave amplitude based on fourier transform is in fig 3 here t e means wave encounter period ξ 4 means linear motion amplitude and a and ξ 4 0 mean the converged wave amplitude and linear motion amplitude of roll respectively with the time series more than ten periods the converged result can be obtained for both roll motion in waves and the incident wave amplitude and these analysis conditions are adopted for the overall analysis in this study 3 towing tank experiment 3 1 ship model and test condition the target model of the present study is a drillship fig 4 which is made of fiber reinforced plastic main particulars are summaries in table 1 the primary objective of this study is to compare the performance of roll reduction for different appendages to this end five replaceable appendages are attached on the ship hull an ordinary sized bilge keel app 1 an extended wide bilge keel app 2 two moonpool flaps attached on the entrance edge of moonpool app 3 a reversed aspect ratio bilge keel attached near on cursor rail app 4 and a large stinger attached to the stern app 5 the comparison of their roll damping with that of bare hull bh is made the photos of the appendages app 1 app 5 are shown in fig 5 in the case of app 3 the photo shows the two flaps which are folded into moon pool the aspect ratio and other non dimensional parameters for the appendages are listed in table 2 here b is breadth r is the distance between the center of gravity cog and the attachment position of the appendage rc is the distance between the cog and the areal center of the appendage furthermore relative means that r b value is compared with the reference value for example relative r b 1 means that appendages are attached at the bilge line table 3 shows the test conditions for free roll decay test in calm water and the motion measurement in harmonic beam waves particularly in the presence of incident waves this study focuses on the motion measurement around resonance frequencies since the roll motion is a narrow banded motion near its resonance 3 2 test scheme all the test cases are conducted in the towing tank of seoul national university which is 110 m long 8 m wide and 3 5 m deep with a plunger type wave maker various test layouts were considered to prevent any unwanted yaw and sway drift and the related coupling effect as well as wire sling on disturbance on water surface and a soft spring system in horizontal plane was finally chosen particularly to prevent a part of wire to touch or submerged into water due to its weight a wire pulley spring system is newly adopted as shown in fig 6 the soft spring wire was chosen to have a natural frequency far from the roll frequencies so that it doesn t affect the amplitude and frequency of the roll motion fig 7 shows the overall scheme of the present experiment the static measurement and calibration is based on the 2d leveler 0 01 deg accuracy and dynamic motion is measured based on the gyro acceleration fusion sensor xsens mti 300 and the incident wave amplitude is measured using a sonar probe baumer and is recorded using a daq hbm mx840a the exact roll center may vary according to the incident wave conditions fernandes et al 2016 to overcome this circumstance horizontal wire length in the soft spring system was lengthened not to exert unwanted external moment on roll motion roll motion is defined based on body fixed coordinate therefore motion sensor is aligned to be parallel to the longitudinal axis of the test model the sidewall effect should be carefully considered in a towing tank test to observe the sidewall effect the wave elevations at the two different locations wave probe 1 and additional wave probe 2 in fig 7 a are measured and no significant difference is observed in the present experiment 4 results and discussion in the first stage the repeatability test results are analyzed to verify the accuracy of the experimental set ups then the results of the free decay responses in calm water are observed for different appendages finally the roll motion responses in beam waves are compared to find the performance of different appendages 4 1 repeatability test the repeatability test should be carried out in advance to observe the sensitivity and accuracy of the present experiments in the present study the repeatability test is conducted for both the free decay test and the motion test in waves in the bare hull test moonpool is closed with flips because the damping of the bare hull is the reference for evaluating the performance of appendages tests for the bare hull are repeated in addition damping of the bare hull is relatively small and may induce a large amplification near the resonant frequency fig 8 shows the repeated free decay test results which are analyzed by the hilbert transform method the repeated test shows a converged band around the mean value if the mean is normalized to 1 the observed standard deviation is approximately 0 02 this implies that reasonable repeatability can be achieved with the current test layout and analysis method fig 9 shows the result of the repeatability test results near the resonant frequency for two different wave amplitudes 0 0134 1a 0 0267 2a the horizontal axis represents the repeat number and the vertical axis means the normalized roll amplitude compared to the mean value which conveys that the mean value of the normalized roll amplitude is set to unity the roll responses are analyzed based on the measured wave amplitudes the vertical axis become also the standard deviation σ even in the low damping environment with the bare hull case and resonance condition the repeated test shows a fair band for each wave amplitude indicating reliable repeatability the responses for different wave amplitudes have almost the same resonant frequency while nonlinearity is captured for peak amplitude 4 2 roll damping in calm water from the free decay tests in calm water the roll damping characteristics and related roll responses are analyzed for the bare hull and five different appendages fig 10 shows a measured time history and for the free decay test with the bare hull where ξ 4 is the roll amplitude ξ 4 i n i t i a l is the initial roll angle and t n is the natural roll period of the bare hull the first cycle signal is not included in the analysis to avoid the vortex memory effect described in veer and fathi 2010 fig 10 also shows the difference between the analyzed steps in the high order polynomial model and the hilbert transform the polynomial damping method uses the peak data from the free decay signal as shown in fig 10 a meanwhile the hilbert transform method uses the overall signal data as shown in fig 10 b in this figure the hilbert transformed signal is also shown which appears as the phase shifted signal for 90 deg in the time domain based on the original signal and the hilbert transformed signal an envelope and other characteristics e g roll damping can be estimated fig 11 shows the measured time series and the reproduced time series the reproduced time series is constructed using the runge kutta 4th order integration based on the results of the hilbert transform approach in the bare hull case i e fig 11 a a decaying trend slower than that of the ordinary bilge keel in fig 11 b can be observed figs 12 and 13 show the analyzed results of the damping coefficient and linear equivalent damping coefficient from the repeated test in the figures the vertical axis denotes the relative damping coefficient which is normalized so that the linear damping coefficient of the bare hull becomes unity for linear damping component fig 12 a and 13 a and the damping coefficient of the app 1 becomes unity for quadratic damping component case fig 12 b the definition of the linear and quadratic damping coefficient and the linearized equivalent damping can be found in equations 2 15 and 16 both the hilbert transform method and the polynomial model show a similar trend and no large deviation is shown these results clearly show that the majority of the damping comes from the linear component for bare hull and apps 3 and 5 however for apps 1 2 and 4 quadratic damping plays important role on overall roll damping according to this result it is shown that bilge keels provide clear contribution of the nonlinear damping when this is the case not only the decay rate but also the natural roll period is changed such case is clear in fig 11 b which shows faster decay and slightly longer period than the bare hull case in fig 11 a this is shown again later in the motion responses in the waves figs 12 and 13 show that apps 1 2 and 4 induce clear differences with that of the bare hull considering the standard deviation from the repeatability test as described in fig 13 a as base line in contrast apps 3 and 5 have not much difference to the bare hull apps 1 2 and 4 show larger linear damping than the bare hull and particularly app 2 has the largest 2nd order damping component as shown in table 2 app 2 has twice the area of app 1 but the length r is similar for app 1 and app 2 therefore the differences between the appendages mainly came from the width of the appendage and the damping moment induced by the additional area on the other hand app 1 and app 4 have a similar area and attachment position near the bilge and the differences come from the aspect ratio even though the length rc between the cog and the area center of app 4 is longer than app 1 it seems that the large aspect ratio appears to have a limited damping effect furthermore from the result of app 5 it is clear that this truss type appendage is not appropriate for roll reduction generally the viscous effect can be explain based on keulegan carpenter number defined as vt l where v t and l represent characteristic velocity oscillation period and appendage width l or submergence depth d for the each appendage of the present study the oscillation period is same therefore v l is different in the case of roll damping v can be dependent on the effective moment arm for example app 3 has length and width larger than bilge keel but moment arm relative to roll center is shorter and the attached angle is not orthogonal to flow around appendage that is flow velocity near app 3 may be much less than app 1 or app 2 and vortex shedding and related roll damping is very small comparing app 1 and 4 app 4 has larger moment arm and higher flow velocity near the appendage however attachment length or effective length is much shorter than app 1 ordinary bilge keel therefore overall performance shows less effective than app 1 it should be mentioned that the damping coefficients of app 3 and app 5 in figs 12 and 13 are slightly less than that of bare hull case this is due to the opening of moonpool in the case of app 3 moonpool is opened while the other cases are not even bare hull case furthermore the stinger in app 5 seems not effective which results in small damping effects then the difference between app 5 and bare hull case is very likely to be within experimental uncertainty it also should be mentioned that although the two different analysis methods provide the same trend of damping coefficients the detailed values can be slightly different e g app 2 in fig 12 b the detailed study must be done in near future but it seems due to the difference of approach one approach is based on fitting and the other approach assumes that the signals have two primary components which are orthogonal each other such difference may be larger when nonlinearity becomes stronger the both methods have limitation and difference of result is natural and more thorough study is needed for this issue 4 3 roll motion responses in waves the roll motion responses for regular beam waves are analyzed for range of wave frequencies and two wave amplitudes because the large motion under resonance condition is vital in operation for safety the performance evaluation for different appendages can be conducted with respect to the roll amplitude and frequency where the resonance occurs the wave frequencies are picked from a narrow band to capture the peak value near the resonance region and different wave amplitudes are applied to observe the nonlinear nature of the roll motion fig 14 shows the examples of roll motion signal in harmonic wave excitation near resonance roll period the difference of roll amplitudes between different appendages shows meaningful differences this result is consistent with the results of free roll decay test fig 15 shows the roll motion amplitudes for the different appendage cases which is the most important results in this study in this figure ξ 4 p e a k 1 a ω b g represent the peak value of motion amplitude for bare hull and 1a wave amplitude wave frequency the beam length of the model and gravitational acceleration respectively for comparison purpose motion responses for different wave amplitude 1a and 2a condition are normalized with same basis value the bare hull case shows the largest amplitude compared with the appendage cases test frequencies concentrate near the resonance frequencies therefore peak differences are well depicted in overall condition for apps 1 2 and 4 in 1a wave condition both roll amplitude and resonance frequency are reduced particularly the peak amplitude of app 4 becomes half of bare hull condition and apps 1 and 2 make the peak below the one third of the peak value of bare hull this trend can be found also in the 2a wave amplitude cases however peak amplitude reduces under the two thirds of the peak amplitude of 1a condition this nonlinearity related to wave amplitudes can be found only near resonance frequencies the comparisons of the maximum roll amplitude and the frequency with peak rao are shown in fig 16 where ξ 4 p e a k means peak value of motion amplitude for bare hull and ω n means natural frequency for bare hull all these results are normalized with the quantities of the bare hull therefore these results show the performance of different appendages in waves as can be easily understood owing to the nonlinear damping and relatively larger linear damping than bare hull the roll amplitudes are reduced for all the cases with appendage particularly the reductions by bilge keels are very significant moreover the natural frequency itself and the resultant peak of motion responses are moved to a smaller frequency region for a larger damping case as expected the roll damping characteristic from the free decay in calm water and the roll responses in the regular beam wave show a corresponding trend fig 17 plots the relative quantities of maximum roll amplitude in waves and the viscous damping obtained from the above free roll decay test in the same graph obviously the conditions for larger roll damping in calm water also reduce the roll response in waves the appendages considered in this study are designed to reduce roll responses by increasing damping and some appendages successfully reduce roll motion and exhibit larger roll damping this means that either the free decay roll test in calm water or the seakeeping test in regular beam waves may be used to determine the roll damping performance of appendages when considering these types of appendages in the model test 5 conclusion to evaluate the roll damping performance for drillship bare hull and appendages a series of free decay test in calm water and seakeeping test in regular beam waves are carried out in a towing tank and nonlinear analysis methods are adopted for nonlinear viscous damping coefficients from the results the following conclusions are drawn based on the repeatability tests and the analyzed mean and standard deviation even in the low roll damping condition a reasonable evaluation of damping and motion responses can be achieved the free decay signal shows the narrow banded frequency response and the linear roll damping for the bare hull and nonlinear damping for bilge keel type appendages these results are analyzed by a high order polynomial method and the hilbert transform method both methods show a similar trend for the linear and quadratic damping for each appendage in the seakeeping test the reduction of resonant roll motion follows the roll damping result of the free decay test in calm water resonant frequency shifting also follows the roll damping characteristic by far the roll damping performance for a bare hull and appendages can be evaluated either based on a free decay test in calm water or a seakeeping test in regular beam waves the bare hull case shows nearly linear damping while bilge keels and larger flap type appendages provide effective quadratic damping components overall it is found that the performance of bilge keels is more effective than the other appendages applied in this study higher performance for roll reduction may be achieved by enlarging the size of bilge keel or combining with other appendages acknowledgement this study was supported by daewoo shipbuilding marine engineering co ltd dsme korea also the experimental research was partly supported by lrfc lloyd s register foundation funded research center and rimse of seoul national university their supports are greatly appreciated 
23339,offshore platforms with ship like hull structures have relatively low roll damping moment in this paper variations of roll reduction appendages based on increasing damping strategy are proposed the appendages are an ordinary bilge keel a newly adopted variation involving extended platforms with ship like hull structures such as drillships or reversed flaps and a stinger type to validate the roll damping performance of newly designed appendages a series of free decay data for the roll motion in calm water and in regular waves are obtained from towing tank tests the free decay data for the roll motion is analyzed using a linear plus quadratic damping method as well as an alternative method based on the hilbert transform in order to overcome the possible problem of nonlinearity for non conventional roll stabilizers the hilbert transform technique has the advantage over polynomial damping models for not assuming the form of the roll characteristics a comparison of the analysis methods for the different appendages is carried out for linear nonlinear and equivalent linear damping methods the results are crosschecked in regular beam waves for different amplitudes near their resonant frequencies from the experimental analysis the linear and nonlinear roll characteristics for various appendages are discussed keywords roll damping drillship hilbert transform quadratic damping nonlinear damping 1 introduction over the last decades many studies have been conducted concerning roll reduction or stabilization as well as a roll performance estimation method for ships and offshore structures however high nonlinearity in roll characteristics leads to complexity and difficulty for research in the field of roll motion even now excessive roll motion is a significant issue for many ships and offshore structures offshore platforms such as drillship have a relatively large length to beam ratio to take advantage of mobility that causes low damping performance both the dynamic stability and operability of drillship have a close relationship with the characteristics of roll motion ship roll reduction or stabilization has a long history and can be divided into two categories the first is the roll reduction or stabilization method and the second is the evaluation or modeling method of the roll performance in this study among various roll reduction methods the investigation is focused on passive roll damping devices such as a bilge keel and the analysis method for roll damping roll motion and related topics have been studied since the late mid 1800 s starting with froude 1981 between the end of the 1950 s and the 80 s a japanese group e g tanaka 1961 kato 1965 and ikeda et al 1978 studied roll damping based on theory numerical calculation and experimentation and suggested an empirical formula including the effect of a bilge keel particularly himeno 1981 summarized these studies and ikeda et al 2004 suggested a modified model the dynamic roll characteristic has been one of the most central topics in seakeeping study however owing to the complexity induced by high nonlinearity potential flow methods cannot solve the roll motion issue effectively up to date many research groups have adopted various methodologies including the advanced experimental method empirical formula or computational fluid dynamics cfd one of the topics is related to the characteristics of roll motion for bare hull and with different appendages another branch of the research has been focused on the analysis method for roll damping which includes higher polynomial roll damping model finite differential model or hyperbola model recently cfd based analyses have been used for the analysis of local phenomena e g vortex shedding around bilge keels yeung et al 1997 yeung 2002 several authors have studied roll damping experimentally with particle image velocimetry piv for local flow visualization aloisio and felice 2006 bassler et al 2007 oliveira and fernandes 2012 another branch of this field of study is roll damping modeling oliveira and fernandes 2014 used the bi linear or hyperbola fitting method and agarwal 2015 used fractional differential equation fde instead of ordinary differential equation ode in addition several joint industry projects jips for floating production storage and offloading fpso such as the clarom jip ledoux et al 2004 or non linear roll jip rezende 2012 have been initiated all these methods have advantages and or limitations especially for newer hull designs or non typical appendages in terms of shape and size the ordinary method for a typical design has not been fully validated yet damping in the second order ode for motion is usually treated as a quadratic model and it is widely accepted that this generally accommodates ordinary cases well however as recently stated by oliveira and fernandes 2014 the above quadratic modeling cannot be fully fit extended bilge keel examples an empirical formula was also constructed based upon the database and usual shape series data therefore the physical interpretation based on the empirical formula for newer appendages may not produce accurate insights when designing a new appendage more general tools or scopes for identifying the characteristics of dynamic systems are needed in this study the performance of the original model in roll and the efficiency of a passive appendage for increasing roll damping are evaluated using the experimental results to capture the nonlinear roll characteristics of the ship shaped platform with and without appendages in the zero speed condition more reliably systematic towing tank model test programs are required and nonlinear analyses methods are examined to produce the experimental results the test layout with wire and soft spring is adopted to minimize the unexpected drift due to yaw and sway and their coupling with roll the time series for the roll motion is measured for free decay of roll in calm water and for harmonic oscillatory motion in regular beam waves and is analyzed based on the 1 dof roll motion equation from repeated free decay roll tests with different appendages the nonlinear characteristics are analyzed using different methods for crosscheck purposes the high order polynomial damping model proposed by froude 1981 and the hilbert transform ht method feldman 1994 lewandowski 2011 kim and park 2015 the ht is adopted for a series of experiments including non typical appendages because the ht method can show instantaneous damping and restoring moments the ht method has been studied with regard to signal processing by feldman 1994 as well as others and this method has been adopted for ship and offshore research by a few authors lewandowski 2011 kim and park 2015 these analysis methods are adopted for the free decay experimental results based on the 1 dof equation for roll motion these results are compared to the roll motion responses measured in various wave frequencies and amplitudes the appendage performance regarding the roll motion can be evaluated by fourier analysis motion responses show corresponding results with roll damping from the free decay test from the experimental analysis linear and nonlinear roll characteristics and possible parameters related to roll motion responses are discussed roll damping from the free decay roll test conducted with various appendages can be used to estimate the performance relating to the roll motion to analyze the nonlinear nature of the roll damping characteristic 2 theoretical background two series of experiment including the free decay test in calm water and the seakeeping test in regular beam waves are carried out in order to evaluate the roll damping coefficients of bare hull with and without appendages since the roll signal from the free decay test generally lies within a narrow banded frequency and roll viscous damping has nonlinear characteristics two different analysis methods are applied to crosscheck the nonlinearity of the test result the high order polynomial model proposed by froude and a more sophisticated method based on the hilbert transform 2 1 analysis of nonlinear damping free roll decay test in this analysis the decoupled 1 dof equation of motion is considered for roll motion as equation 1 and the experimental scheme is also set to satisfy this

becomes ω n 2 where ω n means the roll natural frequency 2 1 1 high order polynomial method the main difference between the high order polynomial method and the hilbert transform is whether the method pre assumes the form of the roll damping or not as well known the high order polynomial method assumes the damping term b is the polynomial function of roll velocity including the linear and nonlinear terms as below 2 ϕ 2 b ϕ c ϕ 0 where b ϕ b 1 ϕ b 2 ϕ ϕ b 3 ϕ 3 in the free decay test a small decrement between each cycle due to small damping may be assumed therefore the roll angle can be modeled as a harmonic function i e ϕ t ϕ a cos ω t where ϕ a is the average amplitude in one or a half roll period and ω is motion frequency in the half cycle of a roll decay signal the decrement in total energy can be assumed to be solely induced by energy dissipation with damping the total energy e t o t a l and time derivative of the total energy d e t o t a l d t can be written as equations 3 and 4 respectively then the change of total energy in a half roll decay cycle can be obtained from equation 5 see fig 1 a furthermore the energy dissipation for a half cycle e d i s s i p a t i o n can be estimated by the mean value as shown in equation 6 since the change of total energy must be the energy dissipation equation 7 can be led that is the linear coefficient b 1 and quadratic coefficient b

no assumption like the polynomial function approximation constant oscillation frequency or restoring moment in this approach only the harmonic oscillation vibration signal and narrow banded signal are assumed then the hilbert transform of the original time series y t is defined as below 8 y ˆ t 1 π p v y τ t τ d τ here p v means cauchy principle value then let s define a complex combination of original signal and the hilbert transformed signal such as 9 y t y t i y ˆ t a t e i ψ t where the envelope a t and phase ψ t are instantaneous values the original signal and the hilbert transformed signal can be written as y t a t cos ψ t and y ˆ t a t sin ψ t furthermore we can write 10 a t y 2 t y ˆ 2 t ψ t arctan y ˆ t y t ω t d ψ d t im y t y t 11 y y a a i ψ y y a a ψ 2 2 i a a ψ i ψ where

2 a 2 a ω a ω the damping coefficients can be obtained by applying the quadratic fitting of h t as the above relationships show the coefficients are related to the envelope and instantaneous frequency of the original signal and the hilbert transformed signal and their time derivatives during this process no assumption is given to the non linearity therefore a more precise analysis for the free decay tests can be made for the high nonlinear problems 2 1 3 linear equivalent damping to compare the analysis method quantitatively a linearized equivalent damping model is also considered as well known the linearized equivalent damping b e q and relative damping coefficient to critical damping ζ are defined as follows 15 ϕ 2 b e q ϕ c ϕ ϕ 2 ζ ω n ϕ ω n 2 ϕ 0 16 b e q b 1 8 3 π ω ϕ a b 2 the equivalent damping can be obtained by adopting the damping comments obtained either hilbert transform approach or polynomial fitting method fig 2 shows the schematic comparison between the hilbert transform and the polynomial roll damping model and their conversion to the linear equivalent damping 2 2 motions in regular beam waves for roll motion in beam waves the vibration from both the natural frequency and wave encounter frequency cause an amplitude modulation in the time series of roll displacements this phenomenon may be reduced by pre oscillation with the wave excitation frequency before the wave approaches however in this experiment such reduction scheme is not adopted although there is a slow growth of amplitude during transient wave making the impact itself cannot be fully avoided therefore during the post processing the fourier transform is used to extract the rao during the steady phase an example of convergence test results for the roll motion response in regular beam waves and incident wave amplitude based on fourier transform is in fig 3 here t e means wave encounter period ξ 4 means linear motion amplitude and a and ξ 4 0 mean the converged wave amplitude and linear motion amplitude of roll respectively with the time series more than ten periods the converged result can be obtained for both roll motion in waves and the incident wave amplitude and these analysis conditions are adopted for the overall analysis in this study 3 towing tank experiment 3 1 ship model and test condition the target model of the present study is a drillship fig 4 which is made of fiber reinforced plastic main particulars are summaries in table 1 the primary objective of this study is to compare the performance of roll reduction for different appendages to this end five replaceable appendages are attached on the ship hull an ordinary sized bilge keel app 1 an extended wide bilge keel app 2 two moonpool flaps attached on the entrance edge of moonpool app 3 a reversed aspect ratio bilge keel attached near on cursor rail app 4 and a large stinger attached to the stern app 5 the comparison of their roll damping with that of bare hull bh is made the photos of the appendages app 1 app 5 are shown in fig 5 in the case of app 3 the photo shows the two flaps which are folded into moon pool the aspect ratio and other non dimensional parameters for the appendages are listed in table 2 here b is breadth r is the distance between the center of gravity cog and the attachment position of the appendage rc is the distance between the cog and the areal center of the appendage furthermore relative means that r b value is compared with the reference value for example relative r b 1 means that appendages are attached at the bilge line table 3 shows the test conditions for free roll decay test in calm water and the motion measurement in harmonic beam waves particularly in the presence of incident waves this study focuses on the motion measurement around resonance frequencies since the roll motion is a narrow banded motion near its resonance 3 2 test scheme all the test cases are conducted in the towing tank of seoul national university which is 110 m long 8 m wide and 3 5 m deep with a plunger type wave maker various test layouts were considered to prevent any unwanted yaw and sway drift and the related coupling effect as well as wire sling on disturbance on water surface and a soft spring system in horizontal plane was finally chosen particularly to prevent a part of wire to touch or submerged into water due to its weight a wire pulley spring system is newly adopted as shown in fig 6 the soft spring wire was chosen to have a natural frequency far from the roll frequencies so that it doesn t affect the amplitude and frequency of the roll motion fig 7 shows the overall scheme of the present experiment the static measurement and calibration is based on the 2d leveler 0 01 deg accuracy and dynamic motion is measured based on the gyro acceleration fusion sensor xsens mti 300 and the incident wave amplitude is measured using a sonar probe baumer and is recorded using a daq hbm mx840a the exact roll center may vary according to the incident wave conditions fernandes et al 2016 to overcome this circumstance horizontal wire length in the soft spring system was lengthened not to exert unwanted external moment on roll motion roll motion is defined based on body fixed coordinate therefore motion sensor is aligned to be parallel to the longitudinal axis of the test model the sidewall effect should be carefully considered in a towing tank test to observe the sidewall effect the wave elevations at the two different locations wave probe 1 and additional wave probe 2 in fig 7 a are measured and no significant difference is observed in the present experiment 4 results and discussion in the first stage the repeatability test results are analyzed to verify the accuracy of the experimental set ups then the results of the free decay responses in calm water are observed for different appendages finally the roll motion responses in beam waves are compared to find the performance of different appendages 4 1 repeatability test the repeatability test should be carried out in advance to observe the sensitivity and accuracy of the present experiments in the present study the repeatability test is conducted for both the free decay test and the motion test in waves in the bare hull test moonpool is closed with flips because the damping of the bare hull is the reference for evaluating the performance of appendages tests for the bare hull are repeated in addition damping of the bare hull is relatively small and may induce a large amplification near the resonant frequency fig 8 shows the repeated free decay test results which are analyzed by the hilbert transform method the repeated test shows a converged band around the mean value if the mean is normalized to 1 the observed standard deviation is approximately 0 02 this implies that reasonable repeatability can be achieved with the current test layout and analysis method fig 9 shows the result of the repeatability test results near the resonant frequency for two different wave amplitudes 0 0134 1a 0 0267 2a the horizontal axis represents the repeat number and the vertical axis means the normalized roll amplitude compared to the mean value which conveys that the mean value of the normalized roll amplitude is set to unity the roll responses are analyzed based on the measured wave amplitudes the vertical axis become also the standard deviation σ even in the low damping environment with the bare hull case and resonance condition the repeated test shows a fair band for each wave amplitude indicating reliable repeatability the responses for different wave amplitudes have almost the same resonant frequency while nonlinearity is captured for peak amplitude 4 2 roll damping in calm water from the free decay tests in calm water the roll damping characteristics and related roll responses are analyzed for the bare hull and five different appendages fig 10 shows a measured time history and for the free decay test with the bare hull where ξ 4 is the roll amplitude ξ 4 i n i t i a l is the initial roll angle and t n is the natural roll period of the bare hull the first cycle signal is not included in the analysis to avoid the vortex memory effect described in veer and fathi 2010 fig 10 also shows the difference between the analyzed steps in the high order polynomial model and the hilbert transform the polynomial damping method uses the peak data from the free decay signal as shown in fig 10 a meanwhile the hilbert transform method uses the overall signal data as shown in fig 10 b in this figure the hilbert transformed signal is also shown which appears as the phase shifted signal for 90 deg in the time domain based on the original signal and the hilbert transformed signal an envelope and other characteristics e g roll damping can be estimated fig 11 shows the measured time series and the reproduced time series the reproduced time series is constructed using the runge kutta 4th order integration based on the results of the hilbert transform approach in the bare hull case i e fig 11 a a decaying trend slower than that of the ordinary bilge keel in fig 11 b can be observed figs 12 and 13 show the analyzed results of the damping coefficient and linear equivalent damping coefficient from the repeated test in the figures the vertical axis denotes the relative damping coefficient which is normalized so that the linear damping coefficient of the bare hull becomes unity for linear damping component fig 12 a and 13 a and the damping coefficient of the app 1 becomes unity for quadratic damping component case fig 12 b the definition of the linear and quadratic damping coefficient and the linearized equivalent damping can be found in equations 2 15 and 16 both the hilbert transform method and the polynomial model show a similar trend and no large deviation is shown these results clearly show that the majority of the damping comes from the linear component for bare hull and apps 3 and 5 however for apps 1 2 and 4 quadratic damping plays important role on overall roll damping according to this result it is shown that bilge keels provide clear contribution of the nonlinear damping when this is the case not only the decay rate but also the natural roll period is changed such case is clear in fig 11 b which shows faster decay and slightly longer period than the bare hull case in fig 11 a this is shown again later in the motion responses in the waves figs 12 and 13 show that apps 1 2 and 4 induce clear differences with that of the bare hull considering the standard deviation from the repeatability test as described in fig 13 a as base line in contrast apps 3 and 5 have not much difference to the bare hull apps 1 2 and 4 show larger linear damping than the bare hull and particularly app 2 has the largest 2nd order damping component as shown in table 2 app 2 has twice the area of app 1 but the length r is similar for app 1 and app 2 therefore the differences between the appendages mainly came from the width of the appendage and the damping moment induced by the additional area on the other hand app 1 and app 4 have a similar area and attachment position near the bilge and the differences come from the aspect ratio even though the length rc between the cog and the area center of app 4 is longer than app 1 it seems that the large aspect ratio appears to have a limited damping effect furthermore from the result of app 5 it is clear that this truss type appendage is not appropriate for roll reduction generally the viscous effect can be explain based on keulegan carpenter number defined as vt l where v t and l represent characteristic velocity oscillation period and appendage width l or submergence depth d for the each appendage of the present study the oscillation period is same therefore v l is different in the case of roll damping v can be dependent on the effective moment arm for example app 3 has length and width larger than bilge keel but moment arm relative to roll center is shorter and the attached angle is not orthogonal to flow around appendage that is flow velocity near app 3 may be much less than app 1 or app 2 and vortex shedding and related roll damping is very small comparing app 1 and 4 app 4 has larger moment arm and higher flow velocity near the appendage however attachment length or effective length is much shorter than app 1 ordinary bilge keel therefore overall performance shows less effective than app 1 it should be mentioned that the damping coefficients of app 3 and app 5 in figs 12 and 13 are slightly less than that of bare hull case this is due to the opening of moonpool in the case of app 3 moonpool is opened while the other cases are not even bare hull case furthermore the stinger in app 5 seems not effective which results in small damping effects then the difference between app 5 and bare hull case is very likely to be within experimental uncertainty it also should be mentioned that although the two different analysis methods provide the same trend of damping coefficients the detailed values can be slightly different e g app 2 in fig 12 b the detailed study must be done in near future but it seems due to the difference of approach one approach is based on fitting and the other approach assumes that the signals have two primary components which are orthogonal each other such difference may be larger when nonlinearity becomes stronger the both methods have limitation and difference of result is natural and more thorough study is needed for this issue 4 3 roll motion responses in waves the roll motion responses for regular beam waves are analyzed for range of wave frequencies and two wave amplitudes because the large motion under resonance condition is vital in operation for safety the performance evaluation for different appendages can be conducted with respect to the roll amplitude and frequency where the resonance occurs the wave frequencies are picked from a narrow band to capture the peak value near the resonance region and different wave amplitudes are applied to observe the nonlinear nature of the roll motion fig 14 shows the examples of roll motion signal in harmonic wave excitation near resonance roll period the difference of roll amplitudes between different appendages shows meaningful differences this result is consistent with the results of free roll decay test fig 15 shows the roll motion amplitudes for the different appendage cases which is the most important results in this study in this figure ξ 4 p e a k 1 a ω b g represent the peak value of motion amplitude for bare hull and 1a wave amplitude wave frequency the beam length of the model and gravitational acceleration respectively for comparison purpose motion responses for different wave amplitude 1a and 2a condition are normalized with same basis value the bare hull case shows the largest amplitude compared with the appendage cases test frequencies concentrate near the resonance frequencies therefore peak differences are well depicted in overall condition for apps 1 2 and 4 in 1a wave condition both roll amplitude and resonance frequency are reduced particularly the peak amplitude of app 4 becomes half of bare hull condition and apps 1 and 2 make the peak below the one third of the peak value of bare hull this trend can be found also in the 2a wave amplitude cases however peak amplitude reduces under the two thirds of the peak amplitude of 1a condition this nonlinearity related to wave amplitudes can be found only near resonance frequencies the comparisons of the maximum roll amplitude and the frequency with peak rao are shown in fig 16 where ξ 4 p e a k means peak value of motion amplitude for bare hull and ω n means natural frequency for bare hull all these results are normalized with the quantities of the bare hull therefore these results show the performance of different appendages in waves as can be easily understood owing to the nonlinear damping and relatively larger linear damping than bare hull the roll amplitudes are reduced for all the cases with appendage particularly the reductions by bilge keels are very significant moreover the natural frequency itself and the resultant peak of motion responses are moved to a smaller frequency region for a larger damping case as expected the roll damping characteristic from the free decay in calm water and the roll responses in the regular beam wave show a corresponding trend fig 17 plots the relative quantities of maximum roll amplitude in waves and the viscous damping obtained from the above free roll decay test in the same graph obviously the conditions for larger roll damping in calm water also reduce the roll response in waves the appendages considered in this study are designed to reduce roll responses by increasing damping and some appendages successfully reduce roll motion and exhibit larger roll damping this means that either the free decay roll test in calm water or the seakeeping test in regular beam waves may be used to determine the roll damping performance of appendages when considering these types of appendages in the model test 5 conclusion to evaluate the roll damping performance for drillship bare hull and appendages a series of free decay test in calm water and seakeeping test in regular beam waves are carried out in a towing tank and nonlinear analysis methods are adopted for nonlinear viscous damping coefficients from the results the following conclusions are drawn based on the repeatability tests and the analyzed mean and standard deviation even in the low roll damping condition a reasonable evaluation of damping and motion responses can be achieved the free decay signal shows the narrow banded frequency response and the linear roll damping for the bare hull and nonlinear damping for bilge keel type appendages these results are analyzed by a high order polynomial method and the hilbert transform method both methods show a similar trend for the linear and quadratic damping for each appendage in the seakeeping test the reduction of resonant roll motion follows the roll damping result of the free decay test in calm water resonant frequency shifting also follows the roll damping characteristic by far the roll damping performance for a bare hull and appendages can be evaluated either based on a free decay test in calm water or a seakeeping test in regular beam waves the bare hull case shows nearly linear damping while bilge keels and larger flap type appendages provide effective quadratic damping components overall it is found that the performance of bilge keels is more effective than the other appendages applied in this study higher performance for roll reduction may be achieved by enlarging the size of bilge keel or combining with other appendages acknowledgement this study was supported by daewoo shipbuilding marine engineering
