18320,high loaded ammonia and low strength organics mature landfill leachate is not effectively treated by conventional biological processes herein an innovative solution was proposed using a three stage simultaneous ammonium oxidation denitrifying sad process firstly ammonia 1760 126 mg n l in wastewater was oxidized to nitrite in a partial nitrification sequencing batch reactor pn sbr next 93 pn sbr effluent and concentrated external waste activated sludge was mlss 23057 6014 mg l were introduced to an anoxic reactor for integrated fermentation and denitrification ifd sbr finally ammonia 101 4 13 8 mg n l released by fermentation in the ifd sbr and residual 7 nitrite in the pn sbr were removed through the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process in the sad up flow anaerobic sludge bed sad uasb in addition n o 3 n generation during the anammox process could be reduced to nitrite by partial denitrification pd and reused as substrate for anammox a satisfactory total nitrogen tn removal efficiency 98 3 external sludge reduction rate 2 5 kg m3 d and effluent tn concentration 16 7 mg l were achieved after long term operation 280 days the ifd sbr and sad uasb contributed to 81 9 and 12 3 nitrogen removal respectively microbial analysis showed that anammox bacteria 1 5 candidatus brocadia cooperated well with partial denitrifying bacteria 4 3 thauera in sad uasb and average nitrogen removal contribution were 83 1 during significant stability of anammox and 9 2 during the denitrification process respectively the three stage sad process provides an environmental and economic approach for landfill leachate treatment since it has the advantage of 25 4 less oxygen 100 organic matter savings and 47 9 less external sludge than traditional biological processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords mature landfill leachate sewage anammox partial denitrification sad 1 introduction sloid waste generation is increasing by the growth of population and economic dang et al 2016 among the various approaches to solid waste management landfilling is the most prevalent due to its low maintenance requirements and relatively low expense more than 53 and around 80 of solid waste is disposed by landfilling in the united states and china respectively behrend and krishnamoorthy 2017 xiaoli et al 2013 the world bank predicted that generation of global solid waste would increase from 1 3 to 2 2 billion tons in 2025 singh et al 2011 furthermore one ton of solid waste can produce 0 05 0 2 tons of leachate via the landfilling process during its lifetime kurniawan and lo 2009 maryana et al 2014 wang et al 2016b landfill leachate has been categorized into young intermediate and mature leachate by the landfill age range from 0 to 5 years 5 10 years and more than 10 years respectively gomes et al 2019 mature landfill leachate obtained from the cell containing waste in the stage of maturity due to the longer stabilization of microbial activity mature landfill leachate contains high ammonia 1800 mg l and fewer biodegradable organic matter 2300 mg l with a c n ratio of 1 5 zhang et al 2017 an array of contaminants contained in landfill leachate which bring about adverse human health risks and major environmental problems if not appropriately treated renou et al 2008 chemical and physical treatment processes such as electrodialysis ion exchange and membrane filtration are applied to eliminate nitrogen compounds but are expensive and generally cause secondary waste oloibiri et al 2017 sruthi et al 2018 wang et al 2019c ye et al 2019 in contrast biological treatment affords a coefficient possibility for nitrogen removal from landfill leachate miao et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a however a recent landfill leachate biotreatment showed a nitrogen removal rate nrr 0 5 kg m3d and only obtained a nitrogen removal efficiency nre of 70 80 sri shalini and joseph 2018 other findings demonstrated an nre of 90 but ignored the nrr typically 0 2 kg m3d zhang et al 2017 this indicates that current processes and devices cannot perfectly achieve landfill leachate treatment moreover as a byproduct of biological nitrogen removal process bnr large amount of waste activated sludge was inevitably produced cao et al 2013 which needs subsequent disposal due to strict discharge requirements sludge management significantly inflates wwtps costs ribarova et al 2017 consequently it is imperative to develop an innovative system that efficiently removes nitrogen from mature landfill leachate is favorable to external sludge reduction has stable performance is simple to control and is environmentally friendly a novel simultaneous ammonium oxidation denitrifying novel sad process has received particular attention azari et al 2017a takekawa et al 2014 sad combines partial denitrification n o 3 n n o 2 n with anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox n h 4 n n o 2 n n2 n o 3 n cao et al 2019 kalyuzhnyi and gladchenko 2009 waki et al 2013 and has been demonstrated as the most energy saving nitrogen removal process kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 pan et al 2018 in current anammox processes the production of 11 nitrogen as n o 3 n always decreases the nre li et al 2019 during the sad process complete nitrogen removal could be achieved under denitrifying conditions since the produced n o 3 n via anammox could be reduced to n o 2 n and accomplishes external n h 4 n removal in sad systems the nre has been reported up to 95 when treating synthetic wastewater with acetate serving as organic matter for n o 3 n reduction du et al 2017a partial denitrification pd based sad was used to treat low strength domestic wastewater achieving a 95 8 nre in a lab scale study du et al 2017b however this previous work did not address nitrogen or ammonium removal from raw mature landfill leachate using the sad process more importantly no previous literature has investigated the use of external sludge as organic matter for sad in this study an innovative three stage sad process was proposed to treat mature landfill leachate using external sludge as organic matter for the first time the mature landfill leachate firstly fed to a partial nitrification sequencing batch reactor pn sbr for n o 2 n production then most of the pn sbr effluent along with the external sludge was introduced to an anoxic reactor for integrated fermentation and denitrification ifd sbr the ammonia released by fermentation and the nitrite contained in the residual pn sbr effluent were removed by the anammox process in a sad up flow anaerobic sludge bed sad uasb in addition 11 nitrogen generated in the form of n o 3 n during the anammox process could be reduced to nitrite by partial denitrification and then reused as a substrate for anammox eq 1 to eq 3 fermentation production from ifd sbr serving as carbon source du et al 2017a waki et al 2013 integrated granular and floc sludge integrated in sad uasb anammox bacteria and partial denitrifiers tend to form microbial aggregates such as granular and biofilm sludge in wastewater treatment azari et al 2017b du et al 2017a the cooperation between granular and floc is significant to nitrogen removal in general granular and floc play different roles in the dea uasb thus insight into the different kinds of sludge on nitrogen removal is still required to understand the proposed three stage sad process has significant advantages in comparison to the conventional bnr for treating high ammonia containing mature landfill leachate such a process would have high nitrogen removal efficiency favorable

sludge by ex situ batch tests 4 characterize the microbial community structure especially the anammox bacteria and partial denitrifiers 2 materials and methods 2 1 three stage sad reactors the three stage sad process was established in three separate reactors fig 1 a an sbr effective volume 10 l diameter 120 mm height 930 mm was used for partial nitrification air was released from a compressor to create an aerobic condition the other sbr effective volume 6 l diameter 120 mm height 600 mm was used for integrated fermentation denitrification mechanical stirrers were installed in the sbrs and operated at 196 rpm an up flow anaerobic sludge bed sad uasb working volume 2 l was used for sad the temperature of the system was controlled between 25 0 and 28 2 c 2 2 operational procedure the operational procedure and schematic are illustrated in fig 1 mature landfill leachate 5 0 l was firstly added to the pn sbr ammonia was oxidized to nitrite in the pn sbr aeration stopped once the ammonia valley emerged on the ph profile jaramillo et al 2018 then 93 2 of the pn sbr effluent 4 66 l stored in the middle tank i and 6 8 of the effluent 0 34 l was stored in the middle tank ii wastewater in the middle tank i 2 33 l with a concentrated external was 1 5 l mlss 23057 6014 mg l was introduced into the ifd sbr for integrated fermentation denitrification the operational cycles are shown in fig 1b and the pn sbr duration was twice as long as that of the ifd sbr a large amount of vfas and ammonia would be released during fermentation process completion of denitrification was indicated by the nitrite apex on the ph profile zhang et al 2019a finally the ifd sbr effluent containing n h 4 n and vfas and the n o 2 n wastewater in middle tank ii were continuously fed to the sad uasb by a peristaltic pump at 165 ml h the pn sbr and ifd sbr volume exchange ratios were 50 and 38 9 respectively the sludge dosing ratio of the ifd sbr was 25 the three stage sad process operated for 280 days during the whole operational cycle the pn sbr and ifd sbr were fed with raw mature landfill leachate five phases was divided based on the sad uasb influent characteristics table 1 during phase i start up phase days 0 50 commissioning was started up using synthetic wastewater with average concentrations of 93 4 mg l n h 4 n and 102 2 mg l n o 2 n the mineral element solution contained l 140 mg mgso4 2h2o 150 mg cacl2 2h2o and 50 mg nah2po4 per milliliter trace elements solution supplementary information s1 during phase ii adaptive phase days 51 100 the n h 4 n and n o 2 n contained in the synthetic wastewater were gradually substituted with raw landfill leachate and pn sbr effluent and maintained concentrations of 101 1 5 mg l n h 4 n and 106 4 10 mg l n o 2 n the proportion increased in the influent by 20 every ten days until 100 of the synthetic wastewater was replaced with landfill leachate during phase iii days 101 150 an influent c n o 3 n 1 1 the stoichiometry of removing 1 mg n h 4 n and 1 32 mg n o 2 n produced 0 26 g n o 3 n was used to calculate the influent c n o 3 n ratios of 3 5 and 6 xu et al 2019 ratio of 3 was applied to achieve sad with fermentation production generated in the ifd sbr serving as biological organic matter a detailed description of the ifd sbr is given in supplementary information s2 during phase iv days 151 200 an influent c n o 3 n of 5 was used for complete n o 3 n removal and a desirable nitrogen removal performance after the organic matter inhibition effect the recovery performance and stability of sad were explored in phase v days 201 280 2 3 seeding biomass and wastewater the seeding biomass of the pn sbr and ifd sbr were taken from pilot scale sbr 7 0 m3 that was treating sewage with a desirable partial nitrification performance fig s1 biomass in the sad uasb was derived from an on going granular anammox and pd reactor the anammox reactor had been cultivated with synthetic wastewater for more than 600 days with 1 4 kg m3 d nrr the pd reactor operated at a nitrogen transformation ratio of 80 with acetate serving as the electronic donor du et al 2017b mature landfill leachate was collected from liulitun municipal solid waste sanitation landfill site every week the leachate characteristics were as follows 2075 113 mg l tn 1760 126 mg l n h 4 n 4 2 mg l n o 3 n 3 1 mg l n o 2 n 2039 217 mg l scod 160 7 mg l bod5 4000 843 mg l alkalinity and ph 7 8 0 8 concentrated was was derived from gaobeidian wwtp secondary sludge tank and the characteristics are shown in table s1 2 4 in situ biomass activity assessment to estimate the pd anammox and denitrification capabilities in the sad uasb a methodology was established by the nitrogen species mass balance anammox reduced nitrite to nitrogen gas using ammonia as the electron donor and producing nitrate heterotrophic denitrification converted the nitrogen species in two ways i nitrate produced via anammox was reduced to nitrite and ii nitrite produced via pd or in the influent was reduced to nitrogen gas the mass balance eq 4 was calculated by stoichiometric parameters henze et al 1999 strous et al 1998 basing on the n h 4 n n o 2 n and n o 2 n balances between the influent and effluent of sad uasb and taking into account each nitrogen species in the biological transformation consequently the nitrogen removal and transformation contribution were calculated by the equation set resolution eq 5 4 δ n h 4 n h 4 anammox i nbm 1 y h 1 71 y h n o 2 h i nbm 1 y h 2 86 y h n o 3 h δ n o 3 0 26 n h 4 anammox n o 3 h δ n o 2 n o 2 h 1

referred to as i n bm g n g cod the stoichiometric parameters i n bm and y h are assumed to be 0 07 and 0 625 respectively according to henze et al 1999 2 5 high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing activated sludge samples were collected from the pn sbr ifd sbr and sad uasb on day 280 for microbial community analysis the 16s rrna gene was sequenced on the illumina miseq platform and a 97 identity threshold was used to group the trimmed sequences into operational taxonomic units otus detailed information about bioinformatic analysis is provided in supplementary information s3 2 6 ex situ batch test of granular and floc sludge activity the ex situ pd anammox and denitrification activities were evaluated between granular and floc activated sludge of the sad uasb six identical wide neck glass vessels working volume 0 2 l were used in the test on day 251 the tests were split into group i group ii and group iii with two vessels in each group mixed sludge was taken from the sad uasb and washed with milli q water to remove background substrate after screening with 200 μm granular sludge was inoculated into reactors 1 3 and 5 and floc sludge was inoculated in reactors 2 4 and 6 table s2 the sludge concentration of each group was consistent with the parent reactor the medium containing 40 mg l n o 3 n and 160 mg l cod was added to group i reactor 1 and 2 for pd activity measurement synthetic wastewater with 100 mg l n h 4 n and 130 mg l n o 2 n was added to group ii reactor 3 and 4 for anammox activity assessment and 130 mg l n o 2 n and 520 mg l cod served as substrates in group iii reactor 5 and 6 for denitrification activity examination the batch tests operated at 27 1 c and the speed of stirring rotation was controlled at 250 rpm 2 7 economic and environmental analysis economic and environmental analysis was performed according to the theoretical calculation table s3 to highlight advantages of the three stage sad compared to conventional nitrification denitrification briefly biomass production for partial nitrification nitrification partial denitrification denitrification and anammox are 0 13 0 19 0 37 0 67 and 0 066 g vss g n respectively carbon consumption during partial denitrification and denitrification are 1 14 and 2 86 mg cod g n respectively oxygen demand for partial nitrification and nitrification are 3 43 and 4 86 g g n respectively and co2 production for partial denitrification and denitrification are 1 57 and 3 93 g g n respectively 2 8 analytical methods samples were collected and analyzed daily a lachat quik chem 8500 flow analyzer was used to analyze the concentration of n h 4 n n o 2 n and n o 3 n the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were measured by standard methods miner 2006 the biomass morphology was recorded with an optical microscope olympus bx43 scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 3400n 4700 was used to observe the biomass microstructure a laser particle size analysis system was used to measure the average particle size malvern mastersizer series 2600 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term performance of the pn sbr and ifd sbr the ammonia transformation evolution and nitrite accumulation ratio nar of the pn sbr are shown in fig 2 a throughout the whole experiment the pn sbr operated with a volume exchange ratio of 50 and a nitrogen loading ratio of 0 38 kg m3 d the effluent n o 2 n concentration varied between 1418 5 and 1620 7 mg l and the concentration of nitrate was relatively low fig 2a average nar and ammonia effluent concentrations were 96 5 and 12 5 mg l respectively two primary reasons accounted for the stable partial nitrification performance firstly parameter of ph was applied to control the aeration duration in the pn sbr accurately secondly the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were significantly inhibited when the free ammonia fa and free nitrite acid fna were higher than 10 mg l and 0 2 mg l respectively anthonisen et al 1976 a high ammonia concentration lead to 81 1 mg l fa at the beginning of the operational cycle and 0 29 mg l fna was obtained after the operational cycle overall desirable partial nitrification in the pn sbr was achieved over 280 days the ifd sbr simultaneously received concentrated external was and pn sbr effluent at the beginning of the operational cycle the fna concentration was above 0 16 mg l the biocidal effect of parts per million ppm fna was reported in a number of key microorganisms as an example periodontal bacteria that cause periodontal disease could be completely killed at 0 2 mg hno2 n l with 24 h expose allaker et al 2010 following that jiang reported that viable microorganisms within the anaerobic biofilms decreased from 80 to 10 after exposure to fna for 6 h at concentration of 0 2 0 3 mg l jiang et al 2011 organic matter contained in the was was released to the aqueous phase by fna promotion wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 then served as an electronic donor for denitrification concentration of n o 2 n was decreased by 675 3 mg l during 10 4 h with nrr of 0 52 kg m3 d fig s2b which is in accordance with previous results zhang et al 2019b the nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the effluent ranged from 0 3 to 1 6 mg l and 1 3 8 6 mg l respectively due to sufficient organic matter production via fermentation fig 2b an average of 47 9 external sludge reduction 16 6 g dry sludge consumption and 2 5 kg m3 d sludge reduction rate srr were observed during the operational cycle fig 2c however as a by product of fermentation 87 6 115 1 mg l of n h 4 n discharged into the aqueous phase fig 2b as is the released ammonia nitrogen cannot meet the landfill leachate emission standards in china n h 4 n 15 mg l tn 40 mg l and brings about great adverse effects 3 2 long term performance of the sad uasb 3 2 1 start up phase performance with respect to the high concentration ammonia released in the ifd sbr an effective sad process was applied to tertiary nitrogen removal the sad uasb performance over 280 days is shown in fig 3 the first 50 days corresponded to cultivation and anammox enrichment after inoculation phase i the influent ammonia and nitrite concentrations ranged from 87 3 to 95 4 mg l and 99 6 105 1 mg l respectively by the synthetic wastewater preparation fig 3a during phase i the nitrogen removal performance was satisfactory after day 37 with an average nre of 73 2 fig 3b the n o 2 n consumption n h 4 n consumption stoichiometry was 1 2 fig 3c which is close to the 1 32 value reported by sri sri shalini and joseph 2018 3 2 2 adaptive phase performance from days 50 100 phase ii influent synthetic wastewater was gradually substituted by landfill leachate by increasing the proportion by 20 every ten days table 1 landfill leachate was found to negatively affect the nitrogen removal performance this was most notable for the n o 3 n n h 4 n ratio 0 51 fig 3c which was obviously higher than previously reported 0 26 for the anammox process molinuevo et al 2009 the overshooting of effluent n o 3 n was caused by two main factors the inability of anammox to adapt to landfill leachate and injection of nitrification related microorganisms into the sad uasb from the pn sbr and ifd sbr effluent a n o 3 n n h 4 n coefficient of 0 34 was previously obtained in a 2 0 l sbr with biomass treating anaerobically pre treated municipal wastewater leal et al 2016 jin reported that influent do enriched nitrifiers aob and nob in an anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed and that some ammonia was oxidized via the nitrification pathway jin et al 2019 for this reason influent for the sad uasb was flushed with nitrogen gas until a do of 0 2 mg l was obtained to avoid both ammonia and nitrite consumption via the nitrification pathway from day 67 the nitrogen removal efficiency subsequently increased to 81 6 from 75 7 fig 3b with an average 74 5 nitrogen removal contribution for anammox the results obtained in phase ii illustrate adaptation of the biomass in the mature landfill leachate 3 2 3 optimization phase performance from days 101 280 phase iii v the experiment was carried out with increasing influent c n o 3 n ratios sludge fermentation production from the ifd sbr served as the carbon source a detailed description is given in supplementary information s1 during phase iii a c n ratio of 3 was found to enhance the nre fig 3b and promote pd activity fig 3d the average effluent nitrate progressively decreased to 19 4 mg l which was much lower than that in phases i and ii mass balance confirmed that the average 10 8 mg l of nitrate produced by anammox was reduced to nitrite via the pd process and that 0 02 kg m3 d of pd activity was obtained fig 3d as pd was taking place the higher anammox activity was observed from 0 30 kg m3 d in phase ii to 0 35 kg m3 d in phase iii although the nre was 90 4 effluent ammonia and nitrate still accumulated to 10 2 and 19 4 mg l on average respectively fig 3a the pd reaction requires a c n o 3 n ratio of 3 with acetate supplied for organic matter cao et al 2013 fermentation production contains a certain percentage of refractory organic matter that cannot be fully utilized by denitrifiers the large amount of residual n h 4 n and n o 3 n may be caused by deficient organic matter for the pd process results in phase iii demonstrate that a desirable effluent value can be achieved by optimizing the c n o 3 n in phase iv prolonging the duration of fermentation in the ifd sbr for sad uasb increased with an influent c n o 3 n ratio of 5 0 a detailed description is given in supplementary information s1 with the initial c n o 3 n increasing to 5 0 the effluent n h 4 n n o 2 n and n o 3 n decreased to 3 4 1 7 and 7 5 mg l respectively fig 3a and an average nre of 93 4 was obtained days 152 164 meanwhile the nrr was enhanced to 0 4 kg m3 d with the anammox process contributing up to 84 7 of the nitrogen removal fig 3d however on day 185 the effluent ammonia concentration sharply increased to 24 mg l while nitrate and nitrite were almost completely consumed fig 3a anammox was partially suppressed decreasing its participation in nitrogen removal from 93 4 on day 160 to 83 3 on day 189 along with the inhibition of anammox participation heterotrophic denitrification was favored as 24 3 of the influent nitrite was consumed by the denitrification process and a higher denitrification activity 0 04 kg m3 d was consequently observed fig 3d an overwhelming amount of organic matter led to an inevitable fraction participating in the heterotrophic n o 2 n and complete n o 3 n reduction the cellular yield coefficient y 0 066 and growth rate of anammox bacteria were much lower than that of the heterotrophic bacteria y 0 27 according to strous et al 1998 a similar result was found by ni who observed that a c n o 2 n ratio of 1 5 inhibited 20 of the granular anammox activity ni et al 2012 in order to prevent excessive growth of denitrifiers a wastewater c n o 3 n of 4 c n 0 5 was fed to the sad uasb on day 190 however the activity of the anammox process did not immediately recover as average 29 2 mg l ammonia residual from day 192 200 several studies have reported that the suppression of anammox by high organic matter could be eliminated by reducing the influent c n du et al 2019 jin et al 2012 after 12 days operation the effluent n h 4 n concentration appeared to gradually decrease fig 3a and the nitrogen removal contribution of anammox increased stepwise and was maintained at 83 1 fig 3d limited organic matter was preferentially utilized by the pd process during the following operation an excellent nitrogen removal performance was obtained with average effluent n h 4 n n o 3 n and tn concentrations of 4 3 7 5 and 16 7 mg l based on the stoichiometry of the complete sad reaction eq 3 oxidation of 1 mol n h 4 n resulted in the reduction of 1 06 mol of n o 2 n as a result the stoichiometric ratio of n o 2 n n h 4 n in most case of phase v was 1 12 fig 3c with pd and anammox activities of 0 045 and 0 38 kg m3d fig 3d respectively this indicates achievement of desirable cooperation between pd and anammox and sustained stably in the sad uasb over long term operation 3 3 biomass characteristics in the sad uasb 3 3 1 microbial community characteristics proteobacteria 61 9 bacteroidetes 16 2 actinobacteria 3 97 ignavibacteriae 3 4 and chloroflexi 2 39 were the main phyla in the pn sbr fig 4 a proteobacteria is a typical phylum related to nitrogen cycling and has been previously reported at high abundances in partial nitrification systems joicy et al 2019 wang et al 2019a multiple bacterial communities involved nitrification nitrosomonas 3 identified as the dominant aob played an important role in realizing stable partial nitrification process in the pn sbr nitrosomonas were found to be effective in treating various sewage such as municipal sewage industrial wastewater landfill leachate and synthetic wastewater du et al 2017a molinuevo et al 2009 zhang et al 2019a only small proportions of nitrospirae 0 61 nitrotoga 0 01 and nitrobacter 0 005 were detected demonstrating that nob were inhibited during long term operation in the ifd sbr the dominant members belonged to proteobacteria actinobacteria chloroflexi and firmicutes which were correlated with anaerobic fermentation representing up to 49 1 of the community fig 4a as documented in previous findings proteobacteria are involved in denitrification and simultaneously have the potential to solubilize organic particulates wang et al 2016a guggeheimella sp and propionibacteriaceae which are producers of short chain fermentation volatiles accounted for 1 3 and 0 8 respectively in the ifd sbr accelerating the organic matter contained in was releasing to the aqueous phase lin et al 2017 wyss et al 2005 anaerolineae has been shown to degrade complex carbohydrates and reduce nitrite thereby playing a significant role in integrated fermentation and deinitritation fig s3 three kinds of anammox bacteria were identified at the genus level in sad uasb namely candidatus kuenenia 0 08 candidatus jettenia 0 05 and candidatus brocadia 1 5 of the phylum planctomycetes 6 fig 4b moreover the denitrifying genus denitratisoma 1 7 was identified and possibly responsible for the denitrification pathway during nitrogen removal xu et al 2018 notably the populations of nitrosomonas and nitrospira were most possibility injected with the pn sbr and ifd sbr effluent and survived on residual oxygen of the influent which could partly explain the reason the n o 3 n n h 4 n ratio was higher than 0 26 during phase i in addition the genus thauera accounted for 4 3 of the microbial community fig 4b in agreement with recent literature demonstrating that a high percentage of thauera is commonly found in pd reactors cao et al 2019 du et al 2017a kalyuzhnyi and gladchenko 2009 throughout the operational cycle the sad uasb exhibited an increasing nre from 77 7 phase i to 97 6 phase v this illustrates that the stable n o 2 n substrate was produced by in situ partial denitrifiers providing sufficient electron acceptors for the anammox process coexistence of microorganisms related to anammox and partial denitrification were the main reason behind the excellent stability of the sad process for treating mature landfill leachate 3 3 2 sludge morphology characteristics the biomass characteristics of the sad uasb were monitored during the whole operation after inoculation more than 50 of the granules had a particle size exceeding 350 μm the toxicity of landfill leachate has an inhibitory impact on granulation and decreases microbial growth wang et al 2015 2019b approximately 46 3 of the granular sludge larger than 350 μm particle size still existed on day 100 fig 5 a indicating that the granules had an excellent capacity for treating mature landfill leachate with the increased c n ratio the distribution of granule diameters showed a slight polarization trend fig 5a which may be attributed to the growth of denitrifying bacteria cao et al 2019 increasing the mature landfill leachate proportion and c n caused the granules to change from brownish yellow to a darker color becoming covered by a layer of dark bacteria fig 5b previous studies assumed that heterotrophic denitrifiers prefer to attach on the surface of granules due to the accessibility of aqueous organic matter and sufficient mass transfer which then provides favorable growth conditions for the inner anammox bacteria chamchoi et al 2008 molinuevo et al 2009 zhang et al 2019c denitrification and anammox bacteria have different niches in the granular sludge the sem images showed the granular sludge surface aggregated various microorganisms with a cauliflower like shape and gave priority to spherical elliptical and bacilli bacteria fig s4 moreover reddish microbes aggregated as wall growth gradually and attached on reactor internal wall gradually microorganisms attached on the reactor wall were dense coccoid cells which were also recognized as anammox bacteria kuenen 2008 3 4 pd anammox and denitrification activity between granular and floc biomass to better understand the biomass activity between granular and floc sludge ex situ tests were conducted on day 280 nitrite gradually accumulated concomitant with nitrate reduction in the granular sludge pd activity test reaching the maximum level 21 6 mg l at 4 5 h fig 6 a which corresponds to a nitrate transformation rate ntr of 0 11 kg m3 d in the following period accumulated n o 2 n maintained a constant concentration until the end of the test this was in line with the long term sad uasb performance with an ntr of 0 032 0 049 kg m3 d but denitrification activity was low 0 002 0 011 kg m3 d in phase v concerning the floc sludge the pd performance was less efficient with an ntr of 0 047 kg m3 d and nitrite accumulation of 37 1 fig 6b results indicate that the granular sludge was primarily responsible for nitrate reduction in the sad uasb this was also well supported by the sludge morphology observation which showed a layer of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria covering the surface of the granular sludge fig 5b since the denitrifiers had sufficient substrate and mass transfer to achieve desirable cooperation with anammox bacteria the description of the mechanism model graphical abstract shows that an efficient pd process reliably provides n o 2 n for anammox which is considered as the most beneficial condition for achieving stable and efficient nitrogen removal performance focusing on the anammox activity a variety of nitrogen compounds were explored fig 6c and d n h 4 n served as an electron donor for n o 2 n removal via the anammox process in the granular sludge group the concentrations of ammonia and nitrite linearly decreased from 94 6 to 124 4 mg l to 0 59 and 0 58 mg l within 14 h respectively at the same time 34 0 mg l n o 3 n subsequently accumulated which was slightly higher than the theoretical value for nitrogen produced as n o 3 n during anammox 11 24 6 mg l for the floc sludge group ammonia and nitrite were reduced at a lower rate the ammonia and nitrite decreased by 58 4 and 83 5 mg l within 14 h anammox activities between the granular and floc sludge were 0 37 and 0 24 kg m3 d respectively which indicates that anammox bacteria were inclined to grow in the granular sludge rather than the floc environment previous studies investigated the substrate inhibition on anammox by haldane model de prá et al 2016 puyol et al 2013 zheng et al 2017 anammox activity decreased by 71 4 along with the increase of nitrite concentration from 50 to 150 mg l zheng et al 2017 obvious difference in kinetic coefficients was observed under various concentrations indicating that complete inhibition of the anammox activity with no2 concentration of 100 mg l strous et al 1998 while other studies have reported that anammox bacteria performed higher tolerance to n o 2 n with the values of 222 mg l tang et al 2011 the nitrite inhibitions on the anammox has been largely relieved in sad uasb since a higher mass transfer resistance performed by granular red colored bacteria dominated the interior of the granular sludge fig 5b and were confirmed as anammox bacteria granular sludge has a greater capacity to retain and immobilize anammox bacteria than floc sludge due to a more protective barrier that increases stress resistance kong et al 2018 liu et al 2017 denitrification activity was also examined in the granular and floc sludge the average nitrogen removal rates were 0 22 and 0 23 kg m3 d respectively and the removal efficiencies were 95 5 and 96 9 respectively within 12 h all above results collectively demonstrate that the pd process cooperated well with anammox for desirable nitrogen removal and that the autotrophic anammox prevailed over heterotrophic denitrification when n o 2 n was provided 3 5 feasible analyses in engineering implications the mass flow of nitrogen was determined to evaluate the three stage sad process for engineering implications as shown in fig 7 97 of the influent ammonia was oxidized to nitrite in the pn sbr with 3 nitrogen loss by simultaneous nitrogen and denitrification snd then 90 4 of the nitrogen compounds were stored in the middle tank i while 6 6 were stored in the middle tank ii an average of 34 6 g dry external sludge and middle tank i wastewater were introduced into the ifd sbr for simultaneous fermentation and denitrification the enhanced sludge consumption rate 2 5 kg m3 d improved the nitrogen removal efficiency 81 9 with 0 51 g n g ss of nitrogen removed per unit of dosing sludge recently a large amount of external sludge has been produced in wwtps i e in 2010 11 million tons of dry sludge generated in china ideally organic matter contained in was could be captured for denitrification in the proposed system additionally 6 25 n was released in the form of ammonia in the final of ifd sbr operational cycle in the sad uasb 83 1 of the influent nitrogen was removed through anammox and 4 6 nitrogen removal was achieved by denitrification as demonstrated in this study only 1 7 of the nitrogen residues were in the effluent and the nre was as high as 98 3 as such the proposed three stage sad process provides a feasible engineering solution for energy positive operations in wwtps see fig 8 3 6 economic and environmental analyses of the three stage sad the primary operational costs of wwtps include excess sludge disposal expenses external carbon addition and aeration energy consumption these aspects were thus used to evaluate the economic advantages of the three stage sad process compared with traditional nitrogen removal processes during traditional nitrification denitrification 0 86 g biomass is produced 2 86 g cod is required and 4 6 g o2 is needed to remove 1 g n h 4 n conversely in the three stage sad process 1 33 g biomass is reduced a 154 decrease no cod is consumed 100 savings and 3 43 g oxygen is required a 25 4 decrease illustrating that the three stage sad process is economically favorable in order to maintain a low growth rate of anammox microorganisms the sludge of the sad uasb is normally not discharged which would further increase external sludge reduction co2 is recognized as an undesirable by product of wwtps due to its greenhouse effect to remove 1 g n h 4 n more than 3 93 g co2 is produced during traditional nitrification denitrification but only 2 2 g co2 is produced during three stage sad thus the three stage sad system is environmentally favorable compared with the traditional nitrification denitrification process 4 conclusions the three stage sad process was first investigated for long term 280 days nitrogen removal from high load ammonia mature landfill leachate using external sludge as external organic matter during the stable period the whole system effluent tn of 16 7 mg l nre of 98 3 and ifd sbr sludge reduction rate of 2 5 kg m3 d were obtained with the influent cod n h 4 n and tn of 2039 217 mg l 1760 126 mg l and 2075 13 mg l respectively coexistence of anammox bacteria 1 5 candidatus brocadia and partial denitrifying bacteria 4 3 thauera was responsible for the stability of the anammox process with an 83 1 nitrogen removal contribution in the sad uasb three stage sad provides an advantageous environmental and economical approach with a 25 4 lower oxygen requirement 100 organic matter savings and 47 9 less external sludge production compared with traditional biological

18320,high loaded ammonia and low strength organics mature landfill leachate is not effectively treated by conventional biological processes herein an innovative solution was proposed using a three stage simultaneous ammonium oxidation denitrifying sad process firstly ammonia 1760 126 mg n l in wastewater was oxidized to nitrite in a partial nitrification sequencing batch reactor pn sbr next 93 pn sbr effluent and concentrated external waste activated sludge was mlss 23057 6014 mg l were introduced to an anoxic reactor for integrated fermentation and denitrification ifd sbr finally ammonia 101 4 13 8 mg n l released by fermentation in the ifd sbr and residual 7 nitrite in the pn sbr were removed through the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process in the sad up flow anaerobic sludge bed sad uasb in addition n o 3 n generation during the anammox process could be reduced to nitrite by partial denitrification pd and reused as substrate for anammox a satisfactory total nitrogen tn removal efficiency 98 3 external sludge reduction rate 2 5 kg m3 d and effluent tn concentration 16 7 mg l were achieved after long term operation 280 days the ifd sbr and sad uasb contributed to 81 9 and 12 3 nitrogen removal respectively microbial analysis showed that anammox bacteria 1 5 candidatus brocadia cooperated well with partial denitrifying bacteria 4 3 thauera in sad uasb and average nitrogen removal contribution were 83 1 during significant stability of anammox and 9 2 during the denitrification process respectively the three stage sad process provides an environmental and economic approach for landfill leachate treatment since it has the advantage of 25 4 less oxygen 100 organic matter savings and 47 9 less external sludge than traditional biological processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords mature landfill leachate sewage anammox partial denitrification sad 1 introduction sloid waste generation is increasing by the growth of population and economic dang et al 2016 among the various approaches to solid waste management landfilling is the most prevalent due to its low maintenance requirements and relatively low expense more than 53 and around 80 of solid waste is disposed by landfilling in the united states and china respectively behrend and krishnamoorthy 2017 xiaoli et al 2013 the world bank predicted that generation of global solid waste would increase from 1 3 to 2 2 billion tons in 2025 singh et al 2011 furthermore one ton of solid waste can produce 0 05 0 2 tons of leachate via the landfilling process during its lifetime kurniawan and lo 2009 maryana et al 2014 wang et al 2016b landfill leachate has been categorized into young intermediate and mature leachate by the landfill age range from 0 to 5 years 5 10 years and more than 10 years respectively gomes et al 2019 mature landfill leachate obtained from the cell containing waste in the stage of maturity due to the longer stabilization of microbial activity mature landfill leachate contains high ammonia 1800 mg l and fewer biodegradable organic matter 2300 mg l with a c n ratio of 1 5 zhang et al 2017 an array of contaminants contained in landfill leachate which bring about adverse human health risks and major environmental problems if not appropriately treated renou et al 2008 chemical and physical treatment processes such as electrodialysis ion exchange and membrane filtration are applied to eliminate nitrogen compounds but are expensive and generally cause secondary waste oloibiri et al 2017 sruthi et al 2018 wang et al 2019c ye et al 2019 in contrast biological treatment affords a coefficient possibility for nitrogen removal from landfill leachate miao et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a however a recent landfill leachate biotreatment showed a nitrogen removal rate nrr 0 5 kg m3d and only obtained a nitrogen removal efficiency nre of 70 80 sri shalini and joseph 2018 other findings demonstrated an nre of 90 but ignored the nrr typically 0 2 kg m3d zhang et al 2017 this indicates that current processes and devices cannot perfectly achieve landfill leachate treatment moreover as a byproduct of biological nitrogen removal process bnr large amount of waste activated sludge was inevitably produced cao et al 2013 which needs subsequent disposal due to strict discharge requirements sludge management significantly inflates wwtps costs ribarova et al 2017 consequently it is imperative to develop an innovative system that efficiently removes nitrogen from mature landfill leachate is favorable to external sludge reduction has stable performance is simple to control and is environmentally friendly a novel simultaneous ammonium oxidation denitrifying novel sad process has received particular attention azari et al 2017a takekawa et al 2014 sad

demonstrated as the most energy saving nitrogen removal process kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 pan et al 2018 in current anammox processes the production of 11 nitrogen as n o 3 n always decreases the nre li et al 2019 during the sad process complete nitrogen removal could be achieved under denitrifying conditions since the produced n o 3 n via anammox could be reduced to n o 2 n and accomplishes external n h 4 n removal in sad systems the nre has been reported up to 95 when treating synthetic wastewater with acetate serving as organic matter for n o 3 n reduction du et al 2017a partial denitrification pd based sad was used to treat low strength domestic wastewater achieving a 95 8 nre in a lab scale study du et al 2017b however this previous work did not address nitrogen or ammonium removal from raw mature landfill leachate using the sad process more importantly no previous literature has investigated the use of external sludge as organic matter for sad in this study an innovative three stage sad process was proposed to treat mature landfill leachate using external sludge as organic matter for the first time the mature landfill leachate firstly fed to a partial nitrification sequencing batch reactor pn sbr for n o 2 n production then most of the pn sbr effluent along with the external sludge was introduced to an anoxic reactor for integrated fermentation and denitrification ifd sbr the ammonia released by fermentation and the nitrite contained in the residual pn sbr effluent were removed by the anammox process in a sad up flow anaerobic sludge bed sad uasb in addition 11 nitrogen generated in the form of n o 3 n during the anammox process could be reduced to nitrite by partial denitrification and then reused as a substrate for anammox eq 1 to eq 3 fermentation production from ifd sbr serving as carbon source du et al 2017a waki et al 2013 integrated granular and floc sludge integrated in sad uasb anammox bacteria and partial denitrifiers tend to form microbial aggregates such as granular and biofilm sludge in wastewater treatment azari et al 2017b du et al 2017a the cooperation between granular and floc is significant to nitrogen removal in general granular and floc play different roles in the dea uasb thus insight into the different kinds of sludge on nitrogen removal is still required to understand the proposed three stage sad process has significant advantages in comparison to the conventional bnr for treating high ammonia containing mature landfill leachate such a process would have high nitrogen removal efficiency favorable

stage sad process was established in three separate reactors fig 1 a an sbr effective volume 10 l diameter 120 mm height 930 mm was used for partial nitrification air was released from a compressor to create an aerobic condition the other sbr effective volume 6 l diameter 120 mm height 600 mm was used for integrated fermentation denitrification mechanical stirrers were installed in the sbrs and operated at 196 rpm an up flow anaerobic sludge bed sad uasb working volume 2 l was used for sad the temperature of the system was controlled between 25 0 and 28 2 c 2 2 operational procedure the operational procedure and schematic are illustrated in fig 1 mature landfill leachate 5 0 l was firstly added to the pn sbr ammonia was oxidized to nitrite in the pn sbr aeration stopped once the ammonia valley emerged on the ph profile jaramillo et al 2018 then 93 2 of the pn sbr effluent 4 66 l stored in the middle tank i and 6 8 of the effluent 0 34 l was stored in the middle tank ii wastewater in the middle tank i 2 33 l with a concentrated external was 1 5 l mlss 23057 6014 mg l was introduced into the ifd sbr for integrated fermentation denitrification the operational cycles are shown in fig 1b and the pn sbr duration was twice as long as that of the ifd sbr a large amount of vfas and ammonia would be released during fermentation process completion of denitrification was indicated by the nitrite apex on the ph profile zhang et al 2019a finally the ifd sbr effluent containing n h 4 n and vfas and the n o 2 n wastewater in middle tank ii were continuously fed to the sad uasb by a peristaltic pump at 165 ml h the pn sbr and ifd sbr volume exchange ratios were 50 and 38 9 respectively the sludge dosing ratio of the ifd sbr was 25 the three stage sad process operated for 280 days during the whole operational cycle the pn sbr and ifd sbr were fed with raw mature landfill leachate five phases was divided based on the sad uasb influent characteristics table 1 during phase i start up phase days 0 50 commissioning was started up using synthetic wastewater with average concentrations of 93 4 mg l n h 4 n and 102 2 mg l n o 2 n the mineral element solution contained

in the synthetic wastewater were gradually substituted with raw landfill leachate and pn sbr effluent and maintained concentrations of 101 1 5 mg l n h 4 n and 106 4 10 mg l n o 2 n the proportion increased in the influent by 20 every ten days until 100 of the synthetic wastewater was replaced with landfill leachate during phase iii days 101 150 an influent c n o 3 n 1 1 the stoichiometry of removing 1 mg n h 4 n and 1 32 mg n o 2 n produced 0 26 g n o 3 n was used to calculate the influent c n o 3 n ratios of 3 5 and 6 xu et al 2019 ratio of 3 was applied to achieve sad with fermentation production generated in the ifd sbr serving as biological organic matter a detailed description of the ifd sbr is given in supplementary information s2 during phase iv days 151 200 an influent c n o 3 n of 5 was used for complete n o 3 n removal and a desirable nitrogen removal performance after the organic matter inhibition effect the recovery performance and stability of sad were explored in phase v days 201 280 2 3 seeding biomass and wastewater the seeding biomass of the pn sbr and ifd sbr were taken from pilot scale sbr 7 0 m3 that was treating sewage with a desirable partial nitrification performance fig s1 biomass in the sad uasb was derived from an on going granular anammox and pd reactor the anammox reactor had been cultivated with synthetic wastewater for more than 600 days with 1 4 kg m3 d nrr the pd reactor operated at a nitrogen transformation ratio of 80 with acetate serving as the electronic donor du et al 2017b mature landfill leachate was collected from liulitun municipal solid waste sanitation landfill site every week the leachate characteristics were as follows 2075 113 mg l tn 1760 126 mg l n h 4 n 4 2 mg l n o 3 n 3 1 mg l n o 2 n 2039 217 mg l

activity assessment to estimate the pd anammox and denitrification capabilities in the sad uasb a methodology was established by the nitrogen species mass balance anammox reduced nitrite to nitrogen gas using ammonia as the electron donor and producing nitrate heterotrophic denitrification converted the nitrogen species in two ways i nitrate produced via anammox was reduced to nitrite and ii nitrite produced via pd or in the influent was reduced to nitrogen gas the mass balance eq 4 was calculated by stoichiometric parameters henze et al 1999 strous et al 1998 basing on the n h 4 n n o 2 n and n o 2 n balances between the influent and effluent of sad uasb and taking into account each nitrogen species in the biological transformation consequently the nitrogen removal and transformation

activated sludge samples were collected from the pn sbr ifd sbr and sad uasb on day 280 for microbial community analysis the 16s rrna gene was sequenced on the illumina miseq platform and a 97 identity threshold was used to group the trimmed sequences into operational taxonomic units otus detailed information about bioinformatic analysis is provided in supplementary information s3 2 6 ex situ batch test of granular and floc sludge activity the ex situ pd anammox and denitrification activities were evaluated between granular and floc activated sludge of the sad uasb six identical wide neck glass vessels working volume 0 2 l were used in the test on day 251 the tests were split into group i group ii and group iii with two vessels in each group mixed sludge was taken from the sad uasb and washed with milli q water to remove background substrate after screening with 200 μm granular sludge was inoculated into reactors 1 3 and 5 and floc sludge was inoculated in reactors 2 4 and 6 table s2 the sludge concentration of each group was consistent with the parent reactor the medium containing 40 mg l n o 3 n and 160 mg l cod was added to group i reactor 1 and 2 for pd activity measurement synthetic wastewater with 100 mg l n h 4 n and 130 mg l n o 2 n was added to group ii reactor 3 and 4 for anammox activity assessment and 130 mg l n o 2 n and 520 mg l cod served as substrates in group iii reactor 5 and 6 for denitrification activity examination the batch tests operated at 27 1 c and the speed of stirring rotation was controlled at 250 rpm 2 7 economic and environmental analysis economic and environmental analysis was performed according to the theoretical calculation table s3 to highlight advantages of the three stage sad compared to conventional nitrification denitrification briefly biomass production for partial nitrification nitrification partial denitrification denitrification and anammox are 0 13 0 19 0 37 0 67 and 0 066 g vss g n respectively carbon consumption during partial denitrification and denitrification are 1 14 and 2 86 mg cod g n respectively oxygen demand for partial nitrification and nitrification are 3 43 and 4 86 g g n respectively and co2 production for partial denitrification and denitrification are 1 57 and 3 93 g g n respectively 2 8 analytical methods samples were collected and analyzed daily a lachat quik chem 8500 flow analyzer was used to analyze the concentration of n h 4 n n o 2 n and n o 3 n the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were measured by standard methods miner 2006 the biomass morphology was recorded with an optical microscope olympus bx43 scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 3400n 4700 was used to observe the biomass microstructure a laser particle size analysis system was used to measure the average particle size malvern mastersizer series 2600 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term performance of the pn sbr and ifd sbr the ammonia transformation evolution and nitrite accumulation ratio nar of the pn sbr are shown in fig 2 a throughout the whole experiment the pn sbr operated with a volume exchange ratio of 50 and a nitrogen loading ratio of 0 38 kg m3 d the effluent n o 2 n concentration varied between 1418 5 and 1620 7 mg l and the concentration of nitrate was relatively low fig 2a average nar and ammonia effluent concentrations were 96 5 and 12 5 mg l respectively two primary reasons accounted for the stable partial nitrification performance firstly parameter of ph was applied to control the aeration duration in the pn sbr accurately secondly the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were significantly inhibited when the free ammonia fa and free nitrite acid fna were higher than 10 mg l and 0 2 mg l respectively anthonisen et al 1976 a high ammonia concentration lead to 81 1 mg l fa at the beginning of the operational cycle and 0 29 mg l fna was obtained after the operational cycle overall desirable partial nitrification in the pn sbr was achieved over 280 days the ifd sbr simultaneously received concentrated external was and pn sbr effluent at the beginning of the operational cycle the fna concentration was above 0 16 mg l the biocidal effect of parts per million ppm fna was reported in a number of key microorganisms as an example periodontal bacteria that cause periodontal disease could be completely killed at 0 2 mg hno2 n l with 24 h expose allaker et al 2010 following that jiang reported that viable microorganisms within the anaerobic biofilms decreased from 80 to 10 after exposure to fna for 6 h at concentration of 0 2 0 3 mg l jiang et al 2011 organic matter contained in the was was released to the aqueous phase by fna promotion wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 then served as an electronic donor for denitrification concentration of n o 2 n was decreased by 675 3 mg l during 10 4 h with nrr of 0 52 kg m3 d fig s2b which is in accordance with previous results zhang et al 2019b the nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the effluent ranged from 0 3 to 1 6 mg l and 1 3 8 6 mg l respectively due to sufficient organic matter production via fermentation fig 2b an average of 47 9 external sludge reduction 16 6 g dry sludge consumption and 2 5 kg m3 d sludge reduction rate srr were observed during the operational cycle fig 2c however as a by product of fermentation 87 6 115 1 mg l of n h 4 n discharged into the aqueous phase fig 2b as is the released ammonia nitrogen cannot meet the landfill leachate emission standards in china n h 4 n 15 mg l tn 40 mg l and brings about great adverse effects 3 2 long term performance of the sad uasb 3 2 1 start up phase performance with respect to the high concentration ammonia released in the ifd sbr an effective sad process was applied to tertiary nitrogen removal the sad uasb performance over 280 days is shown in fig 3 the first 50 days corresponded to cultivation and anammox enrichment after inoculation phase i the influent ammonia and nitrite concentrations ranged from 87 3 to 95 4 mg l and 99 6 105 1 mg l respectively by the synthetic wastewater preparation fig 3a during phase i the nitrogen removal performance was satisfactory after day 37 with an average nre of 73 2 fig 3b the n o 2 n consumption n h 4 n consumption stoichiometry was 1 2 fig 3c which is close to the 1 32 value reported by sri sri shalini and joseph 2018 3 2 2 adaptive phase performance from days 50 100 phase ii influent synthetic wastewater was gradually substituted by landfill leachate by increasing the proportion by 20 every ten days table 1 landfill leachate was found to negatively affect the nitrogen removal performance this was most notable for the n o 3 n n h 4 n ratio 0 51 fig 3c which was obviously higher than previously reported 0 26 for the anammox process molinuevo et al 2009 the overshooting of effluent n o 3 n was caused by two main factors the inability of anammox to adapt to landfill leachate and injection of nitrification related microorganisms into the sad uasb from the pn sbr and ifd sbr effluent a n o 3 n n h 4 n coefficient of 0 34 was previously obtained in a 2 0 l sbr with biomass treating anaerobically pre treated municipal wastewater leal et al 2016 jin reported that influent do enriched nitrifiers aob and nob in an anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed and that some ammonia was oxidized via the nitrification pathway jin et al 2019 for this reason influent for the sad uasb was flushed with nitrogen gas until a do of 0 2 mg l was obtained to avoid both ammonia and nitrite consumption via the nitrification pathway from day 67 the nitrogen removal efficiency subsequently increased to 81 6 from 75 7 fig 3b with an average 74 5 nitrogen removal contribution for anammox the results obtained in phase ii illustrate adaptation of the biomass in the mature landfill leachate 3 2 3 optimization phase performance from days 101 280 phase iii v the experiment was carried out with increasing influent c n o 3 n ratios sludge fermentation production from the ifd sbr served as the carbon source a detailed description is given in supplementary information s1 during phase iii a c n ratio of 3 was found to enhance the nre fig 3b and promote pd activity fig 3d the average effluent nitrate progressively decreased to 19 4 mg l which was much lower than that in phases i and ii mass balance confirmed that the average 10 8 mg l of nitrate produced by anammox was reduced to nitrite via the pd process and that 0 02 kg m3 d of pd activity was obtained fig 3d as pd was taking place the higher anammox activity was observed from 0 30 kg m3 d in phase ii to 0 35 kg m3 d in phase iii although the nre was 90 4 effluent ammonia and nitrate still accumulated to 10 2 and 19 4 mg l on average respectively fig 3a the pd reaction requires a c n o 3 n ratio of 3 with acetate supplied for organic matter cao et al 2013 fermentation production contains a certain percentage of refractory organic matter that cannot be fully utilized by denitrifiers the large amount of residual n h 4 n and n o 3 n may be caused by deficient organic matter for the pd process results in phase iii demonstrate that a desirable effluent value can be achieved by optimizing the c n o 3 n in phase iv prolonging the duration of fermentation in the ifd sbr for sad uasb increased with an influent c n o 3 n ratio of 5 0 a detailed description is given in supplementary information s1 with the initial c n o 3 n increasing to 5 0 the effluent n h 4 n n o 2 n and n o 3 n decreased to 3 4 1 7 and 7 5 mg l respectively fig 3a and an average nre of 93 4 was obtained days 152 164 meanwhile the nrr was enhanced to 0 4 kg m3 d with the anammox process contributing up to 84 7 of the nitrogen removal fig 3d however on day 185 the effluent ammonia concentration sharply increased to 24 mg l while nitrate and nitrite were almost completely consumed fig 3a anammox was partially suppressed decreasing its participation in nitrogen removal from 93 4 on day 160 to 83 3 on day 189 along with the inhibition of anammox participation heterotrophic denitrification was favored as 24 3 of the influent nitrite was consumed by the denitrification process and a higher denitrification activity 0 04 kg m3 d was consequently observed fig 3d an overwhelming amount of organic matter led to an inevitable fraction participating in the heterotrophic n o 2 n and complete n o 3 n reduction the cellular yield coefficient y 0 066 and growth rate of anammox bacteria were much lower than that of the heterotrophic bacteria y 0 27 according to strous et al 1998 a similar result was found by ni who observed that a c n o 2 n ratio of 1 5 inhibited 20 of the granular anammox activity ni et al 2012 in order to prevent excessive growth of denitrifiers a wastewater c n o 3 n of 4 c n 0 5 was fed to the sad uasb on day 190 however the activity of the anammox process did not immediately recover as average 29 2 mg l ammonia residual from day 192 200 several studies have reported that the suppression of anammox by high organic matter could be eliminated by reducing the influent c n du et al 2019 jin et al 2012 after 12 days operation the effluent n h 4 n concentration appeared to gradually decrease fig 3a and the nitrogen removal contribution of anammox increased stepwise and was maintained at 83 1 fig 3d limited organic matter was preferentially utilized by the pd process during the following operation an excellent nitrogen removal performance was obtained with average effluent n h 4 n n o 3 n and tn concentrations of 4 3 7 5 and 16 7 mg l based on the stoichiometry of the complete sad reaction eq 3 oxidation of 1 mol n h 4 n resulted in the reduction of 1 06 mol of n o 2 n as a result the stoichiometric ratio of n o 2 n n h 4 n in most case of phase v was 1 12 fig 3c with pd and anammox activities of 0 045 and 0 38 kg m3d fig 3d respectively this indicates achievement of desirable cooperation between pd and anammox and sustained stably in the sad uasb over long term operation 3 3 biomass characteristics in the sad uasb 3 3 1 microbial community characteristics proteobacteria 61 9 bacteroidetes 16 2 actinobacteria 3 97 ignavibacteriae 3 4 and chloroflexi 2 39 were the main phyla in the pn sbr fig 4 a proteobacteria is a typical phylum related to nitrogen cycling and has been previously reported at high abundances in partial nitrification systems joicy et al 2019 wang et al 2019a multiple bacterial communities involved nitrification nitrosomonas 3 identified as the dominant aob played an important role in realizing stable partial nitrification process in the pn sbr nitrosomonas were found to be effective in treating various sewage such as municipal sewage industrial wastewater landfill leachate and synthetic wastewater du et al 2017a molinuevo et al 2009 zhang et al 2019a only small proportions of nitrospirae 0 61 nitrotoga 0 01 and nitrobacter 0 005 were detected demonstrating that nob were inhibited during long term operation in the ifd sbr the dominant members belonged to proteobacteria actinobacteria chloroflexi and firmicutes which were correlated with anaerobic fermentation representing up to 49 1 of the community fig 4a as documented in previous findings proteobacteria are involved in denitrification and simultaneously have the potential to solubilize organic particulates wang et al 2016a guggeheimella sp and propionibacteriaceae which are producers of short chain fermentation volatiles accounted for 1 3 and 0 8 respectively in the ifd sbr accelerating the organic matter contained in was releasing to the aqueous phase lin et al 2017 wyss et al 2005 anaerolineae has been shown to degrade complex carbohydrates and reduce nitrite thereby playing a significant role in integrated fermentation and deinitritation fig s3 three kinds of anammox bacteria were identified at the genus level in sad uasb namely candidatus kuenenia 0 08 candidatus jettenia 0 05 and candidatus brocadia 1 5 of the phylum planctomycetes 6 fig 4b moreover the denitrifying genus denitratisoma 1 7 was identified and possibly responsible for the denitrification pathway during nitrogen removal xu et al 2018 notably the populations of nitrosomonas and nitrospira were most possibility injected with the pn sbr and ifd sbr effluent and survived on residual oxygen of the influent which could partly explain the reason the n o 3 n n h 4 n ratio was higher than 0 26 during phase i in addition the genus thauera accounted for 4 3 of the microbial community fig 4b in agreement with recent literature demonstrating that a high percentage of thauera is commonly found in pd reactors cao et al 2019 du et al 2017a kalyuzhnyi and gladchenko 2009 throughout the operational cycle the sad uasb exhibited an increasing nre from 77 7 phase i to 97 6 phase v this illustrates that the stable n o 2 n substrate was produced by in situ partial denitrifiers providing sufficient electron acceptors for the anammox process coexistence of microorganisms related to anammox and partial denitrification were the main reason behind the excellent stability of the sad process for treating mature landfill leachate 3 3 2 sludge morphology characteristics the biomass characteristics of the sad uasb were monitored during the whole operation after inoculation more than 50 of the granules had a particle size exceeding 350 μm the toxicity of landfill leachate has an inhibitory impact on granulation and decreases microbial growth wang et al 2015 2019b approximately 46 3 of the granular sludge larger than 350 μm particle size still existed on day 100 fig 5 a indicating that the granules had an excellent capacity for treating mature landfill leachate with the increased c n ratio the distribution of granule diameters showed a slight polarization trend fig 5a which may be attributed to the growth of denitrifying bacteria cao et al 2019 increasing the mature landfill leachate proportion and c n caused the granules to change from brownish yellow to a darker color becoming covered by a layer of dark bacteria fig 5b previous studies assumed that heterotrophic denitrifiers prefer to attach on the surface of granules due to the accessibility of aqueous organic matter and sufficient mass transfer which then provides favorable growth conditions for the inner anammox bacteria chamchoi et al 2008 molinuevo et al 2009 zhang et al 2019c denitrification and anammox bacteria have different niches in the granular sludge the sem images showed the granular sludge surface aggregated various microorganisms with a cauliflower like shape and gave priority to spherical elliptical and bacilli bacteria fig s4 moreover reddish microbes aggregated as wall growth gradually and attached on reactor internal wall gradually microorganisms attached on the reactor wall were dense coccoid cells which were also recognized as anammox bacteria kuenen 2008 3 4 pd anammox and denitrification activity between granular and floc biomass to better understand the biomass activity between granular and floc sludge ex situ tests were conducted on day 280 nitrite gradually accumulated concomitant with nitrate reduction in the granular sludge pd activity test reaching the maximum level 21 6 mg l at 4 5 h fig 6 a which corresponds to a nitrate transformation rate ntr of 0 11 kg m3 d in the following period accumulated n o 2 n maintained a constant concentration until the end of the test this was in line with the long term sad uasb performance with an ntr of 0 032 0 049 kg m3 d but denitrification activity was low 0 002 0 011 kg m3 d in phase v concerning the floc sludge the pd performance was less efficient with an ntr of 0 047 kg m3 d and nitrite accumulation of 37 1 fig 6b results indicate that the granular sludge was primarily responsible for nitrate reduction in the sad uasb this was also well supported by the sludge morphology observation which showed a layer of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria covering the surface of the granular sludge fig 5b since the denitrifiers had sufficient substrate and mass transfer to achieve desirable cooperation with anammox bacteria the description of the mechanism model graphical abstract shows that an efficient pd process reliably provides n o 2 n for anammox which is considered as the most beneficial condition for achieving stable and efficient nitrogen removal performance focusing on the anammox activity a variety of nitrogen compounds were explored fig 6c and d n h 4 n served as an electron donor for n o 2 n removal via the anammox process in the granular sludge group the concentrations of ammonia and nitrite linearly decreased from 94 6 to 124 4 mg l to 0 59 and 0 58 mg l within 14 h respectively at the same time 34 0 mg l n o 3 n subsequently accumulated which was slightly higher than the theoretical value for nitrogen produced as n o 3 n during anammox 11 24 6 mg l for the floc sludge group ammonia and nitrite were reduced at a lower rate the ammonia and nitrite decreased by 58 4 and 83 5 mg l within 14 h anammox activities between the granular and floc sludge were 0 37 and 0 24 kg m3 d respectively which indicates that anammox bacteria were inclined to grow in the granular sludge rather than the floc environment previous studies investigated the substrate inhibition on anammox by haldane model de prá et al 2016 puyol et al 2013 zheng et al 2017 anammox activity decreased by 71 4 along with the increase of nitrite concentration from 50 to 150 mg l zheng et al 2017 obvious difference in kinetic coefficients was observed under various concentrations indicating that complete inhibition of the anammox activity with no2 concentration of 100 mg l strous et al 1998 while other studies have reported that anammox bacteria performed higher tolerance to n o 2 n with the values of 222 mg l tang et al 2011 the nitrite inhibitions on the anammox has been largely relieved in sad uasb since a higher mass transfer resistance performed by granular red colored bacteria dominated the interior of the granular sludge fig 5b and were confirmed as anammox bacteria granular sludge has a greater capacity to retain and immobilize anammox bacteria than floc sludge due to a more protective barrier that increases stress resistance kong et al 2018 liu et al 2017 denitrification activity was also examined in the granular and floc sludge the average nitrogen removal rates were 0 22 and 0 23 kg m3 d respectively and the removal efficiencies were 95 5 and 96 9 respectively within 12 h all above results collectively demonstrate that the pd process cooperated well with anammox for desirable nitrogen removal and that the autotrophic anammox prevailed over heterotrophic denitrification when n o 2 n was provided 3 5 feasible analyses in engineering implications the mass flow of nitrogen was determined to evaluate the three stage sad process for engineering implications as shown in fig 7 97 of the influent ammonia was oxidized to nitrite in the pn sbr with 3 nitrogen loss by simultaneous nitrogen and denitrification snd then 90 4 of the nitrogen compounds were stored in the middle tank i while 6 6 were stored in the middle tank ii an average of 34 6 g dry external sludge and middle tank i wastewater were introduced into the ifd sbr for simultaneous fermentation and denitrification the enhanced sludge consumption rate 2 5 kg m3 d improved the nitrogen removal efficiency 81 9 with 0 51 g n g ss of nitrogen removed per unit of dosing sludge recently a large amount of external sludge has been produced in wwtps i e in 2010 11 million tons of dry sludge generated in china ideally organic matter contained in was could be captured for denitrification in the proposed system additionally 6 25 n was released in the form of ammonia in the final of ifd sbr operational cycle in the sad uasb 83 1 of the influent nitrogen was removed through anammox and 4 6 nitrogen removal was achieved by denitrification as demonstrated in this study only 1 7 of the nitrogen residues were in the effluent and the nre was as high as 98 3 as such the proposed three stage sad process provides a feasible engineering solution for energy positive operations in wwtps see fig 8 3 6 economic and environmental analyses of the three stage sad the primary operational costs of wwtps include excess sludge disposal expenses external carbon addition and aeration energy consumption these aspects were thus used to evaluate the economic advantages of the three stage sad process compared with traditional nitrogen removal processes during traditional nitrification denitrification 0 86 g biomass is produced 2 86 g cod is required and 4 6 g o2 is needed to remove 1 g n h 4 n conversely in the three stage sad process 1 33 g biomass is reduced a 154 decrease no cod is consumed 100 savings and 3 43 g oxygen is required a 25 4 decrease illustrating that the three stage sad process is economically favorable in order to maintain a low growth rate of anammox microorganisms the sludge of the sad uasb is normally not discharged which would further increase external sludge reduction co2 is recognized as an undesirable by product of wwtps due to its greenhouse effect to remove 1 g n h 4 n more than 3 93 g co2 is produced during traditional nitrification denitrification but only 2 2 g co2 is produced during three stage sad thus the three stage sad system is environmentally favorable compared with the traditional nitrification denitrification process 4 conclusions the three stage sad process was first investigated for long term 280 days nitrogen removal from high load ammonia mature landfill leachate using external sludge as external organic matter during the stable period the whole system effluent tn of 16 7 mg l nre of 98 3 and ifd sbr sludge reduction rate of 2 5 kg m3 d were obtained with the influent cod n h 4 n and tn of 2039 217 mg l 1760 126 mg l and 2075 13 mg l respectively coexistence of anammox bacteria 1 5 candidatus brocadia and partial denitrifying bacteria 4 3 thauera was responsible for the stability of the anammox process with an 83 1 nitrogen removal contribution in the sad uasb three stage sad provides an advantageous environmental and economical approach with a 25 4 lower oxygen requirement 100 organic matter savings and 47 9 less external sludge production compared with traditional biological

18321,thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the formation of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids determined based on the quantum chemical qc simulations were compared in this study with the experimental data generated using the differential spectroscopy approach in chlorination and chloramination the ratios of the slopes of the correlations between dlna350 values and individual dbps concentrations snh2cl shocl were observed to be linearly correlated with the ratios of the gibbs free energies δgnh2cl δghocl of the corresponding reactions of chloramine and chlorine with acetaldehyde which was used as a model dbp precursor in qc simulations further qc examination of the kinetics of chlorination and chloramination of the model compound acetoacetic acid showed that the activation energy of reactions between monochloramine that directly participates in substitution reactions to form mono di and tri halogenated intermediates are 2 3 times higher than those of hocl formed via the hydrolysis monochloramine this result confirms that the interactions of chloramine with nom and ensuing dbp formation are primarily mediated by the free chlorine released as a result of the hydrolysis of monochloramine while direct halogenation of nom by monochloramine is likely to provide a small contribution to dbp formation graphical abstract image 1 keywords chloramination

chloramine as a secondary disinfectant because it suppresses the formation of trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas cowman and singer 1996 krasner et al 2013 kristiana et al 2009 lee and westerhoff 2009 yang et al 2008 the formation of mono and di haas decreases in chloramination less prominently than those of tri haas diehl et al 2000 hong et al 2007 the formation of potentially highly toxic nitrogenous and iodine containing dbps n and i dbps tends to increase in chloraminated water criquet et al 2012 gong and zhang 2013 goslan et al 2009 jones et al 2012 krasner et al 2006 shah et al 2011 prior studies have presented alternative hypotheses concerning the mechanisms of interactions of chlorine and chloramine with natural organic matter nom duirk 2003 duirk et al 2002 2005 hong et al 2007 cowman and singer 1996 suggested that dbp formation in chloramination results from reactions between nom and small amounts of hocl released via chloramine hydrolysis duirk et al 2005 suggested that the reactions of monochloramine with nom involve both a direct reaction of monochloramine with nom and a slower reaction of nom with free chlorine hocl formed via monochloramine hydrolysis further evidence to explore these hypotheses needs to be based on experimental methods whose sensitivity is adequate to probe potentially subtle changes of nom properties caused by its interactions with chloramine lee and westerhoff 2009 zhang et al 2018b absorbance spectroscopy has such sensitivity and it has been widely used to characterize nom changes in halogenation ates et al 2007 korshin et al 2002 li et al 2000 differential absorbance spectra of nom obtained in the presence of chloramine have been reported to have a characteristic feature located at ca 272 nm korshin et al 2002 while changes of the shape of the differential spectra of nom e g da272 differential log transformed absorbance at 350 nm dlna350 have been interpreted to indicate the engagement of dissimilar nom functionalities involved in the formation of dbps korshin et al 2007 yan et al 2014 recent study yan et al 2018 demonstrated that changes of the aromaticity of nom denoted δlnφ caused by chlorine or chloramine are correlated with the yields of thms haas and hans the correlations between δlnφ and concentrations of mono and di haas were also shown to have strong similarities for chlorinated and chloraminated waters while those for thms dhan or tri haas have distinct differences while these results quantify the engagement of nom chromophores in reactions with monochloramine mechanistic aspects of reactions that generate mono di and tri haas and thms in chlorination and chloramination remain to be elucidated in more detail yan et al 2018 quantum chemical qc modeling can be used for this purpose because it allows quantitating such important aspects of halogenation reactions such as their reaction barriers structures of potentially formed intermediates nature of reactive sites and others qc has been successfully used to reveal the mechanisms of br dbps formation sivey et al 2013 the competition of cl br i in halogen incorporation zhang et al 2018a mechanisms of dbp degradation by electrochemical reactions ma et al 2015 and uv h2o2 advanced oxidation processes chuang et al 2016 in this study we explored the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the formation of the representative individual dbps based on the qc simulations whose results were compared with the experimental data generated using the differential spectroscopy approach the combination of qc and spectroscopic data provides further microscopic level insight into the pathways of dbp generation in chlorination and chloramination 2 experiments and methods 2 1 experiments two source waters were used in this study one was from lake washington site a and the other was from the drinking water treatment plant located in the eastern us site b the experimental procedures of chlorination and chloramination were the same as those described in prior relevant publications yan et al 2018 for the water from site b chlorination and chloramination were carried out at varying reaction time for the water from site a in addition to investigate the effect of reaction time on the formation of individual dbps in chlorination and chloramination further experiments were carried to examine the effect of chlorine and chloramine doses and temperature specific details of the water quality parameters and experimental conditions were summarized in table s1 the absorbance spectra of the two source waters and their changes observed in chlorination experiments have significant differences as shown in fig s1 in all the above experiments aliquots were withdrawn from the bags and the residual chlorine was quenched as specified in standard method 5710 b the absorbance of the samples was measured with a perkinelmer lamba 18 instrument concentrations of thms including chcl3 chcl2br chclbr2 and chbr3 were analyzed using epa method 551 1 chlorinated and brominated haloacetic acids haas including mcaa mbaa dcaa tcaa bcaa dbaa dbcaa and tbaa were analyzed using epa method 552 2 processing of the absorbance spectra of chlorinated or chloraminated nom was done as described in prior literature yan et al 2013a 2013b 2014 the parameter dlna350 was used in this paper rather than δlnφ because log transformed absorbance spectra at wavelength ca 350 nm have been reported to be less affected by spectroscopic interferences while enabling a reliable monitoring of nom halogenation of nom and attendant dbp formation yan et al 2014 strong linear relationships between dlna350 values and concentrations of major groups of individual dbp species and the intercept of these correlations with the y axis was near zero for the examined water sources 2 2 methods of quantum chemical calculations all computations were carried out with gaussian 09 software guassian 09 the geometry optimizations and gibbs free energies calculation for the reactants products intermediates and transition states were performed using the b3lyp method and 6 31g basis set becke 1988 1993 petersson and al laham 1991 petersson et al 1988 determination of the transition state geometries was achieved using a transition state ts method all transition states were additionally analyzed by the intrinsic reaction coordinate irc approach the stationary character of the reactants products and intermediates was confirmed by the absence of imaginary vibration frequencies while the transition states were characterized by the presence of only one imaginary frequency in all calculations solvent effects were accounted for implicitly using the solvation model density smd continuum model and water as the solvent smd is considered a universal solvation model due to its applicability to any charged or uncharged solute in any solvent or liquid medium for which a few key descriptors are known marenich et al 2009 energy calculations were corrected for zero point vibrational energy and reduced to normal conditions 298 15 k 1 atm using thermal corrections to the free energy 3 results in accord with the approach presented in prior literature yan et al 2013b 2014 dlna350 values measured at varying reaction times were used to quantify the generation of individual dbp species selected correlations between dlna350 and yields of individual dbps in chlorination and chloramination for the water from site a and site b are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively given that dlna350 values reflect the engagement of nom chromophores by halogen species yan et al 2013b 2014 the slopes of individual dbp vs dlna350 correlations were concluded to be indicative of the formation potentials of the corresponding dbps figs 1 and 2 demonstrate that the behavior of individual dbps formed in chlorination and chloramination can be separated into two groups based on the values of the slopes of the correlations between the concentrations of individual dbp species and dlna350 values the first group comprises mono and di halogenated dbps including mcaa mbaa dcaa bcaa and bdaa and tribrominated dbps including chbr3 and tbaa these species have similar slopes of correlations between their concentrations measured in chlorination and chloramination experiments and corresponding dlna350 values the second group comprises the tri halogenated dbps including chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl tcaa and dbcaa except tribrominated dbps chbr3 and tbaa the yields of these species formed in chloramination tended to be much lower than those observed in the case of chlorination these results of individual dbps are consistent in generally with our previous publication for the trends of the yields of mono di and tri haas groups with δlnφ yan et al 2018 4 discussion 4 1 reaction thermodynamics given that the data discussed above show that the slopes of individual dbp vs dlna350 correlations reflect the formation potentials of the corresponding dbps we can hypothesize that there must be a relationship between the gibbs free energies of a reaction δg of the corresponding reactions and the slopes of these correlations to explore this point we used acetaldehyde as a dbp precursor model in chlorination and chloramination because it is extremely challenging to obtain reliable qc calculations for systems as complex as nom acetaldehyde was chosen as a suitable model compound march 2007 urhahn and ballschmiter 1998 the carbonyl group c o of acetaldehyde can undergo halogen substitution at the alpha carbon with the hydrogens at the alpha sites being sufficiently easily substituted by halogen atoms to form halogenated ketones whose base catalyzed hydrolysis is ultimately accompanied by the cleavage of the c c bond to yield a molecule of formic acid and a haloform alternatively the halogenated ketone can undergo oxidation to yield haloacetic acids alix et al 2012 acetaldehyde as a simple ketone is a good dbp precursor model because its properties could well reflect the formation potential of different individual dbps in chlorination and chloramination from thermodynamics view zhang et al 2018a the detailed chemical formulas and the δg values for the formation of each individual dbps from the acetaldehyde precursor are listed in table s2 in the supporting information si both the ratios of gibbs free energies δgnh2cl δghocl for each individual dbp species and the ratios of the slopes between individual dbps concentrations and dlna350 values snh2cl shocl in chloramination and chlorination for the water from site a and site b are listed in table 1 strong linear correlations between snh2cl shocl values and δgnh2cl δghocl values were found to exist for most individual dbps fig 3 with r2 values 0 96 and 0 92 for the water from site a and site b respectively all the ratios of δgnh2cl δghocl values for the dbps formation are smaller than 1 0 which means that the thermodynamic potentials that drive the formation of dbps are consistently lower in chloramination than in chlorination this result is consistent with prior studies hua and reckhow 2007 krasner et al 2006 richardson 2003 tian et al 2013 wu et al 2003 zhang et al 2015 given the strength of the correlation shown in fig 3 theoretically calculated δgnh2cl δghocl ratios can be used to predict the formation potentials of individual dbps other those examined in this study e g haloamides halofuranones and others in general lower δgnh2cl δghocl values are associated with the greater difference in the yields of individual dbps in chloramination and chlorination for example the δgnh2cl δghocl ratio values for tri halogenated forms are consistently lower than those for mono and di haas 0 15 and 0 17 respectively fig 3 b shows that the correlation between δgnh2cl δghocl and snh2cl shocl values for mbaa dbaa dbcaa and chbr2cl deviates from the general pattern we hypothesize that the gibbs free energies calculation for these dbps may ignore some chloramination specific reactions that occur in water from site b for instance the yields of these bromine containing dbps can be strongly affected by the cycling of bromide ions zhu and zhang 2016 that affects the generation of br containing dbps the issue of incorporating bromide cycling reactions in qc simulations of dbp formation is outside of the scope of this paper and it will be explored in detail elsewhere 4 2 reaction kinetics while the data presented above are useful for comparing the experimental data for the formation of individual dbps with the qc predictions of their thermodynamic properties detailed examination of nom chloramination pathways requires that the following questions be addressed in more detail 1 why the tri halogenated dbps are strongly suppressed while the formation of mono and di haas remains significantly in chloramination 2 does monochloramine interacts with dbps precursor directly or via its hydrolysis product s notably hocl activated aromatic sites especially masked aromatic β diketones and aliphatic β diketones produced as intermediates of aromatic halogenation are known to be important in the formation of thms and haas during chlorination boyce and hornig 1983 heasley et al 1989 1993 larson 2018a pan and zhang 2013 reckhow et al 1990 yang et al 2019 zhai and zhang 2011 the β diketone moiety whose generic formula is r co ch2 co r was proposed as a precursor in a simplified conceptual model of the formation of the major organic halide products from chlorination of fulvic acid reckhow and singer 1985 hua et al hua 2006 hua and reckhow 2008 further developed this point in the context of both chlorination and chloramination of nom based on these models that have been used to interpret the chloramination of nom fractions hua 2006 hua and reckhow 2008 reckhow and singer 1985 yang et al 2008 and the known mechanisms of the haloform reaction with methyl ketones morris and baum 1978 acetoacetic acid hooc ch2co ch3 was selected as a suitable model for haas and thms formation in chloramination and chlorination acetoacetic acid was used in the qc modeling of the kinetic aspects of thm haa formation because compared with acetaldehyde acetoacetic acid has a more diverse set of reactive sites whose halogenation may yield all haas and thms relevant to this study the sequence of dbp generation reactions involving the acetoacetic acid model is shown in fig 4 it shows that the alpha carbon in acetoacetic acid coohch2coch3 can be halogenated to incorporate chlorine atoms at least hypothetically directly from monochloramine or hypochlorous acid formed via the hydrolysis of monochloramine to form a mono chlorinated product coohchclcoch3 which can hydrolyze to form mcaa ch2clcooh or it can be halogenated further to form coohccl2coch3 in turn coohccl2coch3 can hydrolyze to form dcaa chcl2cooh or undergo decarboxylation to form 1 1 dichloropropanone chcl2 co ch3 prior research march 1985 shows that if the carboxyl group is linked with a more nucleophilic group this compound tends to undergo decarboxylation reaction more easily therefore decarboxylation of coohccl2coch3 is much more likely than that of coohchclcoch3 and thus the decarboxylation of coohchclcoch3 is not considered in this model the molecules of 1 1 dichloropropanone chcl2 co ch3 can incorporate one more chlorine atom from hypothetically either monochloramine or hypochlorous acid to form 1 1 1 trichloropropanone ccl3 co ch3 which is known to

directly participates in substitution reactions to form mono di and tri halogenated intermediates are about 2 3 times higher than those of hocl formed via the hydrolysis monochloramine prior research has resulted in a general rule of thumb that reactions with dft determined energy barriers of 0 9 ev 21 kcal mol 1 or less proceed readily at room temperature wang et al 2017 young 2001 while reactions with activation energies 30 kcal mol 1 are too slow to proceed even at elevated temperatures rodríguez et al 2015 the calculated activation energies of the direct reactions of monochloramine with the model precursor are only slightly below the nominal threshold of 30 kcal mol 1 this indicates that while direct reactions between monochloramine and dbp precursors are possible they are likely to be much slower kinetically than those for hocl it is noteworthy that the activation energy of the direct reaction that engages monochloramine to form tri halogenated intermediates 29 76 kcal mol 1 are higher than the activation energies of direct reactions of monochloramine to form mono and di halogenated intermediates from the same precursor 28 91 and 24 05 kcal mol 1 thus the formation of the tri halogenated intermediates via the direct engagement is scarcely possible other researchers have also postulated that steric factors are likely to hinder the ability of inorganic chloramines to add a third halogen to a carbon center reckhow 2005 to form tri halogenated intermediates thus the combination of high activation energies and steric hindrance is likely to result in a low rate of the formation of tri halogenated intermediates generated via the direct engagement of monochloramine this result also indicates that dbps formation in chloramination is much more likely to proceed primarily via the engagement of hocl formed via the hydrolysis of chloramine prior research has shown that free chlorine can be formed in chloramination due to the hydrolysis of monochloramine this rate constant of this reaction that yields hocl and nh3 is much slower than the typical rate constant of reactions between hocl and nom at fast reaction sites nomfast or slow reaction sites nomslow with the relevant rate constants being 3 10 5 sec 1 and ca 41 mol 1sec 1 nomfast or 0 95 mol 1sec 1 nomslow respectively zhang et al 2000 zhu and zhang 2016 according to the steady state approximation the concentration of intermediate hocl keeps in trace level because it is formed slowly and consumed readily by nom in chloramination the concentration of nom reactive sites mono and di halogenated intermediates are likely to be much higher than the trace levels of hocl formed via the hydrolysis of monochloramine thus the limited supply of hocl that is consumed rapidly in reactions with nom itself and mono and di halogenated intermediates may limit the availability of hocl in the formation of tri halogenated intermediates thus largely precluding the formation of tcaa and chcl3 to examine this point further we derived expressions for the ratios of yields of mcaa dcaa tcaa and chcl3 in chlorination and chloramination based on the model of haas and thms formation shown in fig 4 the

chloramination and chlorination while it is markedly lower slopes for individual trihalogenated dbps formed in chloramination than those in chlorination the detailed derivation presented in the si section demonstrates that the influence of direct reaction of monochloramine on dbps formation can be largely ignored due to the low kinetic rate constants of such reactions thus it follows from expressions 1 4 that the difference in yields of mcaa dcaa tcaa and chcl3 in chlorination and chloramination is mainly caused by the low concentration of free chlorine present during chloramination and the pronounced activation energy barrier characteristic for direct chloramination 5 conclusions the main conclusions drawn are as following 1 the individual dbps formation by chlorine and chloramine could be consistently quantified by the changes of the absorbance of nom quantified in this study using differential log transformed absorbance at 350 nm dlna350 correlations between spectral parameters and concentrations of individual dbp species tended to be strongly linear while in the cases of chlorination and chloramination individual dbp species have dissimilar slopes which

highly toxic nitrogenous and iodine containing dbps n and i dbps tends to increase in chloraminated water criquet et al 2012 gong and zhang 2013 goslan et al 2009 jones et al 2012 krasner et al 2006 shah et al 2011 prior studies have presented alternative hypotheses concerning the mechanisms of interactions of chlorine and chloramine with natural organic matter nom duirk 2003 duirk et al 2002 2005 hong et al 2007 cowman and singer 1996 suggested that dbp formation in chloramination results from reactions between nom and small amounts of hocl released via chloramine hydrolysis duirk et al 2005 suggested that the reactions of monochloramine with nom involve both a direct reaction of monochloramine with nom and a slower reaction of nom with free chlorine hocl formed via monochloramine hydrolysis further evidence to explore these hypotheses needs to be based on experimental methods whose sensitivity is adequate to probe potentially subtle changes of nom properties caused by its interactions with chloramine lee and westerhoff 2009 zhang et al 2018b absorbance spectroscopy has such sensitivity and it has been widely used to characterize nom changes in halogenation ates et al 2007 korshin et al 2002 li et al 2000 differential absorbance spectra of nom obtained in the presence of chloramine have been reported to have a characteristic feature located at ca 272 nm korshin et al 2002 while changes of the shape of the differential spectra of nom e g da272 differential log transformed absorbance at 350 nm dlna350 have been interpreted to indicate the engagement of dissimilar nom functionalities involved in the formation of dbps korshin et al 2007 yan et al 2014 recent study yan et al 2018 demonstrated that changes of the aromaticity of nom denoted δlnφ caused by chlorine or chloramine are correlated with the yields of thms haas and hans the correlations between δlnφ and concentrations of mono and di haas were also shown to have strong similarities for chlorinated and chloraminated waters while those for thms dhan or tri haas have distinct differences while these results quantify the engagement of nom chromophores in reactions with monochloramine mechanistic aspects of reactions that generate mono di and tri haas and thms in chlorination and chloramination remain to be elucidated in more detail yan et al 2018 quantum chemical qc modeling can be used for this purpose because it allows quantitating such important aspects of halogenation reactions such as their reaction barriers structures of potentially formed intermediates nature of reactive sites and others qc has been successfully used to reveal the mechanisms of br dbps formation sivey et al 2013 the competition of cl br i in halogen incorporation zhang et al 2018a mechanisms of dbp degradation by electrochemical reactions ma et al 2015 and uv h2o2 advanced oxidation processes chuang et al 2016 in this study we explored the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the formation of the representative individual dbps based on the qc simulations whose results were compared with the experimental data generated using the differential spectroscopy approach the combination of qc and spectroscopic data provides further microscopic level insight into the pathways of dbp generation in chlorination and chloramination 2 experiments and methods 2 1 experiments two source waters were used in this study one was from lake washington site a and the other was from the drinking water treatment plant located in the eastern us site b the experimental procedures of chlorination and chloramination were the same as those described in prior relevant publications yan et al 2018 for the water from site b chlorination and chloramination were carried out at varying reaction time for the water from site a in addition to investigate the effect of reaction time on the formation of individual dbps in chlorination and chloramination further experiments were carried to examine the effect of chlorine and chloramine doses and temperature specific details of the water quality parameters and experimental conditions were summarized in table s1 the absorbance spectra of the two source waters and their changes observed in chlorination experiments have significant differences as shown in fig s1 in all the above experiments aliquots were withdrawn from the bags and the residual chlorine was quenched as specified in standard method 5710 b the absorbance of the samples was measured with a perkinelmer lamba 18 instrument concentrations of thms including chcl3 chcl2br chclbr2 and chbr3 were analyzed using epa method 551 1 chlorinated and brominated haloacetic acids haas including mcaa mbaa dcaa tcaa bcaa dbaa dbcaa and tbaa were analyzed using epa method 552 2 processing of the absorbance spectra of chlorinated or chloraminated nom was done as described in prior literature yan et al 2013a 2013b 2014 the parameter dlna350 was used in this paper rather than δlnφ because log transformed absorbance spectra at wavelength ca 350 nm have been reported to be less affected by spectroscopic interferences while enabling a reliable monitoring of nom halogenation of nom and attendant dbp formation yan et al 2014 strong linear relationships between dlna350 values and concentrations of major groups of individual dbp species and the intercept of these correlations with the y axis was near zero for the examined water sources 2 2 methods of quantum chemical calculations all computations were carried out with gaussian 09 software guassian 09 the geometry optimizations and gibbs free energies calculation for the reactants products intermediates and transition states were performed using the b3lyp method and 6 31g basis set becke 1988 1993 petersson and al laham 1991 petersson et al 1988 determination of the transition state geometries was achieved using a transition state ts method all transition states were additionally analyzed by the intrinsic reaction coordinate irc approach the stationary character of the reactants products and intermediates was confirmed by the absence of imaginary vibration frequencies while the transition states were characterized by the presence of only one imaginary frequency in all calculations solvent effects were accounted for implicitly using the solvation model density smd continuum model and water as the solvent smd is considered a universal solvation model due to its applicability to any charged or uncharged solute in any solvent or liquid medium for which a few key descriptors are known marenich et al 2009 energy calculations were corrected for zero point vibrational energy and reduced to normal conditions 298 15 k 1 atm using thermal corrections to the free energy 3 results in accord with the approach presented in prior literature yan et al 2013b 2014 dlna350 values measured at varying reaction times were used to quantify the generation of individual dbp species selected correlations between dlna350 and yields of individual dbps in chlorination and chloramination for the water from site a and site b are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively given that dlna350 values reflect the engagement of nom chromophores by halogen species yan et al 2013b 2014 the slopes of individual dbp vs dlna350 correlations were concluded to be indicative of the formation potentials of the corresponding dbps figs 1 and 2 demonstrate that the behavior of individual dbps formed in chlorination and chloramination can be separated into two groups based on the values of the slopes of the correlations between the concentrations of individual dbp species and dlna350 values the first group comprises mono and di halogenated dbps including mcaa mbaa dcaa bcaa and bdaa and tribrominated dbps including chbr3 and tbaa these species have similar slopes of correlations between their concentrations measured in chlorination and chloramination experiments and corresponding dlna350 values the second group comprises the tri halogenated dbps including chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl tcaa and dbcaa except tribrominated dbps chbr3 and tbaa the yields of these species formed in chloramination tended to be much lower than those observed in the case of chlorination these results of individual dbps are consistent in generally with our previous publication for the trends of the yields of mono di and tri haas groups with δlnφ yan et al 2018 4 discussion 4 1 reaction thermodynamics given that the data discussed above show that the slopes of individual dbp vs dlna350 correlations reflect the formation potentials of the corresponding dbps we can hypothesize that there must be a relationship between the gibbs free energies of a reaction δg of the corresponding reactions and the slopes of these correlations to explore this point we used acetaldehyde as a dbp precursor model in chlorination and chloramination because it is extremely challenging to obtain reliable qc calculations for systems as complex as nom acetaldehyde was chosen as a suitable model compound march 2007 urhahn and ballschmiter 1998 the carbonyl group c o of acetaldehyde can undergo halogen substitution at the alpha carbon with the hydrogens at the alpha sites being sufficiently easily substituted by halogen atoms to form halogenated ketones whose base catalyzed hydrolysis is ultimately accompanied by the cleavage of the c c bond to yield a molecule of formic acid and a haloform alternatively the halogenated ketone can undergo oxidation to yield haloacetic acids alix et al 2012 acetaldehyde as a simple ketone is a good dbp precursor model because its properties could well reflect the formation potential of different individual dbps in chlorination and chloramination from thermodynamics view zhang et al 2018a the detailed chemical formulas and the δg values for the formation of each individual dbps from the acetaldehyde precursor are listed in table s2 in the supporting information si both the ratios of gibbs free energies δgnh2cl δghocl for each individual dbp species and the ratios of the slopes between individual dbps concentrations and dlna350 values snh2cl shocl in chloramination and chlorination for the water from site a and site b are listed in table 1 strong linear correlations between snh2cl shocl values and δgnh2cl δghocl values were found to exist for most individual dbps fig 3 with r2 values 0 96 and 0 92 for the water from site a and site b respectively all the ratios of δgnh2cl δghocl values for the dbps formation are smaller than 1 0 which means that the thermodynamic potentials that drive the formation of dbps are consistently lower in chloramination than in chlorination this result is consistent with prior studies hua and reckhow 2007 krasner et al 2006 richardson 2003 tian et al 2013 wu et al 2003 zhang et al 2015 given the strength of the correlation shown in fig 3 theoretically calculated δgnh2cl δghocl ratios can be used to predict the formation potentials of individual dbps other those examined in this study e g haloamides halofuranones and others in general lower δgnh2cl δghocl values are associated with the greater difference in the yields of individual dbps in chloramination and chlorination for example the δgnh2cl δghocl ratio values for tri halogenated forms are consistently lower than those for mono and di haas 0 15 and 0 17 respectively fig 3 b shows that the correlation between δgnh2cl δghocl and snh2cl shocl values for mbaa dbaa dbcaa and chbr2cl deviates from the general pattern we hypothesize that the gibbs free energies calculation for these dbps may ignore some chloramination specific reactions that occur in water from site b for instance the yields of these bromine containing dbps can be strongly affected by the cycling of bromide ions zhu and zhang 2016 that affects the generation of br containing dbps the issue of incorporating bromide cycling reactions in qc simulations of dbp formation is outside of the scope of this paper and it will be explored in detail elsewhere 4 2 reaction kinetics while the data presented above are useful for comparing the experimental data for the formation of individual dbps with the qc predictions of their thermodynamic properties detailed examination of nom chloramination pathways requires that the following questions be addressed in more detail 1 why the tri halogenated dbps are strongly suppressed while the formation of mono and di haas remains significantly in chloramination 2 does monochloramine interacts with dbps precursor directly or via its hydrolysis product s notably hocl activated aromatic sites especially masked aromatic β diketones and aliphatic β diketones produced as intermediates of aromatic halogenation are known to be important in the formation of thms and haas during chlorination boyce and hornig 1983 heasley et al 1989 1993 larson 2018a pan and zhang 2013 reckhow et al 1990 yang et al 2019 zhai and zhang 2011 the β diketone moiety whose generic formula is r co ch2 co r was proposed as a precursor in a simplified conceptual model of the formation of the major organic halide products from chlorination of fulvic acid reckhow and singer 1985 hua et al hua 2006 hua and reckhow 2008 further developed this point in the context of both chlorination and chloramination of nom based on these models that have been used to interpret the chloramination of nom fractions hua 2006 hua and reckhow 2008 reckhow and singer 1985 yang et al 2008 and the known mechanisms of the haloform reaction with methyl ketones morris and baum 1978 acetoacetic acid hooc ch2co ch3 was selected as a suitable model for haas and thms formation in chloramination and chlorination acetoacetic acid was used in the qc modeling of the kinetic aspects of thm haa formation because compared with acetaldehyde acetoacetic acid has a more diverse set of reactive sites whose halogenation may yield all haas and thms relevant to this study the sequence of dbp generation reactions involving the acetoacetic acid model is shown in fig 4 it shows that the alpha carbon in acetoacetic acid coohch2coch3 can be halogenated to incorporate chlorine atoms at least hypothetically directly from monochloramine or hypochlorous acid formed via the hydrolysis of monochloramine to form a mono chlorinated product coohchclcoch3 which can hydrolyze to form mcaa ch2clcooh or it can be halogenated further to form coohccl2coch3 in turn coohccl2coch3 can hydrolyze to form dcaa chcl2cooh or undergo decarboxylation to form 1 1 dichloropropanone chcl2 co ch3 prior research march 1985 shows that if the carboxyl group is linked with a more nucleophilic group this compound tends to undergo decarboxylation reaction more easily therefore decarboxylation of coohccl2coch3 is much more likely than that of coohchclcoch3 and thus the decarboxylation of coohchclcoch3 is not considered in this model the molecules of 1 1 dichloropropanone chcl2 co ch3 can incorporate one more chlorine atom from hypothetically either monochloramine or hypochlorous acid to form 1 1 1 trichloropropanone ccl3 co ch3 which is known to readily undergo hydrolysis to form chloroform or tcaa chcl3cooh larson 2018b smith and march 2007 morris and baum 1978 in fig 4 k 1 k 2 and k 3 are the kinetic rate constants of the halogenation

the concentration of intermediate hocl keeps in trace level because it is formed slowly and consumed readily by nom in chloramination the concentration of nom reactive sites mono and di halogenated

this point further we derived expressions for the ratios of yields of mcaa dcaa tcaa and chcl3 in chlorination and chloramination based on the model of haas and thms formation shown in fig 4 the

18322,elemental sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification sadn is a cost effective approach for treating secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps additional organics are generally supplemented to promote total nitrogen tn removal reduce nitrite accumulation and sulfate production and balance the ph decrease induced by sadn however understanding of the impacts of organic supplementation on microbial communities nitrogen metabolism denitrifier activity and sadn rates in sulfur based denitrification reactors is still limited here a sulfur based denitrification reactor was continuously operated for 272 days during which six different c n ratios were tested successively 2 7 1 5 0 7 0 5 0 25 and 0 organic supplementation improved tn removal and decreased no2 accumulation but reduced the relative abundance of denitrifiers and the contribution of autotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria anrb to tn removal during the long term operation of reactor predictive functional profiling showed that nitrogen metabolism potential increased with decreasing c n ratios sadn was the predominant removal process when the c n ratio was 0 7 achieving 60 contribution when c n 0 7 although organic supplementation weakened the dominant role of anrb in denitrification batch tests for the first time demonstrated that it could accelerate the sadn rate attributed to the improvement of sulfur bioavailability likely via the formation of polysulfide a possible nitrogen removal pathway with multiple electron donors i e sulfur organics sulfide and polysulfide in a sulfur based denitrification reactor with organic supplementation was therefore proposed however supplementation with a high level of organics could increase the operational cost and effluent concentrations of sulfide and organics as well as enrich heterotrophic denitrifiers moreover microbial community had substantial changes at c n ratios of 0 5 accordingly an optimal c n ratio of 0 25 0 5 was suggested which could simultaneously minimize the additional operating cost associated with organic supplementation and maximize tn removal and sadn rates graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfur based autotrophic denitrification sadn heterotrophic denitrification polysulfide denitrifying bacteria nitrogen removal pathway 1 introduction elemental sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification sadn is an economical and energy efficient approach for treating secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps due to low sludge production and operational cost equation 1 sahinkaya et al 2012 however the extremely low water solubility of elemental sulfur 5 μg l at 25 c limits its bioavailability making denitrification and denitritation rates lower than those obtained with more soluble electron donors park and yoo 2009 di capua et al 2017 during sadn nitrite no2 typically accumulates to high concentration levels limiting the overall nitrogen removal efficiency sahinkaya et al 2015 kostrytsia et al 2018 to alleviate these drawbacks in sadn systems supplementation with organics can reduce no2 accumulation and improve total nitrogen tn removal rates by introducing heterotrophic denitrification hd to achieve mixotrophic denitrification sahinkaya and kilic 2014 zhang et al 2015 the involvement of hd can also reduce sulfate production and balance the ph decrease induced by sadn via alkalinity production equation 2 li et al 2016 1 s 0 0 91 n o 3 0 69 h 2 o 0 07 n h 4 0 36 c o 2 0 07 c 5 h 7 o 2 n s o 4 2 0 45 n 2 1 16 h 2 c h 3 c o o 1 18 n o 3 2 18 h 0 12 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 1 4 c o 2 2 5 h 2 o 0 53 n 2 although some studies have shown the feasibility of reducing sulfate production and alkalinity consumption via simultaneous hd and sadn in a single reactor for treating nitrate contaminated water liu et al 2009 sahinkaya et al 2011 sahinkaya and kilic 2014 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2016 liang et al 2018 little attention has been paid to the effects of organic carbon supplementation on sadn systems on the one hand heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria hnrb grow rapidly and thus may outcompete autotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria anrb to become the dominant functional bacteria in sadn systems if so this may lead to a decline in sadn efficiency and ultimately failure of the system previous studies observed that the supplementation of sadn systems with soluble or solid carbon substrates significantly alters microbial community characteristics zhang et al 2015 li et al 2016 however with different organic dosages microbial communities nitrogen metabolism and nrb activity are also expected to differ yet these effects have not yet been well studied on the other hand in addition to heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria hnrb the growth and activities of other heterotrophic communities such as fermentative bacteria and sulfidogenic bacteria etc can consume a certain amount of organics this means that the amount of organic carbon added to sadn systems should be greater than hd demand in order to achieve efficient nitrogen removal as such the actual cost of organic supplementation would be much higher than the theoretical cost according to the stoichiometry of hd equation 2 however overdosing organics could easily lead to an increase of chemical oxidation demand cod concentration in effluent which can result in severe secondary pollution accordingly an appropriate supplementation of organics is deemed necessary to maximize nitrogen removal and minimize the operational cost simultaneously which has not been fully understood yet as stated above elemental sulfur could have a low bioaccessibility to microorganisms due to its low water solubility however the added organics can serve as electron donors and favor the biological reduction of sulfur to sulfide qiu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b the formed sulfide could directly be used as electron donors for denitrification process chen et al 2009 the biogenic sulfide could also chemically react with sulfur to generate polysulfide equation 3 zhang et al 2018b because of dissolved zero valent sulfur the presence of polysulfide could significantly improve biological sulfur reduction and oxidation rates zhang et al 2018b wang et al 2019 to our knowledge it still remains unknown whether the biogenic sulfide could facilitate the sadn process by the involvement of polysulfide 3 h s n 1 8 s 8 s n 2 h to address these knowledge gaps a laboratory scale sulfur based sequencing batch reactor sbr was continuously operated for 272 days during which the sbr was supplemented with organic substrates at different dosages to achieve different ratios of organic carbon to nitrate c n ratio using this set up we aimed to a investigate the effects of different c n ratios on total nitrogen tn removal no2 accumulation and the contribution of sadn to denitrification to determine an optimal c n ratio b analyze the effects of organic supplementation on sadn rate and the nitrate removal pathway c elucidate the microbial competition between anrb and hnrb and nitrogen metabolism in a sadn reactor receiving organic supplementation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation a laboratory scale sbr with an effective volume of 2 4 l 100 mm diameter x 300 mm effective height was fabricated using acrylic fig 1 the outlet was set at 10 cm from the base indicating a volume exchange ratio of 0 67 the sbr was seeded with 7 5 g of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss l of activated sludge which was taken from a sulfur reducing bioreactor that had been continuously operated for more than one year in our lab qiu et al 2017 the sbr was fed with synthetic wastewater and sodium nitrate solution v v 1 1 the synthetic wastewater was prepared as per jiang et al 2013 and zhang et al 2018d sublimed sulfur fine particles 20 40 μm in diameter were dosed via the top opening of reactor according to the daily sulfur consumption 800 mg l of sodium bicarbonate nahco3 was added as a buffer solution the sbr was placed in a chamber equipped with a regulating thermostat 25 2 c the sbr was continuously operated for 272 days divided into six phases phase i to phase vi table 1 the c n weight ratio hereafter referred to as c n ratio was gradually decreased from 2 7 mg c mg n in phase i to 0 mg c mg n in phase vi by increasing the influent nitrate concentration and decreasing the influent toc concentration the detailed information about the organic and nitrate concentrations in each phase is presented in table 1 from phase i to phase vi the cycle time of the sbr operation was gradually decreased from 6 h to 2 h corresponding with a decrease in the hydraulic retention time hrt from 9 h to 3 h table 1 the timing of the filling reaction settling and decanting phases during each time cycle is presented in table s1 water samples were periodically collected during the entire operational period to measure the concentrations of toc dissolved sulfide sulfate thiosulfate nitrate and nitrite the ph of the influent and effluent and the oxidation reduction potential orp and water temperature in the sbr were also measured 2 2 effect of c n ratios on nitrate removal nitrite accumulation and sadn at the end of the experiment five tests were successively performed in the sbr to study the effects of different c n ratios 0 0 25 0 5 0 7 and 1 5 on tn removal no2 accumulation and sadn rates after conducting the pre tests before performing these tests the sbr was disconnected from the influent and effluent pumps an initial nitrate concentration of 40 mg n l was obtained by spiking a concentrated sodium nitrate solution according to the tested c n ratios five different initial toc concentrations 0 10 20 28 and 60 mg l were obtained by adding different volumes of stock synthetic wastewater in each case approximately 400 mg l of sodium bicarbonate were also added the tests were conducted at approximately 25 c for 180 min during which water samples were collected at 0 min 15 min 30 min 45 min 60 min 90 min 120 min and 180 min through the top opening using a 5 ml syringe toc nitrate nitrite sulfide sulfate and thiosulfate concentrations in the water samples were quantified in triplicate the ph in the sbr was also measured at each sampling time when one batch test was performed the sbr was re connected with the influent and effluent pumps and was allowed to stabilize for at least three full cycles after which the denitrifying activity recovered to the normal level in phase vi data not shown as such the denitrifying activity was assumed to be similar at the beginning of all the batch tests the operational parameters during the recovery period were as same as those used in phase vi 2 3 effects of sulfide on nitrate removal nitrite accumulation and sadn during the long term operation of the sbr sulfide was detected in the effluent see section 3 1 indicating that sulfidogenic activity in the reactor may keep active previous studies have also reported that sulfidogenic activity was not suppressed in sewers receiving nitrate dosage mohanakrishnan et al 2009 liu et al 2015b thus in addition to enhancing hd organic presence may indirectly improve nitrate removal sadn rates and reduce no2 accumulation via the production of sulfide to investigate the impact of sulfide a batch test with sulfide initially was conducted in triplicate with the enriched denitrifying sludge collected from the sbr at the end of the long term experiment the sludge was washed with deoxygenated deionized water three times and then evenly distributed into six 500 ml serum bottles the sludge concentration in each bottle was measured as 0 90 g mlvss l 25 mg n l of nitrate and 1 g l of sublimated sulfur were then added to the bottles along with 10 mg s l of sulfide the bottles were purged with nitrogen gas and then sealed with rubber stoppers to maintain anaerobic conditions a control test without sulfide initially was also performed in triplicate the initial ph was controlled at 7 50 0 05 by adding hcl naoh solution the tests were conducted at approximately 25 c for 450 min during which water samples were collected using a 5 ml syringe at 0 min 30 min 60 min 90 min 180 min 320 min and 450 min via a sampling port on the rubber stopper fitted with a hose toc nitrate nitrite sulfide sulfate and thiosulfate concentrations in these water samples were then measured a ph probe was fitted to each bottle to measure ph variations over time 2 4 chemical analysis concentrations of toc sulfide sulfate thiosulfate nitrate and nitrite in water samples were determined after filtration millipore 0 45 μm the toc was analyzed using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc 5000a h2s hs and s2 were summarized as total dissolved sulfides and the total dissolved sulfide concentration was determined using the methylene blue method apha 2005 liang et al 2019 the concentrations of sulfate thiosulfate nitrate and nitrite in the sbr and the batch tests were analyzed with an ion chromatograph dionex 900 ics 900 ca usa the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mlvss were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 temperature ph and orp were measured using portable meters multi parameter meter hq40d hach elemental sulfur in sludge samples was extracted based on the method as per mcguire and hamers 2000 and was measured using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc shimadzu lc 16 japan equipped with a kromasil column c18 5 μm 100 å and a uv detector at 254 nm the method of polysulfide measurement in water samples as per kleinjan et al 2005 2 5 sludge sampling dna extraction pcr amplification illumina miseq sequencing and bioinformatics analysis the sludge samples in triplicates were collected during the different phases of the sbr operation on day 45 77 104 196 223 and 272 to characterize the microbial community structures using illumina miseq sequencing the total genomic dna was extracted from the sludge samples using the mobio power soil dna isolation kit mp biomedicals carlsbad ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions the extracted dna was then subjected to illumina miseq sequencing for microbial community analysis 16s rrna was amplified using the 515f 806r primer pair to target the hypervariable v4 regions of both the bacteria and archaea domains the illumina miseq sequencing service illumina inc san diego ca was provided by meige bio tech inc guangzhou china the obtained paired end raw 16s rrna gene sequences were assembled and filtered in mothur kozich et al 2013 the aligned sequences were checked for chimera using usearch 6 1 in qiime and classified into operational taxonomic units otus within a 3 dissimilarity applying the de novo otu picking workflow in qiime caporaso et al 2010 to determine the beta diversity of the bacterial communities principal coordinates analysis pcoa was performed based on the weighted unifrac distance matrix in qiime lozupone et al 2011 analysis of similarities anosim with bray curtis distance was employed using the r package vegan to assess the statistical differences p 0 05 among the sludge samples in the pcoa plot where the r value typically ranges from 0 no discrimination to 1 perfect discrimination heatmap analysis was also conducted using the r package heatmap phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust analysis was performed to predict the metabolic functions of the microbial community in the sbr during the different phases using the galaxy platform against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome kegg orthology database langille et al 2013 the abundances of predicted functional genes kegg ortholog ko at l1 l2 and l3 levels were calculated the genes related to biological nitrogen cycling were further visualized using heatmap 3 results 3 1 sbr performance the sbr achieved efficient nitrate removal during the long term period fig 2 a in phase i day 0 45 the influent c n ratio was 2 7 and an average of 91 7 of the influent nitrate was removed with an initial concentration of 15 1 mg n l and a hrt of 9 h fig 2a and table 1 meanwhile 62 3 of the influent toc 40 8 mg l were oxidized fig 2b from phase ii day 46 77 to phase vi day 227 272 the influent nitrate concentration increased to between 27 8 and 45 0 mg n l the influent toc concentration was gradually reduced from 57 7 mg l to 0 mg l resulting in a stepwise decrease in c n ratios from 1 5 to 0 table 1 the hrt was also progressively decreased from 9 h in phase ii to 3 h in phase vi although the operational conditions were varied considerably i e both the c n ratio and hrt nitrate was almost completely removed during the five phases fig 2a note that almost no nitrite was observed in the effluent during the entire operational period fig 2a with respect to the toc approximately 50 of the influent toc were consumed in phase ii iii and iv table 1 and fig 2b when the influent toc concentration was further decreased to 10 8 mg l in phase v c n 0 25 toc was still not completely oxidized table s2 with an average of 78 8 being consumed sulfide was also detected in the sbr effluent throughout the entire operational period in which the effluent sulfide concentration decreased with decreasing c n ratios and hrts fig 2c in addition as sadn consumes alkalinity equation 1 zhang et al 2015 the effluent ph was lower than that in the influent fig s1 sulfate was generated in the sadn process with sulfur being used as the electron donors equation 1 when the c n ratio was gradually decreased from 2 7 phase i to 0 phase vi the net sulfate production increased from 5 5 to 100 0 mg s l fig 2c according to the net sulfate production and removed tn in each phase as well as the stoichiometry ratio of sulfur to nitrate shown in equation 1 the contributions of sadn to tn removal were calculated fig 2d without organic supplementation c n 0 the contribution of sadn to tn removal was 90 on average suggesting that hd and assimilatory nitrate reduction could occur in the last phase of sbr operation this may be due to the fact that soluble microbial products and cell lysis products could provide some organic matter for hd koenig et al 2005 sheng et al 2010 denitrification with endogenous carbon sources as the electron donors have often been reported in previous studies qin et al 2005 ji et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 this value 90 was further used as a baseline to assess the contribution of organic supplementation to tn removal when different c n ratios were employed the results show that with a c n ratio of 0 25 and 0 5 hd only contributed approximately 11 14 to the overall tn removal this contribution increased with elevating c n ratios reaching 46 with a c n ratio of 1 5 the present result shows that most of the influent nitrate was removed via the sadn pathway in the last four phases indicating that sadn predominated in the sulfur based denitrification reactor when c n ratios were lower than or equal to 0 7 3 2 effect of different c n ratios on nitrate removal nitrite accumulation and sadn the tn removal rate increased with elevating c n ratios and plateaued at a c n ratio of 0 5 fig 3 in which the tn removal rate at c n ratio of 0 5 was three times greater than that in the absence of organic supplementation 52 1 mg n l h vs 17 5 mg n l h to compare no2 accumulation in the batch tests with different c n ratios no2 profiles at 90 min were used as this was the first time point when nitrate in all batch tests was depleted as shown in fig 3a no2 accumulation during the nitrate removal was gradually decreased from 46 mg n l in the absence of organics to an undetectable level with a c n ratio of 0 5 indicating that denitritation rate was faster with organics rather than sulfur as the electron donors however with a c n ratio of 0 5 or more no additional increase in tn removal rate was observed and nitrate and nitrite were completely depleted after 60 min these results suggest that c n ratio is a decisive factor of maximizing tn removal rate and minimizing no2 accumulation and operational cost in sadn systems with organic supplementation interestingly the sulfate production rate increased with elevating c n ratios fig 3c correspondingly the sadn rates increased from 17 3 mg n l h in the absence of additional organic to 45 4 mg n l h at c n ratio of 1 5 within the first 45 min fig 3d the lower sadn rate observed at c n ratios of 0 7 than that at c n ratios of 0 5 may be due to the slight lower initial nitrate concentration fig 3d the present result indicates that supplementation with organics could also boost sadn rate meanwhile sulfide was detected during the tests we speculate that the enhanced sadn rate after organic supplementation could be due to the involvement of sulfide being produced during nitrate removal mohanakrishnan et al 2009 and liu et al 2015b also found that nitrate presence did not have inhibitory effects on the activity of sulfidogenic bacteria 3 3 effect of sulfide on nitrate removal no2 accumulation and sadn as mentioned above organic supplementation was found to enhance sadn rate and this likely occurred via the formation of sulfide to investigate whether the presence of sulfide could improve tn removal and sadn rates alongside reducing no2 accumulation a batch test was conducted the results show that tn removal rate with sulfide initially was significantly higher than that without sulfide initially fig 4 with sulfide initially no no2 accumulation was observed at the end of batch test in contrast 11 2 mg n l no2 were accumulated in the batch test with without sulfide initially indicating that sulfide could facilitate no2 reduction note that the added sulfide approximately 10 mg s l was completely oxidized within the first 30 min of the batch test in theory the tn removal rates between the two batch tests should be similar between 30 min and 90 min however the nitrate removal rate 4 9 mg n l h in the batch test with sulfide initially was significantly higher than that in the absence of sulfide almost no removal during this time period it may be due to the presence of sulfide at the beginning of batch test enhanced the bioaccessibility of sulfur via the involvement of polysulfide which was generated from the abiotic reaction between sulfide and sulfur liang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b when sulfide was consumed dissolved zero valent sulfur decomposed from polysulfide florentino et al 2016 equation 3 could be used by denitrifiers resulting in higher tn removal rate compared to that without sulfide initially 3 4 effect of different c n ratios on microbial competition in the sbr 3 4 1 microbial community richness and diversity to study the effects of different c n ratios on the microbial communities in the sbr 16s rrna gene sequencing was conducted on sludge samples collected from the different phases the tendency of the rarefaction curves to approach a saturation plateau indicates that the recovered sequences were sufficient to represent the microbial diversity in the sludge samples fig s2 the microbial community in the sbr at different phases was further compared using pcoa based on weighted unifrac distance fig 5 two distinct groups were determined with the exception of the seeding sludge r 0 794 p 0 001 showing a shaped evolution trajectory with a decreasing c n ratios the overall evolutionary trend of the developing community showed that different c n ratios significantly shaped the microbial community in the sbr differentially zhang et al 2015 also observed that the addition of methanol or ethanol significantly shaped the microbial community in a sulfur based autotrophic denitrifying anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor 3 4 2 microbial community evolution the different c n ratios significantly shaped the microbial community in the sbr at phylum level although bacteroidetes chloroflexi firmicutes epsilonbacteraeota and proteobacteria were the five dominant phyla in the seeding sludge and in the sludge samples at different c n ratios constituting 96 of the microbial community fig 6 a their relative abundances dramatically changed with decreasing c n ratios the abundances of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria gradually increased from 22 4 to 4 9 31 6 and 56 7 respectively when the c n ratio was reduced from 2 7 to 0 the enrichment of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria has also been observed in previous studies about heterotrophic and chemolithotrophic denitrification jin et al 2018 morgan sagastume et al 2008 zhao et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 in contrast the abundances of chloroflexi firmicutes and epsilonbacteraeota gradually decreased from 44 7 6 4 and 16 0 at a c n ratio of 2 7 4 9 0 1 and 4 5 at a c n ratio of 0 respectively the genus level distributions of the bacterial community are presented in fig 6b trichococcus and paludibacter were the main identified fermentative genera in the sbr due to the decreasing amount of organics added the relative abundance of trichococcus gradually decreased from 29 8 in the seeding sludge to an undetected level during the last phase c n 0 the relative abundance of paludibacter increased slightly from 0 1 in the seeding sludge to 1 6 during the last phase with decreasing c n ratios nine denitrifying genera were identified in the sbr even in the seeding sludge namely thiobacillus sulfurovum sulfurimonas thauera longilinea chryseobacterium acinetobacter rhodobacter and paracoccus among these chryseobacterium and acinetobacter were identified hnrb kundu et al 2014 zhang et al 2018c and thiobacillus sulfurovum sulfurimonas longilinea rhodobacter and paracoccus were identified anrb chen et al 2013 wan et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 2018c thauera belongs to facultative denirifier which is capable of heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification liu et al 2015a zhang et al 2015 2018c when c n ratios were decreasd from 2 7 in phase i to 0 in phase vi the abundances of thiobacillus sulfurovum sulfurimonas thauera and longilinea varied dramatically the abundances of thiobacillus sulfurimonas and thauera gradually increased from 0 1 0 02 and 0 07 to 50 2 4 5 and 1 6 respectively in contrast the abundances of sulfurovum and longilinea gradually decreased from 15 4 to 0 9 to an undetectable level and 0 5 respectively as for the chryseobacterium acinetobacter rhodobacter and paracoccus their abundances were relatively stable all below 0 5 with decreasing c n ratios sulfidogenic genera were also analyzed in the seeding sludge desulfuromonas desulfurella and geobacter were identified fig 6b of which their abundances were 0 8 0 2 and 0 1 respectively the abundances of desulfuromonas and desulfurella gradually decreased to undetectable levels with decreasing c n ratios however the abundance of geobacter gradually increased to 2 7 in phase v c n 0 25 and then decreased to 1 7 in the absence of extra organics during the final phase c n 0 3 5 predicted metabolic functions in the sbr the picrust analysis was used to predict the effects of different c n ratios on the metagenomic functional compositions of microbial community in the sbr reactor to our knowledge this is the first time picrust analysis was applied to moderately predict microbial functions and nitrogen metabolic pathways in a sulfur based denitrification reactor in total 328 predicted functions were identified in the sludge samples at each phase the majority of sequences were associated with the functions involved in metabolism 46 40 51 40 genetic information processing 16 00 17 90 environmental information processing 11 63 17 35 and cellular processes 1 83 6 58 respectively fig s3 carbohydrate amino acid and energy metabolism were the most frequently detected gene types in the metabolism category carbohydrate metabolism could decompose complex organics into more easily degradable matter wei et al 2018 amino acid metabolism could provide carbon source and energy for bacterial metabolism lópez gonzález et al 2015 the relative abundances of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism slightly and significantly decreased with decreasing c n ratios respectively fig s3 as the organic concentration in the influent declined over time the functional genes involved in nitrogen metabolism in the energy metabolism category were further analyzed nitrogen metabolism significantly enriched over time fig 7 a which was consistent with the abundances of denitrifiers detected in the sbr during the different phases fig 6a the predicted functional genes associated with nitrogen cycling are further illustrated in fig 7b such as nitrification assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reduction denitrification and nitrogen fixation the high abundances of genes encoding assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification and multifunctional genes encoding nitrate reductase nitrite oxidoreductase demonstrated the high nitrogen metabolism potential of the denitrifying sludge in the sbr in general the abundances of these genes gradually increased with decreasing c n ratios with the expectation of a slight reduction in genes encoding nitrite reductase cytochrome c 552 nrfa periplasmic nitrate reductase napa and cytochrome c type proteins napb these patterns were likely related to the increased abundances of denitrifiers in the sbr the low abundance of gene encoding hao hydroxylamine oxidoreductase which catalyzes the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite may be due to ammonium absence in the sbr influent 4 discussion in this study the effects of organic supplementation on a sulfur based denitrification reactor were investigated tn was efficiently removed with six different c n ratios ranging from 2 7 to 0 in the long term operation of the sbr sadn was the dominant removal process when the c n ratio was 0 7 fig 2d it should be noted that sulfide started to accumulate in the reactor only after nitrate depletion the sulfide production may mainly come from sulfur reduction instead of sulfate reduction as sulfidogenic bacteria preferentially use sulfur as electron acceptors in the presence of sulfide when both sulfur and sulfate are present sun et al 2018 zhou et al 2011b also observed that the sulfide production in an organic rich denitrifying sulfide removal dsr system was from elemental sulfur reduction with unchanged sulfate concentration after nitrate depletion even though sulfate may be reduced to sulfide in the presence of nitrate the generated sulfide was not accumulated in the presence of nitrate nitrite moreover the biogenic sulfide can be involved in denitrification and can be oxidized back to sulfate with sufficient nitrate chen et al 2009 zhang et al 2018c thus the assessment of contribution of sadn to tn removal based on net sulfate production is reliable the effects of different c n ratios on functional microbial groups were further elucidated nine denitrifiers were identified in the reactor which have been often reported in sulfur based autotrophic or mixotrophic denitrification systems zhang et al 2015 li et al 2016 chen et al 2018 in the sbr with a high c n ratio we still observed highly diverse anrb communities which could contribute to sadn overall a decreasing c n ratio increased total relative abundance of nrb and nitrogen metabolism functional genes fig 7b this may be due to the fact that carbon deficit conditions i e a low c n ratio were not suitable for the growth of some microbial communities that were irrelevant to denitrification as for anrb although their total relative abundance increased with decreasing c n ratios fig s4 the responses of different anrb communities varied briefly the abundances of sulfurovum and longilinea gradually decreased with decreasing c n ratios indicating that the two anrb genera could prefer to grow under conditions with a high c n ratio the abundances of thiobacillus and sulfurimonas showed the opposite trend to sulfurovum and longilinea suggesting that they could flourish under conditions with a low c n ratio thus to guarantee high rate nitrogen removal in sulfur based denitrification reactors the dominant anrb groups might shift from sulfurovum and longilinea to thiobacillus and sulfurimonas when the influent c n ratio declined from high to low the abundance of the facultative denitrifier thauera increased with decreasing c n ratios indicating that most of the species affiliated with this genus in the reactor were anrb particularly under low c n ratio conditions additionally without organic supplementation c n 0 a small fraction of hnrb was still detected in the reactor which could partially support the finding that the contribution of sadn to tn removal was only 90 without organic supplementation the c n ratios also influenced sulfidogenic bacteria with a decreasing c n ratio the decrease in the abundances of desulfuromonas and desulfurella could be due to the limited organic carbon however the abundance of geobacter gradually increased with decreasing c n ratio which can reduce sulfur to sulfide qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2018 as such geobacter could play a crucial role in sulfide production in the sadn system which is consistent with the result that sulfide was detected in the sbr effluent sulfidogenic bacteria e g sulfate reducing and sulfur reducing bacteria were also often reported in denitrifying sulfide systems adav and lee 2008 chen et al 2008 zhou et al 2011b show et al 2013 short term batch tests showed that organic supplementation accelerated tn removal and reduced no2 accumulation fig 3 indicating that denitrifiers likely use organics preferentially over sulfur as the electron donors to reduce no2 it may be due to the fact that the presence of organics enhanced hnrb activity promoting no2 reduction interestingly organic supplementation did not slow the sadn rate but improved it to some extent fig 3c to our knowledge this study is the first to demonstrate the positive effect of organics supplementation on accelerating sadn process a batch test further illustrated that sulfide could be directly used as the electron donors in ad process and could also facilitate sadn likely via dissolved zero valent sulfur polysulfide fig 4 a little amount of polysulfide was also detected during a typical cycle of the sbr operation fig s5 thus the acceleration of sadn rate by organic supplementation could likely be explained by sulfide produced in the presence of nitrate that would increase the bioavailability of sulfur via forming polysulfide and finally increase the sadn rate which is partially supported by the detection of sulfide in the sbr effluent fig 2b and by the presence of sulfidogenic genera fig 6b it should be pointed out that sulfide was not detected in the wastewater in the presence of nitrate which is consistent with the findings in denitrifying sulfide removal dsr processes zhou et al 2011a 2011b show et al 2013 this is may be due to the fact that the generated sulfide could be immediately oxidized by anrb the generated sulfide could be formed in the deep layers of the biofilm anaerobic zones growing on the surface of sulfur particles as indicated by scanning electron microscopy as shown in fig s6 zhang et al 2018a as such polysulfide was subsequently produced inside the biofilm and was then released into the wastewater which can be explained by the detection of dissolved zero valent sulfur in the reactor fig s5 mohanakrishnan et al 2009 and liu et al 2015b also demonstrated that sulfidogenic populations and activity were not influenced in anaerobic sewer biofilms and sediments dosed with nitrate moreover okabe et al 2003 observed sulfate reducing activity in anaerobic zones of microaerophilic wastewater biofilm exposed to nitrate although some studies have discussed that polysulfide could play an important role in increasing the bioavailability of sulfur in the sadn process hao et al 2019 wang et al 2016 kostrytsia et al 2018 its role has not yet been experimentally demonstrated which also highlights the need for further research additionally as for chemical oxidation of sulfide with nitrate yang et al 2005 found that chemical oxidation of sulﬁde with nitrate was either non existing or occurring at a very low rate thus this chemical reaction was not considered in this study we thus proposed a possible nitrogen removal pathway involving multiple electron donors organics sulfur sulfide and polysulfide in a sulfur based denitrification reactor when organic carbon is present fig 8 briefly sulfur can be directly used as electron donors in ad when organics are introduced the organics can be oxidized by sulfidogenic bacteria with sulfide being generated from sulfur sulfate reduction in addition to directly contributing to hd the formed sulfide can subsequently be involved in ad by functioning as electron donors as well as stimulating the formation of polysulfide ringel et al 1996 liang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b the formed polysulfide could increase the bioaccessibility of sulfur thereby improving sulfur reduction and ad rates note again as aforementioned the role of polysulfide in sadn merits further investigation the above findings suggest that in addition to reducing sulfate production and alkalinity consumption sahinkaya et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the supplementation with organics could improve tn removal and sadn rates as well as reduce no2 accumulation in sulfur based autotrophic denitrification reactors however it should be noted that a high c n ratio of 0 5 significantly shaped microbial community and reduced anrb abundance moreover when the c n ratio was 0 7 tn removal was mainly attributed to hd thus increasing the operational cost and offsetting the advantages of sadn process for cost effective treatment of nitrate contaminated wastewater high c n ratios also increased the concentrations of organics and sulfide in the effluent which could cause serious environmental problems conversely when c n ratios were controlled between 0 25 and 0 5 tn and sadn rates were significantly increased without having a substantial impact on the microbial community structure as such an optimal c n ratio range could be 0 25 0 5 within this range the additional cost owing to organic supplementation and concentrations of sulfide and organic in the effluent could be minimized fig 1 moreover the low residual sulfide in the effluent could be further eliminated by shortening the hrt of sulfur based denitrification reactors without influencing nitrogen removal as sulfide was only accumulated after nitrogen depletion 5 conclusions organic supplementation improved tn removal and reduced no2 accumulation in a sulfur based denitrification reactor more importantly the sadn pathway predominated in the reactor when the influent c n ratios were 0 7 microbial community analysis showed that the total relative abundance of nrb and the nitrogen metabolism potential increased with decreasing c n ratios in the reactor the dominant anrb groups shifted from sulfurovum and longilinea to thiobacillus and sulfurimonas resulted in efficient nitrogen removal in the reactor when c n ratios were changed from 2 7 to 0 overall the microbial community structure did not have a substantial change at c n ratios of 0 5 short term batch tests further showed that in addition to enhancing hd organic supplementation could boost sadn rate by improving sulfur bioavailability likely via the polysulfide formation induced by sulfur sulfate reduction this nitrogen removal pathway in a sadn system with organic supplementation was previously overlooked accordingly a diagram of the comprehensive nitrogen removal pathways with multiple electron donors in a sulfur based denitrification reactor with organic supplementation was proposed to minimize the additional cost associated with organic supplementation and sulfide and organic concentrations in effluent as well as avoid significant impacts on microbial community an optimal c n ratio of 0 25 0 5 is suggested for improving tn removal and sadn rates and for reducing no2 accumulation collectively the deeper understanding of the role of organic supplementation in a sulfur based denitrification system obtained in this study could provide useful information for optimizing operational parameters of reactors to improve nitrogen removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18322,elemental sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification sadn is a cost effective approach for treating secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps additional organics are generally supplemented to promote total nitrogen tn removal reduce nitrite accumulation and sulfate production and balance the ph decrease induced by sadn however understanding of the impacts of organic supplementation on microbial communities nitrogen metabolism denitrifier activity and sadn rates in sulfur based denitrification reactors is still limited here a sulfur based denitrification reactor was continuously operated for 272 days during which six different c n ratios were tested successively 2 7 1 5 0 7 0 5 0 25 and 0 organic supplementation improved tn removal and decreased no2 accumulation but reduced the relative abundance of denitrifiers and the contribution of autotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria anrb to tn removal during the long term operation of reactor predictive functional profiling showed that nitrogen metabolism potential increased with decreasing c n ratios sadn was the predominant removal process when the c n ratio was 0 7 achieving 60 contribution when c n 0 7 although organic supplementation weakened the dominant role of anrb in denitrification batch tests for the first time demonstrated that it could accelerate the sadn rate attributed to the improvement of sulfur bioavailability likely via the formation of polysulfide a possible nitrogen removal pathway with multiple electron donors i e sulfur organics sulfide and polysulfide in a sulfur based denitrification reactor with organic supplementation was therefore proposed however supplementation with a high level of organics could increase the operational cost and effluent concentrations of sulfide and organics as well as enrich heterotrophic denitrifiers moreover microbial community had substantial changes at c n ratios of 0 5 accordingly an optimal c n ratio of 0 25 0 5 was suggested which could simultaneously minimize the additional operating cost associated with organic supplementation and maximize tn removal and sadn rates graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfur based autotrophic denitrification sadn heterotrophic denitrification polysulfide denitrifying bacteria nitrogen removal pathway 1 introduction elemental sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification sadn is an economical and energy efficient approach for treating secondary effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps due to low sludge production and operational cost equation 1 sahinkaya et al 2012 however the extremely low water solubility of elemental sulfur 5 μg l at 25 c limits its bioavailability making denitrification and denitritation rates lower than those obtained with more soluble electron donors park and yoo 2009 di capua et al 2017 during sadn nitrite no2 typically accumulates to high concentration levels limiting the overall nitrogen removal efficiency sahinkaya et al 2015 kostrytsia et al 2018 to alleviate these drawbacks in sadn systems supplementation with organics can reduce no2 accumulation and improve total nitrogen tn removal rates by introducing heterotrophic denitrification hd to achieve mixotrophic denitrification sahinkaya and kilic 2014 zhang et al 2015 the involvement of hd can also reduce sulfate production and balance the ph decrease induced by sadn via alkalinity production equation 2 li et al 2016 1 s 0 0 91 n o 3 0 69 h 2 o 0 07 n h 4 0 36 c o 2 0 07 c 5 h 7 o 2 n s o 4 2 0 45 n 2 1 16 h 2 c h 3 c o o 1 18 n o 3 2 18 h 0 12 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 1 4 c o 2 2 5 h 2 o 0 53 n 2 although some studies have shown the feasibility of reducing sulfate production and alkalinity consumption via simultaneous hd and sadn in a single reactor for treating nitrate contaminated water liu et al 2009 sahinkaya et al 2011 sahinkaya and kilic 2014 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2016 liang et al 2018 little attention has been paid to the effects of organic carbon supplementation on sadn systems on the one hand heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria hnrb grow rapidly and thus may outcompete autotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria anrb to become the dominant functional bacteria in sadn systems if so this may lead to a decline in sadn efficiency and ultimately failure of the system previous studies observed that the supplementation of sadn systems with soluble or solid carbon substrates significantly alters microbial community characteristics zhang et al 2015 li et al 2016 however with different organic dosages microbial communities nitrogen metabolism and nrb activity are also expected to differ yet these effects have not yet been well studied on the other hand in addition to heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria hnrb the growth and activities of other heterotrophic communities such as fermentative bacteria and sulfidogenic bacteria etc can consume a certain amount of organics this means that the amount of organic carbon added to sadn systems should be greater than hd demand in order to achieve efficient nitrogen removal as such the actual cost of organic supplementation would be much higher than the theoretical cost according to the stoichiometry of hd equation 2 however overdosing organics could easily lead to an increase of chemical oxidation demand cod concentration in effluent which can result in severe secondary pollution accordingly an appropriate supplementation of organics is deemed necessary to maximize nitrogen removal and minimize the operational cost simultaneously which has not been fully understood yet as stated above elemental sulfur could have a low bioaccessibility to microorganisms due to its low water solubility however the added organics can serve as electron donors and favor the biological reduction of sulfur to sulfide qiu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b the formed sulfide could directly be used as electron donors for denitrification process chen et al 2009 the biogenic sulfide could also chemically react with sulfur to generate polysulfide equation 3 zhang et al 2018b because of dissolved zero valent sulfur the presence of polysulfide could significantly improve biological sulfur reduction and oxidation rates zhang et al 2018b wang et al 2019 to our knowledge it still remains unknown whether the biogenic sulfide could facilitate the sadn process by the involvement of polysulfide 3 h s n 1 8 s 8 s n 2 h to address these knowledge gaps a laboratory scale sulfur based sequencing batch reactor sbr was continuously operated for 272 days during which the sbr was supplemented with organic substrates at different dosages to achieve different ratios of organic carbon to nitrate c n ratio using this set up we aimed to a investigate the effects of different c n ratios on total nitrogen tn removal no2 accumulation and the contribution of sadn to denitrification to determine an optimal c n ratio b analyze the effects of organic supplementation on sadn rate and the nitrate removal pathway c elucidate the microbial competition between anrb and hnrb and nitrogen metabolism in a sadn reactor receiving organic supplementation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation a laboratory scale sbr with an effective volume of 2 4 l 100 mm diameter x 300 mm effective height was fabricated using acrylic fig 1 the outlet was set at 10 cm from the base indicating a volume exchange ratio of 0 67 the sbr was seeded with 7 5 g of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss l of activated sludge which was taken from a sulfur reducing bioreactor that had been continuously operated for more than one year in our lab qiu et al 2017 the sbr was fed with synthetic wastewater and sodium nitrate solution v v 1 1 the synthetic wastewater was prepared as per jiang et al 2013 and zhang et al 2018d sublimed sulfur fine particles 20 40 μm in diameter were dosed via the top opening of reactor according to the daily sulfur consumption 800 mg l of sodium bicarbonate nahco3 was added as a buffer solution the sbr was placed in a chamber equipped with a regulating thermostat 25 2 c the sbr was continuously operated for 272 days divided into six phases phase i to phase vi table 1 the c n weight ratio hereafter referred to as c n ratio was gradually decreased from 2 7 mg c mg n in phase i to 0 mg c mg n in phase vi by increasing the influent nitrate concentration and decreasing the influent toc concentration the detailed information about the organic and nitrate concentrations in each phase is presented in table 1 from phase i to phase vi the cycle time of the sbr operation was gradually decreased from 6 h to 2 h corresponding with a decrease in the hydraulic retention time hrt from 9 h to 3 h table 1 the timing of the filling reaction settling and decanting phases during each time cycle is presented in table s1 water samples were periodically collected during the entire operational period to measure the concentrations of toc dissolved sulfide sulfate thiosulfate nitrate and nitrite the ph of the influent and effluent and the oxidation reduction potential orp and water temperature in the sbr were also measured 2 2 effect of c n ratios on nitrate removal nitrite accumulation and sadn at the end of the experiment five tests were successively performed in the sbr to study the effects of different c n ratios 0 0 25 0 5 0 7 and 1 5 on tn removal no2 accumulation and sadn rates after conducting the pre tests before performing these tests the sbr was disconnected from the influent and effluent pumps an initial nitrate concentration of 40 mg n l was obtained by spiking a concentrated sodium nitrate solution according to the tested c n ratios five different initial toc concentrations 0 10 20 28 and 60 mg l were obtained by adding different volumes of stock synthetic wastewater in each case approximately 400 mg l of sodium bicarbonate were also added the tests were conducted at approximately 25 c for 180 min during which water samples were collected at 0 min 15 min 30 min 45 min 60 min 90 min 120 min and 180 min through the top opening using a 5 ml syringe toc nitrate nitrite sulfide sulfate and thiosulfate concentrations in the water samples were quantified in triplicate the ph in the sbr was also measured at each sampling time when one batch test was performed the sbr was re connected with the influent and effluent pumps and was allowed to stabilize for at least three full cycles after which the denitrifying activity recovered to the normal level in phase vi data not shown as such the denitrifying activity was assumed to be similar at the beginning of all the batch tests the operational parameters during the recovery period were as same as those used in phase vi 2 3 effects of sulfide on nitrate removal nitrite accumulation and sadn during the long term operation of the sbr sulfide was detected in the effluent see section 3 1 indicating that sulfidogenic activity in the reactor may keep active previous studies have also reported that sulfidogenic activity was not suppressed in sewers receiving nitrate dosage mohanakrishnan et al 2009 liu et al 2015b thus in addition to enhancing hd organic presence may indirectly improve nitrate removal sadn rates and reduce no2 accumulation via the production of sulfide to investigate the impact of sulfide a batch test with sulfide initially was conducted in triplicate with the enriched denitrifying sludge collected from the sbr at the end of the long term experiment the sludge was washed with deoxygenated deionized water three times and then evenly distributed into six 500 ml serum bottles the sludge concentration in each bottle was measured as 0 90 g mlvss l 25 mg n l of nitrate and 1 g l of sublimated sulfur were then added to the bottles along with 10 mg s l of sulfide the bottles were purged with nitrogen gas and then sealed with rubber stoppers to maintain anaerobic conditions a control test without sulfide initially was also performed in triplicate the initial ph was controlled at 7 50 0 05 by adding hcl naoh solution the tests were conducted at approximately 25 c for 450 min during which water samples were collected using a 5 ml syringe at 0 min 30 min 60 min 90 min 180 min 320 min and 450 min via a sampling port on the rubber stopper fitted with a hose toc nitrate nitrite sulfide sulfate and thiosulfate concentrations in these water samples were then measured a ph probe was fitted to each bottle to measure ph variations over time 2 4 chemical analysis concentrations of toc sulfide sulfate thiosulfate nitrate and nitrite in water samples were determined after filtration millipore 0 45 μm the toc was analyzed using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc 5000a h2s hs and s2 were summarized as total dissolved sulfides and the total dissolved sulfide concentration was determined using the methylene blue method apha 2005 liang et al 2019 the concentrations of sulfate thiosulfate nitrate and nitrite in the sbr and the batch tests were analyzed with an ion chromatograph dionex 900 ics 900 ca usa the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mlvss were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 temperature ph and orp were measured using portable meters multi parameter meter hq40d hach elemental sulfur in sludge samples was extracted based on the method as per mcguire and hamers 2000 and was measured using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc shimadzu lc 16 japan equipped with a kromasil column c18 5 μm 100 å and a uv detector at 254 nm the method of polysulfide measurement in water samples as per kleinjan et al 2005 2 5 sludge sampling dna extraction pcr amplification illumina miseq sequencing and bioinformatics analysis the sludge samples in triplicates were collected during the different phases of the sbr operation on day 45 77 104 196 223 and 272 to characterize the microbial community structures using illumina miseq sequencing the total genomic dna was extracted from the sludge samples using the mobio power soil dna isolation kit mp biomedicals carlsbad ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions the extracted dna was then subjected to illumina miseq sequencing for microbial community analysis 16s rrna was amplified using the 515f 806r primer pair to target the hypervariable v4 regions of both the bacteria and archaea domains the illumina miseq sequencing service illumina inc san diego ca was provided by meige bio tech inc guangzhou china the obtained paired end raw 16s rrna gene sequences were assembled and filtered in mothur kozich et al 2013 the aligned sequences were checked for chimera using usearch 6 1 in qiime and classified into operational taxonomic units otus within a 3 dissimilarity applying the de novo otu picking workflow in qiime caporaso et al 2010 to determine the beta diversity of the bacterial communities principal coordinates analysis pcoa was performed based on the weighted unifrac distance matrix in qiime lozupone et al 2011 analysis of similarities anosim with bray curtis distance was employed using the r package vegan to assess the statistical differences p 0 05 among the sludge samples in the pcoa plot where the r value typically ranges from 0 no discrimination to 1 perfect discrimination heatmap analysis was also conducted using the r package heatmap phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust analysis was performed to predict the metabolic functions of the microbial community in the sbr during the different phases using the galaxy platform against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome kegg orthology database langille et al 2013 the abundances of predicted functional genes kegg ortholog ko at l1 l2 and l3 levels were calculated the genes related to biological nitrogen cycling were further visualized using heatmap 3 results 3 1 sbr performance the sbr achieved efficient nitrate removal during the long term period fig 2 a in phase i day 0 45 the influent c n ratio was 2 7 and an average of 91 7 of the influent nitrate was removed with an initial concentration of 15 1 mg n l and a hrt of 9 h fig 2a and table 1 meanwhile 62 3 of the influent toc 40 8 mg l were oxidized fig 2b from phase ii day 46 77 to phase vi day 227 272 the influent nitrate concentration increased to between 27 8 and 45 0 mg n l the influent toc concentration was gradually reduced from 57 7 mg l to 0 mg l resulting in a stepwise decrease in c n ratios from 1 5 to 0 table 1 the hrt was also progressively decreased from 9 h in phase ii to 3 h in phase vi although the operational conditions were varied considerably i e both the c n ratio and hrt nitrate was almost completely removed during the five phases fig 2a note that almost no nitrite was observed in the effluent during the entire operational period fig 2a with respect to the toc approximately 50 of the influent toc were consumed in phase ii iii and iv table 1 and fig 2b when the influent toc concentration was further decreased to 10 8 mg l in phase v c n 0 25 toc was still not completely oxidized table s2 with an average of 78 8 being consumed sulfide was also detected in the sbr effluent throughout the entire operational period in which the effluent sulfide concentration decreased with decreasing c n ratios and hrts fig 2c in addition as sadn consumes alkalinity equation 1 zhang et al 2015 the effluent ph was lower than that in the influent fig s1 sulfate was generated in the sadn process with sulfur being used as the electron donors equation 1 when the c n ratio was gradually decreased from 2 7 phase i to 0 phase vi the net sulfate production increased from 5 5 to 100 0 mg s l fig 2c according to the net sulfate production and removed tn in each phase as well as the stoichiometry ratio of sulfur to nitrate shown in equation 1 the contributions of sadn to tn removal were calculated fig 2d without organic supplementation c n 0 the contribution of sadn to tn removal was 90 on average suggesting that hd and assimilatory nitrate reduction could occur in the last phase of sbr operation this may be due to the fact that soluble microbial products and cell lysis products could provide some organic matter for hd koenig et al 2005 sheng et al 2010 denitrification with endogenous carbon sources as the electron donors have often been reported in previous studies qin et al 2005 ji et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 this value 90 was further used as a baseline to assess the contribution of organic supplementation to tn removal when different c n ratios were employed the results show that with a c n ratio of 0 25 and 0 5 hd only contributed approximately 11 14 to the overall tn removal this contribution increased with elevating c n ratios reaching 46 with a c n ratio of 1 5 the present result shows that most of the influent nitrate was removed via the sadn pathway in the last four phases indicating that sadn predominated in the sulfur based denitrification reactor when c n ratios were lower than or equal to 0 7 3 2 effect of different c n ratios on nitrate removal nitrite accumulation and sadn the tn removal rate increased with elevating c n ratios and plateaued at a c n ratio of 0 5 fig 3 in which the tn removal rate at c n ratio of 0 5 was three times greater than that in the absence of organic supplementation 52 1 mg n l h vs 17 5 mg n l h to compare no2 accumulation in the batch tests with different c n ratios no2 profiles at 90 min were used as this was the first time point when nitrate in all batch tests was depleted as shown in fig 3a no2 accumulation during the nitrate removal was gradually decreased from 46 mg n l in the absence of organics to an undetectable level with a c n ratio of 0 5 indicating that denitritation rate was faster with organics rather than sulfur as the electron donors however with a c n ratio of 0 5 or more no additional increase in tn removal rate was observed and nitrate and nitrite were completely depleted after 60 min these results suggest that c n ratio is a decisive factor of maximizing tn removal rate and minimizing no2 accumulation and operational cost in sadn systems with organic supplementation interestingly the sulfate production rate increased with elevating c n ratios fig 3c correspondingly the sadn rates increased from 17 3 mg n l h in the absence of additional organic to 45 4 mg n l h at c n ratio of 1 5 within the first 45 min fig 3d the lower sadn rate observed at c n ratios of 0 7 than that at c n ratios of 0 5 may be due to the slight lower initial nitrate concentration fig 3d the present result indicates that supplementation with organics could also boost sadn rate meanwhile sulfide was detected during the tests we speculate that the enhanced sadn rate after organic supplementation could be due to the involvement of sulfide being produced during nitrate removal mohanakrishnan et al 2009 and liu et al 2015b also found that nitrate presence did not have inhibitory effects on the activity of sulfidogenic bacteria 3 3 effect of sulfide on nitrate removal no2 accumulation and sadn as mentioned above organic supplementation was found to enhance sadn rate and this likely occurred via the formation of sulfide to investigate whether the presence of sulfide could improve tn removal and sadn rates alongside reducing no2 accumulation a batch test was conducted the results show that tn removal rate with sulfide initially was significantly higher than that without sulfide initially fig 4 with sulfide initially no no2 accumulation was observed at the end of batch test in contrast 11 2 mg n l no2 were accumulated in the batch test with without sulfide initially indicating that sulfide could facilitate no2 reduction note that the added sulfide approximately 10 mg s l was completely oxidized within the first 30 min of the batch test in theory the tn removal rates between the two batch tests should be similar between 30 min and 90 min however the nitrate removal rate 4 9 mg n l h in the batch test with sulfide initially was significantly higher than that in the absence of sulfide almost no removal during this time period it may be due to the presence of sulfide at the beginning of batch test enhanced the bioaccessibility of sulfur via the involvement of polysulfide which was generated from the abiotic reaction between sulfide and sulfur liang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b when sulfide was consumed dissolved zero valent sulfur decomposed from polysulfide florentino et al 2016 equation 3 could be used by denitrifiers resulting in higher tn removal rate compared to that without sulfide initially 3 4 effect of different c n ratios on microbial competition in the sbr 3 4 1 microbial community richness and diversity to study the effects of different c n ratios on the microbial communities in the sbr 16s rrna gene sequencing was conducted on sludge samples collected from the different phases the tendency of the rarefaction curves to approach a saturation plateau indicates that the recovered sequences were sufficient to represent the microbial diversity in the sludge samples fig s2 the microbial community in the sbr at different phases was further compared using pcoa based on weighted unifrac distance fig 5 two distinct groups were determined with the exception of the seeding sludge r 0 794 p 0 001 showing a shaped evolution trajectory with a decreasing c n ratios the overall evolutionary trend of the developing community showed that different c n ratios significantly shaped the microbial community in the sbr differentially zhang et al 2015 also observed that the addition of methanol or ethanol significantly shaped the microbial community in a sulfur based autotrophic denitrifying anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor 3 4 2 microbial community evolution the different c n ratios significantly shaped the microbial community in the sbr at phylum level although bacteroidetes chloroflexi firmicutes epsilonbacteraeota and proteobacteria were the five dominant phyla in the seeding sludge and in the sludge samples at different c n ratios constituting 96 of the microbial community fig 6 a their relative abundances dramatically changed with decreasing c n ratios the abundances of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria gradually increased from 22 4 to 4 9 31 6 and 56 7 respectively when the c n ratio was reduced from 2 7 to 0 the enrichment of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria has also been observed in previous studies about heterotrophic and chemolithotrophic denitrification jin et al 2018 morgan sagastume et al 2008 zhao et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 in contrast the abundances of chloroflexi firmicutes and epsilonbacteraeota gradually decreased from 44 7 6 4 and 16 0 at a c n ratio of 2 7 4 9 0 1 and 4 5 at a c n ratio of 0 respectively the genus level distributions of the bacterial community are presented in fig 6b trichococcus and paludibacter were the main identified fermentative genera in the sbr due to the decreasing amount of organics added the relative abundance of trichococcus gradually decreased from 29 8 in the seeding sludge to an undetected level during the last phase c n 0 the relative abundance of paludibacter increased slightly from 0 1 in the seeding sludge to 1 6 during the last phase with decreasing c n ratios nine denitrifying genera were identified in the sbr even in the seeding sludge namely thiobacillus sulfurovum sulfurimonas thauera longilinea chryseobacterium acinetobacter rhodobacter and paracoccus among these chryseobacterium and acinetobacter were identified hnrb kundu et al 2014 zhang et al 2018c and thiobacillus sulfurovum sulfurimonas longilinea rhodobacter and paracoccus were identified anrb chen et al 2013 wan et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 2018c thauera belongs to facultative denirifier which is capable of heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification liu et al 2015a zhang et al 2015 2018c when c n ratios were decreasd from 2 7 in phase i to 0 in phase vi the abundances of thiobacillus sulfurovum sulfurimonas thauera and longilinea varied dramatically the abundances of thiobacillus sulfurimonas and thauera gradually increased from 0 1 0 02 and 0 07 to 50 2 4 5 and 1 6 respectively in contrast the abundances of sulfurovum and longilinea gradually decreased from 15 4 to 0 9 to an undetectable level and 0 5 respectively as for the chryseobacterium acinetobacter rhodobacter and paracoccus their abundances were relatively stable all below 0 5 with decreasing c n ratios sulfidogenic genera were also analyzed in the seeding sludge desulfuromonas desulfurella and geobacter were identified fig 6b of which their abundances were 0 8 0 2 and 0 1 respectively the abundances of desulfuromonas and desulfurella gradually decreased to undetectable levels with decreasing c n ratios however the abundance of geobacter gradually increased to 2 7 in phase v c n 0 25 and then decreased to 1 7 in the absence of extra organics during the final phase c n 0 3 5 predicted metabolic functions in the sbr the picrust analysis was used to predict the effects of different c n ratios on the metagenomic functional compositions of microbial community in the sbr reactor to our knowledge this is the first time picrust analysis was applied to moderately predict microbial functions and nitrogen metabolic pathways in a sulfur based denitrification reactor in total 328 predicted functions were identified in the sludge samples at each phase the majority of sequences were associated with the functions involved in metabolism 46 40 51 40 genetic information processing 16 00 17 90 environmental information processing 11 63 17 35 and cellular processes 1 83 6 58 respectively fig s3 carbohydrate amino acid and energy metabolism were the most frequently detected gene types in the metabolism category carbohydrate metabolism could decompose complex organics into more easily degradable matter wei et al 2018 amino acid metabolism could provide carbon source and energy for bacterial metabolism lópez gonzález et al 2015 the relative abundances of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism slightly and significantly decreased with decreasing c n ratios respectively fig s3 as the organic concentration in the influent declined over time the functional genes involved in nitrogen metabolism in the energy metabolism category were further analyzed nitrogen metabolism significantly enriched over time fig 7 a which was consistent with the abundances of denitrifiers detected in the sbr during the different phases fig 6a the predicted functional genes associated with nitrogen cycling are further illustrated in fig 7b such as nitrification assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reduction denitrification and nitrogen fixation the high abundances of genes encoding assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification and multifunctional genes encoding nitrate reductase nitrite oxidoreductase demonstrated the high nitrogen metabolism potential of the denitrifying sludge in the sbr in general the abundances of these genes gradually increased with decreasing c n ratios with the expectation of a slight reduction in genes encoding nitrite reductase cytochrome c 552 nrfa periplasmic nitrate reductase napa and cytochrome c type proteins napb these patterns were likely related to the increased abundances of denitrifiers in the sbr the low abundance of gene encoding hao hydroxylamine oxidoreductase which catalyzes the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite may be due to ammonium absence in the sbr influent 4 discussion in this study the effects of organic supplementation on a sulfur based denitrification reactor were investigated tn was efficiently removed with six different c n ratios ranging from 2 7 to 0 in the long term operation of the sbr sadn was the dominant removal process when the c n ratio was 0 7 fig 2d it should be noted that sulfide started to accumulate in the reactor only after nitrate depletion the sulfide production may mainly come from sulfur reduction instead of sulfate reduction as sulfidogenic bacteria preferentially use sulfur as electron acceptors in the presence of sulfide when both sulfur and sulfate are present sun et al 2018 zhou et al 2011b also observed that the sulfide production in an organic rich denitrifying sulfide removal dsr system was from elemental sulfur reduction with unchanged sulfate concentration after nitrate depletion even though sulfate may be reduced to sulfide in the presence of nitrate the generated sulfide was not accumulated in the presence of nitrate nitrite moreover the biogenic sulfide can be involved in denitrification and can be oxidized back to sulfate with sufficient nitrate chen et al 2009 zhang et al 2018c thus the assessment of contribution of sadn to tn removal based on net sulfate production is reliable the effects of different c n ratios on functional microbial groups were further elucidated nine denitrifiers were identified in the reactor which have been often reported in sulfur based autotrophic or mixotrophic denitrification systems zhang et al 2015 li et al 2016 chen et al 2018 in the sbr with a high c n ratio we still observed highly diverse anrb communities which could contribute to sadn overall a decreasing c n ratio increased total relative abundance of nrb and nitrogen metabolism functional genes fig 7b this may be due to the fact that carbon deficit conditions i e a low c n ratio were not suitable for the growth of some microbial communities that were irrelevant to denitrification as for anrb although their total relative abundance increased with decreasing c n ratios fig s4 the responses of different anrb communities varied briefly the abundances of sulfurovum and longilinea gradually decreased with decreasing c n ratios indicating that the two anrb genera could prefer to grow under conditions with a high c n ratio the abundances of thiobacillus and sulfurimonas showed the opposite trend to sulfurovum and longilinea suggesting that they could flourish under conditions with a low c n ratio thus to guarantee high rate nitrogen removal in sulfur based denitrification reactors the dominant anrb groups might shift from sulfurovum and longilinea to thiobacillus and sulfurimonas when the influent c n ratio declined from high to low the abundance of the facultative denitrifier thauera increased with decreasing c n ratios indicating that most of the species affiliated with this genus in the reactor were anrb particularly under low c n ratio conditions additionally without organic supplementation c n 0 a small fraction of hnrb was still detected in the reactor which could partially support the finding that the contribution of sadn to tn removal was only 90 without organic supplementation the c n ratios also influenced sulfidogenic bacteria with a decreasing c n ratio the decrease in the abundances of desulfuromonas and desulfurella could be due to the limited organic carbon however the abundance of geobacter gradually increased with decreasing c n ratio which can reduce sulfur to sulfide qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2018 as such geobacter could play a crucial role in sulfide production in the sadn system which is consistent with the result that sulfide was detected in the sbr effluent sulfidogenic bacteria e g sulfate reducing and sulfur reducing bacteria were also often reported in denitrifying sulfide systems adav and lee 2008 chen et al 2008 zhou et al 2011b show et al 2013 short term batch tests showed that organic supplementation accelerated tn removal and reduced no2 accumulation fig 3 indicating that denitrifiers likely use organics preferentially over sulfur as the electron donors to reduce no2 it may be due to the fact that the presence of organics enhanced hnrb activity promoting no2 reduction interestingly organic supplementation did not slow the sadn rate but improved it to some extent fig 3c to our knowledge this study is the first to demonstrate the positive effect of organics supplementation on accelerating sadn process a batch test further illustrated that sulfide could be directly used as the electron donors in ad process and could also facilitate sadn likely via dissolved zero valent sulfur polysulfide fig 4 a little amount of polysulfide was also detected during a typical cycle of the sbr operation fig s5 thus the acceleration of sadn rate by organic supplementation could likely be explained by sulfide produced in the presence of nitrate that would increase the bioavailability of sulfur via forming polysulfide and finally increase the sadn rate which is partially supported by the detection of sulfide in the sbr effluent fig 2b and by the presence of sulfidogenic genera fig 6b it should be pointed out that sulfide was not detected in the wastewater in the presence of nitrate which is consistent with the findings in denitrifying sulfide removal dsr processes zhou et al 2011a 2011b show et al 2013 this is may be due to the fact that the generated sulfide could be immediately oxidized by anrb the generated sulfide could be formed in the deep layers of the biofilm anaerobic zones growing on the surface of sulfur particles as indicated by scanning electron microscopy as shown in fig s6 zhang et al 2018a as such polysulfide was subsequently produced inside the biofilm and was then released into the wastewater which can be explained by the detection of dissolved zero valent sulfur in the reactor fig s5 mohanakrishnan et al 2009 and liu et al 2015b also demonstrated that sulfidogenic populations and activity were not influenced in anaerobic sewer biofilms and sediments dosed with nitrate moreover okabe et al 2003 observed sulfate reducing activity in anaerobic zones of microaerophilic wastewater biofilm exposed to nitrate although some studies have discussed that polysulfide could play an important role in increasing the bioavailability of sulfur in the sadn process hao et al 2019 wang et al 2016 kostrytsia et al 2018 its role has not yet been experimentally demonstrated which also highlights the need for further research additionally as for chemical oxidation of sulfide with nitrate yang et al 2005 found that chemical oxidation of sulﬁde with nitrate was either non existing or occurring at a very low rate thus this chemical reaction was not considered in this study we thus proposed a possible nitrogen removal pathway involving multiple electron donors organics sulfur sulfide and polysulfide in a sulfur based denitrification reactor when organic carbon is present fig 8 briefly sulfur can be directly used as electron donors in ad when organics are introduced the organics can be oxidized by sulfidogenic bacteria with sulfide being generated from sulfur sulfate reduction in addition to directly contributing to hd the formed sulfide can subsequently be involved in ad by functioning as electron donors as well as stimulating the formation of polysulfide ringel et al 1996 liang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b the formed polysulfide could increase the bioaccessibility of sulfur thereby improving sulfur reduction and ad rates note again as aforementioned the role of polysulfide in sadn merits further investigation the above findings suggest that in addition to reducing sulfate production and alkalinity consumption sahinkaya et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the supplementation with organics could improve tn removal and sadn rates as well as reduce no2 accumulation in sulfur based autotrophic denitrification reactors however it should be noted that a high c n ratio of 0 5 significantly shaped microbial community and reduced anrb abundance moreover when the c n ratio was 0 7 tn removal was mainly attributed to hd thus increasing the operational cost and offsetting the advantages of sadn process for cost effective treatment of nitrate contaminated wastewater high c n ratios also increased the concentrations of organics and sulfide in the effluent which could cause serious environmental problems conversely when c n ratios were controlled between 0 25 and 0 5 tn and sadn rates were significantly increased without having a substantial impact on the microbial community structure as such an optimal c n ratio range could be 0 25 0 5 within this range the additional cost owing to organic supplementation and concentrations of sulfide and organic in the effluent could be minimized fig 1 moreover the low residual sulfide in the effluent could be further eliminated by shortening the hrt of sulfur based denitrification reactors without influencing nitrogen removal as sulfide was only accumulated after nitrogen depletion 5 conclusions organic supplementation improved tn removal and reduced no2 accumulation in a sulfur based denitrification reactor more importantly the sadn pathway predominated in the reactor when the influent c n ratios were 0 7 microbial community analysis showed that the total relative abundance of nrb and the nitrogen metabolism potential increased with decreasing c n ratios in the reactor the dominant anrb groups shifted from sulfurovum and longilinea to thiobacillus and sulfurimonas resulted in efficient nitrogen removal in the reactor when c n ratios were changed from 2 7 to 0 overall the microbial community structure did not have a substantial change at c n ratios of 0 5 short term batch tests further showed that in addition to enhancing hd organic supplementation could boost sadn rate by improving sulfur bioavailability likely via the polysulfide formation induced by sulfur sulfate reduction this nitrogen removal pathway in a sadn system with organic supplementation was previously overlooked accordingly a diagram of the comprehensive nitrogen removal pathways with multiple electron donors in a sulfur based denitrification reactor with organic supplementation was proposed to minimize the additional cost associated with organic supplementation and sulfide and organic concentrations in effluent as well as avoid significant impacts on microbial community an optimal c n ratio of 0 25 0 5 is suggested for improving tn removal and sadn rates and for reducing no2 accumulation collectively the deeper understanding of the role of organic supplementation in a sulfur based denitrification system obtained in this study could provide useful information for optimizing operational parameters of reactors to improve nitrogen removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18323,anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox based technology has potential for nitrogen removal from wastewater with high salinity but both salt and nitrite a substrate for anammox have negative effect on microbial activity in order to achieve anammox in saline wastewater treatment it is essential to understand the combined effect of these two components in this study the individual and combined effect of salinity and nitrite on fixed film freshwater anammox bacteria fab mainly belonging to the ca brocadia genus enriched on carriers from a 1500 l pilot scale one stage pn anammox moving bed bioreactor mbbr were systematically investigated by 57 pre designed batch tests the combined inhibition of nitrite and salinity was determined by comparing with additive and independent inhibition models with salinity only the specific anammox activity saa decreased with increasing salinity 14 6 ms cm about 9 1 g nacl l of salinity caused 50 inhibition ic50 with nitrite only saa started to decrease when nitrite concentration was above 450 mg n l threshold and decreased with increased nitrite ic50 666 mg n l thereafter significantly when both salinity and nitrite were elevated both the threshold and ic50 of nitrite were reduced with inhibition enhanced analysis showed that at high salinity 14 6 ms cm and nitrite concentration 666 mg n l inhibition was close to that predicted by simulation of additive and independent inhibition models within a salinity range of 4 14 6 ms cm and nitrite concentration range of 50 666 mg n l the combined inhibition was more severe than prediction p 0 05 based on the additive and independent inhibition models and therefore it was determined to be synergistic inhibition graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic ammonium oxidation

alleviate pressures on freshwater resources more and more coastal cities are using seawater to flush toilets which significantly increases the salinity of municipal sewage in the meantime the amount of saline wastewater produced from various processing industry activities e g pickling fisheries and tanneries lefebvre and moletta 2006 has also increased rapidly in the past decade currently more than 5 percent of global wastewater is hypersaline lefebvre and moletta 2006 the salt constituents in wastewater especially industrial wastewater are quite complicated the salt ions can be divided into two groups anions and cations the common and high concentration cations in wastewater include na k ca2 mg2 and the main anions in wastewater are cl so4 2 po4 3 no3 among them sodium and chloride ions na cl are the most common salts in most wastewaters the level of salinity is commonly represented by the concentration of sodium choloride g nacl l and the electricity conductivity ec ms cm the salinity of these wastewaters varies from 5 to 200 g nacl l which is equivalent to ec of 8 320 ms cm these high salinity wastewaters often contain high concentrations of nitrogen based pollutants ammonium nitrate or organic nitrogen which if poorly managed will result in eutrophication and deterioration of water quality ozturk and bal 2015 partial nitritation pn coupled to anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a cost efficient and environmentally friendly biological nitrogen removal method for wastewater treatment this biotechnology can significantly reduce the oxygen and organic carbon demand for nitrogen removal compared to the conventional biological nitrification denitrification process ali and okabe 2015 therefore it is particularly attractive for treatment of wastewater with low carbon to nitrogen ratio however anammox processes usually require long start up time and are very sensitive to wastewater characteristics and operational conditions e g ph tomaszewski et al 2017 temperature hu et al 2013 do zheng et al 2017 and substrate loading zhang et al 2016 the practical application of freshwater anammox bacteria fab for the treatment of saline wastewaters is challenged due to the inhibitory effect of high salinity although it has been demonstrated that low salinity 8 ms cm equivalent to 5 g nacl l does not harm fab liu et al 2008 elevated salinity 8 48 ms cm equivalent to 5 30 g nacl l has negative impact liu et al 2009 yang et al 2011 the extent of salinity depends on biomass species sludge aggregation type biofilm suspended sludge or granular sludge reactor type batch test continuous reactor and sbr system etc summarized in table 1 anammox activity of most fab decreases when salinity is higher than 32 ms cm 20 g nacl l carvajal arroyo et al 2013 dapena mora et al 2007 at salinity lower than 48 ms cm 30 g nacl l it has been observed that the inhibition from salinity is reversible ma et al 2012 it has been reported that the anammox activity of 91 day salt adapted fab increased from 54 9 to 78 6 of the original level when the salinity was altered from 48 ms cm back to 0 ms cm jin et al 2011 also nitrite no2 a substrate for anammox bacteria has been widely studied due to its strong negative effect on microbial activity compared to other salt ions in similar concentration such as na k cl no3 generally the individual inhibition threshold of nitrite the lowest concentration that poses an observable inhibitory effect varies from 100 to 300 mg n l jaroszynski et al 2012 vadivelu et al 2006 zhou et al 2011 lotti et al 2012 showed that the activity of granular fab decreases with increasing nitrite concentration through the range of 30 1000 mg n l as shown in table 2 most of the ic50 values for nitrite concentration which will result in 50 inhibition fall in the range of 150 600 mg n l the tolerance of anammox bacteria to nitrite also depends on the operational conditions it has been reported that nitrite inhibitory effect was enhanced when nitrite exposure took place in the absence of ammonium carvajal arroyo et al 2014a and by the application of ph values below 7 5 carvajal arroyo et al 2014b which may be because of the dramatic increase of free nitrous acid fna un ionized form of nitrite fernandez et al 2012 he et al 2016 in general fab attached on carriers biofilms have much higher nitrite salinity tolerance than suspended biomass biomass running in continuous operating reactor has higher nitrite salinity tolerance than batch test or sbr system even though the individual effects of salinity and nitrite have been investigated in many studies the reality is that both elevated salinity and high nitrite concentration could be present simultaneously especially in two stage pn anammox processes in addition elevated salinity decreases the anammox activity which leads to more nitrite present in the liquid media not consumed giustinianovich et al 2018 therefore the combined effect of these two factors needs to be understood before implementing the technology to treat saline wastewater the combined inhibition is generally characterized as one of four main types which can be described by four models respectively 1 independent inhibition 2 additive inhibition 3 synergistic inhibition and 4 antagonistic inhibition ding et al 2015 the former two models are non interaction inhibition models which are based on the assumption that the components do not interact with each other in contrast the other two models are interaction models whereby the components enhance or mitigate the effects of each other heys et al 2016 to date studies of the combined inhibition inhibition caused by multiple inhibition factors effect on anammox bacteria are rare to the best of our knowledge the effect of combined inhibition by salinity and nitrite on fab ca brocadia genus hasn t been reported the tolerance of fab to salinity and nitrite also varies greatly among different fab cultures therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate the combined inhibition effect of salinity and nitrite on a fab culture cultivated from a local wastewater treatment plant in australia the individual effects of salinity and nitrite were also studied as the baseline for comparison 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristic of inoculum the fab grew on k5 carriers a support plastic material in the real plant from anoxkaldnes sweden taken from in a 1500 l pilot scale one stage pn anammox moving bed bioreactor mbbr run by queensland urban utilities brisbane queensland australia detailed operation of this reactor was reported in hu et al 2015 external to this work the microbial community of the pilot reactor was routinely checked the fab community was shown to be stable fab accounted for about 20 of total microorganism on the k5 carrier more than 98 of fab was belonged to ca brocadia genera the influent to the mbbr was the liquor from the on site anaerobic digesters the pilot parent reactor operated at 1 day hydraulic retention time had been operated under steady state for more than 12 months with a nitrogen removal efficiency of 0 8 1 0 kg n m3 d the ratio of produced nitrate no3 n to removed ammonium nh4 n was generally below or equal to 0 1 more details are shown in table s1 and fig s1 2 2 batch experiment five sets of experiments namely a b c d and e including 57 batch assays were carried out chronologically the later set was designed based on the results of the previous set to ensure the data points representing a good distribution of the inhibition for modelling assays that greatly deviated from the general inhibition trend were triplicated to increase the accuracy the detailed experimental design can be found in table 3 each set contained 9 18 batch reactors serum bottles with 60 ml of working volume one reactor was always used as control no added salt and with an initial nitrite concentration of about 50 or150 mg n l and the rest were used as experimental reactors the anammox activity in each set was represented as percentages of the values measured in the control with this method the variability of biomass on different experimental days was eliminated in all batch tests the effluent of the parent mbbr was collected as inoculum media details are shown in table s1 and table s2 which had been pre filtered with 0 42 μm filters and deoxygenated by sparging with pure nitrogen gas according to the experimental design a nacl stock solution 40 g l made from inoculum media was used to achieve a salinity varying between ec of 4 30 ms cm equivalent to 2 5 to 18 8 nacl g l the ph in each reactor was adjusted to 7 2 7 4 by adding phosphate buffer 2 mm kh2po4 and 3 mm k2hpo4 to keep the ph within the range of 7 2 7 6 during the 24 h anaerobic tests the medium and headspace were deoxygenated again after which one biomass carrier was put into the batch reactor the reactor was then sealed with the rubber lid and alumina cap immediately then the nitrite nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and inorganic carbon were provided by adding nano2 solution 10 g n l and nh4hco3 2 g n l respectively resulting in initial concentrations of nitrite varying between 50 and 950 mg n l with ammonium concentration fixed at 90 110 mg n l at the beginning of each test the volume of liquid phase including all the medium mentioned above was 40 ml which resulted in a gas phase volume of 20 ml in each reactor the batch reactors were placed in a shaking incubator premiere thz 82 china at 35 1 c and 100 10 rpm each batch test lasted for 24 h and the activity within the first 6 h was used to determine the anammox activity under different conditions the gas pressure of each reactor was tested at time 0 2 4 6 9 12 24 h by using a gas pressure meter liquid samples were taken at time 0 and 6 h for the analysis of ammonium nitrite and nitrate the total solids ts and volatile solids vs on each carrier in the reactor were measured at the end of each batch test 2 3 methods for determination of anammox activity and chemical analysis 2 3 1 anammox activity the specific anammox activity saa g n g vs day based on data of the first 6 h of reaction was used to describe anammox activity as shown in eq 1 strous et al 1998 anammox activity can be described according to i the n2 production assumed to be equal to gas production ii ammonium consumption and iii nitrite consumption hence saa can be expressed by three calculation methods as saa n2 saa nh4 saa no2 correspondingly calculated by eq 2 1 through to eq 2 3 1 nh 4 1 32 no 2 0 066 hco 3 0 13 h 1 02 n

raa nh4 and raa no2 and the inhibitory concentration ic were calculated by eq 3 and eq 4 respectively 3 r a a s a a i s a a 0 100 4 i c 100 r a a where saai is the saa value for each experimental test in each set and saa0 is the saa value of the corresponding control 2 3 2 chemical analysis the ammonium nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n and orthophosphate po4 3 p concentrations were analyzed using a lachat quikchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin salinity and ph of medium were tested directly with a portable ec meter eutech instruments ph5 singapore and ph meter eutech instruments cond6 singapore respectively gas pressure was tested with a gas pressure meter sper scientific 840 065 the usa after batch test the biomass attached to each carrier was dried at 105 c for 24 h and peeled from the carrier then ts and vs were analyzed by the standard methods apha 1995 2 4 inhibition model 2 4 1 individual inhibition hill model a hill inhibition model which is an empirical model to describe biological inhibition claros et al 2010 was adopted to describe the individual inhibition effects of salinity and nitrite given no substrate shortage under all experimental conditions within 6 h reaction time the hill inhibition model can be presented as eq 5 5 r a a r a a max k i n k i n i n where raamax is the maximum raa of the control test in each set i represents the concentration of the studied inhibitors i e ms cm for salinity and mg n l for nitrite ki is the inhibition constant and is equal to the value of ic50 the unit of ki is ms cm for salinity and mg n l for nitrite 2 4 2 combined inhibition four combined inhibition models namely independent inhibition additive inhibition synergistic inhibition and antagonistic inhibition are used to analyse the combined inhibition by salinity and nitrite they are listed as follows 1 independent inhibition independent inhibition is based on the assumption that the two or more inhibitors affect activity by different inhibitory mechanism bliss 1939 cedergreen 2014 and can be expressed by eq 6 1 6 1 r a a i n d e p e n d e n t r a a n i t r i t e r a a s a l i n i t y where raanitrite and raasalinity are the corresponding raa under individual nitrite and salinity inhibition respectively 2 additive inhibition additive inhibition is based on the assumption that two or more inhibitors affect activity by a similar inhibitory mechanism bliss 1939 and generally provides a higher predicted inhibition than the independent inhibition model belden et al 2007 additive inhibition can be expressed by eq 6 2 6 2 r a a a d d i t i v e 100 100 r a a n i t r i t e 100 r a a s a l i n i t y 3 synergistic inhibition synergistic inhibition also called potentiated inhibition or cocktail effects means the mix effect of two inhibitors or more is greater than the additive effect heys et al 2016 as shown as eq 6 3 6 3 r a a s y n e r g i s t i c r a a a d d i t i v e 4 antagonistic inhibition antagonistic inhibition refers to the mix effect of two inhibitors or more being less than the predicted value assuming addition inhibition or independent inhibition heys et al 2016 as shown as eq 6 4 6 4 r a a a n t a g o n i s t i c r a a a d d i t i v e o r r a a i n d e p e n d e n t here the deviation between the experimental data and expected data from model simulation is expressed as a deviation rate dr dr is defined as eq 7 7 d r r a a m o d e l r a a o b s e r v e d 100 it should be noted that since nano2 was used for substrate of anammox the elevated nitrite concentration also affects the salinity therefore ec was used to represent the total salinity level of the medium in the inhibition model 3 results 3 1 anammox activity the transformation of inorganic nitrogen in both liquid and gas phase in the control reactor of set a and the estimated saa based on three independent methods are presented in fig 1 a and b as shown in fig 1 a after 6 h reaction the nitrite concentration was close to 0 mg l and the gas pressure plateaued during the whole process the nitrogen mass balance was closed and the saa quantified based on the nitrogen gas ammonium and nitrite consumption was 0 650 0 301 and 0 393 g n gvs d respectively fig 1 b the ratio of n2 n nh4 n no2 n 2 16 1 1 31 was consistent with the theoretical ratio 2 04 1 1 32 for anammox activity these experimental results demonstrated that the variation of gas pressure and soluble inorganic nitrogen were attributed to the anammox activity to simplify raa nh4 represented anammox activity here 3 2 individual effect of salinity with salinity shock only the saa calculated in three ways as saa n2 saa nh4 and saa no2 decreased with increased salinity from 6 4 to 30 ms cm equivalent to 4 0 18 8 g nacl l an ec level of 9 ms cm equivalent to 5 6 g nacl l resulted in 20 activity loss the activity of fab was completely inhibited concentration at which there is no detectable anammox activity at the salinity of 24 ms cm equivalent to 15 g nacl l the hill inhibition model analysis based on raa nh4 data fig 2 a indicated the ic50 of the individual salinity inhibition was 14 6 ms cm equivalent to 9 3 g nacl l r2 0 901 the variation of molar ratio between consumed nitrite and ammonium r niam and molar ratio between nitrate generation and ammonium consumption r naam along with the salinity change is shown in fig 2 b without salinity shock r niam and r naam were 1 30 and 0 25 respectively which were very close to the theoretical ratio of 1 32 and 0 26 presented in eq 1 strous et al 1998 however under salinity shock both r niam and r naam diverged from theoretical values the average values of r niam and r naam were 1 31 0 16 and 0 15 0 13 when ec 8 5 ms cm equivalent to 5 g nacl l when salinity was above 15 ms cm equivalent to 9 4 g nacl l most r naam values were lower than 0 26 which means less nitrate was produced in contrast r niam didn t show a clear trend with increased salinity these two ratios can reflect the response of metabolic processes of fab under inhibited conditions and will be further discussed in the discussion session 3 3 individual effect of nitrite as shown in fig 3 a anammox activity was not affected when nitrite concentration was below 450 mg n l above the threshold nitrite level saa started to decrease with increased nitrite concentration in summary 610 mg n l nitrite can lead to around 40 activity loss 900 mg n l causes more than 85 loss of activity ic50 for the individual nitrite inhibition was 666 mg n l r2 0 791 based on the hill model analysis with the data of raa nh4 when the nitrite concentration from 450 mg n l to 700 mg n l the average r niam significantly p 0 05 increased to 1 7 0 3 fig 3 b while the average value of r naam 0 31 0 16 under high nitrite concentration was comparable to the value obtained under non inhibited condition this means that under elevated nitrite concentration more nitrite was required for same amount of ammonia consumption more nitrite accumulated inside cell or denitrification happened 3 4 combined effect of nitrite and salinity as shown in fig 4 for the combined inhibition effect of salinity and nitrite on fab the more salt nacl and nitrite that were added to the system the more severe the inhibition an initial nitrite concentration of 300 mg n l resulted in more than 20 raa reduction with 5 g l nacl addition equivalent to salinity of 13 7 ms cm but the same nitrite level has no inhibitory effect when salt addition was 0 or 2 5 g l salinity lower than 9 ms cm hill model analysis indicated that the ic50 for nitrite decreased from 666 mg n l to 605 462 404 and 163 mg n l in accordance with the increased nacl addition from 0 to 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 g l equivalent to ec level of 7 11 14 17 and 21 ms cm the results show that elevated salinity enhances inhibition from nitrite which suggests the combined inhibition was highly likely synergistic fig 5 a and b showed the variation of r niam and r naam along with the increased nitrite concentration under different nacl addition in general most of the r niam values were higher than the theoretical value 1 32 this means more nitrite was required when the same amount of ammonium was consumed at the same level of nitrite r niam value increased with increased nacl addition when it s lower than 7 5 g nacl l adding under 10 g nacl l addition at the same level of nitrite the r niam value was lower than those under the 5 and 7 5 g nacl l adding in contrast most of the r naam values were lower than the theoretical values 0 26 under the same nitrite level the higher the salinity the larger the deviations of the r naam values from the theoretical value it should be noted that under the combined effect of nitrite and salinity most of the values of r naam were actually negative which means nitrate consumption was greater than its generation in other words denitrification may likely happened under these conditions due to the available carbon source from increased cell lysis or breakdown of macro organics zhang et al 2015 to further understand the combined effect of these two factors the raw data was compared against predictions based on independent and additive inhibition models results are shown in fig 6 when both salinity and nitrite concentration were below their ic50 values 14 6 ms cm for salinity and 666 mg n l for nitrite the contour lines represented the same raa level in fig 6 a compared with the lines in fig 6 b and c moved significantly to the lower salinity and nitrite level this means the actual combined inhibition was more severe than independent inhibition and additive inhibition in the meantime all the experimental values of raa nh4 were significantly lower than those predicted by additive and independent inhibition models dr were 5 24 and 5 25 respectively for example under the 13 5 ms cm and 350 mg n l condition the actual raa was about 35 which was much lower than both of values predicted by independent inhibition 60 and additive inhibition model 58 this result also suggested the combined inhibition of nitrite and salinity was synergistic within this range of salinity and nitrite concentration however when salinity or nitrite concentration was higher than their ic50 level the position of contour lines in fig 6 a was more similar to fig 6 b than fig 6 c most of the raa nh4 values were higher than the predicted values of additive inhibition models dr 0 35 and closer to independent inhibition model dr 11 this means that at higher salinity or nitrite concentration the synergistic effect was alleviated and the combined inhibition was more likely to be independent 4 discussion 4 1 individual effect of salinity in terms of the effect of salinity different fab species and the structure of the biomass e g suspended vs granular show very different performance under elevated salinity condition shown in table 1 the fab culture gerera of ca brocadia investigated in this study has been reported with relatively low salinity tolerance among the fab genera carvajal arroyo et al 2013 for ca brocadia the ic50 in this study was found to be 14 6 ms cm equivalent to 9 1 g nacl l which was comparable to the results with ic50 of 8 6 ms cm equivalent to 6 1 g nacl l reported by scaglione et al 2017 and carvajal arroyo et al 2013 the salinity inhibition on cells is commonly explained to be the dehydration effect due to the high osmotic pressure which lead to activity loss of enzymes because of salt out effect wang et al 2016a it has been reported that anammox bacteria can accumulate either k or compatible solutes to keep osmotic equilibrium in the cell under high salinity speth et al 2017 in this study under salinity shock the ratio of nitrite to ammonium consumption r niam did not show a clear trend while the ratio of nitrate generation to ammonium consumption r naam was significantly lower than the control this means that increasing salinity resulted in less nitrate being produced nitrate is produced from nitrite to generate reducing equivalents for co2 fixation in anammox cells which means nitrate production can be used as an indicator of anammox growth van de graaf et al 1996 therefore the reduced r naam under elevated salinity indicated that the biomass growth was likely inhibited strous et al 1998 these strongly indicate that to survive in high salinity environment fab cells distribute more energy for protection process and less energy for positive transport of substrates pump out of other toxic ion e g nitrite as well as biomass growth 4 2 individual effect of nitrite for nitrite inhibition the threshold and ic50 for the fab were found to be around 450 and 666 mg n l respectively both of the values are much higher than most of the reported values listed in table 2 this may be because the studied fab was enriched under high ammonium and nitrite loading side stream treatment system under such an enrichment condition the studied fab culture tended to have lower substrate affinity and higher ammonium and nitrite tolerance oshiki et al 2011 2016 in addition aerobic bacteria as well as macro organic material located at the outer layer can play a protection role for the inner fab cells carvajal arroyo et al 2013 fernandez et al 2012 specifically the studied fab has a relatively high anammox activity which means high nitrite consumption rate while low transport rate of the nitrite thus nitrite concentration inside of the cell could maintain at a low level the ratio of nitrite to ammonium consumption r niam under high nitrite concentration was significantly higher than the theoretical value which was similar to the results in lotti et al 2012 s batch test the increased r niam was likely due to two reasons the first is higher nitrite concentration sped up the transport rate of nitrite both no2 ion and fna in the biofilm reactor rittmann and mccarty 1980 therefore more nitrite was accumulated inside of the cell under the same ammonium concentration this also resulted in more inhibition to the functions including enzyme activity baumann et al 1997 yang 1985 gene expression wang et al 2017 positive transport rowe et al 1979 and atp production mortensen et al 2008 sijbesma et al 1996 of the cell the other reason is the increased fna led to higher cell lysis and the break down of macro organics e g extracellular polymeric substances eps which had protective function zhang et al 2015 which provided available cod for denitrification to happen resulting in the increase of r niam thus r niam can be used as an indicator for nitrite inhibition 4 3 combined effect of nitrite and salinity in this study the type of the combined inhibition of salinity and nitrite varied on the level of these two factors when both salinity and nitrite levels were elevated but less than their ic50 values the combined inhibition was synergistic this is in line with the r niam results that when nacl concentration increased from 2 5 to 7 5 g nacl l ec 8 to 17 ms cm r niam value increased under the same level of nitrite concentration which indicated more nitrite accumulation inside of the cell this synergistic inhibition under elevated salinity and nitrite is likely due to the increased accumulation of nitrite inside of the cell nitrite accumulation in the fab cell depends on the transportation of nitrite from outside of cell the capacity to pump out of nitrite and the consumption of nitrite firstly under the elevated nitrite condition the fna diffusion is higher which results in a higher nitrite transportation from outside to inside of the cell secondly higher salinity slows down catabolic process so less energy can be used to pump out nitrite thirdly the nitrite consumption rate is directly affected by the bioavailability of ammonium in the cell high salinity causes lower transport rate of ammonium due to competition for energy and transporter this is because fab tends to use more energy for protection processes and less energy for cellular transport systems pflüger et al 2007 and ammonium shares the transporter with na k and cl good 1994 kleiner 1985 sperelakis 2012 in addition higher nitrite concentration also has negative impact on the active transport system rowe et al 1979 and leads to less bioavailability of ammonium in turn causes less nitrite consumption therefore these three conditions resulted in the increased accumulation of nitrite inside cell which directly resulted more severe inhibition however when either the salinity or nitrite concentration was higher than its ic50 level 14 6 ms cm and 666 mg n l respectively the synergistic effect was mitigated due to the increased ionic strength under higher salinity the phenomenon of salt in may increase the ionized form of nitrite and thereby reduce fna on the other hand increasing nacl concentration was found to decrease the self diffusion of lipids within the bilayer böckmann et al 2003 which also decrease the fna inside cell the decreased negative effect of fna may explain this mitigation of synergistic effect when both ec and nitrite were higher their ic50 level 4 4 implication to the operation of saline wastewater treatment using fab the salinity of wastewater varies among different industries and even at different times from the same industrial process cristóvão et al 2016 reported that the salinity of a fishery canning wastewater collected at different times varied from 0 8 to 43 ms cm according to this study the inhibitory effect of salinity and nitrite was enhanced by each other when both of them are present within a certain range salinity of 4 14 6 ms cm nitrite concentration of 50 666 mg n l with the fluctuation of salinity fab activity decreases which may result in nitrite accumulation and further deterioration of the performance hence during the acclimation process of fab to high salinity or normal operation with salinity fluctuation the concentration of nitrite in the reactor especially in two stage pn anammox process should be maintained in a relatively low concentration to avoid synergistic inhibition by using continuous or semi continuous feeding strategies the threshold of nitrite concentration will vary with different fab cultures due to different nitrite and salinity tolerance it should also be pointed out that this study only considers one specific type of salt nacl the type of salt ion e g k ca2 mg2 po4 3 so4 2 might also alter the inhibition trend threshold and ic50 value also if salt adapted fab has higher nitrite tolerance will need further investigation 5 conclusion this study focuses on the individual and combined inhibition of salinity and nitrite on fab compared with reported fab the studied anammox biomass has a relatively low tolerance to salinity threshold 6 4 ms cm ic50 14 6 ms cm but a high tolerance to nitrite threshold 450 mg n l ic50 666 mg n l within a salinity range of 4 14 6 ms cm and nitrite concentration range of 50 666 mg n l the combined inhibition was more severe than prediction p 0 05 based on the additive and independent inhibition models and so determined to be synergistic inhibition this suggests that for successful application of fab in high salinity wastewater treatment it is essential to consider the level of nitrite concentration especially in two stage pn anammox

18323,anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox based technology has potential for nitrogen removal from wastewater with high salinity but both salt and nitrite a substrate for anammox have negative effect on microbial activity in order to achieve anammox in saline wastewater treatment it is essential to understand the combined effect of these two components in this study the individual and combined effect of salinity and nitrite on fixed film freshwater anammox bacteria fab mainly belonging to the ca brocadia genus enriched on carriers from a 1500 l pilot scale one stage pn anammox moving bed bioreactor mbbr were systematically investigated by 57 pre designed batch tests the combined inhibition of nitrite and salinity was determined by comparing with additive and independent inhibition models with salinity only the specific anammox activity saa decreased with increasing salinity 14 6 ms cm about 9 1 g nacl l of salinity caused 50 inhibition ic50 with nitrite only saa started to decrease when nitrite concentration was above 450 mg n l threshold and decreased with increased nitrite ic50 666 mg n l thereafter significantly when both salinity and nitrite were elevated both the threshold and ic50 of nitrite were reduced with inhibition enhanced analysis showed that at high salinity 14 6 ms cm and nitrite concentration 666 mg n l inhibition was close to that predicted by simulation of additive and independent inhibition models within a salinity range of 4 14 6 ms cm and nitrite concentration range of 50 666 mg n l the combined inhibition was more severe than prediction p 0 05 based on the additive and independent inhibition models and therefore it was determined to be synergistic inhibition graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic ammonium oxidation

alleviate pressures on freshwater resources more and more coastal cities are using seawater to flush toilets which significantly increases the salinity of municipal sewage in the meantime the amount of saline wastewater produced from various processing industry activities e g pickling fisheries and tanneries lefebvre and moletta 2006 has also increased rapidly in the past decade currently more than 5 percent of global wastewater is hypersaline lefebvre and moletta 2006 the salt constituents in wastewater especially industrial wastewater are quite complicated the salt ions can be divided into two groups anions and cations the common and high concentration cations in wastewater include na k ca2 mg2 and the main anions in wastewater are cl so4 2 po4 3 no3 among them sodium and chloride ions na cl are the most common salts in most wastewaters the level of salinity is commonly represented by the concentration of sodium choloride g nacl l and the electricity conductivity ec ms cm the salinity of these wastewaters varies from 5 to 200 g nacl l which is equivalent to ec of 8 320 ms cm these high salinity wastewaters often contain high concentrations of nitrogen based pollutants ammonium nitrate or organic nitrogen which if poorly managed will result in eutrophication and deterioration of water quality ozturk and bal 2015 partial nitritation pn coupled to anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a cost efficient and environmentally friendly biological nitrogen removal method for wastewater treatment this biotechnology can significantly reduce the oxygen and organic carbon demand for nitrogen removal compared to the conventional biological nitrification denitrification process ali and okabe 2015 therefore it is particularly attractive for treatment of wastewater with low carbon to nitrogen ratio however anammox processes usually require long start up time and are very sensitive to wastewater characteristics and operational conditions e g ph tomaszewski et al 2017 temperature hu et al 2013 do zheng et al 2017 and substrate loading zhang et al 2016 the practical application of freshwater anammox bacteria fab for the treatment of saline wastewaters is challenged due to the inhibitory effect of high salinity although it has been demonstrated that low salinity 8 ms cm equivalent to 5 g nacl l does not harm fab liu et al 2008 elevated salinity 8 48 ms cm equivalent to 5 30 g nacl l has negative impact liu et al 2009 yang et al 2011 the extent of salinity depends on biomass species sludge aggregation type biofilm suspended sludge or granular sludge reactor type batch test continuous reactor and sbr system etc summarized in table 1 anammox activity of most fab decreases when salinity is higher than 32 ms cm 20 g nacl l carvajal arroyo et al 2013 dapena mora et al 2007 at salinity lower than 48 ms cm 30 g nacl l it has been observed that the inhibition from salinity is reversible ma et al 2012 it has been reported that the anammox activity of 91 day salt adapted fab increased from 54 9 to 78 6 of the original level when the salinity was altered from 48 ms cm back to 0 ms cm jin et al 2011 also nitrite no2 a substrate for anammox bacteria has been widely studied due to its strong negative effect on microbial activity compared to other salt ions in similar concentration such as na k cl no3 generally the individual inhibition threshold of nitrite the lowest concentration that poses an observable inhibitory effect varies from 100 to 300 mg n l jaroszynski et al 2012 vadivelu et al 2006 zhou et al 2011 lotti et al 2012 showed that the activity of granular fab decreases with increasing nitrite concentration through the range of 30 1000 mg n l as shown in table 2 most of the ic50 values for nitrite concentration which will result in 50 inhibition fall in the range of 150 600 mg n l the tolerance of anammox bacteria to nitrite also depends on the operational conditions it has been reported that nitrite inhibitory effect was enhanced when nitrite exposure took place in the absence of ammonium carvajal arroyo et al 2014a and by the application of ph values below 7 5 carvajal arroyo et al 2014b which may be because of the dramatic increase of free nitrous acid fna un ionized form of nitrite fernandez et al 2012 he et al 2016 in general fab attached on carriers biofilms have much higher nitrite salinity tolerance than suspended biomass biomass running in continuous operating reactor has higher nitrite salinity tolerance than batch test or sbr system even though the individual effects of salinity and nitrite have been investigated in many studies the reality is that both elevated salinity and high nitrite concentration could be present simultaneously especially in two stage pn anammox processes in addition elevated salinity decreases the anammox activity which leads to more nitrite present in the liquid media not consumed giustinianovich et al 2018 therefore the combined effect of these two factors needs to be understood before implementing the technology to treat saline wastewater the combined inhibition is generally characterized as one of four main types which can be described by four models respectively 1 independent inhibition 2 additive inhibition 3 synergistic inhibition and 4 antagonistic inhibition ding et al 2015 the former two models are non interaction inhibition models which are based on the assumption that the components do not interact with each other in contrast the other two models are interaction models whereby the components enhance or mitigate the effects of each other heys et al 2016 to date studies of the combined inhibition inhibition caused by multiple inhibition factors effect on anammox bacteria are rare to the best of our knowledge the effect of combined inhibition by salinity and nitrite on fab ca brocadia genus hasn t been reported the tolerance of fab to salinity and nitrite also varies greatly among different fab cultures therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate the combined inhibition effect of salinity and nitrite on a fab culture cultivated from a local wastewater treatment plant in australia the individual effects of salinity and nitrite were also studied as the baseline for comparison 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristic of inoculum the fab grew on k5 carriers a support plastic material in the real plant from anoxkaldnes sweden taken from in a 1500 l pilot scale one stage pn anammox moving bed bioreactor mbbr run by queensland urban utilities brisbane queensland australia detailed operation of this reactor was reported in hu et al 2015 external to this work the microbial community of the pilot reactor was routinely checked the fab community was shown to be stable fab accounted for about 20 of total microorganism on the k5 carrier more than 98 of fab was belonged to ca brocadia genera the influent to the mbbr was the liquor from the on site anaerobic digesters the pilot parent reactor operated at 1 day hydraulic retention time had been operated under steady state for more than 12 months with a nitrogen removal efficiency of 0 8 1 0 kg n m3 d the ratio of produced nitrate no3 n to removed ammonium nh4 n was generally below or equal to 0 1 more details are shown in table s1 and fig s1 2 2 batch experiment five sets of experiments namely a b c d and e including 57 batch assays were carried out chronologically the later set was designed based on the results of the previous set to ensure the data points representing a good distribution of the inhibition for modelling assays that greatly deviated from the general inhibition trend were triplicated to increase the accuracy the detailed experimental design can be found in table 3 each set contained 9 18 batch reactors serum bottles with 60 ml of working volume one reactor was always used as control no added salt and with an initial nitrite concentration of about 50 or150 mg n l and the rest were used as experimental reactors the anammox activity in each set was represented as percentages of the values measured in the control with this method the variability of biomass on different experimental days was eliminated in all batch tests the effluent of the parent mbbr was collected as inoculum media details are shown in table s1 and table s2 which had been pre filtered with 0 42 μm filters and deoxygenated by sparging with pure nitrogen gas according to the experimental design a nacl stock solution 40 g l made from inoculum media was used to achieve a salinity varying between ec of 4 30 ms cm equivalent to 2 5 to 18 8 nacl g l the ph in each reactor was adjusted to 7 2 7 4 by adding phosphate buffer 2 mm kh2po4 and 3 mm k2hpo4 to keep the ph within the range of 7 2 7 6 during the 24 h anaerobic tests the medium and headspace were deoxygenated again after which one biomass carrier was put into the batch reactor the reactor was then sealed with the rubber lid and alumina cap immediately then the nitrite nitrogen ammonium nitrogen and inorganic carbon were provided by adding nano2 solution 10 g n l and nh4hco3 2 g n l respectively resulting in initial concentrations of nitrite varying between 50 and 950 mg n l with ammonium concentration fixed at 90 110 mg n l at the beginning of each test the volume of liquid phase including all the medium mentioned above was 40 ml which resulted in a gas phase volume of 20 ml in each reactor the batch reactors were placed in a shaking incubator premiere thz 82 china at 35 1 c and 100 10 rpm each batch test lasted for 24 h and the activity within the first 6 h was used to determine the anammox activity under different conditions the gas pressure of each reactor was tested at time 0 2 4 6 9 12 24 h by using a gas pressure meter liquid samples were taken at time 0 and 6 h for the analysis of ammonium nitrite and nitrate the total solids ts and volatile solids vs on each carrier in the reactor were measured at the end of each batch test 2 3 methods for determination of anammox activity and chemical analysis 2 3 1 anammox activity the specific anammox activity saa g n g vs day based on data of the first 6 h of reaction was used to describe anammox activity as shown in eq 1 strous et al 1998 anammox activity can be described according to i the n2 production assumed to be equal to gas production ii ammonium consumption and iii nitrite consumption hence saa can be expressed by three calculation methods as saa n2 saa nh4 saa no2 correspondingly calculated by eq 2 1 through to eq 2 3 1 nh 4 1 32 no 2 0 066 hco 3 0 13 h 1 02 n

the change in concentration of ammonium and nitrite over the first 6 h respectively vl is the volume of the liquid phase in the batch reactor 0 04 l relative anammox activity raa referred to raa n2 raa nh4 and raa no2 and the inhibitory concentration ic were calculated by eq 3 and eq 4 respectively 3 r a a s a a i s a a 0 100 4 i c 100 r a a where saai is the saa value for each experimental test in each set and saa0 is the saa value of the corresponding control 2 3 2 chemical analysis the ammonium nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n and orthophosphate po4 3 p concentrations were analyzed using a lachat quikchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin salinity and ph of medium were tested directly with a portable ec meter eutech instruments ph5 singapore and ph meter eutech instruments cond6 singapore respectively gas pressure was tested with a gas pressure meter sper scientific 840 065 the usa after batch test the biomass attached to each carrier was dried at 105 c for 24 h and peeled from the carrier then ts and vs were analyzed by the standard methods apha 1995 2 4 inhibition model 2 4 1 individual inhibition hill model a hill inhibition model which is an empirical model to describe biological inhibition claros et al 2010 was adopted to describe the individual inhibition effects of salinity and nitrite given no substrate shortage under all experimental conditions within 6 h reaction time the hill inhibition model can be presented as eq 5 5 r a a r a a max k i n k i n i n where raamax is the maximum raa of the control test in each set i represents the concentration of the studied inhibitors i e ms cm for salinity and mg n l for nitrite ki is the inhibition constant and is equal to the value of ic50 the unit of ki is ms cm for salinity and mg n l for nitrite 2 4 2 combined inhibition four combined inhibition models namely independent inhibition additive inhibition synergistic inhibition and antagonistic inhibition are used to analyse the combined inhibition by salinity and nitrite they are listed as follows 1 independent inhibition independent inhibition is based on the assumption that the two or more inhibitors affect activity by different inhibitory mechanism bliss 1939 cedergreen 2014 and can be expressed by eq 6 1 6 1 r a a i n d e p e n d e n t r a a n i t r i t e r a a s a l i n i t y where raanitrite and raasalinity are the corresponding raa under individual nitrite and salinity inhibition respectively 2 additive inhibition additive inhibition is based on the assumption that two or more inhibitors affect activity by a similar inhibitory mechanism bliss 1939 and generally provides a higher predicted inhibition than the independent inhibition model belden et al 2007 additive inhibition can be expressed by eq 6 2 6 2 r a a a d d i t i v e 100 100 r a a n i t r i t e 100 r a a s a l i n i t y 3 synergistic inhibition synergistic inhibition also called potentiated inhibition or cocktail effects means the mix effect of two inhibitors or more is greater than the additive effect heys et al 2016 as shown as eq 6 3 6 3 r a a s y n e r g i s t i c r a a a d d i t i v e 4 antagonistic inhibition antagonistic inhibition refers to the mix effect of two inhibitors or more being less than the predicted value assuming addition inhibition or independent inhibition heys et al 2016 as shown as eq 6 4 6 4 r a a a n t a g o n i s t i c r a a a d d i t i v e o r r a a i n d e p e n d e n t here the deviation between the experimental data and expected data from model simulation is expressed as a deviation rate dr dr is defined as eq 7 7 d r r a a m o d e l r a a o b s e r v e d 100 it should be noted that since nano2 was used for substrate of anammox the elevated nitrite concentration also affects the salinity therefore ec was used to represent the total salinity level of the medium in the inhibition model 3 results 3 1 anammox activity the transformation of inorganic nitrogen in both liquid and gas phase in the control reactor of set a and the estimated saa based on three independent methods are presented in fig 1 a and b as shown in fig 1 a after 6 h reaction the nitrite concentration was close to 0 mg l and the gas pressure plateaued during the whole process the nitrogen mass balance was closed and the saa quantified based on the nitrogen gas ammonium and nitrite consumption was 0 650 0 301 and 0 393 g n gvs d respectively fig 1 b the ratio of n2 n nh4 n no2 n 2 16 1 1 31 was consistent with the theoretical ratio 2 04 1 1 32 for anammox activity these experimental results demonstrated that the variation of gas pressure and soluble inorganic nitrogen were attributed to the anammox activity to simplify raa nh4 represented anammox activity here 3 2 individual effect of salinity with salinity shock only the saa calculated in three ways as saa n2 saa nh4 and saa no2 decreased with increased salinity from 6 4 to 30 ms cm equivalent to 4 0 18 8 g nacl l an ec level of 9 ms cm equivalent to 5 6 g nacl l resulted in 20 activity loss the activity of fab was completely inhibited concentration at which there is no detectable anammox activity at the salinity of 24 ms cm equivalent to 15 g nacl l the hill inhibition model analysis based on raa nh4 data fig 2 a indicated the ic50 of the individual salinity inhibition was 14 6 ms cm equivalent to 9 3 g nacl l r2 0 901 the variation of molar ratio between consumed nitrite and ammonium r niam and molar ratio between nitrate generation and ammonium consumption r naam along with the salinity change is shown in fig 2 b without salinity shock r niam and r naam were 1 30 and 0 25 respectively which were very close to the theoretical ratio of 1 32 and 0 26 presented in eq 1 strous et al 1998 however under salinity shock both r niam and r naam diverged from theoretical values the average values of r niam and r naam were 1 31 0 16 and 0 15 0 13 when ec 8 5 ms cm equivalent to 5 g nacl l when salinity was above 15 ms cm equivalent to 9 4 g nacl l most r naam values were lower than 0 26 which means less nitrate was produced in contrast r niam didn t show a clear trend with increased salinity these two ratios can reflect the response of metabolic processes of fab under inhibited conditions and will be further discussed in the discussion session 3 3 individual effect of nitrite as shown in fig 3 a anammox activity was not affected when nitrite concentration was below 450 mg n l above the threshold nitrite level saa started to decrease with increased nitrite concentration in summary 610 mg n l nitrite can lead to around 40 activity loss 900 mg n l causes more than 85 loss of activity ic50 for the individual nitrite inhibition was 666 mg n l r2 0 791 based on the hill model analysis with the data of raa nh4 when the nitrite concentration from 450 mg n l to 700 mg n l the average r niam significantly p 0 05 increased to 1 7 0 3 fig 3 b while the average value of r naam 0 31 0 16 under high nitrite concentration was comparable to the value obtained under non inhibited condition this means that under elevated nitrite concentration more nitrite was required for same amount of ammonia consumption more nitrite accumulated inside cell or denitrification happened 3 4 combined effect of nitrite and salinity as shown in fig 4 for the combined inhibition effect of salinity and nitrite on fab the more salt nacl and nitrite that were added to the system the more severe the inhibition an initial nitrite concentration of 300 mg n l resulted in more than 20 raa reduction with 5 g l nacl addition equivalent to salinity of 13 7 ms cm but the same nitrite level has no inhibitory effect when salt addition was 0 or 2 5 g l salinity lower than 9 ms cm hill model analysis indicated that the ic50 for nitrite decreased from 666 mg n l to 605 462 404 and 163 mg n l in accordance with the increased nacl addition from 0 to 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 g l equivalent to ec level of 7 11 14 17 and 21 ms cm the results show that elevated salinity enhances inhibition from nitrite which suggests the combined inhibition was highly likely synergistic fig 5 a and b showed the variation of r niam and r naam along with the increased nitrite concentration under different nacl addition in general most of the r niam values were higher than the theoretical value 1 32 this means more nitrite was required when the same amount of ammonium was consumed at the same level of nitrite r niam value increased with increased nacl addition when it s lower than 7 5 g nacl l adding under 10 g nacl l addition at the same level of nitrite the r niam value was lower than those under the 5 and 7 5 g nacl l adding in contrast most of the r naam values were lower than the theoretical values 0 26 under the same nitrite level the higher the salinity the larger the deviations of the r naam values from the theoretical value it should be noted that under the combined effect of nitrite and salinity most of the values of r naam were actually negative which means nitrate consumption was greater than its generation in other words denitrification may likely happened under these conditions due to the available carbon source from increased cell lysis or breakdown of macro organics zhang et al 2015 to further understand the combined effect of these two factors the raw data was compared against predictions based on independent and additive inhibition models results are shown in fig 6 when both salinity and nitrite concentration were below their ic50 values 14 6 ms cm for salinity and 666 mg n l for nitrite the contour lines represented the same raa level in fig 6 a compared with the lines in fig 6 b and c moved significantly to the lower salinity and nitrite level this means the actual combined inhibition was more severe than independent inhibition and additive inhibition in the meantime all the experimental values of raa nh4 were significantly lower than those predicted by additive and independent inhibition models dr were 5 24 and 5 25 respectively for example under the 13 5 ms cm and 350 mg n l condition the actual raa was about 35 which was much lower than both of values predicted by independent inhibition 60 and additive inhibition model 58 this result also suggested the combined inhibition of nitrite and salinity was synergistic within this range of salinity and nitrite concentration however when salinity or nitrite concentration was higher than their ic50 level the position of contour lines in fig 6 a was more similar to fig 6 b than fig 6 c most of the raa nh4 values were higher than the predicted values of additive inhibition models dr 0 35 and closer to independent inhibition model dr 11 this means that at higher salinity or nitrite concentration the synergistic effect was alleviated and the combined inhibition was more likely to be independent 4 discussion 4 1 individual effect of salinity in terms of the effect of salinity different fab species and the structure of the biomass e g suspended vs granular show very different performance under elevated salinity condition shown in table 1 the fab culture gerera of ca brocadia investigated in this study has been reported with relatively low salinity tolerance among the fab genera carvajal arroyo et al 2013 for ca brocadia the ic50 in this study was found to be 14 6 ms cm equivalent to 9 1 g nacl l which was comparable to the results with ic50 of 8 6 ms cm equivalent to 6 1 g nacl l reported by scaglione et al 2017 and carvajal arroyo et al 2013 the salinity inhibition on cells is commonly explained to be the dehydration effect due to the high osmotic pressure which lead to activity loss of enzymes because of salt out effect wang et al 2016a it has been reported that anammox bacteria can accumulate either k or compatible solutes to keep osmotic equilibrium in the cell under high salinity speth et al 2017 in this study under salinity shock the ratio of nitrite to ammonium consumption r niam did not show a clear trend while the ratio of nitrate generation to ammonium consumption r naam was significantly lower than the control this means that increasing salinity resulted in less nitrate being produced nitrate is produced from nitrite to generate reducing equivalents for co2 fixation in anammox cells which means nitrate production can be used as an indicator of anammox growth van de graaf et al 1996 therefore the reduced r naam under elevated salinity indicated that the biomass growth was likely inhibited strous et al 1998 these strongly indicate that to survive in high salinity environment fab cells distribute more energy for protection process and less energy for positive transport of substrates pump out of other toxic ion e g nitrite as well as biomass growth 4 2 individual effect of nitrite for nitrite inhibition the threshold and ic50 for the fab were found to be around 450 and 666 mg n l respectively both of the values are much higher than most of the reported values listed in table 2 this may be because the studied fab was enriched under high ammonium and nitrite loading side stream treatment system under such an enrichment condition the studied fab culture tended to have lower substrate affinity and higher ammonium and nitrite tolerance oshiki et al 2011 2016 in addition aerobic bacteria as well as macro organic material located at the outer layer can play a protection role for the inner fab cells carvajal arroyo et al 2013 fernandez et al 2012 specifically the studied fab has a relatively high anammox activity which means high nitrite consumption rate while low transport rate of the nitrite thus nitrite concentration inside of the cell could maintain at a low level the ratio of nitrite to ammonium consumption r niam under high nitrite concentration was significantly higher than the theoretical value which was similar to the results in lotti et al 2012 s batch test the increased r niam was likely due to two reasons the first is higher nitrite concentration sped up the transport rate of nitrite both no2 ion and fna in the biofilm reactor rittmann and mccarty 1980 therefore more nitrite was accumulated inside of the cell under the same ammonium concentration this also resulted in more inhibition to the functions including enzyme activity baumann et al 1997 yang 1985 gene expression wang et al 2017 positive transport rowe et al 1979 and atp production mortensen et al 2008 sijbesma et al 1996 of the cell the other reason is the increased fna led to higher cell lysis and the break down of macro organics e g extracellular polymeric substances eps which had protective function zhang et al 2015 which provided available cod for denitrification to happen resulting in the increase of r niam thus r niam can be used as an indicator for nitrite inhibition 4 3 combined effect of nitrite and salinity in this study the type of the combined inhibition of salinity and nitrite varied on the level of these two factors when both salinity and nitrite levels were elevated but less than their ic50 values the combined inhibition was synergistic this is in line with the r niam results that when nacl concentration increased from 2 5 to 7 5 g nacl l ec 8 to 17 ms cm r niam value increased under the same level of nitrite concentration which indicated more nitrite accumulation inside of the cell this synergistic inhibition under elevated salinity and nitrite is likely due to the increased accumulation of nitrite inside of the cell nitrite accumulation in the fab cell depends on the transportation of nitrite from outside of cell the capacity to pump out of nitrite and the consumption of nitrite firstly under the elevated nitrite condition the fna diffusion is higher which results in a higher nitrite transportation from outside to inside of the cell secondly higher salinity slows down catabolic process so less energy can be used to pump out nitrite thirdly the nitrite consumption rate is directly affected by the bioavailability of ammonium in the cell high salinity causes lower transport rate of ammonium due to competition for energy and transporter this is because fab tends to use more energy for protection processes and less energy for cellular transport systems pflüger et al 2007 and ammonium shares the transporter with na k and cl good 1994 kleiner 1985 sperelakis 2012 in addition higher nitrite concentration also has negative impact on the active transport system rowe et al 1979 and leads to less bioavailability of ammonium in turn causes less nitrite consumption therefore these three conditions resulted in the increased accumulation of nitrite inside cell which directly resulted more severe inhibition however when either the salinity or nitrite concentration was higher than its ic50 level 14 6 ms cm and 666 mg n l respectively the synergistic effect was mitigated due to the increased ionic strength under higher salinity the phenomenon of salt in may increase the ionized form of nitrite and thereby reduce fna on the other hand increasing nacl concentration was found to decrease the self diffusion of lipids within the bilayer böckmann et al 2003 which also decrease the fna inside cell the decreased negative effect of fna may explain this mitigation of synergistic effect when both ec and nitrite were higher their ic50 level 4 4 implication to the operation of saline wastewater treatment using fab the salinity of wastewater varies among different industries and even at different times from the same industrial process cristóvão et al 2016 reported that the salinity of a fishery canning wastewater collected at different times varied from 0 8 to 43 ms cm according to this study the inhibitory effect of salinity and nitrite was enhanced by each other when both of them are present within a certain range salinity of 4 14 6 ms cm nitrite concentration of 50 666 mg n l with the fluctuation of salinity fab activity decreases which may result in nitrite accumulation and further deterioration of the performance hence during the acclimation process of fab to high salinity or normal operation with salinity fluctuation the concentration of nitrite in the reactor especially in two stage pn anammox process should be maintained in a relatively low concentration to avoid synergistic inhibition by using continuous or semi continuous feeding strategies the threshold of nitrite concentration will vary with different fab cultures due to different nitrite and salinity tolerance it should also be pointed out that this study only considers one specific type of salt nacl the type of salt ion e g k ca2 mg2 po4 3 so4 2 might also alter the inhibition trend threshold and ic50 value also if salt adapted fab has higher nitrite tolerance will need further investigation 5 conclusion this study focuses on the individual and combined inhibition of salinity and nitrite on fab compared with reported fab the studied anammox biomass has a relatively low tolerance to salinity threshold 6 4 ms cm ic50 14 6 ms cm but a high tolerance to nitrite threshold 450 mg n l ic50 666 mg n l within a salinity range of 4 14 6 ms cm and nitrite concentration range of 50 666 mg n l the combined inhibition was more severe than prediction p 0 05 based on the additive and independent inhibition models and so determined to be synergistic inhibition this suggests that for successful application of fab in high salinity wastewater treatment it is essential to consider the level of nitrite concentration especially in two stage pn anammox

18324,phosphonates are an important type of phosphorus containing compounds and have possible eutrophication potential therefore the removal of phosphonates from waste streams is as important as orthophosphate herein we achieved simultaneously removal and recovery of phosphorus from nitrilotris methylene phosphonic acid ntmp using an electrochemical cell it was found that the c n and c p bonds of ntmp were cleaved at the anode leading to the formation of orthophosphate and formic acid meanwhile the converted orthophosphate reacted with coexisting calcium ions and precipitated on the cathode as recoverable calcium phosphate solids due to an electrochemically induced high ph region near the cathode electrochemical removal of ntmp 30 mg l was more efficient when dosed to effluent of a wastewater treatment plant 89 in 24 h than dosed to synthetic solutions of 1 0 mm ca and 50 mm na2so4 43 in 168 h while applying a current density of 28 a m2 and using a pt anode and ti cathode the higher removal efficiency of ntmp in real waste water is due to the presence of chloride ions which resulted in anodic formation of chlorine this study establishes a one step approach for simultaneously phosphorus removal and recovery of calcium phosphate from non orthophosphates graphical abstract image 1 keywords oxidation precipitation calcium phosphate organic phosphorus local high ph 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential element for all forms of life but its reserves are limited on our planet in particular modern agricultural industry depends heavily on using p fertilizer to secure food production for the increasing global population unfortunately phosphate reserves are projected to run out in a few hundred years cordell et al 2009 meanwhile the widespread use of p fertilizer and many other p products often result in a load of excess p in receiving water bodies causing eutrophication of such aquatic systems conley et al 2009 to sustain the use of p and guarantee food supply it is necessary to recover and reuse the p in waste streams elser and bennett 2011 mayer et al 2016 while there have been plenty of studies addressing p removal and recovery from wastewaters the focus was mainly on orthophosphate which can be relatively easily removed by enhanced biological phosphorus removal precipitation or adsorption oehmen et al 2007 desmidt et al 2015 ye et al 2017 however in terms of non orthophosphates we are not aware of any approaches which can achieve simultaneously p removal and recovery in a single step a recent review article pointed out that no technique currently has been implemented for the recovery of p from non orthophosphates venkiteshwaran et al 2018 however though the relative fractions of non orthophosphates are widely variable non orthophosphates can be one of the main p fractions in many aquatic ecosystems baldwin 2013 a recent survey in an eutrophic lake revealed the widespread presence of non orthophosphates brooker et al 2018 non orthophosphates are also detected in the remote marine environment at unexpectedly high concentrations mcdonough et al 2018 non orthophosphate compounds are typically characterized by the presence of c p bond in their molecular structures baldwin 2013 nowack 2003 unlike orthophosphate the reactivity of non orthophosphates is relatively low and is generally grouped as nonreactive phosphorus however in the last decade non orthophosphates were conceived as a potential bioavailable p dyhrman et al 2006 indeed when subjected to enzymatic degradation or photochemical conversion the bioavailability of non orthophosphates to plants microorganisms and algae may be enhanced substantially venkiteshwaran et al 2018 baldwin 2013 nowack 2003 zhang et al 2019 therefore non orthophosphates may be partly responsible for the eutrophication of water bodies nonetheless non orthophosphates are not targeted by the existing treatment process in wastewater treatment plants instead they are mainly removed through uncontrolled adsorption to sludge venkiteshwaran et al 2018 rott et al 2018 to prevent eutrophication many countries set a strict limit for p discharge for example as low as 10 μg l in eco sensitive areas usepa 1986 the presence of non orthophosphates makes it difficult to meet the discharge standard venkiteshwaran et al 2018 mayer et al 2013 also from the point of resource recovery all forms of p need to be recovered and reused yet studies on p removal and recovery from non orthophosphates are rarely reported this is probably due to the overlooked role of non orthophosphates on eutrophication and the technical challenge in recovering p from non orthophosphates due to the increased awareness of the importance of non orthophosphates some researchers have proposed the use of advanced oxidation processes as pretreatment to convert non orthophosphate to orthophosphate sindelar et al 2016 rott et al 2017a sun et al 2019 however to our knowledge there are no approaches which can achieve a one step p removal and recovery from non orthophosphates electrochemical mediated struvite precipitation was shown to be a possible way to get phosphorus removed and recovered wang et al 2010 cusick and logan 2012 hug and udert 2013 however the struvite based process requires the dosing of magnesium source as most nutrient rich waste streams are deficient in magnesium relative to phosphate and ammonium hovelmann and putnis 2016 lei et al established an electrochemical method for the removal and recovery of orthophosphate by electrochemically induced calcium phosphate precipitation lei et al 2017 2018a 2018b 2019 the principle of this method is that a high ph environment in the vicinity of the cathode was created lei et al 2017 due to the high local ph calcium ions and phosphate precipitate at the cathode surface in this electrochemical process however the function of the anode has not been explored drawn from the knowledge of electrochemical treatment of micro organic pollutants martínez huitle et al 2015 martinez huitle and ferro 2006 it may be possible to use the anode to oxidative break down the molecular structure of non orthophosphate compounds converting non orthophosphate to orthophosphate by anodic mediated oxidation subsequently phosphate may precipitate with coexisting calcium ions at the cathode it should be noted that calcium ions are widely present both in natural and engineered aquatic systems therefore in practice the addition of calcium ions is not required nitrilotris methylene phosphonic acid ntmp is a widely used antiscalant in many industries including cooling water systems oil production textile industry and detergents nowack and stone 2000 in 1998 56 000 ton phosphonic acids were consumed worldwide in 2012 this value increased by 70 94 000 ton rott et al 2018 yet phosphonates are not significantly degraded in wastewater treatment plants nowack and stone 2000 therefore ntmp is a highly environmental relevant non orthophosphates compound the most common way for the treatment of phosphonates is adsorption boels et al 2012 however the adsorption of phosphonates by adsorbents only achieves the removal of phosphonates but not the recovery of p from phosphonates here we chose ntmp as a model non orthophosphate compound sun et al 2019 boels et al 2012 investigated the feasibility and mechanism of p removal and recovery from phosphonates via an electrochemical treatment our study established a one step approach for simultaneously p removal and recovery from non orthophosphate this may offer new options for treating non orthophosphate containing waste streams and could be a significant step towards a circular p economy via the recovery of both orthophosphate and non orthophosphate 2 material and methods 2 1 setup fig 1 shows the configuration of the electrochemical cell the electrochemical cell consisted of a single cylindrical glass reactor 1 0 l the cathode was placed 3 cm below the anode and located in the center of the reactor the solutions in the reactor were mixed by a recirculation pump masterflex l s digital economy drive germany at 150 ml min the electrochemical cell was operated under constant current density 28 a m2 and the needed cell voltage was provided by a power supply es 030 5 delta electronics b v the netherlands the current density of 28 a m2 was chosen based on our previous studies on electrochemical removal of inorganic phosphate and preliminary experiments on electrochemical treatment of non orthophosphate compounds 2 2 electrodes the typical anode was a pt coated 20 g m2 ti disc thickness 0 1 cm ø 8 cm a perpendicular 12 cm rod ø 3 mm of the same material was welded on the center as current collector ru ir 10 g m2 mixed metal oxide mmo and pt ir 10 g m2 mmo were investigated as alternative anode materials the cathode was an uncoated ti square plate grade a thickness 0 1 cm 6 6 cm and had the same dimensions as the anodes all electrodes were provided by magneto special anodes bv schiedam the netherlands 2 3 chemicals nitrilotris methylene phosphonic acid n ch2po oh 2 3 ntmp was purchased from sigma aldrich and used as received ca no3 2 4h2o and naclo4 were acquired from merck germany na2so4 nacl and naoh were purchased from vwr leuven belgium 2 4 batch experiments we conducted all experiments with 1 0 l synthetic solutions in the as described electrochemical cell the typical synthetic solutions contained 30 mg l ntmp 0 3 mm p 1 0 mm ca2 and 50 mm na2so4 prepared by dissolving analytical grade chemicals in deionized water 18 2 mω cm millipore in some experiments naclo4 or nacl were used as background electrolyte in the section of proof of principle we applied a higher ntmp concentration 100 mg l in order to collect enough precipitates for the subsequent characterization of solids we also examined the removal of ntmp by conventional chemical precipitation no current applied where necessary we used concentrated naoh to adjust the ph a typical batch test lasted seven days after each test the cathode was cleaned by immersing in acid solution 1 m hno3 and then rinsed with deionized water all experiments were carried out at least in duplicate the data were expressed as mean and standard deviation of independent tests 2 5 analytical methods we analyzed the solution ph over the electrolysis process by a ph meter seven excellence s470 mettler toledo the ph profile is summarized in fig s1 we used icp aes optima 5300 dv perkin elmer to quantify the concentrations of p and ca the detection limits were 20 and 50 μg l respectively we used two types of cuvettes lck 349 0 05 5 mg l po4 p and lck 350 2 20 mg l po4 p hach to measure the concentration of ortho phosphorus po4 p we applied ion chromatography compact ic 761 metrohm to check the concentration of cl the ion chromatography was equipped with a metrohm metrosep a supp 4 5 guard pre column a metrohm metrosep a 112 supp 5 150 4 0 mm column and a conductivity detector we used ultra high pressure liquid chromatography uhplc to quantify the concentration of low molecular weight acids the uhplc was equipped with a phenomenex rezex organic acid h 300 7 8 mm column an ultimate 3000 rs column compartment column oven and an ultimate 3000 rs variable wavelength detector the detection limit for formic acid and acetic acid was 0 5 mg l 2 6 characterization of solids after the electrochemical treatment the cathode was dried at room temperature for 24 h then the solids on the cathode were collected by gentle scraping the solid precipitates on the cathode were only collected at increased ntmp concentration 100 mg l in this case enough solids could be collected for solid characterization we checked the bond information of the solids by raman spectroscopy and x ray diffraction xrd examined its morphology by scanning electron microscopy sem and determined its elemental composition with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds details about the instruments can be found elsewhere lei et al 2017 2018a 3 results and discussion 3 1 proof of principle we first investigated the possibility of removing ntmp in the presence of calcium ions by conventional chemical precipitation which is triggered by increasing solution ph fig 2 however as can be seen from fig 2 in the absence of electric current no ntmp was removed at background ph of 3 6 even with an increase of solution ph to 10 or 12 we did not observe an obvious removal of ntmp this means that merely adjusting the ph does not work for the removal of phosphonates it is worth to mention however that this may only be the case for calcium ions the use of iron or aluminum salts which could form coagulants at specific phs may be able to remove phosphonates to some extent rott et al 2017b however in our approach we focus on getting phosphonates removed as recyclable calcium phosphate minerals instead of aluminum or iron phosphate that has low bioavailability for phosphorus uptake by plants at 28 a m2 applied the concentrations of p and ca decreased simultaneously over the treatment period fig 3 a after seven days treatment 41 3 p and 56 8 ca were removed the analysis of orthophosphorus po4 p concentration clearly shows the difference between chemical precipitation and electrochemically mediated precipitation in the chemical precipitation process the concentration of po4 p is below the detection limit 50 μg l this explains why chemical precipitation by adjusting ph does not work for the non orthophosphate as the p in ntmp is connected to carbon c p bond it is not available to ca in contrast in the electrochemical system we found an increase of po4 p concentration up to 4 12 mg l during the initial two days and then a gradual decrease over the next days the detection of po4 p indicates the conversion of non orthophosphate to orthophosphate with electrochemical treatment the decrease of po4 p concentration afterwards is associated with its precipitation with calcium ions as calcium phosphate at the cathode which is triggered by the increased local high ph during water electrolysis process lei et al 2017 2018a indeed we found white precipitates on the cathode after electrochemical treatment the xrd pattern of the collected solids shows a broad peak around 2 θ 30 fig 3b which is likely linked to the amorphous phase of calcium phosphate that we have seen before lei et al 2018c this assumption is supported by the raman spectrum fig 3c which displays all characteristic internal po4 bonds information of calcium phosphate including a main ν1 po4 peak around 955 cm 1 ensikat et al 2016 the observed frequency of the ν1 po4 model deviates from the ν1 po4 model of hydroxyapatite 962 cm 1 indicating the precipitates indeed are amorphous calcium phosphate ensikat et al 2016 moreover the formation of calcium phosphate is further evidenced by sem eds characterization from the sem images fig 3d we can see the aggregation of irregular spherical shaped particles which is typically seen for amorphous calcium phosphate lei et al 2017 eds mapping of the precipitates shows that p ca and o atoms are well distributed over the collected solids fig 3e furthermore according to the mass balance calculation the ca p atomic ratio in the precipitates is around 1 37 this is consistent with the eds result which indicates a ca p atomic ratio of 1 32 in the collected precipitates fig s2 to conclude we confirmed that by electrochemical treatment the non orthophosphate was converted into orthophosphate and then precipitated with coexisting calcium ions as amorphous calcium phosphate at the cathode 3 2 boosting performance 3 2 1 influence of anode material in electrochemical systems the electrode material plays a crucial role in its electrochemical performance oturan et al 2013 in our system the anode plays a major role in the anodic conversion of ntmp to orthophosphate if the non orthophosphate was not converted to orthophosphate the cathode although having a high ph environment cannot result in the precipitation of calcium ions with ntmp the catalytic behavior of the anode material towards the oxidation of ntmp is therefore crucial for the performance of the whole system we performed experiments with different mmo anodes pt ir or ru ir and compared their efficiencies with the pt anode in terms of the evolution of po4 p removal of p and ca fig 4 a suggests that the formation of orthophosphate was enhanced substantially using mmo anodes the maximum detected po4 p concentration increased from 1 6 mg l with pt anode to 1 8 mg l with mmo pt ir anode and further to 3 5 mg l with mmo ru ir anode in the absence of calcium ions the difference in the evolution of orthophosphate is even more obvious fig 4b this is because the converted orthophosphate from ntmp will not be removed by calcium phosphate precipitation which happens in the presence of calcium ions the maximum po4 p concentration was in the order of ru ir 6 9 mg l pt ir 5 6 mg l pt 4 1 mg l the converted phosphate from ntmp corresponds to a conversion efficiency of non orthophosphate to orthophosphate of 73 6 with mmo ru ir anode followed by mmo pt ir anode 57 6 and pt anode 43 5 due to the improved formation of po4 p the accompanied calcium phosphate precipitation was also enhanced according to the kinetic modeling fig s3 the apparent rate constant of electrochemical removal of p from ntmp decreased in the order of ru ir 0 00592 h 1 pt ir 0 00360 h 1 pt 0 00264 h 1 the overall removal of p reached 47 8 with pt anode 65 9 with pt ir anode and 76 8 with ru ir anode fig 4c similarly as shown in fig 4d the removal efficiency of ca increased from 19 2 pt to 26 5 pt ir and further to 41 8 ru ir we conclude that the performance of the three different anode materials decreases in the order of ru ir pt ir pt the same trend was observed in the electrochemical conversion of micro organic pollutants where the same electrodes were employed butkovskyi et al 2014 the difference in performance in the conversion of non orthophosphate to orthophosphate removal of p and ca of the three employed anode materials is probably connected to their anodic oxidation mechanisms or anodic mediated oxidation ability towards ntmp in the electrochemical system oxygen evolution will compete with ntmp oxidation at the anode surface pt is a well known material that has a low overpotential towards oxygen evolution as such pt anode shows a poor oxidation towards ntmp however the mmo anodes may result in the formation of chemical or even physical adsorbed hydroxyl radicals oh martinez huitle and ferro 2006 which are a very powerful oxidant hence the performance of electrochemical destruction of ntmp and the associated p recovery as calcium phosphate were enhanced dramatically by using ru ir anode 3 2 2 influence of electrolyte given the fact that non orthophosphates may be present in different water matrices the performance of electrochemical p recovery from ntmp was evaluated in various background electrolytes fig 5 we found that in the presence of nacl the removal efficiency of p fig 5a the formation of po4 p fig 5b and the associated removal of ca fig 5c were boosted the apparent rate constant of p removal with 50 mm nacl is 0 01577 h 1 which is even three times faster than with ru ir anode in na2so4 electrolyte fig s3 and table s1 in two days 60 7 p of ntmp and 35 0 ca were removed and precipitated as calcium phosphate solids on the cathode after four days treatment the removal of p and ca reached 96 7 and 56 6 respectively the substantially enhanced removal of p in the presence of nacl is probably due to the role of the chloride anion chloride can be oxidized at the anode forming cl2 in parallel a series of chain reactions may result in the formation of other reactive chlorine species i e clo martinez huitle and ferro 2006 these active chlorine species are known as strong oxidants and could oxidize ntmp molecules converting non orthophosphate to orthophosphate in the case of naclo4 no reactive chlorine species can be formed then the conversion of non orthophosphate to orthophosphate will completely rely on direct electron transfer from ntmp to the anode and or surface bounded radicals although the later mechanism is likely to be limited the pt anode is not a good candidate for producing surface bounded free radicals due to its low overpotential for oxygen evolution song et al 2017 therefore the oxygen evolution reaction competes with the oxidation of ntmp by pt anode as a result the lowest removal efficiency was found within inert naclo4 electrolyte in the case of na2so4 although previous research suggested that persulfate and subsequent h2o2 could be formed farhat et al 2015 the contribution of such oxidants to the conversion of non orthophosphate should be negligible based on the fact that there is no significant difference between na2so4 and naclo4 we further confirmed the function of cl by looking at the evolution of po4 p in the absence of calcium ions fig 5d while the formation of po4 p in the case of naclo4 and na2so4 is slow and incomplete the conversion efficiency of non orthophosphate to orthophosphate in the presence of nacl is much higher in 6 h the po4 p concentration reached 8 6 mg l which corresponds to a conversion efficiency of non orthophosphate to orthophosphate of about 91 9 this efficiency is almost three times higher than with naclo4 or na2so4 electrolyte the overlapping po4 p evolution trend between naclo4 and na2so4 excludes the potential contribution of so4 2 induced reactive oxidants i e persulfate in ntmp degradation while not being tested we can imagine that the performance could be further boosted if we combine the use of ru ir anode with nacl electrolyte 3 3 mechanistic study the conversion of phosphonate to orthophosphate was not caused by radicals in the bulk solution we examined this by adding methanol methanol is a well known quenching agent for free radicals i e oh in bulk solutions lei et al 2015 however the addition of 100 mm methanol has no significant influence on the evolution of po4 p and removal of p fig 6 a indicating that the conversion of ntmp to po4 p is a surface based reaction between anode and ntmp song et al 2017 lei et al 2015 in addition free radicals i e oh are not the main oxidant species for the conversion of ntmp to orthophosphate instead the conversion of ntmp is likely to happen via an electrochemically mediated electron transfer from ntmp to the anode the evolution of orthophosphate indicates the cleavage of the c p bond of ntmp molecules we monitored the evolution of low molecular weight organic acids it was found that formic acid hcooh was formed the formation of formic acid indicates the breakdown of both c p and c n bonds the cleavage of the two bonds was also observed in manganese catalyzed degradation of ntmp nowack and stone 2000 and also in iron mineral induced degradation of other phosphonate compounds zhang and jun 2018 however it is not clear which bond is broken first it should be noted that the cleavage of c n bond alone will not generate phosphate and formic acid assuming the two bonds were cleaved at the same time the generated mole concentration of phosphate and formic acid should be same providing that the subsequent conversion of formic acid to co2 and precipitation of phosphate with calcium ions were prevented therefore we did control experiments by adding ethanol to the system in the absence of calcium ions without calcium ions the converted po4 p will not be consumed the presence of ethanol will result in the formation of acetic acid ch3cooh instead of formic acid therefore we can correlate the formation of formic acid and the oxidation of ntmp fig s4 more importantly the addition of a high concentration of ethanol will inhibit the conversion of formic acid to co2 in this case the comparison of ortho phosphorus concentration mm with formic acid will be able to reveal the cleavage of c p and c n bonds as shown in fig 6b the formed po4 p concentration is higher than hcooh concentration in the whole process therefore it is likely that the c p bond was attacked first and then the c n bond this could also be explained by the relevant bond energies theoretically the c n bond has a higher bond energy than the c p bond 305 kj mol vs 264 kj mol based on the above discussion a schematic diagram of proposed reaction pathways coupling oxidation and precipitation is illustrated in fig 7 firstly ntmp is partly converted to phosphate by direct anodic oxidation i e electron transfer or through anodic mediated oxidation i e via cl2 to inorganic phosphate at the anode depending on the background electrolyte and the catalytic nature of the anode material meanwhile due to the reduction of water molecules at the cathode which generates h2 and hydroxide ions oh a local high ph environment is established in the vicinity of the cathode secondly the converted orthophosphate reacts with coexisting calcium ions forming calcium phosphate solids at the cathode surface driven by the local high ph in this way the conversion of non orthophosphate to orthophosphate and its subsequent recovery as recyclable calcium phosphate solids were achieved simultaneously by combining the functions of both electrodes 3 4 environmental implications we further investigated the efficiency of this system in a complicated environment by adding ntmp to the effluent of the local wastewater treatment plant leeuwarden the netherlands the total soluble p concentration in the effluent increased from less than 0 5 mg l to 9 3 mg l after adding 30 mg l ntmp as shown in fig s5 by electrochemical treatment the total p concentration decreased from 9 3 0 2 to 3 5 0 3 mg l in 24 h and to 1 0 0 1 mg l in 48 h which corresponds to a removal efficiency of 63 in 24 h and 85 in 48 h meanwhile the ca concentration in the effluent decreased from 49 1 2 to 15 1 3 mg l in 24 h and to 7 2 3 3 mg l in 48 h the removal of the phosphonate in the real environment is even faster than in synthetic solutions which do not contain chloride ions this is probably due to the presence of cl in the real environment that results in the formation of chlorine and or other potential active chlorine species which could oxidize ntmp molecules converting phosphonates to orthophosphate the decrease of cl concentration in the wastewater supports the formation of cl2 gas in this process fig s5 it should be noted that no external ca source was dosed the preliminary results in real wastewater highlight the promising feasibility of removing non orthophosphate from complicated water matrices by the electrochemical approach the non orthophosphate i e phosphonates could be converted to orthophosphate and then precipitate with coexisting calcium ions on the cathode in the form of calcium phosphate solids the calcium phosphate solids could be collected and then used as a raw material for producing p fertilizer in this way the removal of non orthophosphates and the recovery of p from non orthophosphates were achieved in a single reactor by an electrochemical treatment the findings in this study may be applied to other organic phosphorus containing compounds as well like 1 hydroxyethylidene diphosphonic acid and diethylenetriamine penta methylene phosphonic acid as used in household cleaning products personal care products industrial cleaning process and as water treatment additives in various applications while the feasibility of this system in real wastewaters needs to be further addressed in future studies in terms of efficiency energy consumption and the formation of halogenated organic compounds the proof of principle of this electrochemical approach may offer a potential solution for addressing the possible eutrophication potential of non orthophosphates moreover the electrochemical recovery of p from non orthophosphates may contribute to a circular p economy via the recovery of not only inorganic phosphate but also other groups of phosphorus containing compounds i e phosphonates 4 conclusions here we demonstrated that electrochemical treatment of non orthophosphate compounds could result in one step phosphorus recovery in the form of calcium phosphate at the anode the non orthophosphate was converted to inorganic orthophosphate at the cathode due to water reduction a local high ph was established then the converted inorganic phosphate reacted with coexisting calcium ions and precipitated as calcium phosphate solids on the cathode the performance of the electrochemical approach was affected by the catalytic nature of the anode material and the background electrolyte the use of ru ir anode or the presence of cl ions could boost the performance of the electrochemical approach

18324,phosphonates are an important type of phosphorus containing compounds and have possible eutrophication potential therefore the removal of phosphonates from waste streams is as important as orthophosphate herein we achieved simultaneously removal and recovery of phosphorus from nitrilotris methylene phosphonic acid ntmp using an electrochemical cell it was found that the c n and c p bonds of ntmp were cleaved at the anode leading to the formation of orthophosphate and formic acid meanwhile the converted orthophosphate reacted with coexisting calcium ions and precipitated on the cathode as recoverable calcium phosphate solids due to an electrochemically induced high ph region near the cathode electrochemical removal of ntmp 30 mg l was more efficient when dosed to effluent of a wastewater treatment plant 89 in 24 h than dosed to synthetic solutions of 1 0 mm ca and 50 mm na2so4 43 in 168 h while applying a current density of 28 a m2 and using a pt anode and ti cathode the higher removal efficiency of ntmp in real waste water is due to the presence of chloride ions which resulted in anodic formation of chlorine this study establishes a one step approach for simultaneously phosphorus removal and recovery of calcium phosphate from non orthophosphates graphical abstract image 1 keywords oxidation precipitation calcium phosphate organic phosphorus local high ph 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential element for all forms of life but its reserves are limited on our planet in particular modern agricultural industry depends heavily on using p fertilizer to secure food production for the increasing global population unfortunately phosphate reserves are projected to run out in a few hundred years cordell et al 2009 meanwhile the widespread use of p fertilizer and many other p products often result in a load of excess p in receiving water bodies causing eutrophication of such aquatic systems conley et al 2009 to sustain the use of p and guarantee food supply it is necessary to recover and reuse the p in waste streams elser and bennett 2011 mayer et al 2016 while there have been plenty of studies addressing p removal and recovery from wastewaters the focus was mainly on orthophosphate which can be relatively easily removed by enhanced biological phosphorus removal precipitation or adsorption oehmen et al 2007 desmidt et al 2015 ye et al 2017 however in terms of non orthophosphates we are not aware of any approaches which can achieve simultaneously p removal and recovery in a single step a recent review article pointed out that no technique currently has been implemented for the recovery of p from non orthophosphates venkiteshwaran et al 2018 however though the relative fractions of non orthophosphates are widely variable non orthophosphates can be one of the main p fractions in many aquatic ecosystems baldwin 2013 a recent survey in an eutrophic lake revealed the widespread presence of non orthophosphates brooker et al 2018 non orthophosphates are also detected in the remote marine environment at unexpectedly high concentrations mcdonough et al 2018 non orthophosphate compounds are typically characterized by the presence of c p bond in their molecular structures baldwin 2013 nowack 2003 unlike orthophosphate the reactivity of non orthophosphates is relatively low and is generally grouped as nonreactive phosphorus however in the last decade non orthophosphates were conceived as a potential bioavailable p dyhrman et al 2006 indeed when subjected to enzymatic degradation or photochemical conversion the bioavailability of non orthophosphates to plants microorganisms and algae may be enhanced substantially venkiteshwaran et al 2018 baldwin 2013 nowack 2003 zhang et al 2019 therefore non orthophosphates may be partly responsible for the eutrophication of water bodies nonetheless non orthophosphates are not targeted by the existing treatment process in wastewater treatment plants instead they are mainly removed through uncontrolled adsorption to sludge venkiteshwaran et al 2018 rott et al 2018 to prevent eutrophication many countries set a strict limit for p discharge for example as low as 10 μg l in eco sensitive areas usepa 1986 the presence of non orthophosphates makes it difficult to meet the discharge standard venkiteshwaran et al 2018 mayer et al 2013 also from the point of resource recovery all forms of p need to be recovered and reused yet studies on p removal and recovery from non orthophosphates are rarely reported this is probably due to the overlooked role of non orthophosphates on eutrophication and the technical challenge in recovering p from non orthophosphates due to the increased awareness of the importance of non orthophosphates some researchers have proposed the use of advanced oxidation processes as pretreatment to convert non orthophosphate to orthophosphate sindelar et al 2016 rott et al 2017a sun et al 2019 however to our knowledge there are no approaches which can achieve a one step p removal and recovery from non orthophosphates electrochemical mediated struvite precipitation was shown to be a possible way to get phosphorus removed and recovered wang et al 2010 cusick and logan 2012 hug and udert 2013 however the struvite based process requires the dosing of magnesium source as most nutrient rich waste streams are deficient in magnesium relative to phosphate and ammonium hovelmann and putnis 2016 lei et al established an electrochemical method for the removal and recovery of orthophosphate by electrochemically induced calcium phosphate precipitation lei et al 2017 2018a 2018b 2019 the principle of this method is that a high ph environment in the vicinity of the cathode was created lei et al 2017 due to the high local ph calcium ions and phosphate precipitate at the cathode surface in this electrochemical process however the function of the anode has not been explored drawn from the knowledge of electrochemical treatment of micro organic pollutants martínez huitle et al 2015 martinez huitle and ferro 2006 it may be possible to use the anode to oxidative break down the molecular structure of non orthophosphate compounds converting non orthophosphate to orthophosphate by anodic mediated oxidation subsequently phosphate may precipitate with coexisting calcium ions at the cathode it should be noted that calcium ions are widely present both in natural and engineered aquatic systems therefore in practice the addition of calcium ions is not required nitrilotris methylene phosphonic acid ntmp is a widely used antiscalant in many industries including cooling water systems oil production textile industry and detergents nowack and stone 2000 in 1998 56 000 ton phosphonic acids were consumed worldwide in 2012 this value increased by 70 94 000 ton rott et al 2018 yet phosphonates are not significantly degraded in wastewater treatment plants nowack and stone 2000 therefore ntmp is a highly environmental relevant non orthophosphates compound the most common way for the treatment of phosphonates is adsorption boels et al 2012 however the adsorption of phosphonates by adsorbents only achieves the removal of phosphonates but not the recovery of p from phosphonates here we chose ntmp as a model non orthophosphate compound sun et al 2019 boels et al 2012 investigated the feasibility and mechanism of p removal and recovery from phosphonates via an electrochemical treatment our study established a one step approach for simultaneously p removal and recovery from non orthophosphate this may offer new options for treating non orthophosphate containing waste streams and could be a significant step towards a circular p economy via the recovery of both orthophosphate and non orthophosphate 2 material and methods 2 1 setup fig 1 shows the configuration of the electrochemical cell the electrochemical cell consisted of a single cylindrical glass reactor 1 0 l the cathode was placed 3 cm below the anode and located in the center of the reactor the solutions in the reactor were mixed by a recirculation pump masterflex l s digital economy drive germany at 150 ml min the electrochemical cell was operated under constant current density 28 a m2 and the needed cell voltage was provided by a power supply es 030 5 delta electronics b v the netherlands the current density of 28 a m2 was chosen based on our previous studies on electrochemical removal of inorganic phosphate and preliminary experiments on electrochemical treatment of non orthophosphate compounds 2 2 electrodes the typical anode was a pt coated 20 g m2 ti disc thickness 0 1 cm ø 8 cm a perpendicular 12 cm rod ø 3 mm of the same material was welded on the center as current collector ru ir 10 g m2 mixed metal oxide mmo and pt ir 10 g m2 mmo were investigated as alternative anode materials the cathode was an uncoated ti square plate grade a thickness 0 1 cm 6 6 cm and had the same dimensions as the anodes all electrodes were provided by magneto special anodes bv schiedam the netherlands 2 3 chemicals nitrilotris methylene phosphonic acid n ch2po oh 2 3 ntmp was purchased from sigma aldrich and used as received ca no3 2 4h2o and naclo4 were acquired from merck germany na2so4 nacl and naoh were purchased from vwr leuven belgium 2 4 batch experiments we conducted all experiments with 1 0 l synthetic solutions in the as described electrochemical cell the typical synthetic solutions contained 30 mg l ntmp 0 3 mm p 1 0 mm ca2 and 50 mm na2so4 prepared by dissolving analytical grade chemicals in deionized water 18 2 mω cm millipore in some experiments naclo4 or nacl were used as background electrolyte in the section of proof of principle we applied a higher ntmp concentration 100 mg l in order to collect enough precipitates for the subsequent characterization of solids we also examined the removal of ntmp by conventional chemical precipitation no current applied where necessary we used concentrated naoh to adjust the ph a typical batch test lasted seven days after each test the cathode was cleaned by immersing in acid solution 1 m hno3 and then rinsed with deionized water all experiments were carried out at least in duplicate the data were expressed as mean and standard deviation of independent tests 2 5 analytical methods we analyzed the solution ph over the electrolysis process by a ph meter seven excellence s470 mettler toledo the ph profile is summarized in fig s1 we used icp aes optima 5300 dv perkin elmer to quantify the concentrations of p and ca the detection limits were 20 and 50 μg l respectively we used two types of cuvettes lck 349 0 05 5 mg l po4 p and lck 350 2 20 mg l po4 p hach to measure the concentration of ortho phosphorus po4 p we applied ion chromatography compact ic 761 metrohm to check the concentration of cl the ion chromatography was equipped with a metrohm metrosep a supp 4 5 guard pre column a metrohm metrosep a 112 supp 5 150 4 0 mm column and a conductivity detector we used ultra high pressure liquid chromatography uhplc to quantify the concentration of low molecular weight acids the uhplc was equipped with a phenomenex rezex organic acid h 300 7 8 mm column an ultimate 3000 rs column compartment column oven and an ultimate 3000 rs variable wavelength detector the detection limit for formic acid and acetic acid was 0 5 mg l 2 6 characterization of solids after the electrochemical treatment the cathode was dried at room temperature for 24 h then the solids on the cathode were collected by gentle scraping the solid precipitates on the cathode were only collected at increased ntmp concentration 100 mg l in this case enough solids could be collected for solid characterization we checked the bond information of the solids by raman spectroscopy and x ray diffraction xrd examined its morphology by scanning electron microscopy sem and determined its elemental composition with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds details about the instruments can be found elsewhere lei et al 2017 2018a 3 results and discussion 3 1 proof of principle we first investigated the possibility of removing ntmp in the presence of calcium ions by conventional chemical precipitation which is triggered by increasing solution ph fig 2 however as can be seen from fig 2 in the absence of electric current no ntmp was removed at background ph of 3 6 even with an increase of solution ph to 10 or 12 we did not observe an obvious removal of ntmp this means that merely adjusting the ph does not work for the removal of phosphonates it is worth to mention however that this may only be the case for calcium ions the use of iron or aluminum salts which could form coagulants at specific phs may be able to remove phosphonates to some extent rott et al 2017b however in our approach we focus on getting phosphonates removed as recyclable calcium phosphate minerals instead of aluminum or iron phosphate that has low bioavailability for phosphorus uptake by plants at 28 a m2 applied the concentrations of p and ca decreased simultaneously over the treatment period fig 3 a after seven days treatment 41 3 p and 56 8 ca were removed the analysis of orthophosphorus po4 p concentration clearly shows the difference between chemical precipitation and electrochemically mediated precipitation in the chemical precipitation process the concentration of po4 p is below the detection limit 50 μg l this explains why chemical precipitation by adjusting ph does not work for the non orthophosphate as the p in ntmp is connected to carbon c p bond it is not available to ca in contrast in the electrochemical system we found an increase of po4 p concentration up to 4 12 mg l during the initial two days and then a gradual decrease over the next days the detection of po4 p indicates the conversion of non orthophosphate to orthophosphate with electrochemical treatment the decrease of po4 p concentration afterwards is associated with its precipitation with calcium ions as calcium phosphate at the cathode which is triggered by the increased local high ph during water electrolysis process lei et al 2017 2018a indeed we found white precipitates on the cathode after electrochemical treatment the xrd pattern of the collected solids shows a broad peak around 2 θ 30 fig 3b which is likely linked to the amorphous phase of calcium phosphate that we have seen before lei et al 2018c this assumption is supported by the raman spectrum fig 3c which displays all characteristic internal po4 bonds information of calcium phosphate including a main ν1 po4 peak around 955 cm 1 ensikat et al 2016 the observed frequency of the ν1 po4 model deviates from the ν1 po4 model of hydroxyapatite 962 cm 1 indicating the precipitates indeed are amorphous calcium phosphate ensikat et al 2016 moreover the formation of calcium phosphate is further evidenced by sem eds characterization from the sem images fig 3d we can see the aggregation of irregular spherical shaped particles which is typically seen for amorphous calcium phosphate lei et al 2017 eds mapping of the precipitates shows that p ca and o atoms are well distributed over the collected solids fig 3e furthermore according to the mass balance calculation the ca p atomic ratio in the precipitates is around 1 37 this is consistent with the eds result which indicates a ca p atomic ratio of 1 32 in the collected precipitates fig s2 to conclude we confirmed that by electrochemical treatment the non orthophosphate was converted into orthophosphate and then precipitated with coexisting calcium ions as amorphous calcium phosphate at the cathode 3 2 boosting performance 3 2 1 influence of anode material in electrochemical systems the electrode material plays a crucial role in its electrochemical performance oturan et al 2013 in our system the anode plays a major role in the anodic conversion of ntmp to orthophosphate if the non orthophosphate was not converted to orthophosphate the cathode although having a high ph environment cannot result in the precipitation of calcium ions with ntmp the catalytic behavior of the anode material towards the oxidation of ntmp is therefore crucial for the performance of the whole system we performed experiments with different mmo anodes pt ir or ru ir and compared their efficiencies with the pt anode in terms of the evolution of po4 p removal of p and ca fig 4 a suggests that the formation of orthophosphate was enhanced substantially using mmo anodes the maximum detected po4 p concentration increased from 1 6 mg l with pt anode to 1 8 mg l with mmo pt ir anode and further to 3 5 mg l with mmo ru ir anode in the absence of calcium ions the difference in the evolution of orthophosphate is even more obvious fig 4b this is because the converted orthophosphate from ntmp will not be removed by calcium phosphate precipitation which happens in the presence of calcium ions the maximum po4 p concentration was in the order of ru ir 6 9 mg l pt ir 5 6 mg l pt 4 1 mg l the converted phosphate from ntmp corresponds to a conversion efficiency of non orthophosphate to orthophosphate of 73 6 with mmo ru ir anode followed by mmo pt ir anode 57 6 and pt anode 43 5 due to the improved formation of po4 p the accompanied calcium phosphate precipitation was also enhanced according to the kinetic modeling fig s3 the apparent rate constant of electrochemical removal of p from ntmp decreased in the order of ru ir 0 00592 h 1 pt ir 0 00360 h 1 pt 0 00264 h 1 the overall removal of p reached 47 8 with pt anode 65 9 with pt ir anode and 76 8 with ru ir anode fig 4c similarly as shown in fig 4d the removal efficiency of ca increased from 19 2 pt to 26 5 pt ir and further to 41 8 ru ir we conclude that the performance of the three different anode materials decreases in the order of ru ir pt ir pt the same trend was observed in the electrochemical conversion of micro organic pollutants where the same electrodes were employed butkovskyi et al 2014 the difference in performance in the conversion of non orthophosphate to orthophosphate removal of p and ca of the three employed anode materials is probably connected to their anodic oxidation mechanisms or anodic mediated oxidation ability towards ntmp in the electrochemical system oxygen evolution will compete with ntmp oxidation at the anode surface pt is a well known material that has a low overpotential towards oxygen evolution as such pt anode shows a poor oxidation towards ntmp however the mmo anodes may result in the formation of chemical or even physical adsorbed hydroxyl radicals oh martinez huitle and ferro 2006 which are a very powerful oxidant hence the performance of electrochemical destruction of ntmp and the associated p recovery as calcium phosphate were enhanced dramatically by using ru ir anode 3 2 2 influence of electrolyte given the fact that non orthophosphates may be present in different water matrices the performance of electrochemical p recovery from ntmp was evaluated in various background electrolytes fig 5 we found that in the presence of nacl the removal efficiency of p fig 5a the formation of po4 p fig 5b and the associated removal of ca fig 5c were boosted the apparent rate constant of p removal with 50 mm nacl is 0 01577 h 1 which is even three times faster than with ru ir anode in na2so4 electrolyte fig s3 and table s1 in two days 60 7 p of ntmp and 35 0 ca were removed and precipitated as calcium phosphate solids on the cathode after four days treatment the removal of p and ca reached 96 7 and 56 6 respectively the substantially enhanced removal of p in the presence of nacl is probably due to the role of the chloride anion chloride can be oxidized at the anode forming cl2 in parallel a series of chain reactions may result in the formation of other reactive chlorine species i e clo martinez huitle and ferro 2006 these active chlorine species are known as strong oxidants and could oxidize ntmp molecules converting non orthophosphate to orthophosphate in the case of naclo4 no reactive chlorine species can be formed then the conversion of non orthophosphate to orthophosphate will completely rely on direct electron transfer from ntmp to the anode and or surface bounded radicals although the later mechanism is likely to be limited the pt anode is not a good candidate for producing surface bounded free radicals due to its low overpotential for oxygen evolution song et al 2017 therefore the oxygen evolution reaction competes with the oxidation of ntmp by pt anode as a result the lowest removal efficiency was found within inert naclo4 electrolyte in the case of na2so4 although previous research suggested that persulfate and subsequent h2o2 could be formed farhat et al 2015 the contribution of such oxidants to the conversion of non orthophosphate should be negligible based on the fact that there is no significant difference between na2so4 and naclo4 we further confirmed the function of cl by looking at the evolution of po4 p in the absence of calcium ions fig 5d while the formation of po4 p in the case of naclo4 and na2so4 is slow and incomplete the conversion efficiency of non orthophosphate to orthophosphate in the presence of nacl is much higher in 6 h the po4 p concentration reached 8 6 mg l which corresponds to a conversion efficiency of non orthophosphate to orthophosphate of about 91 9 this efficiency is almost three times higher than with naclo4 or na2so4 electrolyte the overlapping po4 p evolution trend between naclo4 and na2so4 excludes the potential contribution of so4 2 induced reactive oxidants i e persulfate in ntmp degradation while not being tested we can imagine that the performance could be further boosted if we combine the use of ru ir anode with nacl electrolyte 3 3 mechanistic study the conversion of phosphonate to orthophosphate was not caused by radicals in the bulk solution we examined this by adding methanol methanol is a well known quenching agent for free radicals i e oh in bulk solutions lei et al 2015 however the addition of 100 mm methanol has no significant influence on the evolution of po4 p and removal of p fig 6 a indicating that the conversion of ntmp to po4 p is a surface based reaction between anode and ntmp song et al 2017 lei et al 2015 in addition free radicals i e oh are not the main oxidant species for the conversion of ntmp to orthophosphate instead the conversion of ntmp is likely to happen via an electrochemically mediated electron transfer from ntmp to the anode the evolution of orthophosphate indicates the cleavage of the c p bond of ntmp molecules we monitored the evolution of low molecular weight organic acids it was found that formic acid hcooh was formed the formation of formic acid indicates the breakdown of both c p and c n bonds the cleavage of the two bonds was also observed in manganese catalyzed degradation of ntmp nowack and stone 2000 and also in iron mineral induced degradation of other phosphonate compounds zhang and jun 2018 however it is not clear which bond is broken first it should be noted that the cleavage of c n bond alone will not generate phosphate and formic acid assuming the two bonds were cleaved at the same time the generated mole concentration of phosphate and formic acid should be same providing that the subsequent conversion of formic acid to co2 and precipitation of phosphate with calcium ions were prevented therefore we did control experiments by adding ethanol to the system in the absence of calcium ions without calcium ions the converted po4 p will not be consumed the presence of ethanol will result in the formation of acetic acid ch3cooh instead of formic acid therefore we can correlate the formation of formic acid and the oxidation of ntmp fig s4 more importantly the addition of a high concentration of ethanol will inhibit the conversion of formic acid to co2 in this case the comparison of ortho phosphorus concentration mm with formic acid will be able to reveal the cleavage of c p and c n bonds as shown in fig 6b the formed po4 p concentration is higher than hcooh concentration in the whole process therefore it is likely that the c p bond was attacked first and then the c n bond this could also be explained by the relevant bond energies theoretically the c n bond has a higher bond energy than the c p bond 305 kj mol vs 264 kj mol based on the above discussion a schematic diagram of proposed reaction pathways coupling oxidation and precipitation is illustrated in fig 7 firstly ntmp is partly converted to phosphate by direct anodic oxidation i e electron transfer or through anodic mediated oxidation i e via cl2 to inorganic phosphate at the anode depending on the background electrolyte and the catalytic nature of the anode material meanwhile due to the reduction of water molecules at the cathode which generates h2 and hydroxide ions oh a local high ph environment is established in the vicinity of the cathode secondly the converted orthophosphate reacts with coexisting calcium ions forming calcium phosphate solids at the cathode surface driven by the local high ph in this way the conversion of non orthophosphate to orthophosphate and its subsequent recovery as recyclable calcium phosphate solids were achieved simultaneously by combining the functions of both electrodes 3 4 environmental implications we further investigated the efficiency of this system in a complicated environment by adding ntmp to the effluent of the local wastewater treatment plant leeuwarden the netherlands the total soluble p concentration in the effluent increased from less than 0 5 mg l to 9 3 mg l after adding 30 mg l ntmp as shown in fig s5 by electrochemical treatment the total p concentration decreased from 9 3 0 2 to 3 5 0 3 mg l in 24 h and to 1 0 0 1 mg l in 48 h which corresponds to a removal efficiency of 63 in 24 h and 85 in 48 h meanwhile the ca concentration in the effluent decreased from 49 1 2 to 15 1 3 mg l in 24 h and to 7 2 3 3 mg l in 48 h the removal of the phosphonate in the real environment is even faster than in synthetic solutions which do not contain chloride ions this is probably due to the presence of cl in the real environment that results in the formation of chlorine and or other potential active chlorine species which could oxidize ntmp molecules converting phosphonates to orthophosphate the decrease of cl concentration in the wastewater supports the formation of cl2 gas in this process fig s5 it should be noted that no external ca source was dosed the preliminary results in real wastewater highlight the promising feasibility of removing non orthophosphate from complicated water matrices by the electrochemical approach the non orthophosphate i e phosphonates could be converted to orthophosphate and then precipitate with coexisting calcium ions on the cathode in the form of calcium phosphate solids the calcium phosphate solids could be collected and then used as a raw material for producing p fertilizer in this way the removal of non orthophosphates and the recovery of p from non orthophosphates were achieved in a single reactor by an electrochemical treatment the findings in this study may be applied to other organic phosphorus containing compounds as well like 1 hydroxyethylidene diphosphonic acid and diethylenetriamine penta methylene phosphonic acid as used in household cleaning products personal care products industrial cleaning process and as water treatment additives in various applications while the feasibility of this system in real wastewaters needs to be further addressed in future studies in terms of efficiency energy consumption and the formation of halogenated organic compounds the proof of principle of this electrochemical approach may offer a potential solution for addressing the possible eutrophication potential of non orthophosphates moreover the electrochemical recovery of p from non orthophosphates may contribute to a circular p economy via the recovery of not only inorganic phosphate but also other groups of phosphorus containing compounds i e phosphonates 4 conclusions here we demonstrated that electrochemical treatment of non orthophosphate compounds could result in one step phosphorus recovery in the form of calcium phosphate at the anode the non orthophosphate was converted to inorganic orthophosphate at the cathode due to water reduction a local high ph was established then the converted inorganic phosphate reacted with coexisting calcium ions and precipitated as calcium phosphate solids on the cathode the performance of the electrochemical approach was affected by the catalytic nature of the anode material and the background electrolyte the use of ru ir anode or the presence of cl ions could boost the performance of the electrochemical approach
