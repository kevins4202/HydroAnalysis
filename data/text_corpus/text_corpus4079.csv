20395,reinforced thermoplastic pipes rtp are widely used in the offshore oil and gas production industry for their excellent flexibility corrosion resistance and internal pressure resistance rtps inevitably experience extreme environmental loads including internal pressure and tensile load in the procedures of installation and operation which influence the structural integrity and safety therefore reinforced layers of rtp are designed to bear internal pressure and tensile load herein the mechanical behavior of fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipe that consisting of aramid fiber braid reinforced layers is investigated by combination of numerical simulation and experimental methods the full scale internal pressure bursting experiments of 1 inch aramid fiber rtps were carried out to study the burst pressure and failure behavior a finite element model of aramid fiber rtp is established using abaqus which considers the material nonlinearities as well as frictional interactions between layers based on the finite element model which validated by the experimental results the mechanical behavior of fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipe subjected to internal pressure and tensile load is investigated in detail the current study compares the influence of braided angle of fiber reinforced layers friction coefficient between each layer and load conditions on the mechanical behavior of rtps the experiment results reveal that the bursting pressure of 1 inch aramid fiber rtps is about 76 1 mpa the failure of aramid fiber rtp under internal pressure is dictated by leakage due to the fracture of fiber reinforced layers and the fracture of the internal layer at the end fitting it is worth noting that the braiding angle renders an obvious influence on mechanical properties of fiber reinforced rtps whereas the mechanical behavior remains insensitive to friction coefficient between layers moreover the synergistic influence of internal pressure and tensile load significantly affects the mechanical behavior of fiber reinforced rtps the current study shall serve as a reference for the design and application of fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipes in marine oil and gas production keywords reinforced thermoplastic pipe mechanical behaviors bursting experiment internal pressure finite element analysis 1 introduction the utilization of fiber reinforced polymers frp in the oil and gas industry is steadily increasing due to their numerous advantages over steel pipe including excellent corrosion resistance good fatigue resistance easy to design and lightweight bai et al 2017a parandoush and lin 2017 the reinforced thermoplastic pipes rtps consist of a multilayer pipeline structure with internal polymeric layer reinforced layers and external layer the rtps are employed in the oil and gas industry due to their excellent flexibility resistance to internal pressure during offshore oil and gas production as shown in fig 1 nowadays there are three types of rtps based on different reinforced layer materials i e metallic strip rtp aramid fiber rtp and glass fiber rtp frost and cibson 2001a rtps typically consist of several functional layers where the internal and external layers are made of high density polyethylene and the reinforced layers are made of reinforced fiber or metallic strip the aramid fiber rtps are wildly used instead of conventional steel pipes due to their excellent flexibility and resistance to corrosion and internal pressure the high tensile rigidity and strength of aramid fiber endow fiber rtps structural integrity under high internal pressures herein the reinforced layers of rtp are comprised of braided aramid fiber layers which mainly used as hydraulic transmission pipes in the umbilical cable of the offshore oil and gas platform as shown in fig 2 and the main load of aramid fiber rtps are internal pressure and axial tensile load bai et al 2018 the rtps will experience internal pressure tensile load and external pressure during offshore oil and gas production which will influence structural integrity and safety of flexible pipes hence the mechanical behavior of rtps under different load conditions should be analyzed several research groups have studied the mechanical response of offshore flexible pipes and cables subjected to axisymmetric loads an orthotropic material formulation has been proposed to equivalent the helix armors as shells by raoof and hobbs 1998 frost and gibson frost and cibson 2001b have discussed the applications of rtps for the oil and gas transmission and indicated the advantages of rtp over steel pipe bakaiyan et al 2009 have carried out the stress analysis of multilayer fiber wound composite pipes under the combined action of internal pressure and temperature gradient based on three dimensional anisotropic elastic mechanics sævik et al svein 1993 2011 have investigated the stress and deformation in a single armor tendon subjected to a given curvature distribution by developing a curved beam element also sævik et al vegard and svein 2016 have formulated two alternative models to analyze the local elastic bending of helically wound armors using differential geometries malta et al malta and clóvis 2014 have presented the nonlinear analysis of helically armored optical cables under tension and torsion and considered the geometric nonlinearity during the analysis bai et al 2017b have developed a 2d mathematical model based on the steel pipes models as proposed by kyriakides and carried out theoretical analysis of the metallic strip rtp failure under external pressure and bending moment qiao et al 2018 derived an analytical model from knapp s optical cable model and presented an fe model to study the mechanical behavior of rtps and reinforcement wires under tensile load and internal pressure bai et al 2015a established a theoretical model to estimate the tensile stiffness of rtp under axisymmetric loads and developed an fe model to verify the reliability of theoretical model yu et al 2015 have studied the mechanical behavior of pe based rtps under the synergistic influence of external pressure and bending moment through finite element analysis however the internal layer and reinforced layers of rtps are considered as elastic material in most of the published literature furthermore existing researches mainly focus on theoretical analysis and finite element simulation the full scale experiment of the failure behavior of fiber rtps has rarely been carried out to analysis the real failure behavior of aramid fiber rtp this makes the real failure behaviors of the aramid fiber rtp is unclear in the previous studies the reinforced layers of fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipes consist of contra rotation helically wound tapes chen et al 2017 bai et al 2015b herein the reinforced layers of fiber rtps consist of aramid fiber braided structure which can provide uniform reinforcement for the internal layer and render superior mechanical properties in addition the method to predict the mechanical behavior of fiber reinforced layers under various load conditions is crucial the multi layered composite pipes with contra rotation helically wound components usually considers that the stiffness of reinforced layers is determined by the rule of mixture and the reinforced layer is simplified as a homogenous matrix material zheng et al 2008 gao et al 2020 the aramid fiber braided reinforced layers are modeled by the composite lamination model in this paper which make the braided angle and thickness of the reinforced layer can be accurately simulated the failure of reinforced layers can be analyzed in combination with the failure criteria of composite materials herein the mechanical behavior of aramid fiber rtps is investigated by a combination of numerical simulations and experimental methods the full scale internal pressure busting experiments of 1 inch aramid fiber rtps are carried out to study the failure behavior under extreme internal load the real mechanical properties of each layers were obtained by material test also a finite element model that considers the material nonlinearities is established using abaqus the mechanical behavior of fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipes subjected to internal pressure and tensile load is investigated in detail moreover the influence of braided angle friction coefficient between different layers and load conditions on the mechanical behavior of rtps is analyzed these findings may provide useful guidance during the design and application of fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipes 2 geometry and material property of aramid fiber rtps 2 1 geometrical description the aramid fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipes consist of three functional layers in this paper the internal layer is made of nylon 11 pa11 which isolates the transport medium the reinforced layers consist of aramid fiber braided structure with a braiding angle of 55 shown as fig 2 which meets the comprehensive requirements of internal pressure and tensile load rosenow 1984 the external layer is made of polyurethane pu which mainly protects the other two layers the geometry parameters of aramid fiber rtp are shown as table 1 which are measured by real pipes the inner radius and outer radius of rtp are 26 00 mm and 37 80 mm respectively the fiber reinforced layers consists of 2 braid layers and the thickness of each aramid fiber baraid layer is 2 8 mm the internal layer and external layer of rtp are made by extrusion equipment and the reinforced layers are made by fiber braiding equipment in order to obtain the real material properties of flexible tubes it is necessary to carry out material tests 2 2 material parameters the material uniaxial tensile tests were carried out by electronic universal testing machine to obtain the actual mechanical properties of the aramid fiber and pa11 before the full scale experiment the young s modulus of aramid fiber is 112000 mpa which provided by manufacturers the reinforced layers of rtp are aramid fiber braided structures and uniaxial tensile tests were carried to derive an equivalent strength of aramid fibers b993 1990 test method 1990 the fiber tensile equivalent strength parameters are defined in the composite braided layer of the fe model the aramid fiber specimens were obtained from the pipeline reinforced layers test process is shown as fig 3 the specimens used in the test were the aramid fiber bundle used for braided reinforcement layer which was composed of multiple aramid fibers in the test micrometer was used to measure the diameter of the aramid fiber bundle in the straightening state so as to determine the cross section area of the fiber bundle the ultimate loads of three groups of aramid fibers were tested shown as table 2 there are some differences in the equivalent strength of aramid fiber which is because the influence of processing technology on the aramid fiber reinforced layer which will have an impact on the aramid fiber in the process of forming and weaving the tensile strength of aramid fiber was set as 645 mpa which is a conservative estimate due to safety concerns the internal layer of rtp are made by extrusion equipment which will affect the material properties of the internal layer in order to obtain the actual mechanical properties of the internal layer the tensile test specimens were directly obtained by cutting the internal layer the specimens were flattened to reduce the influence of curvature on the test results the size of pa11 specimen was specified according to the iso527 2012 standard o 527 2012 plastics de 2012 the test speed was adopted as 40 mm min to reveal the stress strain relationship of the pa11 material according to standard as shown in fig 4 when t he strain is relatively small the pa11 exhibits linear elastic behavior when strain exceeds 30 pa11 enters the plastic region and the stress strain curve gradually becomes parallel to the x axis specimen 3 exhibited failure when the stress reaching 42 05 mpa as shown in fig 5 hence the tensile strength of pa11 was set as 42 05 mpa for subsequent numerical simulation analysis curve fitting method is used to obtain the elastic modulus of the pa11 the external layer is made by polyurethane pu which material type is wht 8190 and the material mechanical property of pu were obtained from material manufacturers the material parameters of the 1 inch aramid fiber rtp in this paper are shown as table 3 3 full scale bursting experimental study 3 1 experiment specimen and processes in order to analysis the failure behavior of aramid fiber rtp and determine the bursting internal pressure three groups of internal pressure bursting tests one specimen pipeline for each group of aramid fiber rtp were conducted according to the api spec 17e standard c 17e 2017 specif 2017 the 1 inch aramid fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipe which produced by beijing zhongshida petrochemical technology development co ltd were selected for the internal pressure bursting test the outline of aramid fiber rtp specimen is shown as fig 6 the effective length of pipe is 800 mm 21 times of its outer diameter and the end fittings 240 mm are assembled by the withhold machine rendering a sealing function the end fittings were installed at both end of rtp where one end was fixed at the pressure port and the other end was free the bursting pressure can be obtained by gradually increasing the internal pressure till rtp bursts or leaks the fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipe during the test is shown as fig 7 shanghai puzhong water pressure test bench tpu 100 2b was used for the experiment and the internal pressure load of the pipe is applied by hydrostatic tester the bursting test machine can automatically record the pressure time relationship and plot the corresponding curve a loud bang was heard and a sharp drop in the pressure curve correspond to the failure of rtp resulting in water leakage herein the experiments were carried out at room temperature 3 2 experiment results and analysis the digital photographs of the aramid fiber rtps after internal pressure experiment are shown as fig 8 fig 11 with the increase of internal pressure the pipe is stretched under the action of head force during the first experiment the leakage occurred at the end fitting of pipe with an internal pressure of 70 6 mpa the water inside the pipe leaked out from the end fitting releasing the internal pressure and the aramid fiber rtp is intact therefore the end fittings were tightened in the latter experiments to prevent leakage at end fitting and obtain burst pressure of the pipe based on the result of the first experiment the test steps were repeated to carry out the second internal pressure experiment as shown in fig 9 the aramid braided fiber reinforced layers broke due to internal pressure resulting in the rupture of internal and external layers it can be observed that the bursting point is located near the middle section of the pipe the damage of fiber reinforced layer can be more clearly observed by peeling off the outer layer as shown in fig 10 the breakage traces of aramid fiber indicate the braiding direction of the reinforced layer which is 55 also the plastic deformation of the internal layer occurred in the end fitting these steps were repeated to carry out the third internal pressure experiment and the schematic are shown in fig 11 the bursting point of rtp is located near the end fitting of the pipe which implies that the aramid fiber reinforced layers play a critical role under the internal pressure and both internal and external layers do not resist the internal pressure leading to the unavoidable burst after the rupture of fiber reinforced layers the time pressure relationship of three tests are shown in fig 12 the increasing trend of internal pressure is basically consistent when the internal pressure reaches the bursting pressure the time pressure curve drops sharply indicating that the pipeline leaks the burst and leakage pressure of aramid fiber rtp during the 1st 2nd and 3rd experiments were found to be 70 6 mpa 78 2 mpa and 76 1 mpa respectively shown as table 4 the average burst pressure was found to be 74 96 mpa it can be seen from the three groups of experiments that the typical failure mode of aramid fiber rtp under internal pressure is dictated by the leakage due to fracture of fiber reinforced layers and fracture of the internal layer at the end fitting when the rtp fails aramid fiber layers break and expose from the external layer aramid fiber reinforced layers play a major role in bearing capacity of the rtp therefore the strength of pipeline end fitting should also be considered besides the strength of pipeline structure in practical applications the bursting pressure of aramid rtp in experiment 1 is lower than those in the other two groups which is because of leakage at end fitting the difference of bursting pressure in experiment 2 and experiment 3 is 2 8 which proves the accuracy and repeatability of the experiment this might because the production process is hard to essures complete consistency and might have a certain range of allowable error of bursting pressure furthermore the results of internal pressure bursting experiment can be used to verify the reliability of fe model 4 numerical simulations 4 1 finite element model of aramid fiber rtp the finite element model is established to study the mechanical properties of aramid fiber rtp under complex load conditions the reliability and accuracy of the fe model are verified by the internal pressure bursting experiment results the parameters analysis of the aramid fiber rtp under complex internal pressure and tensile load are developed by numerical simulations the fe model of 1 inch aramid fiber rtp is built based on the existing pipe structure and material parameters the model consists of an internal layer fiber reinforced layers and an external layer the aramid fiber reinforced layer is modeled by a composite material lay up model which can simulate the braided angle and ply thickness of the aramid fiber accurately the fiber reinforced layers consists of 2 braid layers and the thickness of each aramid fiber layer is 1 4 mm the layer angle is defined as 55 according to the braided angle where the red colored lines indicate the fiber direction shown as fig 13 the material parameters of the internal layer are measured by the tensile test considering both elastic and plastic behaviors of the material the yield strength of pa11 is 22 7 mpa and the ultimate tensile strength is found to be 42 05 mpa the material parameters of aramid fiber rtp were shown as table 3 the stress strain inputs of the pa11 material in this simulation are obtained from the uniaxial tensile tests the composite material lay up model of fiber reinforced layer is shown as fig 14 the aramid fiber reinforcement layers are modeled by composite lamination model and the lamina material property is set which is anisotropic the 1 direction is aramid fiber material and the 2 direction is matrix material the matrix is model as pa11 which young s modulus is 525 mpa the material parameters of each direction are shown in table 5 where the e1 e2 represents the elastic modulus in direction 1 and direction 2 μ12 represents poisson ratio g12 g13 g23 represents shear modulus bai et al 2015b the equivalent tensile strength of aramid fiber bundle was determined by uniaxial tensile test the aramid fiber can be treated as linearly elastic with a 112000 mpa young s modulus the minimum value of the tensile force is selected to calculate the tensile strength of fibers which is found to be 645 mpa the composite material lamination is used to model the aramid fiber reinforced layers in the fe model as the commonly used mises yield criterion is no longer applicable to judge the failure of composite materials we should use the failure criteria in composite mechanics trifonov and cherniy 2014 the commonly used failure criteria of composite material is the maximum stress failure criterion shown as follow 1 i f max σ 1 x σ 2 y τ 12 s where i f represents the failure coefficient the material failure when i f 1 σ 1 and σ 2 refers to stress τ 12 denotes the shear stress x and y denote the strength of material in 1 direction and 2 direction s corresponds to shear strength the solid element c3d8r 8 node linear brick reduced integration solid elements is used to model the internal layer and external layer where the thickness and circumferential directions are divided into 3 units and 48 elements respectively the axial mesh size is 2 mm the sc8r continuum shell element is used to model the reinforced layers which can simulate the geometric characteristics of the laminate and improve computational efficiency wang et al 2019 the model is divided into 40536 elements as shown in fig 15 further study revealed that the increase in number of elements renders a little influence on simulation results the boundary conditions of aramid fiber rtp subjected to axisymmetric loads are shown as fig 16 both ends of the flexible pipe are coupled with the reference points i e rp1 and rp2 to establish the deformation consistency and rigidity of the section one end of the pipe is fixed while the tensile load is applied in the z axis direction at the reference point rp2 and internal pressure is applied on the inner surface of internal layer the surface to surface contact is used to simulate the interactions between adjacent layers the normal behavior of interactions is defined as hard contact with allow separation after contact the tangential behavior is defined as penalty and the friction coefficient is set as 0 1 dai et al 2017 4 2 verification of the finite element model the fe model is used to simulate the process of internal pressure burst experiment of rtp which can assess the accuracy and reliability of model by comparing with the experimental results the internal pressure is applied at the inner surface and the end plate of rtp which because that the end force should be considered at the free end fitting as shown in fig 17 and one end of the pipe is fixed the end plate constrains the translational degrees of freedom in the x and y directions relaxing the other degrees of freedom based on the experimental results the aramid fiber rtp s burst pressure is 76 1 mpa which is considered as internal pressure load during simulations the maximum stress failure criterion coefficient mstrs of the reinforced layer is shown as fig 18 which is 1 10 and implies that the maximum failure stress is 585 4 mpa the difference between simulated and experimental results is around 10 which is acceptable in engineering applications and confirms the reliability of the fe model the maximum mises stress of the internal layer under the internal pressure of 76 1 mpa is 22 73 mpa as shown in fig 19 representing the plastic deformation stage the bearing capacity of the internal layer decreases after entering the plastic state and the mstrs of internal reinforced layer is large than outer reinforced layer which means that the internal reinforced layer will fail first when the aramid fiber reinforced layers are damaged the internal layer will also damage and lead to pipeline leakage the mises stress of external pu layer is 0 302 mpa shown as fig 20 which is relatively small it can be noticed that the fiber reinforced layers play a major role under internal pressure load 4 3 numerical analysis of aramid fiber rtp under internal pressure and tensile load the internal pressure and tensile load are primary loads on aramid fiber rtp during operation the fe model of a 1 inch aramid fiber rtp under the combined internal pressure and tensile load is studied in this part the internal pressure is set as 35 mpa which is the design operating internal pressure of aramid fiber rtp the axial load received by the flexible pipe is mainly due to its own gravity and wave load and the design tensile load is 5 tons 50 kn the tensile load is applied in the z axis direction at reference point rp2 the internal pressure remained constant during the loading process the mises stress of the internal layer and reinforced layers under internal pressure and combined load are shown in fig 21 fig 22 it can be seen that the maximum mises stress of the internal layer under 35 mpa internal pressure is 17 23 mpa which is still in the elastic deformation stage the mises stress is uniformly distributed along the axial direction the braided fiber structure of the reinforcement layer plays a major role under tensile loading the maximum stress failure criterion coefficient of the reinforced layer under 35 mpa internal pressure is found to be 0 426 whereas the mstrs of the outer reinforced layer is 0 332 which is smaller than the internal reinforcement layer the maximum mises stress of the internal layer is found to be 22 71 mpa under internal pressure of 35 mpa and tensile load of 5 tons which corresponds to the plastic deformation stage the maximum stress failure criterion coefficient of the internal reinforced layer is found to be 0 693 which is obviously greater than the internal pressure load condition hence the tensile load will influence the internal pressure load bearing capability of fiber rtp significantly in order to analyze the tensile stiffness of aramid fiber rtps under the combined internal pressure and axial tensile load the tensile load elongation curve of aramid fiber was obtained by applying 14 mm axial displacement load at one end of the pipe on the basis of applying 35 mpa internal pressure load the tension extension relationship of aramid fiber rtp under the combined load of internal pressure and tensile load is shown in fig 23 it can be readily observed that the aramid fiber rtp shows elastic deformation stage when the tensile displacement is small and the tension extension relationship remains linear with the increase of tensile displacement the tensile load becomes gentle which is because the internal layer enters the plastic deformation stage the load capacity reduces also when the axial displacement is too large the ability of aramid fiber rtp to resist tensile load is reduced the tensile load is 60 76 kn when the extension is 14 mm moreover the internal pressure will influence the tensile stiffness of aramid fiber rtps the extension tensile load curves of aramid fiber rtps under a constant tensile load and different internal pressures are shown in fig 24 the variation trend of tension extension curve under different internal pressure is basically consistent it can be seen that the tensile stiffness of rtp increases with the increase of internal pressure this is because the fiber reinforced layer is designed to withstand the internal pressure and tensile load the increase of internal pressure will increases the contribution of aramid fiber and improve the ability to resist the tensile load besides the poisson effect of pipe deformation under internal pressure will increase the tensile load bearing capacity therefore the combined load of internal pressure and tensile load affects the load bearing capability and tensile stiffness of rtp which should be considered during practical applications 5 parameters analysis in this section the influence of different parameters of aramid fiber rtp such as braided angle the friction coefficient between layers and tensile load on mechanical properties is analyzed by various case studies so that provide useful guidelines for design and operation process 5 1 influence of braided angle aramid fiber rtp will encounter a variety of load conditions in the application process and the requirements for the internal pressure bearing capacity and axial tensile stiffness will change in order to analyze the effect of braided angle of fiber reinforced layers on mechanical properties of the flexible pipe and give the variation trend of rtp bearing capacity and tensile stiffness quantitatively the finite element model is modified with braiding angle of 45 55 65 and 75 the results of braided angle analysis can be referenced in the design process to accommodate the pipe into different load conditions the change in mises stress of internal layer and mstrs of fiber reinforced layers under internal pressure are shown in fig 25 fig 27 the braided angle will influence the mechanical properties of aramid fiber rtp significantly it can be seen that the mises stress of the internal layer decrease with the increasing braiding angle of the fiber reinforced layers when the braided angle is 45 the internal layer enters the plastic deformation stage under 25 mpa internal pressure the mstrs of fiber reinforced layers decreased with increasing braided angle this is because the contribution of the aramid fiber of rtp will increase with the increase of braided angle the difference in mstrs of reinforced layers with 55 65 and 75 braided angles is relatively small because circumferential stiffness and internal pressure resistance increased with increasing braided angle the mechanical properties of four aramid fiber rtps under internal pressure and tensile load were analyzed using the tension extension relationship as shown in fig 28 it is demonstrated that the stiffness of aramid fiber rtps to resist the axial tensile deformation increased with the decrease of braided angle which implies that the braided angle of reinforced layers significantly influences the tensile stiffness the tension load of rtp with a braiding angle of 45 and 75 under an extension of 14 mm was found to be 11 72t and 2 84t respectively as excessive axial deformation will lead to failure the relationship between axial stiffness and internal pressure resistance should be comprehensively considered based on different load conditions during the determination of braiding angle considering the mises stress of internal layer mstrs of fiber reinforced layers and axial tensile stiffness the recommended angle of rtp under the analysis condition 35 mpa internal pressure and 5t tensile load is 55 however with the increase of water depth of flexible pipe application it is required to improve the rtp axial tensile stiffness and it is recommended to increase the braided angle 5 2 effect of friction coefficient between layers in this section the effect of friction coefficient between layers is investigated the friction coefficient between the pa11 aramid fiber and aramid fiber pu is changed whereas the friction coefficients between the internal layer fiber reinforced layers and external layer are set as 0 1 0 8 fang et al 2019 the mises stress of internal layer under internal pressure with different friction coefficients is shown in fig 29 it can be seen that the friction coefficient renders a little effect on mechanical properties of aramid fiber rtps and the mises stress of internal layer decreases slightly with the increase of friction coefficient this is because that the non bonding and contact between the functional layers of the flexible pipe there will be friction when deformed by internal pressure and tensile load thus slightly affecting the mechanical properties of the aramid fiber rtp in the study of rtp mechanical properties the influence of friction coefficient between can be approximately ignored 5 3 effect of tensile load as previously discussed the tensile load will affect the load bearing capability of aramid fiber rtp under internal pressure which decreases with the increasing of tensile load ramos and pesce 2004 bahtui and alfano 2007 the mises stress of internal layer and mstrs of fiber reinforced layers under internal pressure of 35 mpa and different tensile loads are shown in fig 30 fig 32 the mises stress of the internal layer increases with tensile load where the internal layer will enter the plastic deformation stage under a tensile load of 4t moreover the mstrs of fiber reinforced layers approximate linearly increased with the increase of tensile load when the tensile load is 11 63t the mstrs of fiber reinforced layer reaches 1 which indicates the failure of rtp the influence of tensile load on load bearing capacity under internal pressure should be considered during the design of aramid fiber rtps 6 conclusions in summary the mechanical behavior of aramid fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipe has been investigated using numerical simulation and experimental study the internal pressure bursting experiment of 1 inch aramid fiber rtps has been carried out to investigate the typical failure modes and ultimate burst pressure of aramid fiber rtps the finite element model which describes the mechanical behavior of aramid fiber rtps under internal pressure and tensile load is established the main conclusions can be summarized as 1 the ultimate burst pressure of 1 inch aramid fiber rtp was found to be 78 2 mpa and 76 1 mpa respectively the failure modes of the aramid fiber rtp under internal pressure include the fracture of fiber reinforced layers and rupture of internal layer at the end fitting therefore the strength of both fiber reinforced layers and internal layer in end fitting should be considered to prevent leakage 2 the braided fiber structure of reinforced layers played a major role in load bearing capacity under internal pressure and tensile load with the increase of tensile load the tension extension trend became gentle also the tensile stiffness of rtp increased with the increase of internal pressure which should be considered during the design and practical applications 3 the braiding angle rendered an obvious influence on mechanical properties of the aramid fiber rtp under internal pressure and tensile load the circumferential stiffness and internal pressure resistance of rtp increased with the increase of braided angle whereas the tensile stiffness decreased with increasing braiding angle the relationship between axial stiffness and internal pressure resistance should be comprehensively considered during braiding angle selection 4 additionally the friction coefficient exhibited a little effect on the mechanical properties of the aramid fiber rtps the tensile load affected the resistance of rtps towards the internal pressure the internal layer entered the plastic deformation stage under a tensile load of 4 tons whereas the aramid fiber rtp failed at 11 63 tons the influence of tensile load on load bearing capacity under internal pressure should be considered during practical applications overall the established finite element model reliably provides useful guidelines for the initial design and strength evaluation of aramid fiber rtps credit authorship

properties of fiber reinforced rtps whereas the mechanical behavior remains insensitive to friction coefficient between layers moreover the synergistic influence of internal pressure and tensile load significantly affects the mechanical behavior of fiber reinforced rtps the current study shall serve as a reference for the design and application of fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipes in marine oil and gas production keywords reinforced thermoplastic pipe mechanical behaviors bursting experiment internal pressure finite element analysis 1 introduction the utilization of fiber reinforced polymers frp in the oil and gas industry is steadily increasing due to their numerous advantages over steel pipe including excellent corrosion resistance good fatigue resistance easy to design and lightweight bai et al 2017a parandoush and lin 2017 the reinforced thermoplastic pipes rtps consist of a multilayer pipeline structure with internal polymeric layer reinforced layers and external layer the rtps

rtps and reinforcement wires under tensile load and internal pressure bai et al 2015a established a theoretical model to estimate the tensile stiffness of rtp under axisymmetric loads and developed an fe model to verify the reliability of theoretical model yu et al 2015 have studied the mechanical behavior of pe based rtps under the synergistic influence of external pressure and bending moment through finite element analysis however the internal layer and reinforced layers of rtps are considered as elastic material in most of the published literature furthermore existing researches mainly focus on theoretical analysis and finite element simulation the full scale experiment of the failure behavior of fiber rtps has rarely been carried out to analysis the real failure behavior of aramid fiber rtp this makes the real failure behaviors of the aramid fiber rtp is unclear in the previous studies the reinforced layers of fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipes consist of contra rotation helically wound tapes chen et al 2017 bai et al 2015b herein the reinforced layers of fiber rtps consist of aramid fiber braided structure which can provide uniform reinforcement for the internal layer and render superior mechanical properties in addition the method to predict the mechanical behavior of fiber reinforced layers under various load conditions is crucial the multi layered composite pipes with contra rotation helically wound components usually considers that the stiffness of reinforced layers is determined by the rule of mixture and the reinforced layer is simplified as a homogenous matrix material zheng et al 2008 gao et al 2020 the aramid fiber braided reinforced layers are modeled by the composite lamination model in this paper which make the braided angle and thickness of the reinforced layer can be accurately simulated the failure of reinforced layers can be analyzed in combination with the failure criteria of composite materials herein the mechanical behavior of aramid fiber rtps is investigated by a combination of numerical simulations and experimental methods the full scale internal pressure busting experiments of 1 inch aramid fiber rtps are carried out to study the failure behavior under extreme internal load the real mechanical properties of each layers were obtained by material test also a finite element model that considers the material nonlinearities is established using abaqus the mechanical behavior of fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipes subjected to internal pressure and tensile load is investigated in detail moreover the influence of braided angle friction coefficient between different layers and load conditions on the mechanical behavior of rtps is analyzed these findings may provide useful guidance during the design and application of fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipes 2 geometry and material property of aramid fiber rtps 2 1 geometrical description the aramid fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipes consist of three functional layers in this paper the internal layer is made of nylon 11 pa11 which isolates the transport medium the reinforced layers consist of aramid fiber braided structure with a braiding angle of 55 shown as fig 2 which meets the comprehensive requirements of internal pressure and tensile load rosenow 1984 the external layer is made of polyurethane pu which mainly protects the other two layers the geometry parameters of aramid fiber rtp are shown as table 1 which are measured by real pipes the inner radius and outer radius of rtp are 26 00 mm and 37 80 mm respectively the fiber reinforced layers consists of 2 braid layers and the thickness of each aramid fiber baraid layer is 2 8 mm the internal layer and external layer of rtp are made by extrusion equipment and the reinforced layers are made by fiber braiding equipment in order to obtain the real material properties of flexible tubes it is necessary to carry out material tests 2 2 material parameters the material uniaxial tensile tests were carried out by electronic universal testing machine to obtain the actual mechanical properties of the aramid fiber and pa11 before the full scale experiment the young s modulus of aramid fiber is 112000 mpa which provided by manufacturers the reinforced layers of rtp are aramid fiber braided structures and uniaxial tensile tests were carried to derive an equivalent strength of aramid fibers b993 1990 test method 1990 the fiber tensile equivalent strength parameters are defined in the composite braided layer of the fe model the aramid fiber specimens were obtained from the pipeline reinforced layers test process is shown as fig 3 the specimens used in the test were the aramid fiber bundle used for braided reinforcement layer which was composed of multiple aramid fibers in the test micrometer was used to measure the diameter of the aramid fiber bundle in the straightening state so as to determine the cross section area of the fiber bundle the ultimate loads of three groups of aramid fibers were tested shown as table 2 there are some differences in the equivalent strength of aramid fiber which is because the influence of processing technology on the aramid fiber reinforced layer which will have an impact on the aramid fiber in the process of forming and weaving the tensile strength of aramid fiber was set as 645 mpa which is a conservative estimate due to safety concerns the internal layer of rtp are made by extrusion equipment which will affect the material properties of the internal layer in order to obtain the actual mechanical properties of the internal layer the tensile test specimens were directly obtained by cutting the internal layer the specimens were flattened to reduce the influence of curvature on the test results the size of pa11 specimen was specified according to the iso527 2012 standard o 527 2012 plastics de 2012 the test speed was adopted as 40 mm min to reveal the stress strain relationship of the pa11 material according to standard as shown in fig 4 when t he strain is relatively small the pa11 exhibits linear elastic behavior when strain exceeds 30 pa11 enters the plastic region and the stress strain curve gradually becomes parallel to the x axis specimen 3 exhibited failure when the stress reaching 42 05 mpa as shown in fig 5 hence the tensile strength of pa11 was set as 42 05 mpa for subsequent numerical simulation analysis curve fitting method is used to obtain the elastic modulus of the pa11 the external layer is made by polyurethane pu which material type is wht 8190 and the material mechanical property of pu were obtained from material manufacturers the material parameters of the 1 inch aramid fiber rtp in this paper are shown as table 3 3 full scale bursting experimental study 3 1 experiment specimen and processes in order to analysis the failure behavior of aramid fiber rtp and determine the bursting internal pressure three groups of internal pressure bursting tests one specimen pipeline for each group of aramid fiber rtp were conducted according to the api spec 17e standard c 17e 2017 specif 2017 the 1 inch aramid fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipe which produced by beijing zhongshida petrochemical technology development co ltd were selected for the internal pressure bursting test the outline of aramid fiber rtp specimen is shown as fig 6 the effective length of pipe is 800 mm 21 times of its outer diameter and the end fittings 240 mm are assembled by the withhold machine rendering a sealing function the end fittings were installed at both end of rtp where one end was fixed at the pressure port and the other end was free the bursting pressure can be obtained by gradually increasing the internal pressure till rtp bursts or leaks the fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipe during the test is shown as fig 7 shanghai puzhong water pressure test bench tpu 100 2b was used for the experiment and the internal pressure load of the pipe is applied by hydrostatic tester the bursting test machine can automatically record the pressure time relationship and plot the corresponding curve a loud bang was heard and a sharp drop in the pressure curve correspond to the failure of rtp resulting in water leakage herein the experiments were carried out at room temperature 3 2 experiment results and analysis the digital photographs of the aramid fiber rtps after internal pressure experiment are shown as fig 8 fig 11 with the increase of internal pressure the pipe is stretched under the action of head force during the first experiment the leakage occurred at the end fitting of pipe with an internal pressure of 70 6 mpa the water inside the pipe leaked out from the end fitting releasing the internal pressure and the aramid fiber rtp is intact therefore the end fittings were tightened in the latter experiments to prevent leakage at end fitting and obtain burst pressure of the pipe based on the result of the first experiment the test steps were repeated to carry out the second internal pressure experiment as shown in fig 9 the aramid braided fiber reinforced layers broke due to internal pressure resulting in the rupture of internal and external layers it can be observed that the bursting point is located near the middle section of the pipe the damage of fiber reinforced layer can be more clearly observed by peeling off the outer layer as shown in fig 10 the breakage traces of aramid fiber indicate the braiding direction of the reinforced layer which is 55 also the plastic deformation of the internal layer occurred in the end fitting these steps were repeated to carry out the third internal pressure experiment and the schematic are shown in fig 11 the bursting point of rtp is located near the end fitting of the pipe which implies that the aramid fiber reinforced layers play a critical role under the internal pressure and both internal and external layers do not resist the internal pressure leading to the unavoidable burst after the rupture of fiber reinforced layers the time pressure relationship of three tests are shown in fig 12 the increasing trend of internal pressure is basically consistent when the internal pressure reaches the bursting pressure the time pressure curve drops sharply indicating that the pipeline leaks the burst and leakage pressure of aramid fiber rtp during the 1st 2nd and 3rd experiments were found to be 70 6 mpa 78 2 mpa and 76 1 mpa respectively shown as table 4 the average burst pressure was found to be 74 96 mpa it can be seen from the three groups of experiments that the typical failure mode of aramid fiber rtp under internal pressure is dictated by the leakage due to fracture of fiber reinforced layers and fracture of the internal layer at the end fitting when the rtp fails aramid fiber layers break and expose from the external layer aramid fiber reinforced layers play a major role in bearing capacity of the rtp therefore the strength of pipeline end fitting should also be considered besides the strength of pipeline structure in practical applications the bursting pressure of aramid rtp in experiment 1 is lower than those in the other two groups which is because of leakage at end fitting the difference of bursting pressure in experiment 2 and experiment 3 is 2 8 which proves the accuracy and repeatability of the experiment this might because the production process is hard to essures complete consistency and might have a certain range of allowable error of bursting pressure furthermore the results of internal pressure bursting experiment can be used to verify the reliability of fe model 4 numerical simulations 4 1 finite element model of aramid fiber rtp the finite element model is established to study the mechanical properties of aramid fiber rtp under complex load conditions the reliability and accuracy of the fe model are verified by the internal pressure bursting experiment results the parameters analysis of the aramid fiber rtp under complex internal pressure and tensile load are developed by numerical simulations the fe model of 1 inch aramid fiber rtp is built based on the existing pipe structure and material parameters the model consists of an internal layer fiber reinforced layers and an external layer the aramid fiber reinforced layer is modeled by a composite material lay up model which can simulate the braided angle and ply thickness of the aramid fiber accurately the fiber reinforced layers consists of 2 braid layers and the thickness of each aramid fiber layer is 1 4 mm the layer angle is defined as 55 according to the braided angle where the red colored lines indicate the fiber direction shown as fig 13 the material parameters of the internal layer are measured by the tensile test considering both elastic and plastic behaviors of the material the yield strength of pa11 is 22 7 mpa and the ultimate tensile strength is found to be 42 05 mpa the material parameters of aramid fiber rtp were shown as table 3 the stress strain inputs of the pa11 material in this simulation are obtained from the uniaxial tensile tests the composite material lay up model of fiber reinforced layer is shown as fig 14 the aramid fiber reinforcement layers are modeled by composite lamination model and the lamina material property is set which is anisotropic the 1 direction is aramid fiber material and the 2 direction is matrix material the matrix is model as pa11 which young s modulus is 525 mpa the material parameters of each direction are shown in table 5 where the e1 e2 represents the elastic modulus in direction 1 and direction 2 μ12 represents poisson ratio g12 g13 g23 represents shear modulus bai et al 2015b the equivalent tensile strength of aramid fiber bundle was determined by uniaxial tensile test the aramid fiber can be treated as linearly elastic with a 112000 mpa young s modulus the minimum value of the tensile force is selected to calculate the tensile strength of fibers which is found to be 645 mpa the composite material lamination is used to model the aramid fiber reinforced layers in the fe model as the commonly used mises yield criterion is no longer applicable to judge the failure of composite materials we should use the failure criteria in composite mechanics trifonov and cherniy 2014 the commonly used failure criteria of composite material is the maximum stress failure criterion shown as follow 1 i f max σ 1 x σ 2 y τ 12 s where i f represents the failure coefficient the material failure when i f 1 σ 1 and σ 2 refers to stress τ 12 denotes the shear stress x and y denote the strength of material in 1 direction and 2 direction s corresponds to shear strength the solid element c3d8r 8 node linear brick reduced integration solid elements is used to model the internal layer and external layer where the thickness and circumferential directions are divided into 3 units and 48 elements respectively the axial mesh size is 2 mm the sc8r continuum shell element is used to model the reinforced layers which can simulate the geometric characteristics of the laminate and improve computational efficiency wang et al 2019 the model is divided into 40536 elements as shown in fig 15 further study revealed that the increase in number of elements renders a little influence on simulation results the boundary conditions of aramid fiber rtp subjected to axisymmetric loads are shown as fig 16 both ends of the flexible pipe are coupled with the reference points i e rp1 and rp2 to establish the deformation consistency and rigidity of the section one end of the pipe is fixed while the tensile load is applied in the z axis direction at the reference point rp2 and internal pressure is applied on the inner surface of internal layer the surface to surface contact is used to simulate the interactions between adjacent layers the normal behavior of interactions is defined as hard contact with allow separation after contact the tangential behavior is defined as penalty and the friction coefficient is set as 0 1 dai et al 2017 4 2 verification of the finite element model the fe model is used to simulate the process of internal pressure burst experiment of rtp which can assess the accuracy and reliability of model by comparing with the experimental results the internal pressure is applied at the inner surface and the end plate of rtp which because that the end force should be considered at the free end fitting as shown in fig 17 and one end of the pipe is fixed the end plate constrains the translational degrees of freedom in the x and y directions relaxing the other degrees of freedom based on the experimental results the aramid fiber rtp s burst pressure is 76 1 mpa which is considered as internal pressure load during simulations the maximum stress failure criterion coefficient mstrs of the reinforced layer is shown as fig 18 which is 1 10 and implies that the maximum failure stress is 585 4 mpa the difference between simulated and experimental results is around 10 which is acceptable in engineering applications and confirms the reliability of the fe model the maximum mises stress of the internal layer under the internal pressure of 76 1 mpa is 22 73 mpa as shown in fig 19 representing the plastic deformation stage the bearing capacity of the internal layer decreases after entering the plastic state and the mstrs of internal reinforced layer is large than outer reinforced layer which means that the internal reinforced layer will fail first when the aramid fiber reinforced layers are damaged the internal layer will also damage and lead to pipeline leakage the mises stress of external pu layer is 0 302 mpa shown as fig 20 which is relatively small it can be noticed that the fiber reinforced layers play a major role under internal pressure load 4 3 numerical analysis of aramid fiber rtp under internal pressure and tensile load the internal pressure and tensile load are primary loads on aramid fiber rtp during operation the fe model of a 1 inch aramid fiber rtp under the combined internal pressure and tensile load is studied in this part the internal pressure is set as 35 mpa which is the design operating internal pressure of aramid fiber rtp the axial load received by the flexible pipe is mainly due to its own gravity and wave load and the design tensile load is 5 tons 50 kn the tensile load is applied in the z axis direction at reference point rp2 the internal pressure remained constant during the loading process the mises stress of the internal layer and reinforced layers under internal pressure and combined load are shown in fig 21 fig 22 it can be seen that the maximum mises stress of the internal layer under 35 mpa internal pressure is 17 23 mpa which is still in the elastic deformation stage the mises stress is uniformly distributed along the axial direction the braided fiber structure of the reinforcement layer plays a major role under tensile loading the maximum stress failure criterion coefficient of the reinforced layer under 35 mpa internal pressure is found to be 0 426 whereas the mstrs of the outer reinforced layer is 0 332 which is smaller than the internal reinforcement layer the maximum mises stress of the internal layer is found to be 22 71 mpa under internal pressure of 35 mpa and tensile load of 5 tons which corresponds to the plastic deformation stage the maximum stress failure criterion coefficient of the internal reinforced layer is found to be 0 693 which is obviously greater than the internal pressure load condition hence the tensile load will influence the internal pressure load bearing capability of fiber rtp significantly in order to analyze the tensile stiffness of aramid fiber rtps under the combined internal pressure and axial tensile load the tensile load elongation curve of aramid fiber was obtained by applying 14 mm axial displacement load at one end of the pipe on the basis of applying 35 mpa internal pressure load the tension extension relationship of aramid fiber rtp under the combined load of internal pressure and tensile load is shown in fig 23 it can be readily observed that the aramid fiber rtp shows elastic deformation stage when the tensile displacement is small and the tension extension relationship remains linear with the increase of tensile displacement the tensile load becomes gentle which is because the internal layer enters the plastic deformation stage the load capacity reduces also when the axial displacement is too large the ability of aramid fiber rtp to resist tensile load is reduced the tensile load is 60 76 kn when the extension is 14 mm moreover the internal pressure will influence the tensile stiffness of aramid fiber rtps the extension tensile load curves of aramid fiber rtps under a constant tensile load and different internal pressures are shown in fig 24 the variation trend of tension extension curve under different internal pressure is basically consistent it can be seen that the tensile stiffness of rtp increases with the increase of internal pressure this is because the fiber reinforced layer is designed to withstand the internal pressure and tensile load the increase of internal pressure will increases the contribution of aramid fiber and improve the ability to resist the tensile load besides the poisson effect of pipe deformation under internal pressure will increase the tensile load bearing capacity therefore the combined load of internal pressure and tensile load affects the load bearing capability and tensile stiffness of rtp which should be considered during practical applications 5 parameters analysis in this section the influence of different parameters of aramid fiber rtp such as braided angle the friction coefficient between layers and tensile load on mechanical properties is analyzed by various case studies so that provide useful guidelines for design and operation process 5 1 influence of braided angle aramid fiber rtp will encounter a variety of load conditions in the application process and the requirements for the internal pressure bearing capacity and axial tensile stiffness will change in order to analyze the effect of braided angle of fiber reinforced layers on mechanical properties of the flexible pipe and give the variation trend of rtp bearing capacity and tensile stiffness quantitatively the finite element model is modified with braiding angle of 45 55 65 and 75 the results of braided angle analysis can be referenced in the design process to accommodate the pipe into different load conditions the change in mises stress of internal layer and mstrs of fiber reinforced layers under internal pressure are shown in fig 25 fig 27 the braided angle will influence the mechanical properties of aramid fiber rtp significantly it can be seen that the mises stress of the internal layer decrease with the increasing braiding angle of the fiber reinforced layers when the braided angle is 45 the internal layer enters the plastic deformation stage under 25 mpa internal pressure the mstrs of fiber reinforced layers decreased with increasing braided angle this is because the contribution of the aramid fiber of rtp will increase with the increase of braided angle the difference in mstrs of reinforced layers with 55 65 and 75 braided angles is relatively small because circumferential stiffness and internal pressure resistance increased with increasing braided angle the mechanical properties of four aramid fiber rtps under internal pressure and tensile load were analyzed using the tension extension relationship as shown in fig 28 it is demonstrated that the stiffness of aramid fiber rtps to resist the axial tensile deformation increased with the decrease of braided angle which implies that the braided angle of reinforced layers significantly influences the tensile stiffness the tension load of rtp with a braiding angle of 45 and 75 under an extension of 14 mm was found to be 11 72t and 2 84t respectively as excessive axial deformation will lead to failure the relationship between axial stiffness and internal pressure resistance should be comprehensively considered based on different load conditions during the determination of braiding angle considering the mises stress of internal layer mstrs of fiber reinforced layers and axial tensile stiffness the recommended angle of rtp under the analysis condition 35 mpa internal pressure and 5t tensile load is 55 however with the increase of water depth of flexible pipe application it is required to improve the rtp axial tensile stiffness and it is recommended to increase the braided angle 5 2 effect of friction coefficient between layers in this section the effect of friction coefficient between layers is investigated the friction coefficient between the pa11 aramid fiber and aramid fiber pu is changed whereas the friction coefficients between the internal layer fiber reinforced layers and external layer are set as 0 1 0 8 fang et al 2019 the mises stress of internal layer under internal pressure with different friction coefficients is shown in fig 29 it can be seen that the friction coefficient renders a little effect on mechanical properties of aramid fiber rtps and the mises stress of internal layer decreases slightly with the increase of friction coefficient this is because that the non bonding and contact between the functional layers of the flexible pipe there will be friction when deformed by internal pressure and tensile load thus slightly affecting the mechanical properties of the aramid fiber rtp in the study of rtp mechanical properties the influence of friction coefficient between can be approximately ignored 5 3 effect of tensile load as previously discussed the tensile load will affect the load bearing capability of aramid fiber rtp under internal pressure which decreases with the increasing of tensile load ramos and pesce 2004 bahtui and alfano 2007 the mises stress of internal layer and mstrs of fiber reinforced layers under internal pressure of 35 mpa and different tensile loads are shown in fig 30 fig 32 the mises stress of the internal layer increases with tensile load where the internal layer will enter the plastic deformation stage under a tensile load of 4t moreover the mstrs of fiber reinforced layers approximate linearly increased with the increase of tensile load when the tensile load is 11 63t the mstrs of fiber reinforced layer reaches 1 which indicates the failure of rtp the influence of tensile load on load bearing capacity under internal pressure should be considered during the design of aramid fiber rtps 6 conclusions in summary the mechanical behavior of aramid fiber reinforced thermoplastic pipe has been investigated using numerical simulation and experimental study the internal pressure bursting experiment of 1 inch aramid fiber rtps has been carried out to investigate the typical failure modes and ultimate burst pressure of aramid fiber rtps the finite element model which describes the mechanical behavior of aramid fiber rtps under internal pressure and tensile load is established the main conclusions can be summarized as 1 the ultimate burst pressure of 1 inch aramid fiber rtp was found to be 78 2 mpa and 76 1 mpa respectively the failure modes of the aramid fiber rtp under internal pressure include the fracture of fiber reinforced layers and rupture of internal layer at the end fitting therefore the strength of both fiber reinforced layers and internal layer in end fitting should be considered to prevent leakage 2 the braided fiber structure of reinforced layers played a major role in load bearing capacity under internal pressure and tensile load with the increase of tensile load the tension extension trend became gentle also the tensile stiffness of rtp increased with the increase of internal pressure which should be considered during the design and practical applications 3 the braiding angle rendered an obvious influence on mechanical properties of the aramid fiber rtp under internal pressure and tensile load the circumferential stiffness and internal pressure resistance of rtp increased with the increase of braided angle whereas the tensile stiffness decreased with increasing braiding angle the relationship between axial stiffness and internal pressure resistance should be comprehensively considered during braiding angle selection 4 additionally the friction coefficient exhibited a little effect on the mechanical properties of the aramid fiber rtps the tensile load affected the resistance of rtps towards the internal pressure the internal layer entered the plastic deformation stage under a tensile load of 4 tons whereas the aramid fiber rtp failed at 11 63 tons the influence of tensile load on load bearing capacity under internal pressure should be considered during practical applications overall the established finite element model reliably provides useful guidelines for the initial design and strength evaluation of aramid fiber rtps credit authorship

20396,different spacing cases l b 2 6 are numerically examined to identify the spacing effect on the two degree of freedom vortex induced vibration viv of two tandem square cylinders at re 150 according to the various vibration responses force characteristics and flow patterns spacing cases can be divided into three different situations at a small spacing l b 2 2 5 the upstream cylinder uc has no traditional lock in region the frequency ratio f y f n 0 95 1 05 and the reduced velocity v r 6 and the downstream cylinder dc has a narrow lock in region however there is a wide soft lock in region the synchronization region of f y f n 0 85 at high reduced velocities v r 9 5 12 for both cylinders in this region both cylinders experience large amplitude transverse vibrations with the uc exhibiting a higher amplitude at a moderate spacing l b 3 4 the uc does not exhibit lock in or soft lock in regions similar to a single cylinder at the same mass ratio and the dc exhibits a relatively wide lock in region v r 5 5 8 instead of a soft lock in region notably two amplitude peaks appear within the lock in region for the dc depending on v r at a large spacing l b 5 6 the amplitude of the dc is typically higher than that of a single cylinder even within the narrow lock in region keywords two tandem square cylinders vortex induced vibration viv spacing effect soft lock in region numerical simulation 1 introduction the vortex induced vibration viv of cylindrical structures with large slenderness ratios is frequently observed in several engineering fields when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the natural frequency of the structure the amplitude of the structure sharply rises eventually causing fatigue damage viv has attracted considerable interest due to its engineering and academic value bearman 2011 blevins 1990 parkinson 1989 sarpkaya 2004 sumer 2006 williamson and govardhan 2004 it is generally accepted that viv is an undesirable phenomenon causing local and global instabilities however with the rapid development of science and technology many researchers have leveraged the principles of viv to harvest ocean energy and wind energy to provide theoretical guidance for further development and to improve energy harvesting devices an increasing number of scholars have comprehensively analyzed the viv of different structures to clarify their dynamic characteristics and vibration mechanisms wu et al 2013 bernitsas 2008 raghavan and bernitsas 2011 ding et al 2016 to decrease their shape complexities most bluff bodies in engineering practice are reasonably simplified as typical shapes including circular cylinders and square cylinders therefore many studies have been performed on the viv of a single cylinder with these typical cylinder shapes jauvtis and williamson 2004 mittal and kumar 1999 sen and mittal 2015 compared with the vibration characteristics of a circular cylinder a square cylinder immersed in a flow displays both viv and galloping depending on the reduced velocity v r bearman et al 1987 bearman 1984 luo 1992 in addition the continuously increasing application of multicylinder systems is evident in various engineering fields among them multicylinder systems with square cylinders are widely employed in marine engineering particularly for offshore floating bodies such as semi submersible and tension leg platforms det norske veritas 2010 guan and jaiman 2017 however the flow fields around the cylinders interfere with each other causing the vibration responses to differ from that of a single cylinder consequently in the field of offshore engineering there is a growing need to fundamentally understand and optimize the flow induced loads and flow induced motions of multicylinder floating structures as the simplest form of the multicylinder system the two cylinder system needs to be studied additionally it is important to understand the factors that affect the viv of two cylinders such as the spacing ratio l b mass ratio m degrees of freedom and reynolds number re critical nondimensional parameters including the mass ratio m reynolds number re and reduced velocity v r are defined as follows m m ρ b 2 r e ρ v b μ a n d v r v f n b where m is the mass per unit length of the cylinder ρ is the fluid density v is the free stream velocity μ is the fluid kinematic viscosity and f n is the natural frequency of the structure in addition b is the characteristic length which is the side length of the square cylinder in the case of viv many studies have previously concentrated on the structures of two circular cylinders such as parallel slings split conductors and ocean risers in contrast research on the viv of two square cylinders is insufficient several scholars have considered the viv of two square cylinders numerically and experimentally with different arrangements because the viv characteristics of the two cylinders vary with the array notably viv based studies have been conducted on two square cylinders regarding the viv of bluff bodies with staggered side by side and tandem arrangements considering the different arrangements gowda and kumar 2006 kumar and gowda 2006 and kumar et al 2008 studied the interference effect of a fixed downstream cylinder dc on the vibration of an upstream cylinder uc the results showed that the uc arranged in tandem with a small spacing exhibited the maximum amplitude in the transverse direction guan and jaiman 2017 studied the viv of two rigidly connected cylinders and successfully observed four distinct flow regimes it is well established that the viv of two square cylinders in tandem is highly dependent on the distance l between the centroids of the two cylinders with the change in the distance l three kinds of flow regimes occur for two fixed square cylinders namely the single body regime reattachment regime and co shedding regime as shown in fig 1 scholars have analyzed the spacing effect of viv on two cylinders in tandem but most of these studies have been subject to limitations namely considering the degrees of freedom of square cylinders mithun and tiwari 2014 studied two tandem cylinders with a fixed amplitude and the same phase vibration in the transverse direction yielding a reynolds number of 100 the influence of the transverse vibration frequency on the flow induced forces and flow field structures with different distances l was studied as well it was found that at l 3b 4b the vortex shedding mode of the two cylinders changed from 2s to 2p bhatt and alam 2018 carried out numerical simulations to analyze the operating case in which the upstream square cylinder was fixed while the downstream square cylinder could freely vibrate in the transverse direction and the study was conducted at re 100 and 200 these researchers pointed out that the gap flow exerted a major impact on the vibration response of the downstream square cylinder when l 2b and 6b patil and tiwari 2009 and more et al 2015 studied the interference effect of a fixed downstream square cylinder on the upstream square cylinder vibration with different distances between the centroids of two cylinders some scholars have also investigated the viv of two tandem cylinders at a fixed spacing with various degrees of freedom jaiman et al 2016 examined the viv characteristics of two tandem cylinders a fixed upstream square cylinder and a free downstream square cylinder at l 4b han et al 2018 and nepali et al 2020 also focused on the viv response of two tandem square cylinders at l 5b and re 40 200 han et al 2018 studied the situation of a fixed uc and a free dc while nepali et al 2020 analyzed the situation of a free uc and a free dc in the latter case the lock in region of the dc was relatively wider and the vortex shedding mode was much more complicated previous researchers have mainly studied the viv phenomenon of two tandem square cylinders with restricted movement it should be noted that there are few relevant studies analyzing two square cylinders that can freely vibrate in both transverse and downstream directions moreover in previous papers the influence of the limited spacing ratio on the forced vibration mithun and tiwari 2014 and wake induced vibration bhatt and alam 2018 has mainly been studied to the authors knowledge few research studies have been conducted on the influence of the spacing ratio on the viv of two cylinders that vibrate freely the comprehension of the viv response of two tandem square cylinders needs further exploration to investigate the spacing effect on the viv we present numerical simulation results for the viv responses of two tandem square cylinders that are free to vibrate two cylinders are immersed in a steady uniform flow yielding a reynolds number of 150 which ensures the calculation efficiency according to previous studies our numerical analysis is performed at l b 2 6 and m 10 to maximize the viv response the structural damping coefficient is set to zero and the reduced velocity v r is in the range of 3 12 the outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows a brief introduction of the fluid governing equations and solid movement equations is presented in section 2 followed by the setup of the problem and model validation in section 3 the spacing effect is displayed in section 4 finally short concluding remarks are outlined in section 5 2 governing equations the viv of the two square cylinders is simplified as a spring mass damping system as shown in fig 2 where uc and dc denote the upstream and downstream square cylinders respectively both the uc and dc can vibrate freely in the transverse and streamwise directions the corresponding vibration differential equations are 1 m x c x k x f d t 2 m y c y k y f l t where xꞌꞌ xꞌ and x are the instantaneous acceleration velocity and displacement of the square cylinder in the streamwise direction respectively and yꞌꞌ yꞌ and y are the instantaneous acceleration velocity and displacement of the transverse direction respectively c and k are the damping coefficients and spring stiffness respectively in addition fd t 0 5ρv2bcd t and fl t 0 5ρv2bcl t are the streamwise and transverse aerodynamic forces acting on a square cylinder of unit length respectively where cd t and cl t are the time histories of the drag and lift coefficients respectively and ρ is the fluid density in the solid domain the governing equation is solved via the fourth order runge kutta method for two dimensional incompressible laminar flow around the square cylinders the governing equations of fluid flow are the continuity equation and the navier stokes n s equation in the following forms 3 u i x i 0 4 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x i x j where p is the fluid pressure and ν is the viscosity coefficient x i i 1 2 represents the coordinate components in the x and y directions u i i 1 2 represents the component of the velocity vector u in the x and y directions for the fluid domain the governing equation is solved via the finite volume method in addition pressure velocity coupling is achieved via the simplec algorithm and the second order accurate discrete format is adopted in equations 3 and 4 the viv of the two square cylinders in this paper adopts a weak coupling algorithm the specific calculation process is as follows 1 solve governing equations of fluid flow with ansys fluent simulation software to obtain the velocity field and pressure field of the fluid domain at each time step and the fluid force acting on the surface of the square cylinders 2 act the fluid force on the vibrating square cylinder solve the vibration differential equations of the square cylinders and obtain the displacement of the vibrating square cylinder in the transverse and streamwise directions 3 according to the motion of the cylinder update the grids by using the equation which provides a new mesh for the flow field calculation 4 return to step 1 and restart the calculation of the vibration response of the square cylinders at the next time step as mentioned above the dynamic response of the cylinders at each time step is obtained cyclically and the fluid structure interaction algorithm is ultimately realized 3 problem description 3 1 computational domain and boundary conditions the computational domain and boundary conditions are shown in fig 3 the entrance boundary and the upper and lower boundaries are 30b from the origin o while the exit boundary is 40b from the origin on the one hand a uniform flow under free stream velocity conditions is applied at the inlet on the other hand the zero gradient condition regarding the flow velocity is employed at the outlet to simplify the computation domain the two side walls are set as symmetrical boundaries and a no slip boundary condition is used at the square cylinder surface to reduce the calculation of the updated grid only the circular frame area is set as the accompanying moving zone the detailed grid system is shown in fig 4 to improve the accuracy of the calculation on the cylinder walls the computational grid is divided into several blocks a structured grid is arranged near the square cylinders an unstructured grid is implemented in the circular frame area in contrast to the grids in the remainder of the regions since the flow around the square cylinders is more complicated mesh refinement is performed near the surface of these cylinders we consider the size of the nearest layer from the cylinder wall to be 0 01b 3 2 verification and validation to assess the reliability of the calculation model verification and validation tests are performed on the viv of a single square cylinder as shown in table 1 taking the single square cylinder at re 100 m 3 and v r 5 the transverse amplitude is large as an example we perform verification and validation tests for different parameters such as the blockage ratio a1 a4 the number of nodes on the cylinder b1 b3 the nearest layer size c1 c3 and the nondimensional time step d1 d3 notably with an increase in the number nodes on the cylinder and decreases in the blockage ratio nearest layer size and time step the results of the present paper tend to stabilize that is the results tend to converge evidently the maximum percentage change 10 29 occurs at the value of c l rms as the mesh changes from b1 to b2 whereas no significant change is observed when the mesh changes from b2 to b3 only a 1 76 change in the value of c l rms that is the numerical results have both grid independence and time step independence considering the calculation efficiency and accuracy we adopt case b2 as the subsequent working condition in table 1 a y y max y min 2 is the transverse amplitude where y max and y min are the maximum and minimum displacements of the square cylinder in the transverse direction respectively f y f n is the transverse frequency ratio where f y represents the transverse vibration frequency of the square cylinder in addition c d mean and c l rms are the time averaged drag coefficient and root mean square rms lift coefficient respectively the value of cd mean is obtained by calculating the average of c d t and the value of cl rms is obtained by calculating the pulsation of c l t as mentioned above we adopt case b2 for follow up analysis involving re 100 m 3 and v r 3 12 the nondimensional transverse amplitude a y b streamwise frequency ratio f x f n where f x is the streamwise vibration frequency of the square cylinder and transverse frequency ratio f y f n are compared with published results from fig 5 the agreement with previous data is fairly good which indicates that the numerical simulation methods and parameters in this paper have high credibility 3 3 parameter selection principles to select the reynolds number we consider that the workload of a numerical simulation for viv at high reynolds numbers is very heavy so many fundamental studies are carried out at low reynolds numbers partly due to the low computational cost associated with low reynolds numbers more significantly the flow field characteristics and vibration properties of cylindrical structures can be reliably predicted at low reynolds numbers jaiman et al 2016 papaioannou et al 2008 guan and jaiman 2017 zhao et al 2013 therefore the present paper selects a low reynolds number for the numerical simulation to select the center spacing between cylinders more et al 2015 patil and tiwari 2009 and mithun and tiwari 2014 considered spacing ratios of l b 2 6 and achieved the systematic trends therefore we refer to the previous literature and select spacing ratios of l b 2 6 to select the reduced velocity we mainly analyze the viv characteristics of two square cylinders so the selected reduced velocity is v r 3 12 tu et al 2015 papaioannou et al 2008 and nepali et al 2020 selected a similar range of reduced velocities when studying the viv of circular and square cylinders to select the damping ratio we consider that a square cylinder vibrates faster when the damping ratio is set as zero which can conserve computational resources therefore referring to the previous literature the damping ratio is taken as zero mittal and kumar 1999 tu et al 2015 zhao et al 2013 sen and mittal 2015 to select the mass ratio we consider six spacing conditions 2b 6b for the cases of 2b and 2 5b if we select a low mass ratio m 3 we find that the uc displays a sizable streamwise displacement and collides with the downstream square cylinder which is not conducive to studying the vibration characteristics comprehensively considering these conditions we select a mass ratio of m 10 for the numerical simulation by referring to previous literature papaioannou et al 2008 guan and jaiman 2017 zhou et al 1999 4 results and discussion 4 1 dynamic responses figs 6 8 outline the nondimensional amplitude a y b and a x b of two cylinders with different spacing ratios and the transverse frequency ratio f y f n with the reduced velocity note that a x x max x min 2 where x max and x min are the maximum and minimum displacements respectively of the square cylinder in the streamwise direction and indexes 1 and 2 represent the uc and dc respectively the calculation results of a single cylinder are also shown for comparison the transverse amplitude of the single cylinder is relatively small additionally no significant soft lock in or lock in phenomena occur for the case of m 10 we divide the spacing into three types small spacing ratios l b 2 and 2 5 moderate spacing ratios l b 3 and 4 and large spacing ratios l b 5 and 6 it can be concluded that the vibration of the two cylinders at each spacing ratio is mainly in the transverse direction while no significant streamwise vibration is observed therefore the following analysis mainly examines the transverse vibration response of the two square cylinders 4 1 1 case of small spacing at low reduced velocity the transverse amplitude of the uc is relatively small and the dc exhibits a narrow lock in region the synchronization region of f y f n 0 95 1 05 combined with obvious transverse vibrations different from previous papers for two circular cylinders papaioannou et al 2008 tu et al 2015 the lock in is typically wide in general and occurs at a low reduced velocity v r 6 under the condition of a high reduced velocity both the uc and dc have a wide soft lock in region the synchronization region of f y f n 0 85 the corresponding reduced velocities of the two cylinders with l b 2 and 2 5 within the soft lock in region are 9 5 12 and 10 5 12 respectively the maximum transverse amplitudes of the uc and dc appear in the soft lock in region and the amplitude of the uc is larger than that of the dc the soft lock in phenomenon in the present study is in good agreement with the results of prasanth and mittal 2009 who carried out numerical simulations to investigate the viv of two circular cylinders at m 10 when soft lock in occurs the vortex shedding frequency of the cylinder is reduced which significantly changes the flow pattern and has an important influence on the movement trajectory therefore the movement trajectory of the dc is notably unstable within the soft lock in region and that of the two cylinders outside this region is an 8 shape 4 1 2 case of moderate spacing as the spacing ratio increases to a moderate level the transverse amplitude of the uc decreases rapidly without the lock in and soft lock in regions which is similar to the vibration response of the single cylinder compared with the case of small spacing the dc does not exhibit the soft lock in region and the traditional lock in region becomes wider the corresponding reduced velocities of the two cylinders with l b 3 and 4 within the lock in region are 5 5 8 and 5 5 7 75 respectively notably within the lock in region the transverse amplitude of the dc exhibits two peaks corresponding to reattachment and co shedding regimes and the different flow patterns result in two distinctive fluid structure interactions see section 4 4 4 for further details in addition the vibration trajectory for the two cylinders is basically shaped like an 8 4 1 3 case of large spacing the transverse amplitude trend of the two cylinders with the reduced velocity is similar to that of the single cylinder there is no significant transverse vibration for the uc and the traditional lock in region of the dc is typically narrow in addition to the case of the high reduced velocity at l b 6 the vibration trajectory of the two cylinders is basically shaped like an 8 it is also noteworthy that for the case of l b 6 the dc exhibits a large transverse vibration and the corresponding frequency ratio f y f n remains almost constant with increasing reduced velocity to the best of our knowledge the phenomenon mentioned above is attributed to galloping rather than vortex induced resonance which is explained later in conjunction with the power spectrum in general the flow pattern changes significantly at the onsets of the lock in or soft lock in phenomena for each spacing ratio resulting in a frequency jump for the case of l b 2 5 the dominant vibration frequency of the uc is the same as that of the dc but the dominant vibration frequencies of the two cylinders are not equal at vr 9 5 12 for l b 6 this is attributed to the viv of the two cylinders with l b 2 5 and the galloping of the dc with l b 6 which is explained in detail below finally considering the large amplitudes of two square cylinders at a typical spacing ratio the displacement time history and the corresponding lift and displacement power spectral density psd functions are shown in figs 9 11 in general the uc at each spacing ratio is basically subjected only to a single frequency lift force resulting in the strong periodicity of the transverse vibrations for the two cylinders at different spacing ratios the dominant lift frequency of the uc is the same as that of the dc at the same reduced velocity at l b 2 5 the two cylinders display viv and the dominant vibration frequency of both the uc and the dc is in accordance with the dominant frequency of the lift force that is the uc has the same dominant vibration frequency as the dc for a large spacing ratio l b 6 the uc displays two vibration frequency peaks and the dominant frequency of vibration is the same as that of the lift force in contrast the dc exhibits multifrequency vibration at a high reduced velocity and the dominant frequency of vibration is not equal to that of the lift force which is caused by galloping rather than viv as shown in fig 11 d f combining fig 11 with fig 8 galloping results in the large vibration of the dc at a higher reduced velocity for l b 6 notably the two cylinders display multifrequency vibration in certain cases at a relatively low mass ratio m 2 a multifrequency lift force can result in multifrequency vibration for both cylinders nepali et al 2020 we analyze this phenomenon in the power spectrum and find that the dc displays a multifrequency lift force under the wake flow interference of the uc at m 10 however the rms lift force of the nondominant frequency is small and has little impact on the vibration of the dc resulting in the single frequency vibration of the dc other scholars carried out an analysis under a similar mass ratio and found the same phenomenon guan and jaiman 2017 4 2 flow induced forces 4 2 1 mean drag coefficient we calculated the mean drag coefficient c d mean and streamwise displacement x mean of the two cylinders depending on the reduced velocity the relationships between these parameters are presented in figs 12 14 overall the c d mean and x mean of the uc at each spacing are greater than those of the dc which is caused by the shielding effect of the uc in addition as the spacing ratio increases the values of c d mean and x mean for the dc gradually approach those of the uc at the same reduced velocity which indicates that the shielding effect of the uc weakens in the cases of small spacing l b 2 and 2 5 when v r 3 9 5 the c d mean of the uc remains basically unchanged depending on v r while that of the dc shows a peak at v r 6 which is caused by the strong vortexes on the leeward side of the dc within the soft lock in region v r 10 12 the c d mean of the uc increases rapidly while that of the dc is less than zero as a consequence the x mean of the uc increases rapidly while that of the dc decreases as reflected by the instantaneous vorticity and surface pressure of the two cylinders in fig 20 for the cases of moderate spacing l b 3 and 4 the c d mean of uc changes negligibly with the reduced velocity which indirectly indicates that no strong vortex is present on the leeward side of the uc as shown by the instantaneous vorticity and surface pressure of the two cylinders in fig 19 additionally the c d mean of the dc increases suddenly in the lock in region with two obvious peaks but the stiffness of the dc is large so its x mean does not show an abrupt increase in the cases of large spacing l b 5 and 6 the values of c d mean for the uc and dc remain almost constant with the reduced velocity and the linear increase in x mean is caused by the variation in the stiffness of the cylinder 4 2 2 rms lift coefficient to clarify the influence of the spacing ratio on the flow induced lift force fig 15 shows the variation curve of the rms lift coefficient c l rms with the reduced velocity the uc experiences a large rms lift force in the soft lock in region only at small spacing ratios l b 2 and 2 5 during the increase in the spacing ratio the c l1 rms of the uc decreases rapidly different from the uc the dc shows a low rms lift value at a low reduced velocity at small and moderate spacing ratios as the reduced velocity increases the value of c l2 rms is relatively larger both within and outside the lock in region in regard to the large spacing ratio except for v r 6 5 7 the rms lift value of the dc is notably large at each reduced velocity combining figs 6 8 it can be concluded that the uc shows sizable transverse vibration only when the rms lift force of the uc is considerable compared with the uc for a small rms lift value the dc also exhibits an enormous transverse vibration such as l 4b and v r 7 and l 6b and v r 6 5 the reason for this phenomenon is that the lift force frequency is close to the natural frequency and sufficient energy is input to the dc in contrast although the lift force frequency of the uc is similar to the natural frequency the energy input is insufficient so its amplitude is very small see section 4 2 3 for more details 4 2 3 energy input to study the internal connection between the lift force and transverse vibration figs 16 17 outline the time history of the lift force and transverse displacement when two square cylinders exhibit relatively large amplitudes at the typical spacing ratio in this study details regarding the process of the instantaneous energy input are observed among them p c l t v t v is the nondimensional power where v t and v are the movement velocity of the square cylinders and the free stream velocity respectively the phase angle ϕ of the lift force and transverse displacement is approximately equal to zero over time when the uc has a large amplitude as shown in fig 16 a unlike the uc the phase angle ϕ 0 when the dc has a large amplitude at a small spacing ratio as shown in fig 17 a and b at moderate and large spacing ratios the dc experiences a large transverse vibration at the phase angle ϕ 180 as shown in fig 17 d in most cases of each spacing ratio the stable and robust energy input which is governed by the lift force results in the sizable amplitude of the two square cylinders furthermore at a small spacing ratio within the soft lock in region the periodicity of the lift time history of the dc is unremarkable which may disturb and weaken the energy input of the dc as shown in fig 17 b on this basis the amplitude of the dc is evidently smaller than that of the uc except within the soft lock in region in the cases of small spacing the energy input of the uc is far less than that of the dc at the same v r as shown in figs 16 b and 17 f as a result the energy input for the uc is achieved mainly by its own vortex and the wake vortex of the uc and its own shedding vortex produce energy that is input to the dc which is located within the wake flow of the uc 4 3 flow pattern to elucidate the influence of the spacing ratio on the flow field characteristics of the two cylinders fig 18 summarizes the evolution process of the flow pattern and wake mode with the changing reduced velocity at different spacing ratios two square cylinders at each spacing ratio exhibit two flow regimes the reattachment regime and the co shedding regime considerable attention should be given to the fact that the range of the reduced velocity in the reattachment regime decreases with the increasing spacing ratio and the flow regime for a large ratio only shows the co shedding regime with increasing reduced velocity the two square cylinders at each spacing ratio exhibit a total of seven wake modes modes i iii appear in the reattachment regime under mode i the wake flow forming the vortex is relatively long mode ii is the two row vortex mode of the reattachment regime that is the uc does not display vortex shedding and two rows of parallel vortices move backward relative to the dc mode iii is the 2s mode of the reattachment regime that is the uc has no vortex shedding and the dc sheds two vortices during a vibration cycle modes iv vii appear in the co shedding regime where the uc in mode iv displays vortex shedding and vortex fusion which seems very disorderly occurs in the near wake region of the dc mode v is the two row vortex mode of the co shedding regime the uc displays vortex shedding and two side by side vortexes move backward relative to the dc mode vi is the 2s mode of the co shedding regime that is the uc experiences vortex shedding and the dc sheds two vortices during a vibration cycle the uc of mode vii sheds four vortices during a vibration cycle and the near wake region of the dc displays disorderly vortex fusion in the case of a small spacing ratio there are four wake modes modes i iii and vii with changing reduced velocity as the spacing ratio increases to a moderate value the wake modes become more diverse and exhibit six wake modes namely modes i vi where mode iv is not formed for two square cylinders with l b 3 at a high spacing ratio the wake mode type is single of which the case is only mode iv according to figs 6 8 the soft lock in regions of the two square cylinders at the low spacing ratio appear in the co shedding regime with mode vii the lock in region of the dc at a moderate spacing ratio occurs in both the reattachment regime and co shedding regime the corresponding wakes are modes ii v the wake mode is iv within the lock in region of the dc at a large spacing 4 4 fluid structure interaction mechanism affected by the wake of the uc the dc exhibits large transverse vibrations within the synchronization region lock in region or soft lock in region along with diverse flow patterns this section examines the working cases with a relatively large amplitude of the dc combined with the instantaneous vorticity and instantaneous surface pressure of the two cylinders this part also explains the cause of the wake mode formation and the large amplitude of the cylinders 4 4 1 wake mode ii fig 19 shows the typical working condition of the two square cylinders in mode ii under this mode the lock in region of the reattachment regime occurs for the dc with small and moderate spacing ratios taking the operating case of l b 4 and v r 6 5 as an example the lower side of the dc sheds a strong vortex causing the dc to move downward when reaching the maximum negative displacement t 4 the uc and dc are in a relatively distant position which means the shear layer of the uc cannot be attached to both sides of the dc at the same time this impact increases the lift force which further promotes the vibration of the dc in addition the large transverse vibration of the dc increases the transverse spacing of wake vortices leading to the appearance of the two row vortex mode 4 4 2 wake mode vii fig 20 shows the typical working condition of the two square cylinders in mode vii under this mode the dc at a small spacing exhibits a soft lock in region with a higher transverse amplitude uc taking the operating case of l b 2 5 and v r 11 as an example apart from the other cases four vortices falling off the uc a1 a2 b1 and b2 in one period cause the uc to vibrate greatly due to the small spacing ratio the wake of the uc has a very complicated effect on the vibration of the dc during dc downward movement t 2 vortex a1 falling off the uc hits the lower side of the dc vortex b2 passes through the upper side of the dc which generates an upward force on the dc and restrains the dc from moving downwards finally the dc has a smaller transverse amplitude than the uc when time elapses to t 3 the impact of vortex a1 on the dc disappears and vortex a1 merges with c1 falling off the dc resulting in a large downward lift force promoting the vibration of the dc the vortices shedding from the two square cylinders merge near the wake area t 4 eventually leading to a chaotic wake 4 4 3 wake mode iv and v figs 21 and 22 show the typical working conditions of the two cylinders in mode iv and mode v respectively under these modes two cylinders at moderate and large spacing ratios exhibit the lock in region of the co shedding regime taking the operating cases of l b 4 v r 7 5 and l b 4 v r 7 75 as examples from fig 21 the vortex shedding from the uc interacts with the shear layer of the dc which causes the lift force of the dc the dc does not exhibit vortex shedding so the lift value of the dc is quite low at this time the dc also vibrates greatly in the transverse direction which is attributed to the frequency ratio f y f n 1 in addition the wake vortex of the dc has a larger size in the streamwise direction which causes it to merge in the near wake region finally the vortex results in a chaotic wake compared with mode iv from fig 22 the vortex shedding from the dc merges with that from the uc resulting in a large lift force and promoting the vibration of the dc at this time the wake vortex size in the streamwise direction is typically small and the vortices do not merge near the wake area of the dc 5 conclusion the viv characteristics of two tandem square cylinders were investigated via the numerical simulation technique computations were carried out at various spacing ratios which profoundly affected the viv responses of the two cylinders the main conclusions in this paper are as follows in the cases of small spacing l b 2 2 5 the uc has no traditional lock in region f y f n 0 95 1 05 and v r 6 and the dc has only an exceedingly narrow traditional lock in region at a high reduced velocity v r 9 5 12 the wide soft lock in region f y f n 0 85 appears for both cylinders within this region the uc sheds four vortices in one vibration period and these vortices merge with the vortices of the dc in the wake flow causing the dc to exhibit a chaotic wake in the cases of moderate spacing l b 3 4 the transverse amplitude of the uc is limited and there are no lock in and soft lock in regions the dc does not have a soft lock in region and exhibits a relatively wide traditional lock in region v r 5 5 8 with two transverse amplitude peaks depending on v r there are four distinctively different wake modes within the lock in region namely the two row vortex mode of the reattachment regime 2s mode of the reattachment regime 2s mode with chaotic wake flow and two row vortex mode of the co shedding regime in the cases of large spacing l b 5 6 there is no significant soft lock in phenomenon or lock in phenomenon of the uc which is similar to the case of a single square cylinder it should be noted that the dc exhibits only a highly narrow traditional lock in region accompanied by sizable transverse amplitude the two square cylinders exhibit the co shedding regime with the single wake mode at a large spacing ratio namely the 2s mode with a chaotic wake flow credit authorship

20396,different spacing cases l b 2 6 are numerically examined to identify the spacing effect on the two degree of freedom vortex induced vibration viv of two tandem square cylinders at re 150 according to the various vibration responses force characteristics and flow patterns spacing cases can be divided into three different situations at a small spacing l b 2 2 5 the upstream cylinder uc has no traditional lock in region the frequency ratio f y f n 0 95 1 05 and the reduced velocity v r 6 and the downstream cylinder dc has a narrow lock in region however there is a wide soft lock in region the synchronization region of f y f n 0 85 at high reduced velocities v r 9 5 12 for both cylinders in this region both cylinders experience large amplitude transverse vibrations with the uc exhibiting a higher amplitude at a moderate spacing l b 3 4 the uc does not exhibit lock in or soft lock in regions similar to a single cylinder at the same mass ratio and the dc exhibits a relatively wide lock in region v r 5 5 8 instead of a soft lock in region notably two amplitude peaks appear within the lock in region for the dc depending on v r at a large spacing l b 5 6 the amplitude of the dc is typically higher than that of a single cylinder even within the narrow lock in region keywords two tandem square cylinders vortex induced vibration viv spacing effect soft lock in region numerical simulation 1 introduction the vortex induced vibration viv of cylindrical structures with large slenderness ratios is frequently observed in several engineering fields when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the natural frequency of the structure the amplitude of the structure sharply rises eventually causing fatigue damage viv has attracted considerable interest due to its engineering and academic value bearman 2011 blevins 1990 parkinson 1989 sarpkaya 2004 sumer 2006 williamson and govardhan 2004 it is generally accepted that viv is an undesirable phenomenon causing local and global instabilities however with the rapid development of science and technology many researchers have leveraged the principles of viv to harvest ocean energy and wind energy to provide theoretical guidance for further development and to improve energy harvesting devices an increasing number of scholars have comprehensively analyzed the viv of different structures to clarify their dynamic characteristics and vibration mechanisms wu et al 2013 bernitsas 2008 raghavan and bernitsas 2011 ding et al 2016 to decrease their shape complexities most bluff bodies in engineering practice are reasonably simplified as typical shapes including circular cylinders and square cylinders therefore many studies have been performed on the viv of a single cylinder with these typical cylinder shapes jauvtis and williamson 2004 mittal and kumar 1999 sen and mittal 2015 compared with the vibration characteristics of a circular cylinder a square cylinder immersed in a flow displays both viv and galloping depending on the reduced velocity v r bearman et al 1987 bearman 1984 luo 1992 in addition the continuously increasing application of multicylinder systems is evident in various engineering fields among them multicylinder systems with square cylinders are widely employed in marine engineering particularly for offshore floating bodies such as semi submersible and tension leg platforms det norske veritas 2010 guan and jaiman 2017 however the flow fields around the cylinders interfere with each other causing the vibration responses to differ from that of a single cylinder consequently in the field of offshore engineering there is a growing need to fundamentally understand and optimize the flow induced loads and flow induced motions of multicylinder floating structures as the simplest form of the multicylinder system the two cylinder system needs to be studied additionally it is important to understand the factors that affect the viv of two cylinders such as the spacing ratio l b mass ratio m degrees of freedom and reynolds number re critical nondimensional parameters including the mass ratio m reynolds number re and reduced velocity v r are defined as follows m m ρ b 2 r e ρ v b μ a n d v r v f n b where m is the mass per unit length of the cylinder ρ is the fluid density v is the free stream velocity μ is the fluid kinematic viscosity and f n is the natural frequency of the structure in addition b is the characteristic length which is the side length of the square cylinder in the case of viv many studies have previously concentrated on the structures of two circular cylinders such as parallel slings split conductors and ocean risers in contrast research on the viv of two square cylinders is insufficient several scholars have considered the viv of two square cylinders numerically and experimentally with different arrangements because the viv characteristics of the two cylinders vary with the array notably viv based studies have been conducted on two square cylinders regarding the viv of bluff bodies with staggered side by side and tandem arrangements considering the different arrangements gowda and kumar 2006 kumar and gowda 2006 and kumar et al 2008 studied the interference effect of a fixed downstream cylinder dc on the vibration of an upstream cylinder uc the results showed that the uc arranged in tandem with a small spacing exhibited the maximum amplitude in the transverse direction guan and jaiman 2017 studied the viv of two rigidly connected cylinders and successfully observed four distinct flow regimes it is well established that the viv of two square cylinders in tandem is highly dependent on the distance l between the centroids of the two cylinders with the change in the distance l three kinds of flow regimes occur for two fixed square cylinders namely the single body regime reattachment regime and co shedding regime as shown in fig 1 scholars have analyzed the spacing effect of viv on two cylinders in tandem but most of these studies have been subject to limitations namely considering the degrees of freedom of square cylinders mithun and tiwari 2014 studied two tandem cylinders with a fixed amplitude and the same phase vibration in the transverse direction yielding a reynolds number of 100 the influence of the transverse vibration frequency on the flow induced forces and flow field structures with different distances l was studied as well it was found that at l 3b 4b the vortex shedding mode of the two cylinders changed from 2s to 2p bhatt and alam 2018 carried out numerical simulations to analyze the operating case in which the upstream square cylinder was fixed while the downstream square cylinder could freely vibrate in the transverse direction and the study was conducted at re 100 and 200 these researchers pointed out that the gap flow exerted a major impact on the vibration response of the downstream square cylinder when l 2b and 6b patil and tiwari 2009 and more et al 2015 studied the interference effect of a fixed downstream square cylinder on the upstream square cylinder vibration with different distances between the centroids of two cylinders some scholars have also investigated the viv of two tandem cylinders at a fixed spacing with various degrees of freedom jaiman et al 2016 examined the viv characteristics of two tandem cylinders a fixed upstream square cylinder and a free downstream square cylinder at l 4b han et al 2018 and nepali et al 2020 also focused on the viv response of two tandem square cylinders at l 5b and re 40 200 han et al 2018 studied the situation of a fixed uc and a free dc while nepali et al 2020 analyzed the situation of a free uc and a free dc in the latter case the lock in region of the dc was relatively wider and the vortex shedding mode was much more complicated previous researchers have mainly studied the viv phenomenon of two tandem square cylinders with restricted movement it should be noted that there are few relevant studies analyzing two square cylinders that can freely vibrate in both transverse and downstream directions moreover in previous papers the influence of the limited spacing ratio on the forced vibration mithun and tiwari 2014 and wake induced vibration bhatt and alam 2018 has mainly been studied to the authors knowledge few research studies have been conducted on the influence of the spacing ratio on the viv of two cylinders that vibrate freely the comprehension of the viv response of two tandem square cylinders needs further exploration to investigate the spacing effect on the viv we present numerical simulation results for the viv responses of two tandem square cylinders that are free to vibrate two cylinders are immersed in a steady uniform flow yielding a reynolds number of 150 which ensures the calculation efficiency according to previous studies our numerical analysis is performed at l b 2 6 and m 10 to maximize the viv response the structural damping coefficient is set to zero and the reduced velocity v r is in the range of 3 12 the outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows a brief introduction of the fluid governing equations and solid movement equations is presented in section 2 followed by the setup of the problem and model validation in section 3 the spacing effect is displayed in section 4 finally short concluding remarks are outlined in section 5 2 governing equations the viv of the two square cylinders is simplified as a spring mass damping system as shown in fig 2 where uc and dc denote the upstream and downstream square cylinders respectively both the uc and dc can vibrate freely in the transverse and streamwise directions the corresponding vibration differential equations are 1 m x c x k x f d t 2 m y c y k y f l t where xꞌꞌ xꞌ and x are the instantaneous acceleration velocity and displacement of the square cylinder in the streamwise direction respectively and yꞌꞌ yꞌ and y are the instantaneous acceleration velocity and displacement of the transverse direction respectively c and k are the damping coefficients and spring stiffness respectively in addition fd t 0 5ρv2bcd t and fl t 0 5ρv2bcl t are the streamwise and transverse aerodynamic forces acting on a square cylinder of unit length respectively where cd t and cl t are the time histories of the drag and lift coefficients respectively and ρ is the fluid density in the solid domain the governing equation is solved via the fourth order runge kutta method for two dimensional incompressible laminar flow around the square cylinders the governing equations of fluid flow are the continuity equation and the navier stokes n s equation in the following forms 3 u i x i 0 4 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x i x j where p is the fluid pressure and ν is the viscosity coefficient x i i 1 2 represents the coordinate components in the x and y directions u i i 1 2 represents the component of the velocity vector u in the x and y directions for the fluid domain the governing equation is solved via the finite volume method in addition pressure velocity coupling is achieved via the simplec algorithm and the second order accurate discrete format is adopted in equations 3 and 4 the viv of the two square cylinders in this paper adopts a weak coupling algorithm the specific calculation process is as follows 1 solve governing equations of fluid flow with ansys fluent simulation software to obtain the velocity field and pressure field of the fluid domain at each time step and the fluid force acting on the surface of the square cylinders 2 act the fluid force on the vibrating square cylinder solve the vibration differential equations of the square cylinders and obtain the displacement of the vibrating square cylinder in the transverse and streamwise directions 3 according to the motion of the cylinder update the grids by using the equation which provides a new mesh for the flow field calculation 4 return to step 1 and restart the calculation of the vibration response of the square cylinders at the next time step as mentioned above the dynamic response of the cylinders at each time step is obtained cyclically and the fluid structure interaction algorithm is ultimately realized 3 problem description 3 1 computational domain and boundary conditions the computational domain and boundary conditions are shown in fig 3 the entrance boundary and the upper and lower boundaries are 30b from the origin o while the exit boundary is 40b from the origin on the one hand a uniform flow under free stream velocity conditions is applied at the inlet on the other hand the zero gradient condition regarding the flow velocity is employed at the outlet to simplify the computation domain the two side walls are set as symmetrical boundaries and a no slip boundary condition is used at the square cylinder surface to reduce the calculation of the updated grid only the circular frame area is set as the accompanying moving zone the detailed grid system is shown in fig 4 to improve the accuracy of the calculation on the cylinder walls the computational grid is divided into several blocks a structured grid is arranged near the square cylinders an unstructured grid is implemented in the circular frame area in contrast to the grids in the remainder of the regions since the flow around the square cylinders is more complicated mesh refinement is performed near the surface of these cylinders we consider the size of the nearest layer from the cylinder wall to be 0 01b 3 2 verification and validation to assess the reliability of the calculation model verification and validation tests are performed on the viv of a single square cylinder as shown in table 1 taking the single square cylinder at re 100 m 3 and v r 5 the transverse amplitude is large as an example we perform verification and validation tests for different parameters such as the blockage ratio a1 a4 the number of nodes on the cylinder b1 b3 the nearest layer size c1 c3 and the nondimensional time step d1 d3 notably with an increase in the number nodes on the cylinder and decreases in the blockage ratio nearest layer size and time step the results of the present paper tend to stabilize that is the results tend to converge evidently the maximum percentage change 10 29 occurs at the value of c l rms as the mesh changes from b1 to b2 whereas no significant change is observed when the mesh changes from b2 to b3 only a 1 76 change in the value of c l rms that is the numerical results have both grid independence and time step independence considering the calculation efficiency and accuracy we adopt case b2 as the subsequent working condition in table 1 a y y max y min 2 is the transverse amplitude where y max and y min are the maximum and minimum displacements of the square cylinder in the transverse direction respectively f y f n is the transverse frequency ratio where f y represents the transverse vibration frequency of the square cylinder in addition c d mean and c l rms are the time averaged drag coefficient and root mean square rms lift coefficient respectively the value of cd mean is obtained by calculating the average of c d t and the value of cl rms is obtained by calculating the pulsation of c l t as mentioned above we adopt case b2 for follow up analysis involving re 100 m 3 and v r 3 12 the nondimensional transverse amplitude a y b streamwise frequency ratio f x f n where f x is the streamwise vibration frequency of the square cylinder and transverse frequency ratio f y f n are compared with published results from fig 5 the agreement with previous data is fairly good which indicates that the numerical simulation methods and parameters in this paper have high credibility 3 3 parameter selection principles to select the reynolds number we consider that the workload of a numerical simulation for viv at high reynolds numbers is very heavy so many fundamental studies are carried out at low reynolds numbers partly due to the low computational cost associated with low reynolds numbers more significantly the flow field characteristics and vibration properties of cylindrical structures can be reliably predicted at low reynolds numbers jaiman et al 2016 papaioannou et al 2008 guan and jaiman 2017 zhao et al 2013 therefore the present paper selects a low reynolds number for the numerical simulation to select the center spacing between cylinders more et al 2015 patil and tiwari 2009 and mithun and tiwari 2014 considered spacing ratios of l b 2 6 and achieved the systematic trends therefore we refer to the previous literature and select spacing ratios of l b 2 6 to select the reduced velocity we mainly analyze the viv characteristics of two square cylinders so the selected reduced velocity is v r 3 12 tu et al 2015 papaioannou et al 2008 and nepali et al 2020 selected a similar range of reduced velocities when studying the viv of circular and square cylinders to select the damping ratio we consider that a square cylinder vibrates faster when the damping ratio is set as zero which can conserve computational resources therefore referring to the previous literature the damping ratio is taken as zero mittal and kumar 1999 tu et al 2015 zhao et al 2013 sen and mittal 2015 to select the mass ratio we consider six spacing conditions 2b 6b for the cases of 2b and 2 5b if we select a low mass ratio m 3 we find that the uc displays a sizable streamwise displacement and collides with the downstream square cylinder which is not conducive to studying the vibration characteristics comprehensively considering these conditions we select a mass ratio of m 10 for the numerical simulation by referring to previous literature papaioannou et al 2008 guan and jaiman 2017 zhou et al 1999 4 results and discussion 4 1 dynamic responses figs 6 8 outline the nondimensional amplitude a y b and a x b of two cylinders with different spacing ratios and the transverse frequency ratio f y f n with the reduced velocity note that a x x max x min 2 where x max and x min are the maximum and minimum displacements respectively of the square cylinder in the streamwise direction and indexes 1 and 2 represent the uc and dc respectively the calculation results of a single cylinder are also shown for comparison the transverse amplitude of the single cylinder is relatively small additionally no significant soft lock in or lock in phenomena occur for the case of m 10 we divide the spacing into three types small spacing ratios l b 2 and 2 5 moderate spacing ratios l b 3 and 4 and large spacing ratios l b 5 and 6 it can be concluded that the vibration of the two cylinders at each spacing ratio is mainly in the transverse direction while no significant streamwise vibration is observed therefore the following analysis mainly examines the transverse vibration response of the two square cylinders 4 1 1 case of small spacing at low reduced velocity the transverse amplitude of the uc is relatively small and the dc exhibits a narrow lock in region the synchronization region of f y f n 0 95 1 05 combined with obvious transverse vibrations different from previous papers for two circular cylinders papaioannou et al 2008 tu et al 2015 the lock in is typically wide in general and occurs at a low reduced velocity v r 6 under the condition of a high reduced velocity both the uc and dc have a wide soft lock in region the synchronization region of f y f n 0 85 the corresponding reduced velocities of the two cylinders with l b 2 and 2 5 within the soft lock in region are 9 5 12 and 10 5 12 respectively the maximum transverse amplitudes of the uc and dc appear in the soft lock in region and the amplitude of the uc is larger than that of the dc the soft lock in phenomenon in the present study is in good agreement with the results of prasanth and mittal 2009 who carried out numerical simulations to investigate the viv of two circular cylinders at m 10 when soft lock in occurs the vortex shedding frequency of the cylinder is reduced which significantly changes the flow pattern and has an important influence on the movement trajectory therefore the movement trajectory of the dc is notably unstable within the soft lock in region and that of the two cylinders outside this region is an 8 shape 4 1 2 case of moderate spacing as the spacing ratio increases to a moderate level the transverse amplitude of the uc decreases rapidly without the lock in and soft lock in regions which is similar to the vibration response of the single cylinder compared with the case of small spacing the dc does not exhibit the soft lock in region and the traditional lock in region becomes wider the corresponding reduced velocities of the two cylinders with l b 3 and 4 within the lock in region are 5 5 8 and 5 5 7 75 respectively notably within the lock in region the transverse amplitude of the dc exhibits two peaks corresponding to reattachment and co shedding regimes and the different flow patterns result in two distinctive fluid structure interactions see section 4 4 4 for further details in addition the vibration trajectory for the two cylinders is basically shaped like an 8 4 1 3 case of large spacing the transverse amplitude trend of the two cylinders with the reduced velocity is similar to that of the single cylinder there is no significant transverse vibration for the uc and the traditional lock in region of the dc is typically narrow in addition to the case of the high reduced velocity at l b 6 the vibration trajectory of the two cylinders is basically shaped like an 8 it is also noteworthy that for the case of l b 6 the dc exhibits a large transverse vibration and the corresponding frequency ratio f y f n remains almost constant with increasing reduced velocity to the best of our knowledge the phenomenon mentioned above is attributed to galloping rather than vortex induced resonance which is explained later in conjunction with the power spectrum in general the flow pattern changes significantly at the onsets of the lock in or soft lock in phenomena for each spacing ratio resulting in a frequency jump for the case of l b 2 5 the dominant vibration frequency of the uc is the same as that of the dc but the dominant vibration frequencies of the two cylinders are not equal at vr 9 5 12 for l b 6 this is attributed to the viv of the two cylinders with l b 2 5 and the galloping of the dc with l b 6 which is explained in detail below finally considering the large amplitudes of two square cylinders at a typical spacing ratio the displacement time history and the corresponding lift and displacement power spectral density psd functions are shown in figs 9 11 in general the uc at each spacing ratio is basically subjected only to a single frequency lift force resulting in the strong periodicity of the transverse vibrations for the two cylinders at different spacing ratios the dominant lift frequency of the uc is the same as that of the dc at the same reduced velocity at l b 2 5 the two cylinders display viv and the dominant vibration frequency of both the uc and the dc is in accordance with the dominant frequency of the lift force that is the uc has the same dominant vibration frequency as the dc for a large spacing ratio l b 6 the uc displays two vibration frequency peaks and the dominant frequency of vibration is the same as that of the lift force in contrast the dc exhibits multifrequency vibration at a high reduced velocity and the dominant frequency of vibration is not equal to that of the lift force which is caused by galloping rather than viv as shown in fig 11 d f combining fig 11 with fig 8 galloping results in the large vibration of the dc at a higher reduced velocity for l b 6 notably the two cylinders display multifrequency vibration in certain cases at a relatively low mass ratio m 2 a multifrequency lift force can result in multifrequency vibration for both cylinders nepali et al 2020 we analyze this phenomenon in the power spectrum and find that the dc displays a multifrequency lift force under the wake flow interference of the uc at m 10 however the rms lift force of the nondominant frequency is small and has little impact on the vibration of the dc resulting in the single frequency vibration of the dc other scholars carried out an analysis under a similar mass ratio and found the same phenomenon guan and jaiman 2017 4 2 flow induced forces 4 2 1 mean drag coefficient we calculated the mean drag coefficient c d mean and streamwise displacement x mean of the two cylinders depending on the reduced velocity the relationships between these parameters are presented in figs 12 14 overall the c d mean and x mean of the uc at each spacing are greater than those of the dc which is caused by the shielding effect of the uc in addition as the spacing ratio increases the values of c d mean and x mean for the dc gradually approach those of the uc at the same reduced velocity which indicates that the shielding effect of the uc weakens in the cases of small spacing l b 2 and 2 5 when v r 3 9 5 the c d mean of the uc remains basically unchanged depending on v r while that of the dc shows a peak at v r 6 which is caused by the strong vortexes on the leeward side of the dc within the soft lock in region v r 10 12 the c d mean of the uc increases rapidly while that of the dc is less than zero as a consequence the x mean of the uc increases rapidly while that of the dc decreases as reflected by the instantaneous vorticity and surface pressure of the two cylinders in fig 20 for the cases of moderate spacing l b 3 and 4 the c d mean of uc changes negligibly with the reduced velocity which indirectly indicates that no strong vortex is present on the leeward side of the uc as shown by the instantaneous vorticity and surface pressure of the two cylinders in fig 19 additionally the c d mean of the dc increases suddenly in the lock in region with two obvious peaks but the stiffness of the dc is large so its x mean does not show an abrupt increase in the cases of large spacing l b 5 and 6 the values of c d mean for the uc and dc remain almost constant with the reduced velocity and the linear increase in x mean is caused by the variation in the stiffness of the cylinder 4 2 2 rms lift coefficient to clarify the influence of the spacing ratio on the flow induced lift force fig 15 shows the variation curve of the rms lift coefficient c l rms with the reduced velocity the uc experiences a large rms lift force in the soft lock in region only at small spacing ratios l b 2 and 2 5 during the increase in the spacing ratio the c l1 rms of the uc decreases rapidly different from the uc the dc shows a low rms lift value at a low reduced velocity at small and moderate spacing ratios as the reduced velocity increases the value of c l2 rms is relatively larger both within and outside the lock in region in regard to the large spacing ratio except for v r 6 5 7 the rms lift value of the dc is notably large at each reduced velocity combining figs 6 8 it can be concluded that the uc shows sizable transverse vibration only when the rms lift force of the uc is considerable compared with the uc for a small rms lift value the dc also exhibits an enormous transverse vibration such as l 4b and v r 7 and l 6b and v r 6 5 the reason for this phenomenon is that the lift force frequency is close to the natural frequency and sufficient energy is input to the dc in contrast although the lift force frequency of the uc is similar to the natural frequency the energy input is insufficient so its amplitude is very small see section 4 2 3 for more details 4 2 3 energy input to study the internal connection between the lift force and transverse vibration figs 16 17 outline the time history of the lift force and transverse displacement when two square cylinders exhibit relatively large amplitudes at the typical spacing ratio in this study details regarding the process of the instantaneous energy input are observed among them p c l t v t v is the nondimensional power where v t and v are the movement velocity of the square cylinders and the free stream velocity respectively the phase angle ϕ of the lift force and transverse displacement is approximately equal to zero over time when the uc has a large amplitude as shown in fig 16 a unlike the uc the phase angle ϕ 0 when the dc has a large amplitude at a small spacing ratio as shown in fig 17 a and b at moderate and large spacing ratios the dc experiences a large transverse vibration at the phase angle ϕ 180 as shown in fig 17 d in most cases of each spacing ratio the stable and robust energy input which is governed by the lift force results in the sizable amplitude of the two square cylinders furthermore at a small spacing ratio within the soft lock in region the periodicity of the lift time history of the dc is unremarkable which may disturb and weaken the energy input of the dc as shown in fig 17 b on this basis the amplitude of the dc is evidently smaller than that of the uc except within the soft lock in region in the cases of small spacing the energy input of the uc is far less than that of the dc at the same v r as shown in figs 16 b and 17 f as a result the energy input for the uc is achieved mainly by its own vortex and the wake vortex of the uc and its own shedding vortex produce energy that is input to the dc which is located within the wake flow of the uc 4 3 flow pattern to elucidate the influence of the spacing ratio on the flow field characteristics of the two cylinders fig 18 summarizes the evolution process of the flow pattern and wake mode with the changing reduced velocity at different spacing ratios two square cylinders at each spacing ratio exhibit two flow regimes the reattachment regime and the co shedding regime considerable attention should be given to the fact that the range of the reduced velocity in the reattachment regime decreases with the increasing spacing ratio and the flow regime for a large ratio only shows the co shedding regime with increasing reduced velocity the two square cylinders at each spacing ratio exhibit a total of seven wake modes modes i iii appear in the reattachment regime under mode i the wake flow forming the vortex is relatively long mode ii is the two row vortex mode of the reattachment regime that is the uc does not display vortex shedding and two rows of parallel vortices move backward relative to the dc mode iii is the 2s mode of the reattachment regime that is the uc has no vortex shedding and the dc sheds two vortices during a vibration cycle modes iv vii appear in the co shedding regime where the uc in mode iv displays vortex shedding and vortex fusion which seems very disorderly occurs in the near wake region of the dc mode v is the two row vortex mode of the co shedding regime the uc displays vortex shedding and two side by side vortexes move backward relative to the dc mode vi is the 2s mode of the co shedding regime that is the uc experiences vortex shedding and the dc sheds two vortices during a vibration cycle the uc of mode vii sheds four vortices during a vibration cycle and the near wake region of the dc displays disorderly vortex fusion in the case of a small spacing ratio there are four wake modes modes i iii and vii with changing reduced velocity as the spacing ratio increases to a moderate value the wake modes become more diverse and exhibit six wake modes namely modes i vi where mode iv is not formed for two square cylinders with l b 3 at a high spacing ratio the wake mode type is single of which the case is only mode iv according to figs 6 8 the soft lock in regions of the two square cylinders at the low spacing ratio appear in the co shedding regime with mode vii the lock in region of the dc at a moderate spacing ratio occurs in both the reattachment regime and co shedding regime the corresponding wakes are modes ii v the wake mode is iv within the lock in region of the dc at a large spacing 4 4 fluid structure interaction mechanism affected by the wake of the uc the dc exhibits large transverse vibrations within the synchronization region lock in region or soft lock in region along with diverse flow patterns this section examines the working cases with a relatively large amplitude of the dc combined with the instantaneous vorticity and instantaneous surface pressure of the two cylinders this part also explains the cause of the wake mode formation and the large amplitude of the cylinders 4 4 1 wake mode ii fig 19 shows the typical working condition of the two square cylinders in mode ii under this mode the lock in region of the reattachment regime occurs for the dc with small and moderate spacing ratios taking the operating case of l b 4 and v r 6 5 as an example the lower side of the dc sheds a strong vortex causing the dc to move downward when reaching the maximum negative displacement t 4 the uc and dc are in a relatively distant position which means the shear layer of the uc cannot be attached to both sides of the dc at the same time this impact increases the lift force which further promotes the vibration of the dc in addition the large transverse vibration of the dc increases the transverse spacing of wake vortices leading to the appearance of the two row vortex mode 4 4 2 wake mode vii fig 20 shows the typical working condition of the two square cylinders in mode vii under this mode the dc at a small spacing exhibits a soft lock in region with a higher transverse amplitude uc taking the operating case of l b 2 5 and v r 11 as an example apart from the other cases four vortices falling off the uc a1 a2 b1 and b2 in one period cause the uc to vibrate greatly due to the small spacing ratio the wake of the uc has a very complicated effect on the vibration of the dc during dc downward movement t 2 vortex a1 falling off the uc hits the lower side of the dc vortex b2 passes through the upper side of the dc which generates an upward force on the dc and restrains the dc from moving downwards finally the dc has a smaller transverse amplitude than the uc when time elapses to t 3 the impact of vortex a1 on the dc disappears and vortex a1 merges with c1 falling off the dc resulting in a large downward lift force promoting the vibration of the dc the vortices shedding from the two square cylinders merge near the wake area t 4 eventually leading to a chaotic wake 4 4 3 wake mode iv and v figs 21 and 22 show the typical working conditions of the two cylinders in mode iv and mode v respectively under these modes two cylinders at moderate and large spacing ratios exhibit the lock in region of the co shedding regime taking the operating cases of l b 4 v r 7 5 and l b 4 v r 7 75 as examples from fig 21 the vortex shedding from the uc interacts with the shear layer of the dc which causes the lift force of the dc the dc does not exhibit vortex shedding so the lift value of the dc is quite low at this time the dc also vibrates greatly in the transverse direction which is attributed to the frequency ratio f y f n 1 in addition the wake vortex of the dc has a larger size in the streamwise direction which causes it to merge in the near wake region finally the vortex results in a chaotic wake compared with mode iv from fig 22 the vortex shedding from the dc merges with that from the uc resulting in a large lift force and promoting the vibration of the dc at this time the wake vortex size in the streamwise direction is typically small and the vortices do not merge near the wake area of the dc 5 conclusion the viv characteristics of two tandem square cylinders were investigated via the numerical simulation technique computations were carried out at various spacing ratios which profoundly affected the viv responses of the two cylinders the main conclusions in this paper are as follows in the cases of small spacing l b 2 2 5 the uc has no traditional lock in region f y f n 0 95 1 05 and v r 6 and the dc has only an exceedingly narrow traditional lock in region at a high reduced velocity v r 9 5 12 the wide soft lock in region f y f n 0 85 appears for both cylinders within this region the uc sheds four vortices in one vibration period and these vortices merge with the vortices of the dc in the wake flow causing the dc to exhibit a chaotic wake in the cases of moderate spacing l b 3 4 the transverse amplitude of the uc is limited and there are no lock in and soft lock in regions the dc does not have a soft lock in region and exhibits a relatively wide traditional lock in region v r 5 5 8 with two transverse amplitude peaks depending on v r there are four distinctively different wake modes within the lock in region namely the two row vortex mode of the reattachment regime 2s mode of the reattachment regime 2s mode with chaotic wake flow and two row vortex mode of the co shedding regime in the cases of large spacing l b 5 6 there is no significant soft lock in phenomenon or lock in phenomenon of the uc which is similar to the case of a single square cylinder it should be noted that the dc exhibits only a highly narrow traditional lock in region accompanied by sizable transverse amplitude the two square cylinders exhibit the co shedding regime with the single wake mode at a large spacing ratio namely the 2s mode with a chaotic wake flow credit authorship

20397,the stability of floating platforms is closely related to the sea states fairlead positions and center of mass cm of the platform to investigate the influences of these interference factors numerical modeling of a spar platform with four mooring cables is performed using an in house matlab code to analyze the influences of the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces of cables cable dynamics are considered using the lumped mass method with respect to a relative velocity element frame the relation between the motions of the spar and the propagating waves is revealed in both the time and frequency domains additionally the contribution of the hydrodynamic forces to the oscillating amplitude of the mooring forces is approximately 20 in the x and y directions and 40 in the z direction the hydrodynamic forces also generate hysteresis between the peak displacements and the peak forces finally the influences of the cm and fairleads are studied using four and five virtual maneuvers respectively the analysis results indicate that both the cm and fairleads have a slight influence on the translational motions whereas they have a significant influence on the rotational motions the optimal positions for setting the cm and fairleads are found with respect to the spar frame keywords stability analysis spar platform cable dynamics sea states center of mass fairleads 1 introduction the spar platform is widely used for floating offshore wind turbines and oil production facilities jonkman 2010 soeb et al 2017 tomasicchio et al 2018 its slender shape reduces the hydrodynamic forces of surface waves additionally as the center of mass cm is lower than the center of buoyancy cb restoring moments are generated automatically when the axis of the spar is not perpendicular to the still water level swl stability is the most important issue in platform design and it is closely related to the sea states mooring system fairlead positions and cm of the platform the frequency domain model is widely used to assess platform stability in the conceptual design stage hall and low modeled the mooring system in the frequency domain and nonlinear effects such as hydrodynamic forces were ignored hall et al 2014 low and langley 2006 the impact of the wind turbine floating platform and mooring system was considered in the frequency domain model developed by karimi karimi et al 2019 in addition to the frequency domain the dynamic motions of the platform have also been analyzed in the time domain the effects of the cable length cable number layout of mooring cables and anchor radius were studied using virtual simulations and these design parameters were optimized to achieve stable floating platforms barbanti et al 2018 campanile et al 2018 montasir et al 2015 it should be pointed out that the above models regardless of the domain are established based on quasi static methods in which the mooring forces are functions of the displacements of the spar platform the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces of the cables are ignored in quasi static methods generally the spar platform is moored by heavy chains and the motions of the spar are small therefore it is reasonable to ignore the dynamics of chains in engineering analysis jeon et al 2013 lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 however with the development of equipment to harvest marine resources smaller spar platforms are widely used the motions of the small spar are larger than those of the large spar and the hydrodynamic forces become non negligible in addition instead of a heavy chain many mooring cables are made of composite materials with a density similar to that of seawater pham et al 2019 tahar and kim 2008 xu and chen 2014 these changes have promoted the consideration of mooring cable dynamics cable dynamics were considered by xu in developing a vessel mooring coupled program xu et al 2020 which was used to design mooring system deployment for vessels at varying water depths to consider the nonlinear effects of hydrodynamic forces cable dynamics are widely expressed using the finite difference method fdm chen et al 2018 gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 mehrabi and tabatabai 1998 yuan et al 2014 and the lumped mass method lmm du et al 2019 minowa and toda 2018 zhu and yoo 2016 zhu et al 2017 compared to the fdm the lmm is more robust and fits the mooring system of a floating platform masciola et al 2014 to overcome the singularity of the lmm a relative velocity element frame based on the element orientation and relative velocity of the fluid was proposed by zhu zhu and yoo 2017 the hydrodynamic forces are efficiently expressed and the cable model survives in situations where singularity problems are generated by the frenet frame iyer and vishveshwara 1993 or euler angles diebel 2006 therefore the mooring cable is modeled by the lmm based on the relative velocity element frame in this numerical model because the ratio of the cross diameters to the wavelength is much less than 0 02 both the spar and cable are simplified as slender cylinders and divided into finite elements morison s equation matha et al 2011 is used to calculate the hydrodynamic forces with respect to wrt each element the loads of one element are expressed at the midpoint of the element and the strip theory rainey 1989 is used to sum all the element loads the mooring system is composed of four cables that are evenly distributed around the spar platform and four fairleads are located on the surface of the spar platform the bottoms of the cables are connected to the seabed by spring forces while the upper ends are connected to the fairleads by modified spherical joints this system is subjected to x and y directional waves which are expressed using the linear wave theory craik 2004 to validate the accuracy of the numerical model this floating system is analyzed using the commercial software proteusds pacific 2015 the spar motions and cable tensions obtained by the numerical model match well with those obtained by proteusds in both the time and frequency domains the differences in cable tension on the incoming flow side and outward side are investigated in this study additionally owing to the convenience in outputting the concerned forces the hydrodynamic forces acting on the cables are output and the contribution of the hydrodynamic forces to the entire cable load is illustrated wrt the global frame the hydrodynamic forces of the cables also generate hysteresis between the motions of the platform and mooring forces the impacts of mooring lines hysteresis on dynamics response of spar platform were also analyzed by li and chen chen et al 2021 li et al 2020 finally the effects of the cm and fairleads on the stability of the spar are studied using four and five virtual maneuvers respectively the lower the cm the more stable is the spar given the feasibility of manufacturing one proper cm is selected from four maneuvers meanwhile the best position of the fairlead is selected from five virtual maneuvers and an interesting relation between the phase of the pitch and the fairlead position is found the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the numerical model of the floating system including the spar cables ocean waves layout of mooring system and equation of motion of system is described in section 2 the influences of the sea states hydrodynamic forces of cables and positions of the cm and fairlead on the stability of the spar platform are investigated in section 3 section 4 concludes the paper with a summary of the research results 2 numerical models the global frame of the system is located at the swl as shown in fig 1 the z axis is directed upward and the x axis is directed horizontally to the right as the numerical model of the cable and ocean waves are given in detail in the references zhu and yoo 2015 2016 2017 they are briefly introduced herein the spar model the layout of the mooring system and the equation of motion of the system are introduced in detail 2 1 spar model the origin of the spar frame is located at its geometric center and the three axes coincide with those of the global frame the initial position of the spar is its undisplaced position in the wave trough as shown in fig 1 to calculate the submerged volume the spar is divided into 100 elements along the central axis and the height of each element is 0 12 m the properties of the spars are shown in table 1 the external forces acting on the spar platform are composed of the buoyancy f b b the effects of the added mass and froude krylov force f a b hydrodynamic drag f d b and moments m a b generated when the above forces are transferred from each element to the origin of the spar frame the formulations of the external loads are expressed in eq 1 f j a b represents the added mass and froude krylov force acting on the jth spar element and it is zero if the jth element is not submerged in water the hydrodynamic drag of the jth spar element f j d b obeys the same rule as f j a b f a b and f d b sum all f j a b and f j d b respectively 1 f b b ρ f v 0 g m b g c b q o r i g b f j a b 1 c a b v e ρ f v f j c a b v e ρ f q j

consider cable dynamics the cable is modeled using a lumped mass and spring modeling scheme buckham et al 2003 zhu and yoo 2017 a single cable is divided into 20 elements and the forces acting on the cable elements are expressed wrt the relative velocity element frame the element orientation vector is defined by the position vectors of the adjacent nodes the element orientation e g i and relative velocity v g i of the ith element are given by eq 4 n g i is the time derivative of the position vector n g i and v f i is the velocity of the water particle at the ith cable node the unit axes of the

the elevation of the surface wave ζ is the superposition of waves propagating in the x and y directions independently as shown in eq 10 10 ζ ζ a x cos k x x g ω x t ζ a y cos k y y g ω y t the superscripts x and y indicate the evaluation of wrt wave propagating in the x and y directions respectively therefore ζ a x and ζ a y denote wave amplitudes ω x and ω y denote circular wave frequencies and k x and k y denote wave numbers in the x and y directions respectively moreover the subscripts g represent the evaluation of wrt the global frame the position of a water particle wrt the global frame is expressed by x g y g and z g according to the above definition for a finite water depth the wave numbers k and circular wave frequencies ω are given by eq 11 t a x and t a y denote the wave periods in the x and y directions respectively d sb is the depth of the seabed the wave amplitudes and periods are presented in table 3 11 k x tanh k x d s b 4 π 2 g t a x 2 k y tanh k y d s

velocity and acceleration of the fluid is the sum of the velocities and accelerations of water particles in three dimensions respectively which are given by eq 13 13 v f i u g v g w g t v f i u g v g w g t 2 4 layout of mooring system the mooring system has four cables distributed uniformly around the spar platform and four fairleads are located on the surface of the spar platform the layout of the mooring system is shown in fig 2 initially the cable is a straight line without a preload cables a and b are distributed along the x and y axes respectively cables c and d are distributed along the x and y axes respectively a b c and d denote the fairlead positions on the spar according to the fairlead depth z f and diameter d b shown in table 1 the fairlead positions of z f a z f b z f c and z f d are 0 5 0 2 0 0 5 2 0 5 0 2 and 0 0 5 2 respectively each cable bottom is connected to the seabed by spring forces and the spring force between the cable a and the seabed is expressed by eq 14 p a n c h r a is the position vector of anchor point a with p a n c h r a 64 0 1000 here the radius of the anchors and depth of seabed are 64 and 1000 m respectively k and c are three by three diagonal matrixes of the stiffness and damping of the seabed respectively the coefficients k s and c s are given in table 3 14 q spr a k n g 21 p a n c h r a c n g 21 2 5 equation of motion of system a rigid body has six degrees of freedom dofs in three dimensions whereas a mass point has only three translational dofs the spherical joint model which is suitable for the connection between two rigid bodies is well developed in the literature nikravesh 1988 shabana 2013 as the cable node has only three translational dofs an appropriate modification is required for the connection between the spar and cable node the constraint equation of the fairlead position a is expressed by eq 15 15 φ s p h a q o r i g b 3 a b z f a n g 1 because the 1st node of the cable is connected to the floating spar the position vector of the 1st node n g 1 is used to express the constraint the jacobian matrix of the constraint equation is expressed by eq 16 16 φ q s p h a i a b z f a g i 17 ω g θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 g cos θ 2 cos θ 3 sin θ 3 0 cos θ 2 sin θ 3 cos θ 3 0 sin θ 2 0 1 the rotation angles of the euler angle set x y z are selected as the general coordinates equation 17 shows the relation between the angular velocities of the spar and the rotation speed of the euler angles expressed as g shabana 2009 greenwood 1988 the product of the jacobian matrix and general coordinates vector γ a are generated by the general coordinates and the first derivative of the general coordinates wrt time as given in eq 18 18 γ a a b ω z f a g a b z f a g θ finally the equation of motion for a floating spar system with mooring cables is expressed in eq 19 to illustrate the relationship between the spar and cables the first term in eq 19 is shown in fig 3 in addition to the fairlead position a the jacobian matrix φ q s p h also includes the fairlead positions b c and d the matrix φ q s p h t denotes the transposed jacobian matrix φ q s p h q is the vector of external forces acting on the spar and four cables γ consists of γ a γ b γ c and γ d 19 m φ q s p h t φ q s p h 0 q λ q γ 3 simulation results 3 1 effect of propagating waves the simulation is conducted for 200 s with a step size of 0 01 s the motions of the buoy are measured wrt the geometric center of the spar to validate the accuracy of the numerical model a spar system with four mooring cables is also modeled using the commercial software proteusds as shown in fig 4 the effect of propagating waves is analyzed using both the numerical model and proteusds the surge motion oscillates in the x direction with an amplitude of 0 8 m and the results of the numerical model are slightly larger than those of proteusds as shown in fig 5 a fast fourier transform is used to illustrate the relation between the surge motion and propagating waves in the frequency domain the outstanding frequency is 0 127 hz as shown in fig 6 as 0 125 hz is the natural frequency of the x directional wave the x directional wave has a dominant effect on the surge motion the sway motion and associated frequency are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively the spar oscillates in the y direction with an amplitude of 0 6 m the outstanding frequency of 0 153 hz is consistent with the natural frequency of the y directional wave as cables a and c are distributed along the x axis and cables b and d are along the y axis the surge and sway motions are independent and dominated by the x and y directional waves respectively the y directional wave has almost no effect on the surge motion and the x directional wave has no effect on the sway motion the layout of the mooring cable decouples the x and y directional motions the heave motion and associated frequency are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively the spar dives and rises approximately 4 57 m with an oscillating amplitude of 0 2 m which is indicated by both the numerical model and proteusds as the heave motion combines the effects of the x and y directional waves the natural frequency of the system is shown herein the period of the x and y directional waves are 8 0 and 6 4 s the lowest common multiple of which is 32 s which matches with the frequency of 0 033 hz the x directional wave makes the main contribution to the heave motion by the numerical model whereas the y directional wave is the main contributor according to proteusds as shown in fig 10 because the wave amplitudes are 2 4 and 1 4 m in the x and y directions respectively it is reasonable that the x directional wave makes the dominant contribution to the heave motion the superiority of the x directional wave is not shown in proteusds and this difference might be due to the coupling of the x and y directional waves initially the spar is located at the trough of the cosine waves and it then moves to the x and y axes it oscillates only on the positive side of the x and y axes if there are no mooring cables because of the mooring system the spar moves to the negative side of the x and y axes and the mean amplitude of the oscillation changes gradually from 1 to 0 as shown by the numerical model in fig 11 the spar is modeled using 100 axial elements in the numerical model and the external loads for each element are expressed at the midpoint of the element therefore the yaw motion of the spar is simply generated by the unbalanced loads from the mooring system whereas the spar is divided into 100 elements axially 64 elements angularly and 3 elements radially in proteusds thus the moment arms of the radial elements exist in proteusds in addition to the mooring system yaw motion is also generated by hydrodynamic forces acting on the spar elements in proteusds the difference in the geometric construction results in a difference in the external loads and generates a slight difference in the yaw motion the yaw motion of proteusds has more oscillating frequencies than that of the numerical model as shown in fig 12 the frequency of 0 033 hz is obvious and 0 22 and 0 28 hz are frequency multiplications of 0 033 hz the frequency multiplications become prominent possibly because of the nonlinear effect of the hydrodynamic forces of cables there is no preload therefore the tension is zero initially subsequently the cable tension varies with the propagating waves the tensions within cables a and b are shown in figs 13 and 15 respectively the associated frequencies are shown in figs 14 and 16 respectively the average tension in cable a is 8126 n from the numerical model whereas it is 8146 n from proteusds as the x directional wave is larger than the y directional wave the tension in cables a and c is larger than that in cables b and d the cables distributed in the x direction are dominantly affected by the x directional wave as shown in fig 14 as the oscillating amplitudes of the surge and sway are less than 1 m and the length of a single cable is larger than 77 m the influence of the y directional wave on cables a and c is insignificant meanwhile the y directional wave has a dominant influence on the tension of cables b and d and the effect of the x directional wave is insignificant the frequency of 0 033 hz appears again in the tension as shown in fig 16 table 4 summarizes the cable tensions given by the numerical model and proteusds both the mean value and the oscillating amplitudes are shown wrt cables a b c and d the maximum error is generated for the tension in cable c compared to the results given by proteusds the error ratios of the mean value and amplitude are 4 0 and 24 respectively fig 5 shows that the surge motion by numerical model is larger than that by proteusds and this difference is also reflected by the cable tensions the tension of cables located on the incoming flow is larger by approximately 20 than that of cables on the outward side to analyze the nonlinear effect of the hydrodynamic forces such as the hydrodynamic drag and froude krylov forces the hydrodynamic forces acting on each cable node are summed wrt the global frame the mooring forces acting on the fairleads of the spar are expressed by the reaction forces of the modified spherical joint nikravesh 1988 the y directional mooring forces of cable a are negligible compared to the x and z directional forces as shown in fig 17 where ahyx and amx indicate the x directional hydrodynamic forces and mooring forces of cable a respectively the hydrodynamic forces are generated by ocean waves they change periodically around 0 n due to the inclination angle between cable a and seabed the x and z directional hydrodynamic forces have negative and positive values synchronously the magnitude of the hydrodynamic forces is about 500 n in the both x and z direction as the z axis of the global frame is upward and cable a is directed along the x axis the z and x directional mooring forces have negative and positive values respectively generally the x and z directional mooring forces can also be derived from the cable tension of the 1st element table 5 shows the proportion of hydrodynamic forces in cables a b c and d the y directional forces in cables a and c and the x directional forces in cables b and d are too small to be considered in the proportion analysis the hydrodynamic drag and froude krylov forces are closely related to the relative velocities and accelerations of the water particles respectively because the velocities and accelerations of water particles change periodically with propagating waves the mean values of the hydrodynamic forces are small however the mean values of the mooring forces are dominated by the displacements of the spar and thus the mean values of the mooring forces are very large the proportion of the oscillating amplitude of the hydrodynamic forces in the mean value of the mooring forces is approximately 10 as 90 of the loads are considered by the quasi static method the quasi static method is acceptable in the conceptual design however the proportion of the oscillating amplitude of the hydrodynamic forces in the oscillating amplitude of the mooring forces is approximately 25 in the x and y directions and it is approximately 40 in the z direction this indicates that the hydrodynamic forces contribute significantly to the oscillating amplitude of the mooring forces the hydrodynamic forces of cables should be considered in stability analysis of the floating platform and the fatigue analysis of the mooring cable finally the relationship between the mooring forces and the motions of the spar is shown in fig 18 according to the quasi static theory the maximum mooring forces occur at the largest surge displacement owing to the nonlinear effect of the hydrodynamic forces the maximum mooring forces emerge ahead of the largest displacement and the time differences between the force peaks and the largest displacements are approximately 1 10 of the period in this model this hysteresis is generated by the hydrodynamic forces additionally the sway has the same step as the y directional mooring forces and has an insignificant influence on the x directional mooring forces which is confirmed again 3 2 effect of center of mass to analyze the relation between the motions of the spar and the position of the cm four maneuvers named cm 2 cm 3 cm 4 and cm 5 are generated and they indicate that the cm of the spar is 2 3 4 and 5 m wrt the spar frame respectively the properties of the spar platform mooring cables and ocean conditions are the same as those in the study of propagating waves the change in the cm from 3 to 5 m has almost no influence on the surge sway and heave motions as shown in figs 19 21 respectively the sway and heave motion of cm 2 show slight differences compared to other cases this indicates that the translational motions are stable when the cm is 3 m lower than the geometric center of the spar in the current sea states the frequencies and phases of the translational motions are the same when the cm is 3 m lower than the geometric center of the spar the rotational motions of the spar i e the roll pitch and yaw are shown in figs 22 24 respectively the rotational motions of cm 2 are obviously larger than those of other cases and the yaw motion has the tendency of divergence the lower the cm the more stable is the spar the difference between cm 4 and cm 5 is very small and this difference is much smaller than those between cm 2 and cm 3 and between cm 3 and cm 4 the roll and pitch angles of cm 4 are 6 and 7 respectively as the total length of the spar is 12 m the bottom is 6 m wrt the spar frame it is difficult to construct a spar platform if the cm is 5 m and thus a cm of 4 m is the best choice to stabilize this system in the current sea states 3 3 effect of fairleads based on the analysis results of the position of the cm the relations between the motions of the spar and the positions of the fairlead are studied with the cm set to 4 m five cases are analyzed and f2 f1 f0 f 1 and f 2 indicate the fairlead vertical positions of 2 1 0 1 and 2 m wrt the spar frame respectively the properties of the spar platform mooring cables and ocean conditions are the same as those considered in propagating wave studies the influences of the fairlead position on the surge sway and heave motions are shown in figs 25 27 respectively except for the divergent cases the influence of the fairleads on the translational motions is slight f0 and f 1 have nearly the same effect in the surge and sway motions the rotational motions are sensitive to the position of the fairlead as shown in figs 28 30 which show the roll pitch and yaw motions respectively f0 is the most stable position and f 1 is the second most stable the angles of roll and pitch vary within 3 and 3 in the case of f0 the oscillation amplitude of f 2 is twice as large as that of f0 the change in fairlead position does not affect the frequency of motions but it affects the phases of motion especially the rotation motions the simulation results indicate both the f2 and f1 cases tend to divergence after 100 s this indicates that positions above 1 m from the spar origin are improper for the fairlead figs 28 and 29 indicate the f 1 and f 2 have the same phase angle and f0 f1 and f2 have the other phase angle the phase difference is one semi period which indicates that the x directional loads are divided at a point located between 1 and 0 m to reduce the pitch and sway motions all the loads above the fairlead ought to be balanced with the loads below the fairlead although this ideal fairlead position changes with the sea states one feasible range can be obtained by dynamic analysis of the system in the appointed ocean states as the cost of lowering the cm is high optimizing the position of the fairlead is a feasible way to improve the stability of the spar platform f0 the geometric center of the spar platform is the best position for the fairlead in the current condition where the yaw angle is less than 3 as shown in fig 30 4 conclusions numerical modeling of a spar platform with four mooring cables is performed considering the cable dynamics the cable model is established using a lumped mass method based on a relative velocity element frame the influences of the sea states cable dynamics fairlead positions and cm of the spar on the stability of the spar platform are investigated in both the time and frequency domains the results of this study are briefly listed as follows 1 the layout of the mooring system affects the motion of the spar platform four cables separated by 90 decoupled the x and y directional motions 2 the tension of the cables located on the incoming flow side is larger than that of those on the outward side by approximately 20 3 the contribution of the hydrodynamic forces to the mean value of the mooring forces is approximately 10 whereas the contribution of the hydrodynamic forces to the oscillating amplitude is approximately 25 in the x and y directions and 40 in the z direction 4 this hysteresis between the motions of the spar and mooring forces is generated by hydrodynamic forces the time difference between the peak of the x directional mooring forces and the largest surge motion is approximately 1 10 of the period 5 both the cm and fairlead have a slight influence on the translational motions whereas they have an obvious influence on the rotational motions given the feasibility of manufacturing the best vertical positions of the cm and fairleads are selected from the virtual analysis which are 4 and 0 m wrt the spar frame respectively 6 optimizing the fairlead is an effective and economical method to improve the stability of the spar platform and the location where the phase of pitch roll changes 1 2 of the period is the best fairlead position credit authorship contribution statement xiangqian zhu conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation writing original draft writing review editing

20397,the stability of floating platforms is closely related to the sea states fairlead positions and center of mass cm of the platform to investigate the influences of these interference factors numerical modeling of a spar platform with four mooring cables is performed using an in house matlab code to analyze the influences of the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces of cables cable dynamics are considered using the lumped mass method with respect to a relative velocity element frame the relation between the motions of the spar and the propagating waves is revealed in both the time and frequency domains additionally the contribution of the hydrodynamic forces to the oscillating amplitude of the mooring forces is approximately 20 in the x and y directions and 40 in the z direction the hydrodynamic forces also generate hysteresis between the peak displacements and the peak forces finally the influences of the cm and fairleads are studied using four and five virtual maneuvers respectively the analysis results indicate that both the cm and fairleads have a slight influence on the translational motions whereas they have a significant influence on the rotational motions the optimal positions for setting the cm and fairleads are found with respect to the spar frame keywords stability analysis spar platform cable dynamics sea states center of mass fairleads 1 introduction the spar platform is widely used for floating offshore wind turbines and oil production facilities jonkman 2010 soeb et al 2017 tomasicchio et al 2018 its slender shape reduces the hydrodynamic forces of surface waves additionally as the center of mass cm is lower than the center of buoyancy cb restoring moments are generated automatically when the axis of the spar is not perpendicular to the still water level swl stability is the most important issue in platform design and it is closely related to the sea states mooring system fairlead positions and cm of the platform the frequency domain model is widely used to assess platform stability in the conceptual design stage hall and low modeled the mooring system in the frequency domain and nonlinear effects such as hydrodynamic forces were ignored hall et al 2014 low and langley 2006 the impact of the wind turbine floating platform and mooring system was considered in the frequency domain model developed by karimi karimi et al 2019 in addition to the frequency domain the dynamic motions of the platform have also been analyzed in the time domain the effects of the cable length cable number layout of mooring cables and anchor radius were studied using virtual simulations and these design parameters were optimized to achieve stable floating platforms barbanti et al 2018 campanile et al 2018 montasir et al 2015 it should be pointed out that the above models regardless of the domain are established based on quasi static methods in which the mooring forces are functions of the displacements of the spar platform the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces of the cables are ignored in quasi static methods generally the spar platform is moored by heavy chains and the motions of the spar are small therefore it is reasonable to ignore the dynamics of chains in engineering analysis jeon et al 2013 lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 however with the development of equipment to harvest marine resources smaller spar platforms are widely used the motions of the small spar are larger than those of the large spar and the hydrodynamic forces become non negligible in addition instead of a heavy chain many mooring cables are made of composite materials with a density similar to that of seawater pham et al 2019 tahar and kim 2008 xu and chen 2014 these changes have promoted the consideration of mooring cable dynamics cable dynamics were considered by xu in developing a vessel mooring coupled program xu et al 2020 which was used to design mooring system deployment for vessels at varying water depths to consider the nonlinear effects of hydrodynamic forces cable dynamics are widely expressed using the finite difference method fdm chen et al 2018 gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 mehrabi and tabatabai 1998 yuan et al 2014 and the lumped mass method lmm du et al 2019 minowa and toda 2018 zhu and yoo 2016 zhu et al 2017 compared to the fdm the lmm is more robust and fits the mooring system of a floating platform masciola et al 2014 to overcome the singularity of the lmm a relative velocity element frame based on the element orientation and relative velocity of the fluid was proposed by zhu zhu and yoo 2017 the hydrodynamic forces are efficiently expressed and the cable model survives in situations where singularity problems are generated by the frenet frame iyer and vishveshwara 1993 or euler angles diebel 2006 therefore the mooring cable is modeled by the lmm based on the relative velocity element frame in this numerical model because the ratio of the cross diameters to the wavelength is much less than 0 02 both the spar and cable are simplified as slender cylinders and divided into finite elements morison s equation matha et al 2011 is used to calculate the hydrodynamic forces with respect to wrt each element the loads of one element are expressed at the midpoint of the element and the strip theory rainey 1989 is used to sum all the element loads the mooring system is composed of four cables that are evenly distributed around the spar platform and four fairleads are located on the surface of the spar platform the bottoms of the cables are connected to the seabed by spring forces while the upper ends are connected to the fairleads by modified spherical joints this system is subjected to x and y directional waves which are expressed using the linear wave theory craik 2004 to validate the accuracy of the numerical model this floating system is analyzed using the commercial software proteusds pacific 2015 the spar motions and cable tensions obtained by the numerical model match well with those obtained by proteusds in both the time and frequency domains the differences in cable tension on the incoming flow side and outward side are investigated in this study additionally owing to the convenience in outputting the concerned forces the hydrodynamic forces acting on the cables are output and the contribution of the hydrodynamic forces to the entire cable load is illustrated wrt the global frame the hydrodynamic forces of the cables also generate hysteresis between the motions of the platform and mooring forces the impacts of mooring lines hysteresis on dynamics response of spar platform were also analyzed by li and chen chen et al 2021 li et al 2020 finally the effects of the cm and fairleads on the stability of the spar are studied using four and five virtual maneuvers respectively the lower the cm the more stable is the spar given the feasibility of manufacturing one proper cm is selected from four maneuvers meanwhile the best position of the fairlead is selected from five virtual maneuvers and an interesting relation between the phase of the pitch and the fairlead position is found the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the numerical model of the floating system including the spar cables ocean waves layout of mooring system and equation of motion of system is described in section 2 the influences of the sea states hydrodynamic forces of cables and positions of the cm and fairlead on the stability of the spar platform are investigated in section 3 section 4 concludes the paper with a summary of the research results 2 numerical models the global frame of the system is located at the swl as shown in fig 1 the z axis is directed upward and the x axis is directed horizontally to the right as the numerical model of the cable and ocean waves are given in detail in the references zhu and yoo 2015 2016 2017 they are briefly introduced herein the spar model the layout of the mooring system and the equation of motion of the system are introduced in detail 2 1 spar model the origin of the spar frame is located at its geometric center and the three axes coincide with those of the global frame the initial position of the spar is its undisplaced position in the wave trough as shown in fig 1 to calculate the submerged volume the spar is divided into 100 elements along the central axis and the height of each element is 0 12 m the properties of the spars are shown in table 1 the external forces acting on the spar platform are composed of the buoyancy f b b the effects of the added mass and froude krylov force f a b hydrodynamic drag f d b and moments m a b generated when the above forces are transferred from each element to the origin of the spar frame the formulations of the external loads are expressed in eq 1 f j a b represents the added mass and froude krylov force acting on the jth spar element and it is zero if the jth element is not submerged in water the hydrodynamic drag of the jth spar element f j d b obeys the same rule as f j a b f a b and f d b sum all f j a b and f j d b respectively 1 f b b ρ f v 0 g m b g c b q o r i g b f j a b 1 c a b v e ρ f v f j c a b v e ρ f q j

condition respectively m b is the mass matrix of the spar and the restoring coefficient c b is given by eq 2 the position vector q o r i g b represents the origin of the spar frame wrt the global frame because the origin of the spar frame is located at the midpoint between the 50th and 51st spar elements q o r i g b can be expressed by using q 50 g b and q 51 g b as shown in eq 3 v e and a e denote the volume and horizontally projected area of one submerged element respectively v f j is the acceleration of the water particle at the jth spar element and it assumes that the acceleration of the water particle is identical within the element q j g b is the acceleration vector of the jth spar element v j g r is the velocity of the jth spar element relative to the surrounding fluid as shown in eq 3 the velocity of the water particle is assumed to be identical within the element the vector s b j denotes the position of the jth spar element wrt the spar frame where s b j represents the skew symmetric matrix of the position vector s b j shabana 2009 and where g is the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration vector g finally all the element forces are transferred to the origin of

rotational transformation matrix of the spar and θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 are the rotation angles of the euler angle set x y z ω denotes the angular velocity of the spar wrt the spar frame 2 2 cable model to consider cable dynamics the cable is modeled using a lumped mass and spring modeling scheme buckham et al 2003 zhu and yoo 2017 a single cable is divided into 20 elements and the forces acting on the cable elements are expressed wrt the relative velocity element frame the element orientation vector is defined by the position vectors of the adjacent nodes the element orientation e g i and relative velocity v g i of the ith element are given by eq 4 n g i is the time derivative of the position vector n g i and v f i is the velocity of the water particle at the ith cable node the unit axes of the ith element are specified by eq 5 4 e g i n g i 1 n g i v g i v f i 1 v f i n g i 1 n g i 2 5 z i e g i e g i x i z i v g i z i v g i y i z i x i the forces acting on the cables include the tension t

the mass matrix of the ith node wrt the global frame m i i is given by eq 8 m c i is the mass of the ith element wrt the element frame c a is the coefficient of the added mass and the axial added mass is ignored because the ith node is the intersection of the i 1 th and ith elements the mass matrix m i i is expressed by element mass matrices m c i 1 and m c i 8 m c i m c i c a m f i 0 0 0 m c i c a

the elevation of the surface wave ζ is the superposition of waves propagating in the x and y directions independently as shown in eq 10 10 ζ ζ a x cos k x x g ω x t ζ a y cos k y y g ω y t the superscripts x and y indicate the evaluation of wrt wave propagating in the x and y directions respectively therefore ζ a x and ζ a y denote wave amplitudes ω x and ω y denote circular wave frequencies and k x and k y denote wave numbers in the x and y directions respectively moreover the subscripts g represent the evaluation of wrt the global frame the position of a water particle wrt the global frame is expressed by x g y g and z g according to the above definition for a finite water depth the wave numbers k and circular wave frequencies ω are given by eq 11 t a x and t a y denote the wave periods in the x and y directions respectively d sb is the depth of the seabed the wave amplitudes and periods are presented in table 3 11 k x tanh k x d s b 4 π 2 g t a x 2 k y tanh k y d s

velocity and acceleration of the fluid is the sum of the velocities and accelerations of water particles in three dimensions respectively which are given by eq 13 13 v f i u g v g w g t v f i u g v g w g t 2 4 layout of mooring system the mooring system has four cables distributed uniformly around the spar platform and four fairleads are located on the surface of the spar platform the layout of the mooring system is shown in fig 2 initially the cable is a straight line without a preload cables a and b are distributed along the x and y axes respectively cables c and d are distributed along the x and y axes respectively a b c and d denote the fairlead positions on the spar according to the fairlead depth z f and diameter d b shown in table 1 the fairlead positions of z f a z f b z f c and z f d are 0 5 0 2 0 0 5 2 0 5 0 2 and 0 0 5 2 respectively each cable bottom is connected to the seabed by spring forces and the spring force between the cable a and the seabed is expressed by eq 14 p a n c h r a is the position vector of anchor point a with p a n c h r a 64 0 1000 here the radius of the anchors and depth of seabed are 64 and 1000 m respectively k and c are three by three diagonal matrixes of the stiffness and damping of the seabed respectively the coefficients k s and c s are given in table 3 14 q spr a k n g 21 p a n c h r a c n g 21 2 5 equation of motion of system a rigid body has six degrees of freedom dofs in three dimensions whereas a mass point has only three translational dofs the spherical joint model which is suitable for the connection between two rigid bodies is well developed in the literature nikravesh 1988 shabana 2013 as the cable node has only three translational dofs an appropriate modification is required for the connection between the spar and cable node the constraint equation of the fairlead position a is expressed by eq 15 15 φ s p h a q o r i g b 3 a b z f a n g 1 because the 1st node of the cable is connected to the floating spar the position vector of the 1st node n g 1 is used to express the constraint the jacobian matrix of the constraint equation is expressed by eq 16 16 φ q s p h a i a b z f a g i 17 ω g θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 g cos θ 2 cos θ 3 sin θ 3 0 cos θ 2 sin θ 3 cos θ 3 0 sin θ 2 0 1 the rotation angles of the euler angle set x y z are selected as the general coordinates equation 17 shows the relation between the angular velocities of the spar and the rotation speed of the euler angles expressed as g shabana 2009 greenwood 1988 the product of the jacobian matrix and general coordinates vector γ a are generated by the general coordinates and the first derivative of the general coordinates wrt time as given in eq 18 18 γ a a b ω z f a g a b z f a g θ finally the equation of motion for a floating spar system with mooring cables is expressed in eq 19 to illustrate the relationship between the spar and cables the first term in eq 19 is shown in fig 3 in addition to the fairlead position a the jacobian matrix φ q s p h also includes the fairlead positions b c and d the matrix φ q s p h t denotes the transposed jacobian matrix φ q s p h q is the vector of external forces acting on the spar and four cables γ consists of γ a γ b γ c and γ d 19 m φ q s p h t φ q s p h 0 q λ q γ 3 simulation results 3 1 effect of propagating waves the simulation is conducted for 200 s with a step size of 0 01 s the motions of the buoy are measured wrt the geometric center of the spar to validate the accuracy of the numerical model a spar system with four mooring cables is also modeled using the commercial software proteusds as shown in fig 4 the effect of propagating waves is analyzed using both the numerical model and proteusds the surge motion oscillates in the x direction with an amplitude of 0 8 m and the results of the numerical model are slightly larger than those of proteusds as shown in fig 5 a fast fourier transform is used to illustrate the relation between the surge motion and propagating waves in the frequency domain the outstanding frequency is 0 127 hz as shown in fig 6 as 0 125 hz is the natural frequency of the x directional wave the x directional wave has a dominant effect on the surge motion the sway motion and associated frequency are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively the spar oscillates in the y direction with an amplitude of 0 6 m the outstanding frequency of 0 153 hz is consistent with the natural frequency of the y directional wave as cables a and c are distributed along the x axis and cables b and d are along the y axis the surge and sway motions are independent and dominated by the x and y directional waves respectively the y directional wave has almost no effect on the surge motion and the x directional wave has no effect on the sway motion the layout of the mooring cable decouples the x and y directional motions the heave motion and associated frequency are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively the spar dives and rises approximately 4 57 m with an oscillating amplitude of 0 2 m which is indicated by both the numerical model and proteusds as the heave motion combines the effects of the x and y directional waves the natural frequency of the system is shown herein the period of the x and y directional waves are 8 0 and 6 4 s the lowest common multiple of which is 32 s which matches with the frequency of 0 033 hz the x directional wave makes the main contribution to the heave motion by the numerical model whereas the y directional wave is the main contributor according to proteusds as shown in fig 10 because the wave amplitudes are 2 4 and 1 4 m in the x and y directions respectively it is reasonable that the x directional wave makes the dominant contribution to the heave motion the superiority of the x directional wave is not shown in proteusds and this difference might be due to the coupling of the x and y directional waves initially the spar is located at the trough of the cosine waves and it then moves to the x and y axes it oscillates only on the positive side of the x and y axes if there are no mooring cables because of the mooring system the spar moves to the negative side of the x and y axes and the mean amplitude of the oscillation changes gradually from 1 to 0 as shown by the numerical model in fig 11 the spar is modeled using 100 axial elements in the numerical model and the external loads for each element are expressed at the midpoint of the element therefore the yaw motion of the spar is simply generated by the unbalanced loads from the mooring system whereas the spar is divided into 100 elements axially 64 elements angularly and 3 elements radially in proteusds thus the moment arms of the radial elements exist in proteusds in addition to the mooring system yaw motion is also generated by hydrodynamic forces acting on the spar elements in proteusds the difference in the geometric construction results in a difference in the external loads and generates a slight difference in the yaw motion the yaw motion of proteusds has more oscillating frequencies than that of the numerical model as shown in fig 12 the frequency of 0 033 hz is obvious and 0 22 and 0 28 hz are frequency multiplications of 0 033 hz the frequency multiplications become prominent possibly because of the nonlinear effect of the hydrodynamic forces of cables there is no preload therefore the tension is zero initially subsequently the cable tension varies with the propagating waves the tensions within cables a and b are shown in figs 13 and 15 respectively the associated frequencies are shown in figs 14 and 16 respectively the average tension in cable a is 8126 n from the numerical model whereas it is 8146 n from proteusds as the x directional wave is larger than the y directional wave the tension in cables a and c is larger than that in cables b and d the cables distributed in the x direction are dominantly affected by the x directional wave as shown in fig 14 as the oscillating amplitudes of the surge and sway are less than 1 m and the length of a single cable is larger than 77 m the influence of the y directional wave on cables a and c is insignificant meanwhile the y directional wave has a dominant influence on the tension of cables b and d and the effect of the x directional wave is insignificant the frequency of 0 033 hz appears again in the tension as shown in fig 16 table 4 summarizes the cable tensions given by the numerical model and proteusds both the mean value and the oscillating amplitudes are shown wrt cables a b c and d the maximum error is generated for the tension in cable c compared to the results given by proteusds the error ratios of the mean value and amplitude are 4 0 and 24 respectively fig 5 shows that the surge motion by numerical model is larger than that by proteusds and this difference is also reflected by the cable tensions the tension of cables located on the incoming flow is larger by approximately 20 than that of cables on the outward side to analyze the nonlinear effect of the hydrodynamic forces such as the hydrodynamic drag and froude krylov forces the hydrodynamic forces acting on each cable node are summed wrt the global frame the mooring forces acting on the fairleads of the spar are expressed by the reaction forces of the modified spherical joint nikravesh 1988 the y directional mooring forces of cable a are negligible compared to the x and z directional forces as shown in fig 17 where ahyx and amx indicate the x directional hydrodynamic forces and mooring forces of cable a respectively the hydrodynamic forces are generated by ocean waves they change periodically around 0 n due to the inclination angle between cable a and seabed the x and z directional hydrodynamic forces have negative and positive values synchronously the magnitude of the hydrodynamic forces is about 500 n in the both x and z direction as the z axis of the global frame is upward and cable a is directed along the x axis the z and x directional mooring forces have negative and positive values respectively generally the x and z directional mooring forces can also be derived from the cable tension of the 1st element table 5 shows the proportion of hydrodynamic forces in cables a b c and d the y directional forces in cables a and c and the x directional forces in cables b and d are too small to be considered in the proportion analysis the hydrodynamic drag and froude krylov forces are closely related to the relative velocities and accelerations of the water particles respectively because the velocities and accelerations of water particles change periodically with propagating waves the mean values of the hydrodynamic forces are small however the mean values of the mooring forces are dominated by the displacements of the spar and thus the mean values of the mooring forces are very large the proportion of the oscillating amplitude of the hydrodynamic forces in the mean value of the mooring forces is approximately 10 as 90 of the loads are considered by the quasi static method the quasi static method is acceptable in the conceptual design however the proportion of the oscillating amplitude of the hydrodynamic forces in the oscillating amplitude of the mooring forces is approximately 25 in the x and y directions and it is approximately 40 in the z direction this indicates that the hydrodynamic forces contribute significantly to the oscillating amplitude of the mooring forces the hydrodynamic forces of cables should be considered in stability analysis of the floating platform and the fatigue analysis of the mooring cable finally the relationship between the mooring forces and the motions of the spar is shown in fig 18 according to the quasi static theory the maximum mooring forces occur at the largest surge displacement owing to the nonlinear effect of the hydrodynamic forces the maximum mooring forces emerge ahead of the largest displacement and the time differences between the force peaks and the largest displacements are approximately 1 10 of the period in this model this hysteresis is generated by the hydrodynamic forces additionally the sway has the same step as the y directional mooring forces and has an insignificant influence on the x directional mooring forces which is confirmed again 3 2 effect of center of mass to analyze the relation between the motions of the spar and the position of the cm four maneuvers named cm 2 cm 3 cm 4 and cm 5 are generated and they indicate that the cm of the spar is 2 3 4 and 5 m wrt the spar frame respectively the properties of the spar platform mooring cables and ocean conditions are the same as those in the study of propagating waves the change in the cm from 3 to 5 m has almost no influence on the surge sway and heave motions as shown in figs 19 21 respectively the sway and heave motion of cm 2 show slight differences compared to other cases this indicates that the translational motions are stable when the cm is 3 m lower than the geometric center of the spar in the current sea states the frequencies and phases of the translational motions are the same when the cm is 3 m lower than the geometric center of the spar the rotational motions of the spar i e the roll pitch and yaw are shown in figs 22 24 respectively the rotational motions of cm 2 are obviously larger than those of other cases and the yaw motion has the tendency of divergence the lower the cm the more stable is the spar the difference between cm 4 and cm 5 is very small and this difference is much smaller than those between cm 2 and cm 3 and between cm 3 and cm 4 the roll and pitch angles of cm 4 are 6 and 7 respectively as the total length of the spar is 12 m the bottom is 6 m wrt the spar frame it is difficult to construct a spar platform if the cm is 5 m and thus a cm of 4 m is the best choice to stabilize this system in the current sea states 3 3 effect of fairleads based on the analysis results of the position of the cm the relations between the motions of the spar and the positions of the fairlead are studied with the cm set to 4 m five cases are analyzed and f2 f1 f0 f 1 and f 2 indicate the fairlead vertical positions of 2 1 0 1 and 2 m wrt the spar frame respectively the properties of the spar platform mooring cables and ocean conditions are the same as those considered in propagating wave studies the influences of the fairlead position on the surge sway and heave motions are shown in figs 25 27 respectively except for the divergent cases the influence of the fairleads on the translational motions is slight f0 and f 1 have nearly the same effect in the surge and sway motions the rotational motions are sensitive to the position of the fairlead as shown in figs 28 30 which show the roll pitch and yaw motions respectively f0 is the most stable position and f 1 is the second most stable the angles of roll and pitch vary within 3 and 3 in the case of f0 the oscillation amplitude of f 2 is twice as large as that of f0 the change in fairlead position does not affect the frequency of motions but it affects the phases of motion especially the rotation motions the simulation results indicate both the f2 and f1 cases tend to divergence after 100 s this indicates that positions above 1 m from the spar origin are improper for the fairlead figs 28 and 29 indicate the f 1 and f 2 have the same phase angle and f0 f1 and f2 have the other phase angle the phase difference is one semi period which indicates that the x directional loads are divided at a point located between 1 and 0 m to reduce the pitch and sway motions all the loads above the fairlead ought to be balanced with the loads below the fairlead although this ideal fairlead position changes with the sea states one feasible range can be obtained by dynamic analysis of the system in the appointed ocean states as the cost of lowering the cm is high optimizing the position of the fairlead is a feasible way to improve the stability of the spar platform f0 the geometric center of the spar platform is the best position for the fairlead in the current condition where the yaw angle is less than 3 as shown in fig 30 4 conclusions numerical modeling of a spar platform with four mooring cables is performed considering the cable dynamics the cable model is established using a lumped mass method based on a relative velocity element frame the influences of the sea states cable dynamics fairlead positions and cm of the spar on the stability of the spar platform are investigated in both the time and frequency domains the results of this study are briefly listed as follows 1 the layout of the mooring system affects the motion of the spar platform four cables separated by 90 decoupled the x and y directional motions 2 the tension of the cables located on the incoming flow side is larger than that of those on the outward side by approximately 20 3 the contribution of the hydrodynamic forces to the mean value of the mooring forces is approximately 10 whereas the contribution of the hydrodynamic forces to the oscillating amplitude is approximately 25 in the x and y directions and 40 in the z direction 4 this hysteresis between the motions of the spar and mooring forces is generated by hydrodynamic forces the time difference between the peak of the x directional mooring forces and the largest surge motion is approximately 1 10 of the period 5 both the cm and fairlead have a slight influence on the translational motions whereas they have an obvious influence on the rotational motions given the feasibility of manufacturing the best vertical positions of the cm and fairleads are selected from the virtual analysis which are 4 and 0 m wrt the spar frame respectively 6 optimizing the fairlead is an effective and economical method to improve the stability of the spar platform and the location where the phase of pitch roll changes 1 2 of the period is the best fairlead position credit authorship contribution statement xiangqian zhu conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation writing original draft writing review editing

20398,hydrodynamic experiments in a flume tank in the current range of 40 80 cm s and computational fluid dynamic cfd analysis at the current of 60 cm s of trawl plane nettings with solidity ratios of 0 06 0 32 at small angles of attack 0 25 were conducted to refine the understanding of the relationship between resistance performance and flow behavior the rigid model representing the plane netting in a taut configuration was adopted a finite volume method was used for solving reynolds averaged navier stokes equations associated with the shear stress transport k ω model in cfd analysis referred to experimental results the parallel drag coefficient decreases from 0 4 to 0 25 with a reduction of 38 but the drag coefficient at the angle of attack of 25 rises from 0 62 to 0 79 with an increment of 27 as the solidity ratio increases from 0 06 to 0 32 such dual effect of the solidity ratio on the drag coefficient of plane nettings with respect to the inclination angle is also observed from cfd analysis a transition of flow behavior from flowing above to passing through the netting occurs the changing tendency of the local flow velocity is consistent with the resistance performance relative to the solidity ratio for the tested nettings keywords trawl plane netting resistance performance small angle of attack rigid model flow visualization 1 introduction the hydrodynamic analysis of fishing net structures especially the trawl has been of great interest to scientists for a long time such investigation has an impact not only on commercial fishing operations including the fishing vessel energy efficiency but also on the biological and socio economic environment bouhoubeiny et al 2011 mchugh et al 2017 mcconnaughey et al 2019 it is now well known that most of the fuel consumed during a fishing trip is used to tow the fishing gear of which the trawl net is responsible for the largest part for bottom and pelagic trawls the high energy intensity expressed as resistance performance of the trawl net accounts for over 60 of fuel consumption during fishing operations with otter boards vincent and roullt 2006 you et al 2020a the net proportion increases up to 90 of the overall for beam trawls or sampling gears towed by the warp only gjøsund and enerhaug 2010 suuronen et al 2012 resistance performance of the trawl net also determines fishing efficiency through the inverse relationship between drag and the net spread when the gear is towed furthermore the fluid flow behavior surrounding the trawl net influences the species selectivity of the fishing gear bouhoubeiny et al 2011 druault et al 2015 for a trawl net made of wing side square belly and cod end nettings the movement of trawl gear shown through an angle of inclination between netting and flow defined as the angle of attack θ is generally less than 15 during relatively stable towing matsuda 2001 the angle of attack steadily decreases along with the net and ends at the cod end parallel to the flow the inclination angle less than or equal to 25 was defined as the small angle of attack in the present study cf imai et al 1994 and tang et al 2019 the solidity ratio α defined as the ratio of the projected area to the total area enclosed by the outline area is commonly used to characterize the geometrical characteristics of netting customarily the solidity ratio for nettings of a whole trawl net increasing from the wing to the cod end is within the range of 0 05 0 3 patente et al 2008 kodota 2015 numerous efforts on addressing the abovementioned three issues have been conducted since the beginning of the 21st century most modification work has been confirmed through reduced model experiments or at sea trials although both methods are time intensive and costly balash et al 2014 mchugh et al 2017 the computer simulation acts as an alternative tool that can predict the behavior of the trawl net with few costs but its accuracy is low compared with the results of in situ measurement nguyen et al 2015 prada and pirour 2015 it is perhaps due to the lack of understanding of fluid structure interaction in trawl nettings relevant studies on the resistance performance vs inclination angle of different types of plane netting for aquaculture net cage reveal that the effect of solidity ratio on the resistance characteristics of the plane netting has been highlighted kebert et al 2013 riziotis et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 dong et al 2016 its tendency showed that when the angle of attack was close to the parallel state drag coefficient increased as solidity ratio shrunk for angles approaching normal to the current drag coefficient rose with the increasing solidity ratio they proposed that a shadow effect might occur as the fluid moved through upstream twine to downstream twine and caused a reduction of stream velocity and exerted fluid force the shadow effect was considered to take place in the case of a low angle of attack and reached a maximum when the plane netting was parallel to the current it implies that the interacting fluid around the trawl net towed at small angles of attack would induce different flow behaviors surrounding the trawl gear however the progress in fundamental studies of hydrodynamic characteristics of the trawl netting at small angles of attack is slow few references reported the resistance performance and the fluid net interaction issue of the trawl plane netting varying solidity ratios at small angles of attack in detail because of limitations on the experimental setup including the frame and installation methods tang et al 2019 we propose to investigate the resistance performance and flow pattern for the trawl plane netting at small angles of attack even if such a simple structure does not correspond to any practical trawl net however such a preliminary study will be permitted to elucidate the resistance behavior of the plane netting which is not fully understood in this study a novel self design framework was used to measure the resistance of the plane netting with solidity ratios 0 06 0 32 at small angles of attack 0 25 in flume tank experiments computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis as a simulation tool often used in fishery engineering chen et al 2016 bi et al 2017 you et al 2020b was adopted the rigid model expressing the plane netting in a taut configuration was calculated for a comparative study with experimental values at small angles of attack 0 25 the resistance characteristics of each mesh on one array were then extracted and the flow field around the plane netting was visualized and analyzed with the aid of the cfd approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 flume tank experiment to investigate resistance performance of trawl plane netting at small angles of attack eleven kinds of three stranded polyamide multifilament plane netting colloquially called nylon netting presented in table 1 were used in hydrodynamic experiments to evaluate the drag coefficient in the range of the reynolds number re d vd ν from 400 to 2000 here v is flow velocity d is twine diameter and ν is the kinematic viscosity mesh size and twine diameter were mean values measured in wet conditions by taking a sample of 5 mesh sizes with a ruler and 10 twine diameters with a digital caliper nichimo co ltd japan 0 01 mm resolution the solidity ratio as above defined is calculated as follows 1 α d 2 l d l 2 s i n 2 ϕ where l is the bar length and ϕ is the half mesh angle maintained at 45 30 20 in tests fig 1 hydrodynamic force measurements were conducted in a circulating flume tank at tokyo university of marine science and technology observation section length 9 0 m width 2 2 m and water depth 1 6 m a new setup framework l type frame was used to measure the drag force loading on the netting at angles of attack from 0 to 25 as the interval of 5 fig 2 the framework was assembled with six streamlined struts made of 5 mm aluminum which were designed to reduce the wake disturbance formed by the upwind side of the framework the dry weight of the framework was 213 g some thin wires with a 1 mm diameter were used to assemble experimental plane netting on the frame 50 cm 50 cm and compose the l type frame structure in the parallel state two sliders with a 5 cm length were fixed on the two fore struts to make the angle of attack equal to 0 fig 2a five attachment holes in the fore and rear struts respectively were provided to adjust the inclination between plane netting and the flow at the interval of 5 fig 2b a steel rod 36 cm in length and 16 mm in diameter was fixed to the center top of the frame to enable connection to a six component balance electronic industrial co ltd maximum load 5 kg and the flow velocity was measured using a propeller type current meter kenek co ltd model vot2 200 20 measurement range 3 cm s 200 cm s resolution 0 7 cm s 100 cm ahead of the netting load cells were calibrated by a series of gravity measurements in advance and before each experiment run we performed a zero reset step without load exerted on the devices the experiment was tested at current velocities v from 40 to 80 cm s in an increment of 10 cm s the upper tip of the l type frame with the plane netting was set at the water depth of 40 cm where the root mean square deviation of the measured current was on the order of 1 3 cm s 1 6 3 2 relative to the tested currents the free surface effect on the flow field around the net structure was thus ignored the temperature of the water was about 12 c during the experiments data acquisition was depicted by the following 1 the load cell with a full capacity of 5 kg recorded the acting force in the form of voltage signals 2 an excitation voltage of 5 v was used for all the strain gauge bridges 3 noise in the data was filtered out 4 a 12 bit a d converter changed analog signals to digital signals real time and viewable on the monitor 5 actual force was figured by calibration coefficient the time series data in terms of flow velocity and hydrodynamic forces were collected at a sampling frequency of 20 hz for a period of 20 s and the arithmetic mean of the data was adopted the netting drag d was obtained by deducting the force on the frame and the drag coefficient was calculated as follows 2 c d 2 d ρ a α v 2 here ρ is the water density and a is the area of the square type frame each experiment was repeated three times in the current range from 40 to 80 cm s displacements elastic deformation of those plane nettings along the current direction were slight during the experiments the inclination angle of the single mesh of the plane netting exposed to the current was assumed as the same as the set angle of attack 2 2 computational fluid dynamic approach for rigid plane netting model the porous media model describing the plane netting for the net cage in the cfd approach is often used to grasp the velocity deficit behind the permeable net structure patursson et al 2010 zhao et al 2013 bi et al 2014 chen et al 2016 but it seems impossible to measure the velocity between the upstream and downstream twines inside the mesh as an alternative approach the rigid model the netting was in a taut configuration during the flume tank experiment for the plane netting is herein used to evaluate its resistance and corresponding flow pattern the material stiffness surface roughness and strand arrangement of the fiber netting were simplified as the cylindrical cruciform mesh structure with a smooth surface in the cfd approach fig 3 a 2 2 1 governing equations the time averaged mean properties on the resistance of the plane netting and corresponding mean flow behavior were proposed to be investigated so the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations was adopted consisting of a mass conservation equation eq 3 and a momentum conservation equation eq 4 as 3 u i x i 0 4 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j x j ρ u i u j ρ g i s i where u i u i i j 1 2 3 are average velocity and fluctuation velocity in the cartesian coordinates x 1 x 2 x 3 respectively t is time p is the pressure μ and ρ are the viscosity coefficient and the density of the fluid respectively g i is the acceleration due to the gravity s i is the source term of the momentum equation the right hand third term of eq 4 represents the reynolds stress 2 2 2 turbulence model two equation models represent the simplest class of complete models of turbulence as they provide transport equations for both turbulent velocity scale and turbulent length scale which effectively defines the turbulent convective transport the choice of the turbulent velocity scale usually falls on turbulent kinetic energy k for the turbulent length scale wilcox 1993 noted that it was equivalent to the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy the two most usual choices are dissipation rate ε and dissipation per unit turbulence kinetic energy ω branching as the k ε model and k ω model turbulent effects are incorporated in the rans eqs 3 and 4 by solving two additional transport equations to yield a value for turbulent kinematic viscosity the shear stress transport k ω model is a hybrid model based on the standard k ε model and k ω model the k ω model is used in the inner region near the wall and the k ε model is used for the free shear flow therefore the sst k ω model switches to a k ε behavior in the free stream and thereby avoids the common problem of the k ω model being too sensitive to the inlet stream turbulence properties menter 1994 the automatic near wall treatment for the sst k ω model was adopted in fluent which generally requires the value of y in the near wall region is less than 1 it has shown good results in literatures to simulate the flow flied distribution for example menter et al 2003 highlighted the advantages of the sst k ω model about strong adverse pressure gradients and separation from the object based on ten year industrial experience rahman et al 2007 mentioned that the sst k ω model was much more recommendable for reynolds number 1000 and 3900 in a uniform free stream flow passing a two dimensional cylinder the resistance coefficient of the three dimensional cylinder estimated by the sst k ω model was similar to those from the experimental work bi et al 2017 the sst k ω model was thus selected and applied in the present simulations the incompressible sst k ω model for a single fluid is formulated menter et al 2003 devolder et al 2017 xu et al 2019 as 5 t ρ k x i ρ k u i p k β ρ k ω x j μ σ k μ t k i x i 6 t ρ ω x i ρ ω u i α ω ρ s 2

with solidity ratios of 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 23 and 0 32 were used table 2 the bar length l was both 28 mm the twine diameters d were 0 7 3 0 mm and the half mesh angles ϕ were 20 45 because the plane netting is symmetrical in shape it is possible to use a half model for calculations in the pre test both the half model and the full model for the plane netting were calculated results indicated a slight difference in both methods hereafter the half model with the diamond numbers of 5 and 2 in transverse and normal directions respectively was used in the following calculation fig 3a to avoid the blockage effect and disturbance of the outer boundaries the computational domains are sufficiently extended as fig 3b shows the inlet region is far from the leading edge at 100 mm 33d and the outlet in the downstream direction is the location at a distance of 600 mm 200d from the leading edge the y direction and z direction boundaries are extended by a width of 150 mm 50d and a height of 200 mm 66d respectively the governing equations were discretized using a finite volume approach and solved using the segregated iterative solver employing an algebraic multigrid method with under relaxation the simple method was employed for the pressure velocity coupling e g patanker and spalding 1972 kawamura et al 1995 the spatial discretization for pressure momentum turbulent kinetic energy and specific dissipation rate were carried out using a second order upwind scheme the fluid was modeled as freshwater with a density of 998 2 kg m3 and viscosity of 0 001003 kg ms 1 the incoming flow at the inlet boundary was set at a uniform flow of 60 cm s the pressure outlet condition was downstream of the domain the surface close to the model was set to be symmetrical the model s walls were assumed to be smooth and no slip conditions smooth walls with free slip conditions were considered for the outer domain walls the simulations were defined as having reached a converged solution when all residuals were reduced to less than 10 5 the drag coefficient of the overall plane netting varying the angle of attack was calculated the drag characteristics of the mesh termed as no 1 no 5 mesh along the current direction respectively on the array close to the symmetry side were further estimated from cfd analysis fig 4 the flow field around the trawl plane netting and the streamline profile around the no 3 mesh were visualized using the cfd post tool 2 2 4 computational grids the three dimensional numerical model was subdivided into grids and the computational grid around the model was generated using icem cfd fig 3c the grid was an unstructured tetrahedron that was clustered around the models from the inner domain to the outer domain the global grid size of the outer domain was set as 20 mm to achieve the optimal grid size surrounding the netting a grid dependency study on the grid size of the inner domain and the initial layer height of the 15 layer prism was conducted in the pre test the rigid plane netting model with the solidity ratio of 0 2 parallel to the current was used as table 3 shows the results reveal that the inner domain of 2 mm range 2 8 mm and the initial layer height of 0 02 mm range 0 02 0 08 mm at a given height ratio of 1 2 are sufficient for an accurate prediction of the resistance of the plane netting in the following simulations the maximum number of elements was approximately 2 7 106 with the node elements totaling approximately 5 5 105 for the netting with a solidity ratio of 0 05 notably y of the near wall region for six investigated plane nettings was around 0 5 3 results 3 1 resistance characteristics of trawl plane netting at small angles of attack relationships between drag coefficients and reynolds number of plane nettings with solidity ratios of 0 106 and 0 204 in uniform currents are presented in fig 5 respectively the oscillation of the time averaged drag coefficient of the plane netting with the low solidity ratio of 0 106 varying the currents is approximately 0 03 at every angle of attack the decreasing tendency of the drag coefficient vs reynolds number is not remarkable the 0 03 magnitude fluctuation of drag coefficient for the low solidity ratio plane netting converted to the corresponding drag force was 6 4 25 9 g in the tested currents moreover the perturbation proportion is about 10 of the parallel drag coefficient and decreases to 3 c d at the angle of attack of 25 therefore the drag perturbation of the plane netting with a low solidity ratio is possibly generated from the experiment limitation of the l type frame but which is better than the cylindrical frame e g cf zhou et al 2015 it infers that the resistance performance of plane netting at small angles of attack stayed steady during the flume tank experiment the average values were thereby used in the subsequent analyses for every angle of attack hereafter the drag coefficients of the plane netting as a function of the solidity ratio obtained from a the flume tank experiment and b the cfd analysis at every small angle of attack are shown in fig 6 experimental results display that the parallel drag coefficient decreases from 0 4 to 0 25 with a reduction of 38 but the drag coefficient at the angle of attack of 25 rises from 0 62 to 0 79 with an increment of 27 as the solidity ratio increases from 0 05 to 0 32 fig 6a the dual effect of the solidity ratio on the drag coefficient of plane netting with respect to the inclination angle is confirmed the critical angle of attack for transferring from the inverse to the direct relationships between the drag coefficient and the solidity ratio seems to be in the range of 15 20 the discrepancy in the increasing gradient of drag coefficient vs inclination angle for two representative plane nettings with solidity ratios of 0 05 and 0 32 means that the interacting flows surrounding both nettings behave differently additionally the drag coefficient formula for polyamide multifilament plane netting was derived based on tauti s theoretical formula matuda 2001 and tang et al s formula 2019 to precisely estimate the resistance performance at small angles of attack using nonlinear regression with data argument predicted from the formula of plane netting with small angle of attack solidity ratio and reynold number the following expression can be proposed 12 c d 0 175 α 0 316 r e d 0 0091 1 α sin θ 5 43 0 θ 25 the residual standard error of the nonlinear regression model is 0 05 and all parameters were tested to prove the reliability of the nonlinear model by parameter validation test p 0 05 the dual effect is reflected in the empirical formula as fig 7 shows the conclusions obtained from the cfd results are consistent with those in flume tank experiments as fig 6b shows the relative error of drag coefficient between cfd analysis and experiments is mostly less than 10 covering the angle of attack and only a few values exceed marginally 10 using the simplified rigid model roughness factor elastic deformation as well as angular distortion of half mesh angle for the rigid net structure exposed to the current were not considered in the cfd approach accounting for the discrepancy of drag coefficient notably the changing tendency of drag coefficient as the function of the solidity ratio and angle of attack in cfd analysis was consistent with the experimental result comprehensively the calculation error of the cfd approach is within an acceptable range in all simulations acting as an effective tool for predicting the drag performance of plane netting drag coefficients of five meshes on the array close to the symmetry side fig 4 at the angles of attack of 0 25 were calculated in cfd analysis for six plane nettings with solidity ratios of 0 05 0 32 as fig 8 shows compared with the no 1 mesh the leading one the parallel drag coefficients of the no 2 no 5 meshes decrease sharply and the decrement becomes large as the solidity ratio increases as the plane netting turns inclined in the free stream the reduction ratio of the drag coefficient of the no 2 no 5 meshes relative to no 1 mesh for each netting becomes small with an increment of the angle of attack the ratio for the nettings with solidity ratios of 0 05 0 2 approaches zero after the angle of 15 notably an increasing tendency of drag characteristics from the no 1 mesh to the no 5 mesh for the nettings with solidity ratio of 0 23 0 32 is observed since the angle exceeds 20 it is worth noting that the drag coefficient for the posterior meshes no 2 no 5 exhibits a constant value regardless of the solidity ratio and angle of attack 3 2 relationship between resistance performance and flow behavior of trawl plane netting at small angles of attack velocity contour x z plane through the centerline knot to knot on the array close to the symmetry of plane netting is illustrated in fig 9 the netting with a solidity ratio of 0 32 concerning the angle of attack is taken as an example to visualize the fluid flow around the whole net structure the current v 0 6 m s shown as the yellow color flows from left to right the red color in the colormap is the maximum local velocity 0 8 m s and the blue color is the minimum 0 m s fig 9 shows that the fluid flows above or through the plane netting as the angle of attack changes local velocities extracted along the centerline of four plane nettings at solidity ratios of 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 32 are shown in fig 10 combined with the results as described above in section 3 1 the changing trend about the drag coefficient of single mesh one of the no 2 no 5 meshes as a function of solidity ratio exhibits similarly as the resistance performance of the whole plane netting figs 6 and 8 it is plausible to suggest that the flow pattern around one mesh could elucidate the resistance behavior of the plane netting the center of mesh velocity of the no 3 mesh relative to the inlet velocity is illustrated in fig 11 streamline profiles around the no 3 mesh fig 4 are thus demonstrated in fig 12 the analysis in detail is proceeding as follows in parallel the flow in the middle of the no 1 mesh after the upstream knot recovers 24 81 of the current inlet velocity as the solidity ratio decreases since then the flow recovery behavior surrounding the following knots acts in the same mode except for the final downstream knot of the no 5 mesh figs 10 and 11 a high pressure region generated by the low speed flow between two adjacent knots forces the fluid flowing above the upper lower surfaces of the mesh in parallel like the streamlines shown in fig 12 the shadow effect that emerged by the upstream downstream twines is proved through the visualization results the reduced flow velocity is unable to restore to the inlet velocity mainly due to the loss of turbulence intensity for the plane netting with a solidity ratio of 0 05 in the inclined case the fluid ahead of the downstream knot is out of the wake boundary generated by the upstream knot and tends to flow through the mesh after the angle of 10 the downstream mesh is exerted by the undisturbed flow equal to the inlet velocity and the hydrodynamic force loaded on every mesh for the netting with a low solidity ratio is independent a similar tendency for the netting with a solidity ratio of 0 1 is also seen when the inclination angle is greater or equal to 15 figs 8 10 and 11 nevertheless for the plane nettings with solidity ratios of 0 2 and 0 32 the downstream knot is partly in the upstream knot wake and the local velocity remains influenced before the angle of 15 the fluid between the mesh is still occupied by the wake consequently the local flow velocity is thus lower than the inlet velocity and the fluid keeps moving above the large solidity ratio netting figs 10 12 as the angle is greater or equal to 20 the fluid in front of the downstream mesh for the netting with the solidity ratio of 0 32 is accelerated and starts flowing through the mesh the increment of local flow velocity relative to the inlet velocity is up to 8 at the angle of attack of 25 figs 10 12 in term of it the transition range for different flow patterns seems within 15 20 for the trawl netting consequently the solidity ratio influencing the drag coefficient of the plane netting performs as the same relationship between the local flow velocity and the solidity ratio exhibiting the dual effect across the angle of attack the velocity v vertical to the current direction and the velocity w in the normal direction along with the no 3 mesh for the trawl plane netting with the solidity ratio of 0 32 is shown in fig 13 both velocities are on the order of 2 cm s before the angle of attack of 10 the maximum velocity w approaches 10 cm s emerged by the netting in the taut configuration which is more than two times of velocity v at the angle of attack of 25 even if the magnitude of velocity w is only 10 cm s at most and remarkably smaller than the current v 60 cm s it is adequate to alter the streamlines through the mesh as the downwash direction after the angle of 20 fig 12 it implies the turbulent flow is characterized by the dominance of the normal velocity w when the trawl net is towed 4 discussion hydrodynamic experiments for trawl plane nettings have been conducted by an effective l type frame to refine the understanding of its resistance performance at small angles of attack the l type frame is with a low resistance d 0 026v 1 96 shown in fig 14 which is the basic demand of netting hydrodynamic experiment at a small angle of attack the drag caused by the frame without netting occupied less than 20 of the total resistance and the frame stability was also confirmed under different inclination angle conditions during the experiments although the drag coefficient uncertainty was 3 10 herein the l type frame overall satisfies the experiment requirement and ensures the measurement accuracy of the drag coefficient for plane netting drag coefficients of smooth cylinder and sphere are dominated by the flow regime that is characterized by viscous laminar in the state of low reynolds number based on the diameter re 200 and transition to turbulence at high reynolds number re 400 referred to hoerner 1965 which arguably is one of the main empirical works on fluid dynamic drag for the plane netting the critical reynolds number re d for the transition of normal drag coefficient approached the empirical value of 200 imai and nakamura 1989 or 700 yamamoto et al 1996 through flume tank experiments respectively wang et al 1988 reported that there was a slight variation on the parallel drag coefficient of fishing plane netting in relation to the re d range of 200 1000 referred to present results the sight experiment limitation could not significantly change the resistance performance of plane netting re d more than 400 for the investigated nettings is likely to explain why a decreasing trend of drag coefficient and reynolds number did not occur in which the turbulent flow surrounding the plane netting has been developed early experimental studies revealed that when the aspect ratio the transverse length normal length of a netting was more than 4 few differences of drag coefficient occurred in parallel imai 1986 kumazawa et al 2012 in the present results the resistance of the no 2 no 5 mesh close to the symmetry side remains similar but is lower than that of no 1 mesh assuming the mesh number of fishing netting satisfies the aspect ratio of more than 4 the drag coefficient of the single mesh of course it acts as one mesh of the netting not the isolative mesh geometry is reliable to express the resistance performance of the whole netting thus drag force loading on the overall net is credible to be simplified as the sum of a basic mesh geometry or the four cruciform assembly klebert et al 2013 lader et al 2014 bi et al 2017 as the aspect ratio of the netting for every trawl component is more than 4 before the angle of attack of 20 the netting drag coefficient is mainly influenced by the flow pattern moving above the netting the shadow effect the maximum local flow velocity ahead of the downstream twine is lower than the inlet velocity the magnitude of which depends on the limited mesh distance for instance the knot to knot distances for the plane netting with the solidity ratio of 0 05 and 0 32 are about 56 and 6 times the twine diameter respectively the former distance contributes to recovering the local velocity up to approximately 81 of the current whereas the rear one is only 24 in parallel case fig 11 the downstream twine remains located in the upstream twine wake when the inclination angle is small it leads to that the shadow effect still works and less resistance is exerted on the plane netting with a large solidity ratio it could be thus concluded that less reduction of local velocity is associated with a longer knot to knot distance geometrized by a smaller solidity ratio the noticeable difference between real center of mesh flow velocity ahead of the twine and the reference velocity is believed to explain the inverse effect of solidity ratio on the estimated resistance coefficient at a low inclination angle since the angle of attack exceeds 20 the flow starts to be accelerated by the net structure and passes through the mesh when the solidity ratio turns larger the opening mouth area of the mesh gets smaller the speed of the accelerated flow increases and eventually leads to a larger resistance exerted on the plane netting relative to the inlet velocity thus such flow pattern emerged by the netting is plausible to account for the direct relationship between the solidity ratio and the drag coefficient for the plane netting for α 20 this assumption was supported by the increment of the normal drag coefficient of plane nettings with an increasing solidity ratio kebert et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 dong et al 2016 computations of drag coefficient for plane netting are commonly obtained by using eq 2 using the current v as a reference water velocity assumed that water flow each mesh is equal to the corresponding velocity though it is well admitted that the flow speed in through the mesh may change as the angle of attack turns inclination angle these small velocity differences are believed to lead to some modifications in local drag force estimations based on present results the maximum local flow velocity ahead of the knot which is noticeably lower or higher than the current does have a significant impact on the estimated drag characteristics of the plane netting prediction tools for the resistance acting on a full size fishing net is applicable to the work to optimize the design of the net gear structure modify the energy efficiency as well as reduce environmental damage achieved by the low cost numerical simulation a high accuracy estimation method would be indeed attractive for engineers fishermen and communities in the fishery and aquaculture fields considering the common screen model and morison model for the simulation work of net structure modification design reliable references were provided in the present study the screen model determination of the drag force acting on a trawl net is associated with each panel of the trawl and approaches the sum of drag force acting on the nettings the empirical drag coefficient formula eq 12 of the plane netting integrated with the dual effect of solidity ratio is more suitable for the screen model simulation on the other hand the morison model simulation of net gear is conducted by considering the cylinder twine and sphere knot as the basic elements using a given set current towing speed the hydrodynamic prediction of nets would be more accurate using the local velocity as a function of solidity ratio and small angle of attack fig 11 reflecting the shadow effect of twines in the morison model simulations of the full scale pelagic and bottom trawl nets as well as sea water aquaculture net cage would be promoted with these results in further research investigations of hydrodynamic performances of high solidity ratio plane nettings with finer mesh structure mesh size 50 1000 μm are also in progress to establish a comprehensive hydrodynamic model of plane netting in a wider range of solidity ratio 5 conclusion resistance performances of trawl plane netting with solidity ratio of 0 05 0 32 at small angles of attack from 0 to 25 was investigated in the flume tank experiment and cfd analysis under the premise of feasibility with the following conclusions 1 the dual effect of the solidity ratio on the drag coefficient varying small angles of attack was confirmed through the hydrodynamic experiment and visualization results 2 a slight difference in drag coefficient of the single mesh and the plane netting infers that a basic mesh geometry or the four cruciform assembly is reliable to express the resistance performance of a whole netting 3 the empirical drag coefficient formula of the plane netting integrated with the dual effect of solidity ratio contributes to an accurate prediction of screen model simulation of net structures 4 the local velocity as a function of solidity ratio and small angle of attack reflecting the twine to twine shadow effect is suggested to be adopted in the morison model simulation of net gear rather than the set velocity credit authorship contribution statement xinxing you conceptualization data curation and

20398,hydrodynamic experiments in a flume tank in the current range of 40 80 cm s and computational fluid dynamic cfd analysis at the current of 60 cm s of trawl plane nettings with solidity ratios of 0 06 0 32 at small angles of attack 0 25 were conducted to refine the understanding of the relationship between resistance performance and flow behavior the rigid model representing the plane netting in a taut configuration was adopted a finite volume method was used for solving reynolds averaged navier stokes equations associated with the shear stress transport k ω model in cfd analysis referred to experimental results the parallel drag coefficient decreases from 0 4 to 0 25 with a reduction of 38 but the drag coefficient at the angle of attack of 25 rises from 0 62 to 0 79 with an increment of 27 as the solidity ratio increases from 0 06 to 0 32 such dual effect of the solidity ratio on the drag coefficient of plane nettings with respect to the inclination angle is also observed from cfd analysis a transition of flow behavior from flowing above to passing through the netting occurs the changing tendency of the local flow velocity is consistent with the resistance performance relative to the solidity ratio for the tested nettings keywords trawl plane netting resistance performance small angle of attack rigid model flow visualization 1 introduction the hydrodynamic analysis of fishing net structures especially the trawl has been of great interest to scientists for a long time such investigation has an impact not only on commercial fishing operations including the fishing vessel energy efficiency but also on the biological and socio economic environment bouhoubeiny et al 2011 mchugh et al 2017 mcconnaughey et al 2019 it is now well known that most of the fuel consumed during a fishing trip is used to tow the fishing gear of which the trawl net is responsible for the largest part for bottom and pelagic trawls the high energy intensity expressed as resistance performance of the trawl net accounts for over 60 of fuel consumption during fishing operations with otter boards vincent and roullt 2006 you et al 2020a the net proportion increases up to 90 of the overall for beam trawls or sampling gears towed by the warp only gjøsund and enerhaug 2010 suuronen et al 2012 resistance performance of the trawl net also determines fishing efficiency through the inverse relationship between drag and the net spread when the gear is towed furthermore the fluid flow behavior surrounding the trawl net influences the species selectivity of the fishing gear bouhoubeiny et al 2011 druault et al 2015 for a trawl net made of wing side square belly and cod end nettings the movement of trawl gear shown through an angle of inclination between netting and flow defined as the angle of attack θ is generally less than 15 during relatively stable towing matsuda 2001 the angle of attack steadily decreases along with the net and ends at the cod end parallel to the flow the inclination angle less than or equal to 25 was defined as the small angle of attack in the present study cf imai et al 1994 and tang et al 2019 the solidity ratio α defined as the ratio of the projected area to the total area enclosed by the outline area is commonly used to characterize the geometrical characteristics of netting customarily the solidity ratio for nettings of a whole trawl net increasing from the wing to the cod end is within the range of 0 05 0 3 patente et al 2008 kodota 2015 numerous efforts on addressing the abovementioned three issues have been conducted since the beginning of the 21st century most modification work has been confirmed through reduced model experiments or at sea trials although both methods are time intensive and costly balash et al 2014 mchugh et al 2017 the computer simulation acts as an alternative tool that can predict the behavior of the trawl net with few costs but its accuracy is low compared with the results of in situ measurement nguyen et al 2015 prada and pirour 2015 it is perhaps due to the lack of understanding of fluid structure interaction in trawl nettings relevant studies on the resistance performance vs inclination angle of different types of plane netting for aquaculture net cage reveal that the effect of solidity ratio on the resistance characteristics of the plane netting has been highlighted kebert et al 2013 riziotis et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 dong et al 2016 its tendency showed that when the angle of attack was close to the parallel state drag coefficient increased as solidity ratio shrunk for angles approaching normal to the current drag coefficient rose with the increasing solidity ratio they proposed that a shadow effect might occur as the fluid moved through upstream twine to downstream twine and caused a reduction of stream velocity and exerted fluid force the shadow effect was considered to take place in the case of a low angle of attack and reached a maximum when the plane netting was parallel to the current it implies that the interacting fluid around the trawl net towed at small angles of attack would induce different flow behaviors surrounding the trawl gear however the progress in fundamental studies of hydrodynamic characteristics of the trawl netting at small angles of attack is slow few references reported the resistance performance and the fluid net interaction issue of the trawl plane netting varying solidity ratios at small angles of attack in detail because of limitations on the experimental setup including the frame and installation methods tang et al 2019 we propose to investigate the resistance performance and flow pattern for the trawl plane netting at small angles of attack even if such a simple structure does not correspond to any practical trawl net however such a preliminary study will be permitted to elucidate the resistance behavior of the plane netting which is not fully understood in this study a novel self design framework was used to measure the resistance of the plane netting with solidity ratios 0 06 0 32 at small angles of attack 0 25 in flume tank experiments computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis as a simulation tool often used in fishery engineering chen et al 2016 bi et al 2017 you et al 2020b was adopted the rigid model expressing the plane netting in a taut configuration was calculated for a comparative study with experimental values at small angles of attack 0 25 the resistance characteristics of each mesh on one array were then extracted and the flow field around the plane netting was visualized and analyzed with the aid of the cfd approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 flume tank experiment to investigate resistance performance of trawl plane netting at small angles of attack eleven kinds of three stranded polyamide multifilament plane netting colloquially called nylon netting presented in table 1 were used in hydrodynamic experiments to evaluate the drag coefficient in the range of the reynolds number re d vd ν from 400 to 2000 here v is flow velocity d is twine diameter and ν is the kinematic viscosity mesh size and twine diameter were mean values measured in wet conditions by taking a sample of 5 mesh sizes with a ruler and 10 twine diameters with a digital caliper nichimo co ltd japan 0 01 mm resolution the solidity ratio as above defined is calculated as follows 1 α d 2 l d l 2 s i n 2 ϕ where l is the bar length and ϕ is the half mesh angle maintained at 45 30 20 in tests fig 1 hydrodynamic force measurements were conducted in a circulating flume tank at tokyo university of marine science and technology observation section length 9 0 m width 2 2 m and water depth 1 6 m a new setup framework l type frame was used to measure the drag force loading on the netting at angles of attack from 0 to 25 as the interval of 5 fig 2 the framework was assembled with six streamlined struts made of 5 mm aluminum which were designed to reduce the wake disturbance formed by the upwind side of the framework the dry weight of the framework was 213 g some thin wires with a 1 mm diameter were used to assemble experimental plane netting on the frame 50 cm 50 cm and compose the l type frame structure in the parallel state two sliders with a 5 cm length were fixed on the two fore struts to make the angle of attack equal to 0 fig 2a five attachment holes in the fore and rear struts respectively were provided to adjust the inclination between plane netting and the flow at the interval of 5 fig 2b a steel rod 36 cm in length and 16 mm in diameter was fixed to the center top of the frame to enable connection to a six component balance electronic industrial co ltd maximum load 5 kg and the flow velocity was measured using a propeller type current meter kenek co ltd model vot2 200 20 measurement range 3 cm s 200 cm s resolution 0 7 cm s 100 cm ahead of the netting load cells were calibrated by a series of gravity measurements in advance and before each experiment run we performed a zero reset step without load exerted on the devices the experiment was tested at current velocities v from 40 to 80 cm s in an increment of 10 cm s the upper tip of the l type frame with the plane netting was set at the water depth of 40 cm where the root mean square deviation of the measured current was on the order of 1 3 cm s 1 6 3 2 relative to the tested currents the free surface effect on the flow field around the net structure was thus ignored the temperature of the water was about 12 c during the experiments data acquisition was depicted by the following 1 the load cell with a full capacity of 5 kg recorded the acting force in the form of voltage signals 2 an excitation voltage of 5 v was used for all the strain gauge bridges 3 noise in the data was filtered out 4 a 12 bit a d converter changed analog signals to digital signals real time and viewable on the monitor 5 actual force was figured by calibration coefficient the time series data in terms of flow velocity and hydrodynamic forces were collected at a sampling frequency of 20 hz for a period of 20 s and the arithmetic mean of the data was adopted the netting drag d was obtained by deducting the force on the frame and the drag coefficient was calculated as follows 2 c d 2 d ρ a α v 2 here ρ is the water density and a is the area of the square type frame each experiment was repeated three times in the current range from 40 to 80 cm s displacements elastic deformation of those plane nettings along the current direction were slight during the experiments the inclination angle of the single mesh of the plane netting exposed to the current was assumed as the same as the set angle of attack 2 2 computational fluid dynamic approach for rigid plane netting model the porous media model describing the plane netting for the net cage in the cfd approach is often used to grasp the velocity deficit behind the permeable net structure patursson et al 2010 zhao et al 2013 bi et al 2014 chen et al 2016 but it seems impossible to measure the velocity between the upstream and downstream twines inside the mesh as an alternative approach the rigid model the netting was in a taut configuration during the flume tank experiment for the plane netting is herein used to evaluate its resistance and corresponding flow pattern the material stiffness surface roughness and strand arrangement of the fiber netting were simplified as the cylindrical cruciform mesh structure with a smooth surface in the cfd approach fig 3 a 2 2 1 governing equations the time averaged mean properties on the resistance of the plane netting and corresponding mean flow behavior were proposed to be investigated so the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations was adopted consisting of a mass conservation equation eq 3 and a momentum conservation equation eq 4 as 3 u i x i 0 4 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j x j ρ u i u j ρ g i s i where u i u i i j 1 2 3 are average velocity and fluctuation velocity in the cartesian coordinates x 1 x 2 x 3 respectively t is time p is the pressure μ and ρ are the viscosity coefficient and the density of the fluid respectively g i is the acceleration due to the gravity s i is the source term of the momentum equation the right hand third term of eq 4 represents the reynolds stress 2 2 2 turbulence model two equation models represent the simplest class of complete models of turbulence as they provide transport equations for both turbulent velocity scale and turbulent length scale which effectively defines the turbulent convective transport the choice of the turbulent velocity scale usually falls on turbulent kinetic energy k for the turbulent length scale wilcox 1993 noted that it was equivalent to the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy the two most usual choices are dissipation rate ε and dissipation per unit turbulence kinetic energy ω branching as the k ε model and k ω model turbulent effects are incorporated in the rans eqs 3 and 4 by solving two additional transport equations to yield a value for turbulent kinematic viscosity the shear stress transport k ω model is a hybrid model based on the standard k ε model and k ω model the k ω model is used in the inner region near the wall and the k ε model is used for the free shear flow therefore the sst k ω model switches to a k ε behavior in the free stream and thereby avoids the common problem of the k ω model being too sensitive to the inlet stream turbulence properties menter 1994 the automatic near wall treatment for the sst k ω model was adopted in fluent which generally requires the value of y in the near wall region is less than 1 it has shown good results in literatures to simulate the flow flied distribution for example menter et al 2003 highlighted the advantages of the sst k ω model about strong adverse pressure gradients and separation from the object based on ten year industrial experience rahman et al 2007 mentioned that the sst k ω model was much more recommendable for reynolds number 1000 and 3900 in a uniform free stream flow passing a two dimensional cylinder the resistance coefficient of the three dimensional cylinder estimated by the sst k ω model was similar to those from the experimental work bi et al 2017 the sst k ω model was thus selected and applied in the present simulations the incompressible sst k ω model for a single fluid is formulated menter et al 2003 devolder et al 2017 xu et al 2019 as 5 t ρ k x i ρ k u i p k β ρ k ω x j μ σ k μ t k i x i 6 t ρ ω x i ρ ω u i α ω ρ s 2

with solidity ratios of 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 23 and 0 32 were used table 2 the bar length l was both 28 mm the twine diameters d were 0 7 3 0 mm and the half mesh angles ϕ were 20 45 because the plane netting is symmetrical in shape it is possible to use a half model for calculations in the pre test both the half model and the full model for the plane netting were calculated results indicated a slight difference in both methods hereafter the half model with the diamond numbers of 5 and 2 in transverse and normal directions respectively was used in the following calculation fig 3a to avoid the blockage effect and disturbance of the outer boundaries the computational domains are sufficiently extended as fig 3b shows the inlet region is far from the leading edge at 100 mm 33d and the outlet in the downstream direction is the location at a distance of 600 mm 200d from the leading edge the y direction and z direction boundaries are extended by a width of 150 mm 50d and a height of 200 mm 66d respectively the governing equations were discretized using a finite volume approach and solved using the segregated iterative solver employing an algebraic multigrid method with under relaxation the simple method was employed for the pressure velocity coupling e g patanker and spalding 1972 kawamura et al 1995 the spatial discretization for pressure momentum turbulent kinetic energy and specific dissipation rate were carried out using a second order upwind scheme the fluid was modeled as freshwater with a density of 998 2 kg m3 and viscosity of 0 001003 kg ms 1 the incoming flow at the inlet boundary was set at a uniform flow of 60 cm s the pressure outlet condition was downstream of the domain the surface close to the model was set to be symmetrical the model s walls were assumed to be smooth and no slip conditions smooth walls with free slip conditions were considered for the outer domain walls the simulations were defined as having reached a converged solution when all residuals were reduced to less than 10 5 the drag coefficient of the overall plane netting varying the angle of attack was calculated the drag characteristics of the mesh termed as no 1 no 5 mesh along the current direction respectively on the array close to the symmetry side were further estimated from cfd analysis fig 4 the flow field around the trawl plane netting and the streamline profile around the no 3 mesh were visualized using the cfd post tool 2 2 4 computational grids the three dimensional numerical model was subdivided into grids and the computational grid around the model was generated using icem cfd fig 3c the grid was an unstructured tetrahedron that was clustered around the models from the inner domain to the outer domain the global grid size of the outer domain was set as 20 mm to achieve the optimal grid size surrounding the netting a grid dependency study on the grid size of the inner domain and the initial layer height of the 15 layer prism was conducted in the pre test the rigid plane netting model with the solidity ratio of 0 2 parallel to the current was used as table 3 shows the results reveal that the inner domain of 2 mm range 2 8 mm and the initial layer height of 0 02 mm range 0 02 0 08 mm at a given height ratio of 1 2 are sufficient for an accurate prediction of the resistance of the plane netting in the following simulations the maximum number of elements was approximately 2 7 106 with the node elements totaling approximately 5 5 105 for the netting with a solidity ratio of 0 05 notably y of the near wall region for six investigated plane nettings was around 0 5 3 results 3 1 resistance characteristics of trawl plane netting at small angles of attack relationships between drag coefficients and reynolds number of plane nettings with solidity ratios of 0 106 and 0 204 in uniform currents are presented in fig 5 respectively the oscillation of the time averaged drag coefficient of the plane netting with the low solidity ratio of 0 106 varying the currents is approximately 0 03 at every angle of attack the decreasing tendency of the drag coefficient vs reynolds number is not remarkable the 0 03 magnitude fluctuation of drag coefficient for the low solidity ratio plane netting converted to the corresponding drag force was 6 4 25 9 g in the tested currents moreover the perturbation proportion is about 10 of the parallel drag coefficient and decreases to 3 c d at the angle of attack of 25 therefore the drag perturbation of the plane netting with a low solidity ratio is possibly generated from the experiment limitation of the l type frame but which is better than the cylindrical frame e g cf zhou et al 2015 it infers that the resistance performance of plane netting at small angles of attack stayed steady during the flume tank experiment the average values were thereby used in the subsequent analyses for every angle of attack hereafter the drag coefficients of the plane netting as a function of the solidity ratio obtained from a the flume tank experiment and b the cfd analysis at every small angle of attack are shown in fig 6 experimental results display that the parallel drag coefficient decreases from 0 4 to 0 25 with a reduction of 38 but the drag coefficient at the angle of attack of 25 rises from 0 62 to 0 79 with an increment of 27 as the solidity ratio increases from 0 05 to 0 32 fig 6a the dual effect of the solidity ratio on the drag coefficient of plane netting with respect to the inclination angle is confirmed the critical angle of attack for transferring from the inverse to the direct relationships between the drag coefficient and the solidity ratio seems to be in the range of 15 20 the discrepancy in the increasing gradient of drag coefficient vs inclination angle for two representative plane nettings with solidity ratios of 0 05 and 0 32 means that the interacting flows surrounding both nettings behave differently additionally the drag coefficient formula for polyamide multifilament plane netting was derived based on tauti s theoretical formula matuda 2001 and tang et al s formula 2019 to precisely estimate the resistance performance at small angles of attack using nonlinear regression with data argument predicted from the formula of plane netting with small angle of attack solidity ratio and reynold number the following expression can be proposed 12 c d 0 175 α 0 316 r e d 0 0091 1 α sin θ 5 43 0 θ 25 the residual standard error of the nonlinear regression model is 0 05 and all parameters were tested to prove the reliability of the nonlinear model by parameter validation test p 0 05 the dual effect is reflected in the empirical formula as fig 7 shows the conclusions obtained from the cfd results are consistent with those in flume tank experiments as fig 6b shows the relative error of drag coefficient between cfd analysis and experiments is mostly less than 10 covering the angle of attack and only a few values exceed marginally 10 using the simplified rigid model roughness factor elastic deformation as well as angular distortion of half mesh angle for the rigid net structure exposed to the current were not considered in the cfd approach accounting for the discrepancy of drag coefficient notably the changing tendency of drag coefficient as the function of the solidity ratio and angle of attack in cfd analysis was consistent with the experimental result comprehensively the calculation error of the cfd approach is within an acceptable range in all simulations acting as an effective tool for predicting the drag performance of plane netting drag coefficients of five meshes on the array close to the symmetry side fig 4 at the angles of attack of 0 25 were calculated in cfd analysis for six plane nettings with solidity ratios of 0 05 0 32 as fig 8 shows compared with the no 1 mesh the leading one the parallel drag coefficients of the no 2 no 5 meshes decrease sharply and the decrement becomes large as the solidity ratio increases as the plane netting turns inclined in the free stream the reduction ratio of the drag coefficient of the no 2 no 5 meshes relative to no 1 mesh for each netting becomes small with an increment of the angle of attack the ratio for the nettings with solidity ratios of 0 05 0 2 approaches zero after the angle of 15 notably an increasing tendency of drag characteristics from the no 1 mesh to the no 5 mesh for the nettings with solidity ratio of 0 23 0 32 is observed since the angle exceeds 20 it is worth noting that the drag coefficient for the posterior meshes no 2 no 5 exhibits a constant value regardless of the solidity ratio and angle of attack 3 2 relationship between resistance performance and flow behavior of trawl plane netting at small angles of attack velocity contour x z plane through the centerline knot to knot on the array close to the symmetry of plane netting is illustrated in fig 9 the netting with a solidity ratio of 0 32 concerning the angle of attack is taken as an example to visualize the fluid flow around the whole net structure the current v 0 6 m s shown as the yellow color flows from left to right the red color in the colormap is the maximum local velocity 0 8 m s and the blue color is the minimum 0 m s fig 9 shows that the fluid flows above or through the plane netting as the angle of attack changes local velocities extracted along the centerline of four plane nettings at solidity ratios of 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 32 are shown in fig 10 combined with the results as described above in section 3 1 the changing trend about the drag coefficient of single mesh one of the no 2 no 5 meshes as a function of solidity ratio exhibits similarly as the resistance performance of the whole plane netting figs 6 and 8 it is plausible to suggest that the flow pattern around one mesh could elucidate the resistance behavior of the plane netting the center of mesh velocity of the no 3 mesh relative to the inlet velocity is illustrated in fig 11 streamline profiles around the no 3 mesh fig 4 are thus demonstrated in fig 12 the analysis in detail is proceeding as follows in parallel the flow in the middle of the no 1 mesh after the upstream knot recovers 24 81 of the current inlet velocity as the solidity ratio decreases since then the flow recovery behavior surrounding the following knots acts in the same mode except for the final downstream knot of the no 5 mesh figs 10 and 11 a high pressure region generated by the low speed flow between two adjacent knots forces the fluid flowing above the upper lower surfaces of the mesh in parallel like the streamlines shown in fig 12 the shadow effect that emerged by the upstream downstream twines is proved through the visualization results the reduced flow velocity is unable to restore to the inlet velocity mainly due to the loss of turbulence intensity for the plane netting with a solidity ratio of 0 05 in the inclined case the fluid ahead of the downstream knot is out of the wake boundary generated by the upstream knot and tends to flow through the mesh after the angle of 10 the downstream mesh is exerted by the undisturbed flow equal to the inlet velocity and the hydrodynamic force loaded on every mesh for the netting with a low solidity ratio is independent a similar tendency for the netting with a solidity ratio of 0 1 is also seen when the inclination angle is greater or equal to 15 figs 8 10 and 11 nevertheless for the plane nettings with solidity ratios of 0 2 and 0 32 the downstream knot is partly in the upstream knot wake and the local velocity remains influenced before the angle of 15 the fluid between the mesh is still occupied by the wake consequently the local flow velocity is thus lower than the inlet velocity and the fluid keeps moving above the large solidity ratio netting figs 10 12 as the angle is greater or equal to 20 the fluid in front of the downstream mesh for the netting with the solidity ratio of 0 32 is accelerated and starts flowing through the mesh the increment of local flow velocity relative to the inlet velocity is up to 8 at the angle of attack of 25 figs 10 12 in term of it the transition range for different flow patterns seems within 15 20 for the trawl netting consequently the solidity ratio influencing the drag coefficient of the plane netting performs as the same relationship between the local flow velocity and the solidity ratio exhibiting the dual effect across the angle of attack the velocity v vertical to the current direction and the velocity w in the normal direction along with the no 3 mesh for the trawl plane netting with the solidity ratio of 0 32 is shown in fig 13 both velocities are on the order of 2 cm s before the angle of attack of 10 the maximum velocity w approaches 10 cm s emerged by the netting in the taut configuration which is more than two times of velocity v at the angle of attack of 25 even if the magnitude of velocity w is only 10 cm s at most and remarkably smaller than the current v 60 cm s it is adequate to alter the streamlines through the mesh as the downwash direction after the angle of 20 fig 12 it implies the turbulent flow is characterized by the dominance of the normal velocity w when the trawl net is towed 4 discussion hydrodynamic experiments for trawl plane nettings have been conducted by an effective l type frame to refine the understanding of its resistance performance at small angles of attack the l type frame is with a low resistance d 0 026v 1 96 shown in fig 14 which is the basic demand of netting hydrodynamic experiment at a small angle of attack the drag caused by the frame without netting occupied less than 20 of the total resistance and the frame stability was also confirmed under different inclination angle conditions during the experiments although the drag coefficient uncertainty was 3 10 herein the l type frame overall satisfies the experiment requirement and ensures the measurement accuracy of the drag coefficient for plane netting drag coefficients of smooth cylinder and sphere are dominated by the flow regime that is characterized by viscous laminar in the state of low reynolds number based on the diameter re 200 and transition to turbulence at high reynolds number re 400 referred to hoerner 1965 which arguably is one of the main empirical works on fluid dynamic drag for the plane netting the critical reynolds number re d for the transition of normal drag coefficient approached the empirical value of 200 imai and nakamura 1989 or 700 yamamoto et al 1996 through flume tank experiments respectively wang et al 1988 reported that there was a slight variation on the parallel drag coefficient of fishing plane netting in relation to the re d range of 200 1000 referred to present results the sight experiment limitation could not significantly change the resistance performance of plane netting re d more than 400 for the investigated nettings is likely to explain why a decreasing trend of drag coefficient and reynolds number did not occur in which the turbulent flow surrounding the plane netting has been developed early experimental studies revealed that when the aspect ratio the transverse length normal length of a netting was more than 4 few differences of drag coefficient occurred in parallel imai 1986 kumazawa et al 2012 in the present results the resistance of the no 2 no 5 mesh close to the symmetry side remains similar but is lower than that of no 1 mesh assuming the mesh number of fishing netting satisfies the aspect ratio of more than 4 the drag coefficient of the single mesh of course it acts as one mesh of the netting not the isolative mesh geometry is reliable to express the resistance performance of the whole netting thus drag force loading on the overall net is credible to be simplified as the sum of a basic mesh geometry or the four cruciform assembly klebert et al 2013 lader et al 2014 bi et al 2017 as the aspect ratio of the netting for every trawl component is more than 4 before the angle of attack of 20 the netting drag coefficient is mainly influenced by the flow pattern moving above the netting the shadow effect the maximum local flow velocity ahead of the downstream twine is lower than the inlet velocity the magnitude of which depends on the limited mesh distance for instance the knot to knot distances for the plane netting with the solidity ratio of 0 05 and 0 32 are about 56 and 6 times the twine diameter respectively the former distance contributes to recovering the local velocity up to approximately 81 of the current whereas the rear one is only 24 in parallel case fig 11 the downstream twine remains located in the upstream twine wake when the inclination angle is small it leads to that the shadow effect still works and less resistance is exerted on the plane netting with a large solidity ratio it could be thus concluded that less reduction of local velocity is associated with a longer knot to knot distance geometrized by a smaller solidity ratio the noticeable difference between real center of mesh flow velocity ahead of the twine and the reference velocity is believed to explain the inverse effect of solidity ratio on the estimated resistance coefficient at a low inclination angle since the angle of attack exceeds 20 the flow starts to be accelerated by the net structure and passes through the mesh when the solidity ratio turns larger the opening mouth area of the mesh gets smaller the speed of the accelerated flow increases and eventually leads to a larger resistance exerted on the plane netting relative to the inlet velocity thus such flow pattern emerged by the netting is plausible to account for the direct relationship between the solidity ratio and the drag coefficient for the plane netting for α 20 this assumption was supported by the increment of the normal drag coefficient of plane nettings with an increasing solidity ratio kebert et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 dong et al 2016 computations of drag coefficient for plane netting are commonly obtained by using eq 2 using the current v as a reference water velocity assumed that water flow each mesh is equal to the corresponding velocity though it is well admitted that the flow speed in through the mesh may change as the angle of attack turns inclination angle these small velocity differences are believed to lead to some modifications in local drag force estimations based on present results the maximum local flow velocity ahead of the knot which is noticeably lower or higher than the current does have a significant impact on the estimated drag characteristics of the plane netting prediction tools for the resistance acting on a full size fishing net is applicable to the work to optimize the design of the net gear structure modify the energy efficiency as well as reduce environmental damage achieved by the low cost numerical simulation a high accuracy estimation method would be indeed attractive for engineers fishermen and communities in the fishery and aquaculture fields considering the common screen model and morison model for the simulation work of net structure modification design reliable references were provided in the present study the screen model determination of the drag force acting on a trawl net is associated with each panel of the trawl and approaches the sum of drag force acting on the nettings the empirical drag coefficient formula eq 12 of the plane netting integrated with the dual effect of solidity ratio is more suitable for the screen model simulation on the other hand the morison model simulation of net gear is conducted by considering the cylinder twine and sphere knot as the basic elements using a given set current towing speed the hydrodynamic prediction of nets would be more accurate using the local velocity as a function of solidity ratio and small angle of attack fig 11 reflecting the shadow effect of twines in the morison model simulations of the full scale pelagic and bottom trawl nets as well as sea water aquaculture net cage would be promoted with these results in further research investigations of hydrodynamic performances of high solidity ratio plane nettings with finer mesh structure mesh size 50 1000 μm are also in progress to establish a comprehensive hydrodynamic model of plane netting in a wider range of solidity ratio 5 conclusion resistance performances of trawl plane netting with solidity ratio of 0 05 0 32 at small angles of attack from 0 to 25 was investigated in the flume tank experiment and cfd analysis under the premise of feasibility with the following conclusions 1 the dual effect of the solidity ratio on the drag coefficient varying small angles of attack was confirmed through the hydrodynamic experiment and visualization results 2 a slight difference in drag coefficient of the single mesh and the plane netting infers that a basic mesh geometry or the four cruciform assembly is reliable to express the resistance performance of a whole netting 3 the empirical drag coefficient formula of the plane netting integrated with the dual effect of solidity ratio contributes to an accurate prediction of screen model simulation of net structures 4 the local velocity as a function of solidity ratio and small angle of attack reflecting the twine to twine shadow effect is suggested to be adopted in the morison model simulation of net gear rather than the set velocity credit authorship contribution statement xinxing you conceptualization data curation and

20399,a composite buffer has been designed to reduce the impact load of high speed water entry projectile rigid polyurethane pu foams of different densities have been used to make the damper of the buffer a series of compression tests for pu foam specimens are implemented to obtain the stress strain curves under different loading speeds the constitutive model used in the simulation for pu foam has been validated by comparing the results with the experimental data six different failure modes have been found in the dynamic crushing process of the nose cap the effects of pu foam density the length of the nose cap on these failure modes are presented quantitatively by introducing a time related non dimensional number that represents the beginning time of each failure mode the results show the complete disintegration of the nose cap strongly depends on pu foam density its effect is more pronounced in the cases when the ratio of the length of the buffer to the diameter of the projectile is greater than 0 92 the dedicated buffer is very efficient in reducing the impact load imposed in the cavitator of the projectile the highest load reducing ratio up to 51 keywords high speed water entry composite buffer rigid polyurethane foams mechanical testing load reduction 1 introduction when canonical shapes like spheres cones and other objects penetrate the water from air at a certain speed some distinct phases may 1975 truscott et al 2014 can be found during the process among these phases the flow establishment phase is considered as the key phase that the water entry structure will withstand a high impacting load the body shell of the projectile may experience a significant deformation even the structural failure in this phase simultaneously the onboard instrumentation has a high risk of being wholly damaged by the negative accelerations associated with impact thus it is very important to focus attention on the load reduction of the water entry structure to ensure its safety investigations of objects entering into the liquid have been conducted for over one hundred years the earliest work published on the experimental determination of the water entry process dates back to the study on splashes phenomena produced by a liquid sphere falling on a horizontal solid plate a liquid sphere falling into a liquid and a solid sphere falling into a liquid worthington and cole 1897 then worthington and cole worthington 1908 extend their improved short duration flash photographic technology to capture cavities von karman von karman 1929 postulated that the increase in added mass had caused the impact pressure on this basis he developed the earliest recognized theoretical consideration of water entry by investigating the pressure of seaplane floating landing von karman s work was continued by wagner 1932 who dealt with a two dimensional wedge by taking into account the calculation of the piled up water surface and the spray thickness shiffman and hillman shiffman and spencer 1951 developed a solution towards the impact force on a cone during the water entry process based on the work conducted by hillman 1946 other improved works include the linearised solution developed by trilling 1950 an approximate design formula monaghan 1947 for calculating the maximum deceleration a theory bisplinghoff doherty for determining the shape of the free surface based on wagner s work the effects of hydroelasticity have been studied theoretically and experimentally by faltinsen faltinsen et al 2000 lu et al 2000 maki et al 2011 wang et al wang and soares 2018 further studied the water entry wedges by using different fully coupled numerical methods high speed water entry problems have been widely concerned since the middle of the 20th century due to ordnance applications such as underwater moving objects guo et al 2012 spacecraft seddon and moatamedi 2006 and others shoji et al 2008 metzger 1981 studied the experiment for oblique water entry with a velocity up to 356 m s baldwin 1972 utilized an air gun to accelerate conical models with tip angles of 45 90 and 120 up to 110 feet per second he found that the initial rise in pressure coefficient to maximum value depends only on the cone angle lee et al 1997 proposed an analytical model which described the energy transfer for cavity production providing accurate estimates of cavity dynamic by comparing the analytical results with the results from experiments and numerical simulations truscott 2009 investigated the effect of bullet shape on ballistic stability by the experiments of the shallow angle entry bullets yan et al 2018 carried on experimental and numerical research on the water entry of air launched autonomous underwater vehicles auv with the speed ranging from 20 m s to 90 m s chen et al 2019a studied the effects of entry angle entry speed and cavitator area on the axial force experimentally another group focused on the influences of nose shape velocity and water entry attitude angle on the trajectory stability of high speed water entry projectiles chen et al 2019b more recent research revealed the relationship between the maximum acceleration shock spectrum of the impact load and the peak pulse width of the impact load based on the shock response spectrum method shi et al 2020 most water entry related literature are concerned with impact load and the generation of the cavity limited attention has been taken to the load reduction structure for water entry objects it is interesting that the sudden shock overload of the structure during the water entry process also exists in the animal kingdom scholars have found that several species of seabirds brown boobies ropert coudert et al 2004 northern gannets herring gulls castro and huber 2012 can use some unique foraging methods such as plunge diving and surface diving for surviving these birds have a high risk of injury due to a large deceleration at impact resulting in considerable water entry forces on their body wang et al 2013 however gannet and sulidae could dive at a relatively high speed up to 24 m s to foraging without injury depending on their slender and seemingly fragile neck chang et al 2016 the neck and skull form a natural load reduction structure which can be simplified to be an elastic beam attached to a skull like cone ordering a special buckling criterion during the impacting process such a buckling behavior is analogous to the euler buckling of a thin shell under the compression loading numerically simulated data for diving birds provides some insight into the great impact forces and large deceleration during diving crandell et al 2019 for comparison purposes experimental data from real or 3d printed bird geometries make the mechanical mechanism of the load reducing process more reliable sharker et al 2019 inspired by seabirds skull neck structural form a dedicated mitigation system could be designed for the high speed water entry objects the earliest load reducing structure for the underwater projectile is a nose cap for torpedo howard 1959 which is entirely made from solid foam hinckly and yang hinckley and yang 1975 used the rigid polyurethane foam pu as the energy absorbing element in their impact loading tests based on the design of a composite structural buffer shutler et al 2012 shi et al 2019 using the explicit finite element method to estimate the impact load performance of their new mitigation structure however there are still very limited investigations on the mitigation system for high speed water entry projectile in the published works in the present work a composite structural buffer device consisting of a nose cap a pu foam damper and a connector has been designed for the high speed water entry projectile pu foams of different densities ranging from 40 kg m3 to 450 kg m3 are used to be the materials of the damper the fully coupled simulation of the water entry projectile with the buffer has been conducted by using ls dyna hallquist 2006 software numerical simulations based on arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method are implemented in studying the dynamic crushing of the buffer a series of compression tests have been carried on to validate the constitutive model of pu foams six different failure patterns of the nose cap are found in the vertical high speed water entry process the effects of the density of the pu foam the length of the nose cap on the occurrence of each failure mode the peak fsi impact pressure are revealed 2 numerical theory and validation the process of the water impact of the projectile with a buffer is very complex involving the interaction of elastic body and fluid the high speed impact between solids also structural failure so the explicit finite element code ls dyna is applied to deal with the present work 2 1 governing equations the governing equations of the ale algorithm are given by the following equations 1 the continuity equation 1 ρ t ρ v i x i w i ρ x i where ρ is the density of fluid v i represents the velocity of material w i is the relative velocity which is given by w i v i u i u i is the velocity of mesh 2 the momentum equation 2 ρ v i t σ

j ρ b i v i w j x j ρ e ρ 2 v i 2 where e is the internal energy for the present work the penalty method has been applied to copy with the involving fluid structure coupling problem in the ale algorithm the fluid is solved in an eulerian fixed mesh method while the solid is embedded in an eulerian fixed mesh the multi material and volume of fluid formation are described by aquelet et al 2003 2 2 description of buffer structure and setting the buffer for load reducing propose consists of the nose cap damper and connector it should be noted that the material of the nose cap must satisfy the strict requirement on one hand the cap must have a certain strength to withstand the air pressure before impacting into the water on the other hand a certain fragility makes it easy for it to completely disintegrate after entering into the water so a special composite material that consists of chopped twisting glass fiber and unsaturated polyester resin has been chosen as the material of the ogival nose cap the detailed parameters of this material are listed in table 1 mat plastic kinematic is applied to be the constitutive model of this composite material this material model is a combination of kinematic isotropic hardening theory with a von mises yield surface and associated flow rule strain rate is accounted for using the cowper symonds model jones 1983 which scales the yield stress by a strain rate dependent factor this constitutive model is formulated by krieg and key 1976 the damper is the main energy absorbing element of the whole structure the damper is manufactured by a machine tool for a snug fit with the internal face of the nose cap pu foams of different densities ranging from 40 kg m3 to 450 kg m3 are used to be the material of the damper for better energy absorbing performance other parameters of the pu foams can be found in table 2 mat fu chang foam is applied in modeling the pu foam material to avoid the negative volume error before the material has reached its failure criterion due to the extremely large deformation under compression the interior contact algorithm has been used to control a combined mode of shear and compression the connector is a ring like component linking the buffer and projectile the material of the connector is the same as the nose cap the contact between the nose cap and damper is automatic node to surface and so is the contact between the foam and projectile fig 1 is the schematic diagram of the buffer projectile and their connection type b n is the thickness of the nose cap shell the total mass of the projectile is 100 kg other detailed dimensions are listed in table 3 2 3 materials and testing preparation pu foam specimens 100 kg m3 have been processed into cubes 100 mm 100 mm 100 mm in our laboratory pu foams used in the present work have been proved to be strain rate dependent materials having a good energy absorbing performance to precisely modeling their mechanical properties a suitable constitutive model is needed in ls dyna mat fu chang foam is available to model the low medium density pu foam materials according to the large amount of work by chang 1995 in this unified constitutive model mat 83 can address a relatively complicated physical process involving isotropic directional hardening thermal recovery hardening general temperature dependence of plastic flow isotropic and directional damage compared with mat 63 and mat 57 this constitutive model is quite suitable for the condition that strain rate dependency for stress strain responses should be considered mat 83 uses tabulated test data for the loading curves three inputting engineering stress strain curves at different strain rates are needed in this constitutive model as illustrated in fig 2 a series of compression tests have been conducted by using the mts 810 material test system to obtain the stress strain curves under different loading speeds this testing system consists of a hydraulic universal test platform a computer system a hydraulic oil container a ddc servo control system a data acquisition system a digital signal processing system and a remote controller the density of testing pu foam specimens is 100 kg m3 the compression tests are conducted at three different rates 0 001s 1 0 1s 1 and 2s 1 as shown in fig 3 a and fig 3b to improve the reliability of the stress strain curves each set of experiments has been repeated three times the split hopkinson pressure bar shpb technique is adopted as a means of determining the stress strain relationship at a much higher strain rate 1000 s 1 1500 s 1 as shown in fig 3c fig 3d shows the simulation result of the compression test the simulation result shows a good agreement with the experimental data it should be noted that the typical uniaxial compressive stress strain relationship of pu foam can be divided into three parts li et al 2018 pre collapse plateau stage and densification stage the key stage for estimating the load reducing performance is the plateau stage thus the plateau stress and densification initiation strain have become the two key parameters the former can be obtained by the energy equivalence in the plateau stage while the latter is determined by the stress strain curve from the compression test tan et al 2002 to address the dynamic impacting process once the elements will be deleted in the simulation when they reach the failure criterion this method can ensure the constitutive model still works even the damper is compressed to exceed 80 of its initial length during the high speed water entry process 2 4 validation of the numerical model chen et al 2019a used an air gun to accelerate the experimental model their launch system has been proved to accelerate a 2 kg model up to 100 m s at 1 mpa of pressure to validate the accuracy of the ale method in calculating high speed water entry problems the predictions from a rigid body entering the water at a 20 entry angle with an entry speed of 70 m s are compared with the experimental results conducted by chen et al 2019a the diameter of the m4 model s cavitator d is 58 5 mm the mass is 1 907 kg the geometry and other dimensions are showed in fig 4 the outer fluid boundaries of the calculating area are set as non reflecting while the inner nodes are entirely free the numerical simulation of the m4 model is conducted by using the commercial software ls dyna a penalty coupling algorithm and multi material eulerian formulation have also been applied to the present work the fluid and solid domains are all meshed by solid164 element 8 nodes hexahedron solid element water and air domains are defined as null materials the using linear polynomial equation of state is applied for fluid domains 8 p c 0 c 1 θ c 2 θ 2 c 3 θ 3 c 4 c 5 θ c 6 θ 2 e where θ ρ ρ 0 1 ρ ρ 0 is the ratio of current density to reference density ρ is the density of fluid e represents the initial inter energy per unit volume c 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 and c 6 are the polynomial coefficients the parameters for fluid are listed in table 4 the numerical results are compared with experimental data conducted by chen et al 2019a as shown in fig 5 the axial force coefficient versus dimensionless penetration distance curve is applied to estimate the accuracy of the ale method in addressing high speed water entry impacting problems here the axial force coefficient and dimensionless penetration distance are defined as 9 c x m a a x l ρ v a x l 2 s 2 10 λ l d 11 s π d 2 4 where m is the mass of m4 model a a x l and v a x l are the axial acceleration and velocity of the projectile respectively ρ is the density of fluid s represents the area of cavitator d is the diameter of the cavitator the value of m4 model is 58 5 mm l is the moving distance of the model as shown in fig 4 we use three different mesh densities to mesh the solid domain for reducing the number of grids the local mesh refinement criterion has been applied in both solid and fluid domains the detailed parameters of elements are listed in table 5 according to the results of grid independence verification fig 5 it is found that the medium grid is enough to estimate the present high speed water entry impact when the ratio of fluid mesh size to vehicle mesh size is 1 5 the relative errors can be acceptable in engineering applications 2 5 numerical preparation the simulation of the crushing process of the buffer during the impact is the difficult part of the work as illustrated in fig 6 the fluid is defined as a cylindrical region for saving the cpu time the diameter of the fluid domain is 6000 mm the height of the air and water domains is 1400 mm and 4500 mm respectively the mesh generation strategy is similar to that for m4 model validation the fluid domain is divided into 3 parts the central area middle area and boundary area the diameter of the central area is 1 2d4 d4 is the diameter of the projectile see table 3 to obtain accurate results of fsi pressure between the projectile and fluid stress and deformation of structures a local grid refinement method has been adopted the ratio of fluid mesh size in this area to projectile mesh size is 1 5 compared with the central mesh area the middle area has a much larger size with an external diameter of about 5d4 meshed by a coarser grid then it is the boundary mesh area the external diameter of this region is about 28d4 the mesh size in the boundary area is much larger than that in the central area and middle area with a growth rate of 3 3 dynamic crushing of the nose caps 3 1 deformation and failure modes the ale method has been used in the simulation of the dynamic crushing process of the whole buffer the impact speed of the projectile is 100 m s during the impacting process the nose cap has experienced six failure processes before it is completely disintegrated in the beginning the projectile will be launched by an aerial platform before impacting the air water surface fig 7 a the projectile will fly in the air for a certain amount of time at this stage the buffer of the projectile experiences no distinct deformation the only function of the nose cap is to protect the damper and the head of the projectile the perfect streamlined shell of the nose cap can maintain a lower air drag once the buffer contacts the air water interface the tip of the nose cap is almost smashed at the moment we name this failure mode as local failure lf fig 7b then the damper is compressed by both the projectile front and the water surface in the longitudinal direction direction of water impact o y direction leading to large transverse deformation of the foam at the moment the great wedging in forces are imposed on the inner surface of the nose cap in this process the named wedging in forces come from both the pu foam and the head of the projectile as a result progressive buckling dominates the deformation of the nose cap this failure mode is named as wedging in failure wif fig 7c mode which is caused by the lateral expanding o x direction of the nose cap wif mode will last a relatively long time until the nose cap breaks down during the process a visible warping deformation wd fig 7e has been found in the tail of the nose cap as the nose cap front continues to expand in the lateral direction the euler failure mode ef fig 7d has been found in the middle part of the nose cap unlike the progressive expansion of the nose cap in wif mode ef mode caused a sharp increase in the lateral size of the middle part of the nose cap a series of visible cracks suddenly appear in this area leading to the collapse of the middle part of the nose cap after the ef mode the cracks which generate in the ef mode continue to grow longitudinally the nose cap flares as guided by these cracks around the circumference the strips resulting from the growth of cracks move along the longitudinal direction inversing and curling in this process this failure process is named inversion and curling mode ic fig 7f the crushing process is ended with the complete disintegration cd mode fig 7g of the nose cap fig 8 is the classification chart for failure modes of the nose caps during the high speed water entry process it is found that the lf mode has appeared in the whole 25 calculation conditions the area of collapse led by lf mode decreases with the increase of the length of the nose cap the area of stress concentration region in the head decreases with the increase of pu foam density von mises stress distribution results of the wif mode show that the stress concentration regions are almost the half area of the nose cap in most cases in consideration of the great contribution to the lateral expansion of the nose cap wif mode plays the most significant role in the final complete collapse of the nose cap wd mode only appears in the cases of nose cap 4 and 5 it seems that the existence of wd mode is related to the length of the nose cap a non dimensional number l1 d2 is defined for the quantitative study the results reveal that wd mode only occurs when l 1 d 1 1 08 it should be noted that both of the wd and wif modes have caused the lateral expansion of the nose cap but they are caused by different physical mechanisms the former is the result of the superposition of the elastic plastic waves propagating through the nose cap the latter is the inevitable result of excessive deformation led by lateral stretching of the nose cap the results have suggested a possible link between the occurrence of the ef mode and the length of the nose cap after all the ef mode has not occurred in the case 19 20 23 24 and 25 von mises results show that the number of strips is inversely proportional to the density of pu foam the shorter the length of the nose cap the easier it is to observe the inversion and curling of these strips ic mode is a continuation of the ef mode the appearance of ic mode is consistent with that of ef mode in all the cases the nose cap has a thin walled structure with an ogival head and cylindrical body ic mode always occurs on the surface of the cylindrical body it is found that a longitudinal penetrating crack can lead to the final destruction of the remaining structure of the nose cap thus we defined the moment that a longitudinal penetrating crack occurs as the initial occurrence time of the cd mode the ideal outcome is the complete disintegrated cd mode of the nose cap however the complete disintegration of the nose cap has characteristics of randomness from the von mises stress distribution results in all nose cap 2 cases the tail structure of the nose cap has failed to completely collapse it is noted that the failure patterns of the nose cap are similar to that of the composite tubes under axial compression tests conducted by zhang et al 2018 and sun et al 2018 especially the ic mode as shown in fig 9 in the axial and oblique loading experiments of the cfrp tube conducted by sun et al chang 1995 strips led by matrix cracks move along the longitudinal direction progressively curling until the damage of tube the generation and evolution of strips in the ic modes show apparent similarity to that in axial compression tests of composite tubes fig 10 shows the structural diagram of the nose cap the nose cap shell can be divided into three parts the ogival head of the cap the tail part with a cylindrical thin walled structure and the middle part which connects the two parts the red blue and green rectangle dotted line boxes represent the head middle and tail regions of the nose cap we use the acronyms hp mp and tp to denote the three parts lf wd wif ef ic and cd modes are the simulation results of the structural model in fig 10a according to our calculations tp has little contribution to the load reducing performance of the buffer the function of tp is to enable the nose cap to be fixed to the projectile body the wedging in forces imposed by foam and projectile are only acting on the hp and mp of the nose cap hence the von mises stress distribution results of tp have been hidden in the post processing fig 10b leaving that of hp and mp for further study the cd mode in figs 7h and 8 represents the complete disintegration of only hp and mp of the nose cap as shown in fig 10b while cd mode refers to that of the entire structure of the nose cap as shown in fig 10a 3 2 modes classification and load reducing evaluation fig 11 shows the failure mode classification for the nose cap during the water entry process a vertical axis is a non dimensional number t t c t represents the beginning time of the failure mode while t c is our numerical calculation time t c 8 ms in the present work the horizontal axis is the non dimensional number l1 d2 the scatters represent the failure modes observed in the crushing process while colored lines represent different pu foam cases lf mode occurs at the moment when the ogival head touches the air water surface wif mode is following the lf mode in all the cases to study the wif mode quantitatively groups of sensors are set along the longitudinal direction in the outer surface of the nose cap the criterion for determining the occurrence of the wif mode is that more than half of the sensors have a displacement greater than 0 1 mm this criterion is also applied for the ef mode and wd mode the vertical coordinate of scatters in fig 11 represents the beginning time of the failure mode it is found that when l1 d2 0 92 the beginning time of the wif mode in pu100 pu200 pu350 and pu450 cases depend on l1 d2 the longer the length of the nose cap the later wif mode appears for the nose cap 1 t t c of the cd mode is increasing with the increase of ρ p u in other words a higher pu foam density will delay the occurrence of the complete disintegration of the nose cap case 4 and 5 show that the nose cap cannot be completely broken down when ρ p u 350 kg m 3 which has been against our initial design of the buffer after all one of our requirements for the buffer is that the entire structure of the nose cap must be able to fully decompose during the crushing process however the occurrence of cd mode has distinct randomness if we ignore the results of the tail part tp of the nose cap it is found that t t c of complete disintegration of the remaining structure follows a certain rule for nose cap 1 t t c of the cd mode has firstly decreased then increasing with the increase of pu foam density nose caps 2 5 also have a similar law for nose caps 1 3 the lowest t t c appears in the pu100 foam case which means that the hp and mp of the nose cap will completely collapse in the shortest time when the material of the damper is pu100 foam fig 12 shows the time history of t t c of the cd mode the results of five different pu foams reveal that t t c of the cd mode increases with the increase of the length of the nose cap except case 7 marked by red rectangular boxes in figs 11 and 12 t t c of the cd mode in case 7 is much lower than it in a lower pu foam density case simultaneously the wif mode of case 7 occurs dramatically later than that of other cases before the occurrence of the wif mode it is the lf mode that dominants the crushing process during this time the tip of the nose cap and the foam front collapse layer by layer successively the contact area between water and the nose cap increased with time resulting in a greater resultant force from water on the nose cap thus it is easier for the nose cap to be broken under the great impact loads from water and the wedging in force imposed by pu foam the delay of the wif mode has accelerated the disintegration of the nose cap to a certain extent in the pu40 and pu100 cases the length of the nose cap only has a limited effect on t t c of the cd mode when l1 d2 0 92 whereas t t c of the cd mode increases exponentially with the increase of the length of the nose cap when l1 d2 0 92 when the density of pu foam is great than 200 kg m3 t t c of the cd mode increases rapidly with the increase of the length of the nose cap when l1 d2 0 92 whereas the nose caps have failed to break down in our numerical calculation time when l1 d2 0 92 according to our design standards for the buffer pu200 pu350 and pu450 are not fit for the material of the damper in the case that l1 d2 0 92 it should be noted that t t c of the cd mode in all pu40 foam cases is larger than it in pu100 ones it is the weaker wedging in force imposed by the foam that has delayed the complete disintegration of the nose cap the strength and stiffness of the pu40 foam are one or two orders of magnitude lower than pu100 and other pu foams in addition pu40 foam material has a lower poisson ratio among the five different pu foams a much lower strength means the pu foam has entirely collapsed under a very high impact loading before it applies an effective wedging in force to the inner face of the nose cap a lower poisson ratio means a weaker lateral expansion of the structure when the foam is compressed in the longitudinal direction by both the water and the projectile front both of the two factors have led to a larger t t c of the cd mode in the pu40 foam case 3 3 load reducing evaluation fig 13 plots the fsi pressure pressure between projectile front and water forces between buffer and water are not included time history curve of the characteristic element on the cavitator the black line represents the slamming pressure of the light projectile while other colored dot lines represent different pu foam cases 10 pressure sensors have been set in the central area in cavitator surface of the projectile the pressure values are the mean values of pressure captured by these sensors as shown in fig 13f only the front of the pu foam has been broken down in pu200 pu350 and pu450 cases for the nose cap 5 the remaining structure of the pu foam still exists preventing the head of the projectile from contact with water the buffer has failed to collapse even the projectile penetrates the water for 14 ms a similar situation also exists in other cases hence the value of the fsi pressure is zero in these cases the results of peak fsi pressures reveal the significant load reduction performance of the buffers it is found that the peak pressure decreases with the increase of the length of the nose cap which means the longer the length of the nose cap the better the load reducing performance moreover the peak fsi pressure decreases with the increase of pu foam density to estimate the load reducing performance of the buffer the load reducing ratio ϖ is defined by eq faltinsen et al 2000 12 ϖ p l p b p l 100 where p l represents the pressure peak of the light projectile 372 mpa p b represents the pressure peak of the projectile with buffer as illustrated in fig 14 a the results of fsi pressure indicate that pu200 foam is the best material for the damper among the 25 cases with a load reducing ratio of up to 51 nose cap 2 case 8 fig 14b plots the time curves of the peak fsi pressure for different cases t t c of peak fsi pressure increases with the increasing of the length of the nose cap the variation of the time curve for pu40 is similar to that for pu100 compared to pu40 and pu100 curves the time curve for pu200 rises much faster with the increase of pu foam density it will take much more time to reach the peak fsi pressure on one hand a higher density of pu foam material means a better load reduction performance of the buffer on the other hand the buffer cannot be completely broken down when the pu foam density is greater than 200 kg m3 both the load reducing performance and fragility should be taken into account when selecting foam materials for the damper 4 conclusions in this study a composite mitigation structure including the nose cap damper and connector has been designed for reducing the impact load of high speed water entry projectile pu foams of five different densities ranging from 40 kg m3 to 450 kg m3 have been used as the main energy absorbing materials a series of compression tests have been conducted to validate the constitutive model used in the simulation according to the results of fe simulation for the composite buffer we can draw the following conclusions 1 lf wif wd ef ic and cd failure modes have been found in the crushing process of the nose cap the appearance of wd is dependent on the length of the nose cap wd mode just occurs when l1 d2 1 08 but independent of the density of pu foams 2 the wedging in force imposed by pu foam is the key factor leading to the complete disintegration of the nose cap t t c of the wif mode is dependent on l1 d2 but independent on the density of pu foams if l1 d2 0 92 t t c of the wif mode is approaching a constant whereas if l1 d2 0 92 t t c of the wif mode is monotonically increasing with the increase of l1 d2 moreover the delay of the wif mode will accelerate the disintegration of the nose cap the tail part is not included 3 in the case that ρ p u 100 kg m 3 when l1 d2 0 92 t t c of the cd mode is nearly constant when l1 d2 0 92 t t c of the cd mode increases exponentially with the increase of the length of nose cap whereas if ρ p u 100 kg m 3 t t c of the cd mode is monotonically increasing with the increase of the length of the nose cap 4 the load reducing ratio ϖ strongly depends on the length of the nose cap and the density of pu foam taking into account the load reducing performance and destructibility of the nose cap pu200 foam is the best material for the damper among the 25 cases with a load reducing ratio of up to 51 credit authorship contribution statement yao li conceptualization methodology validation investigation software formal analysis writing original draft

20399,a composite buffer has been designed to reduce the impact load of high speed water entry projectile rigid polyurethane pu foams of different densities have been used to make the damper of the buffer a series of compression tests for pu foam specimens are implemented to obtain the stress strain curves under different loading speeds the constitutive model used in the simulation for pu foam has been validated by comparing the results with the experimental data six different failure modes have been found in the dynamic crushing process of the nose cap the effects of pu foam density the length of the nose cap on these failure modes are presented quantitatively by introducing a time related non dimensional number that represents the beginning time of each failure mode the results show the complete disintegration of the nose cap strongly depends on pu foam density its effect is more pronounced in the cases when the ratio of the length of the buffer to the diameter of the projectile is greater than 0 92 the dedicated buffer is very efficient in reducing the impact load imposed in the cavitator of the projectile the highest load reducing ratio up to 51 keywords high speed water entry composite buffer rigid polyurethane foams mechanical testing load reduction 1 introduction when canonical shapes like spheres cones and other objects penetrate the water from air at a certain speed some distinct phases may 1975 truscott et al 2014 can be found during the process among these phases the flow establishment phase is considered as the key phase that the water entry structure will withstand a high impacting load the body shell of the projectile may experience a significant deformation even the structural failure in this phase simultaneously the onboard instrumentation has a high risk of being wholly damaged by the negative accelerations associated with impact thus it is very important to focus attention on the load reduction of the water entry structure to ensure its safety investigations of objects entering into the liquid have been conducted for over one hundred years the earliest work published on the experimental determination of the water entry process dates back to the study on splashes phenomena produced by a liquid sphere falling on a horizontal solid plate a liquid sphere falling into a liquid and a solid sphere falling into a liquid worthington and cole 1897 then worthington and cole worthington 1908 extend their improved short duration flash photographic technology to capture cavities von karman von karman 1929 postulated that the increase in added mass had caused the impact pressure on this basis he developed the earliest recognized theoretical consideration of water entry by investigating the pressure of seaplane floating landing von karman s work was continued by wagner 1932 who dealt with a two dimensional wedge by taking into account the calculation of the piled up water surface and the spray thickness shiffman and hillman shiffman and spencer 1951 developed a solution towards the impact force on a cone during the water entry process based on the work conducted by hillman 1946 other improved works include the linearised solution developed by trilling 1950 an approximate design formula monaghan 1947 for calculating the maximum deceleration a theory bisplinghoff doherty for determining the shape of the free surface based on wagner s work the effects of hydroelasticity have been studied theoretically and experimentally by faltinsen faltinsen et al 2000 lu et al 2000 maki et al 2011 wang et al wang and soares 2018 further studied the water entry wedges by using different fully coupled numerical methods high speed water entry problems have been widely concerned since the middle of the 20th century due to ordnance applications such as underwater moving objects guo et al 2012 spacecraft seddon and moatamedi 2006 and others shoji et al 2008 metzger 1981 studied the experiment for oblique water entry with a velocity up to 356 m s baldwin 1972 utilized an air gun to accelerate conical models with tip angles of 45 90 and 120 up to 110 feet per second he found that the initial rise in pressure coefficient to maximum value depends only on the cone angle lee et al 1997 proposed an analytical model which described the energy transfer for cavity production providing accurate estimates of cavity dynamic by comparing the analytical results with the results from experiments and numerical simulations truscott 2009 investigated the effect of bullet shape on ballistic stability by the experiments of the shallow angle entry bullets yan et al 2018 carried on experimental and numerical research on the water entry of air launched autonomous underwater vehicles auv with the speed ranging from 20 m s to 90 m s chen et al 2019a studied the effects of entry angle entry speed and cavitator area on the axial force experimentally another group focused on the influences of nose shape velocity and water entry attitude angle on the trajectory stability of high speed water entry projectiles chen et al 2019b more recent research revealed the relationship between the maximum acceleration shock spectrum of the impact load and the peak pulse width of the impact load based on the shock response spectrum method shi et al 2020 most water entry related literature are concerned with impact load and the generation of the cavity limited attention has been taken to the load reduction structure for water entry objects it is interesting that the sudden shock overload of the structure during the water entry process also exists in the animal kingdom scholars have found that several species of seabirds brown boobies ropert coudert et al 2004 northern gannets herring gulls castro and huber 2012 can use some unique foraging methods such as plunge diving and surface diving for surviving these birds have a high risk of injury due to a large deceleration at impact resulting in considerable water entry forces on their body wang et al 2013 however gannet and sulidae could dive at a relatively high speed up to 24 m s to foraging without injury depending on their slender and seemingly fragile neck chang et al 2016 the neck and skull form a natural load reduction structure which can be simplified to be an elastic beam attached to a skull like cone ordering a special buckling criterion during the impacting process such a buckling behavior is analogous to the euler buckling of a thin shell under the compression loading numerically simulated data for diving birds provides some insight into the great impact forces and large deceleration during diving crandell et al 2019 for comparison purposes experimental data from real or 3d printed bird geometries make the mechanical mechanism of the load reducing process more reliable sharker et al 2019 inspired by seabirds skull neck structural form a dedicated mitigation system could be designed for the high speed water entry objects the earliest load reducing structure for the underwater projectile is a nose cap for torpedo howard 1959 which is entirely made from solid foam hinckly and yang hinckley and yang 1975 used the rigid polyurethane foam pu as the energy absorbing element in their impact loading tests based on the design of a composite structural buffer shutler et al 2012 shi et al 2019 using the explicit finite element method to estimate the impact load performance of their new mitigation structure however there are still very limited investigations on the mitigation system for high speed water entry projectile in the published works in the present work a composite structural buffer device consisting of a nose cap a pu foam damper and a connector has been designed for the high speed water entry projectile pu foams of different densities ranging from 40 kg m3 to 450 kg m3 are used to be the materials of the damper the fully coupled simulation of the water entry projectile with the buffer has been conducted by using ls dyna hallquist 2006 software numerical simulations based on arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method are implemented in studying the dynamic crushing of the buffer a series of compression tests have been carried on to validate the constitutive model of pu foams six different failure patterns of the nose cap are found in the vertical high speed water entry process the effects of the density of the pu foam the length of the nose cap on the occurrence of each failure mode the peak fsi impact pressure are revealed 2 numerical theory and validation the process of the water impact of the projectile with a buffer is very complex involving the interaction of elastic body and fluid the high speed impact between solids also structural failure so the explicit finite element code ls dyna is applied to deal with the present work 2 1 governing equations the governing equations of the ale algorithm are given by the following equations 1 the continuity equation 1 ρ t ρ v i x i w i ρ x i where ρ is the density of fluid v i represents the velocity of material w i is the relative velocity which is given by w i v i u i u i is the velocity of mesh 2 the momentum equation 2 ρ v i t σ

the kronecker δ function defined as 5 δ ij 1 i j 0 i j we assume that the velocity field of the whole computed domain at the time t 0 is 6 v i x i 0 0 3 the energy equation 7 t ρ e ρ 2 v i 2 σ ij v i j ρ b i v i w j x j ρ e ρ 2 v i 2 where e is the internal energy for the present work the penalty method has been applied to copy with the involving fluid structure coupling problem in the ale algorithm the fluid is solved in an eulerian fixed mesh method while the solid is embedded in an eulerian fixed mesh the multi material and volume of fluid formation are described by aquelet et al 2003 2 2 description of buffer structure and setting the buffer for load reducing propose consists of the nose cap damper and connector it should be noted that the material of the nose cap must satisfy the strict requirement on one hand the cap must have a certain strength to withstand the air pressure before impacting into the water on the other hand a certain fragility makes it easy for it to completely disintegrate after entering into the water so a special composite material that consists of chopped twisting glass fiber and unsaturated polyester resin has been chosen as the material of the ogival nose cap the detailed parameters of this material are listed in table 1 mat plastic kinematic is applied to be the constitutive model of this composite material this material model is a combination of kinematic isotropic hardening theory with a von mises yield surface and associated flow rule strain rate is accounted for using the cowper symonds model jones 1983 which scales the yield stress by a strain rate dependent factor this constitutive model is formulated by krieg and key 1976 the damper is the main energy absorbing element of the whole structure the damper is manufactured by a machine tool for a snug fit with the internal face of the nose cap pu foams of different densities ranging from 40 kg m3 to 450 kg m3 are used to be the material of the damper for better energy absorbing performance other parameters of the pu foams can be found in table 2 mat fu chang foam is applied in modeling the pu foam material to avoid the negative volume error before the material has reached its failure criterion due to the extremely large deformation under compression the interior contact algorithm has been used to control a combined mode of shear and compression the connector is a ring like component linking the buffer and projectile the material of the connector is the same as the nose cap the contact between the nose cap and damper is automatic node to surface and so is the contact between the foam and projectile fig 1 is the schematic diagram of the buffer projectile and their connection type b n is the thickness of the nose cap shell the total mass of the projectile is 100 kg other detailed dimensions are listed in table 3 2 3 materials and testing preparation pu foam specimens 100 kg m3 have been processed into cubes 100 mm 100 mm 100 mm in our laboratory pu foams used in the present work have been proved to be strain rate dependent materials having a good energy absorbing performance to precisely modeling their mechanical properties a suitable constitutive model is needed in ls dyna mat fu chang foam is available to model the low medium density pu foam materials according to the large amount of work by chang 1995 in this unified constitutive model mat 83 can address a relatively complicated physical process involving isotropic directional hardening thermal recovery hardening general temperature dependence of plastic flow isotropic and directional damage compared with mat 63 and mat 57 this constitutive model is quite suitable for the condition that strain rate dependency for stress strain responses should be considered mat 83 uses tabulated test data for the loading curves three inputting engineering stress strain curves at different strain rates are needed in this constitutive model as illustrated in fig 2 a series of compression tests have been conducted by using the mts 810 material test system to obtain the stress strain curves under different loading speeds this testing system consists of a hydraulic universal test platform a computer system a hydraulic oil container a ddc servo control system a data acquisition system a digital signal processing system and a remote controller the density of testing pu foam specimens is 100 kg m3 the compression tests are conducted at three different rates 0 001s 1 0 1s 1 and 2s 1 as shown in fig 3 a and fig 3b to improve the reliability of the stress strain curves each set of experiments has been repeated three times the split hopkinson pressure bar shpb technique is adopted as a means of determining the stress strain relationship at a much higher strain rate 1000 s 1 1500 s 1 as shown in fig 3c fig 3d shows the simulation result of the compression test the simulation result shows a good agreement with the experimental data it should be noted that the typical uniaxial compressive stress strain relationship of pu foam can be divided into three parts li et al 2018 pre collapse plateau stage and densification stage the key stage for estimating the load reducing performance is the plateau stage thus the plateau stress and densification initiation strain have become the two key parameters the former can be obtained by the energy equivalence in the plateau stage while the latter is determined by the stress strain curve from the compression test tan et al 2002 to address the dynamic impacting process once the elements will be deleted in the simulation when they reach the failure criterion this method can ensure the constitutive model still works even the damper is compressed to exceed 80 of its initial length during the high speed water entry process 2 4 validation of the numerical model chen et al 2019a used an air gun to accelerate the experimental model their launch system has been proved to accelerate a 2 kg model up to 100 m s at 1 mpa of pressure to validate the accuracy of the ale method in calculating high speed water entry problems the predictions from a rigid body entering the water at a 20 entry angle with an entry speed of 70 m s are compared with the experimental results conducted by chen et al 2019a the diameter of the m4 model s cavitator d is 58 5 mm the mass is 1 907 kg the geometry and other dimensions are showed in fig 4 the outer fluid boundaries of the calculating area are set as non reflecting while the inner nodes are entirely free the numerical simulation of the m4 model is conducted by using the commercial software ls dyna a penalty coupling algorithm and multi material eulerian formulation have also been applied to the present work the fluid and solid domains are all meshed by solid164 element 8 nodes hexahedron solid element water and air domains are defined as null materials the using linear polynomial equation of state is applied for fluid domains 8 p c 0 c 1 θ c 2 θ 2 c 3 θ 3 c 4 c 5 θ c 6 θ 2 e where θ ρ ρ 0 1 ρ ρ 0 is the ratio of current density to reference density ρ is the density of fluid e represents the initial inter energy per unit volume c 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 c 5 and c 6 are the polynomial coefficients the parameters for fluid are listed in table 4 the numerical results are compared with experimental data conducted by chen et al 2019a as shown in fig 5 the axial force coefficient versus dimensionless penetration distance curve is applied to estimate the accuracy of the ale method in addressing high speed water entry impacting problems here the axial force coefficient and dimensionless penetration distance are defined as 9 c x m a a x l ρ v a x l 2 s 2 10 λ l d 11 s π d 2 4 where m is the mass of m4 model a a x l and v a x l are the axial acceleration and velocity of the projectile respectively ρ is the density of fluid s represents the area of cavitator d is the diameter of the cavitator the value of m4 model is 58 5 mm l is the moving distance of the model as shown in fig 4 we use three different mesh densities to mesh the solid domain for reducing the number of grids the local mesh refinement criterion has been applied in both solid and fluid domains the detailed parameters of elements are listed in table 5 according to the results of grid independence verification fig 5 it is found that the medium grid is enough to estimate the present high speed water entry impact when the ratio of fluid mesh size to vehicle mesh size is 1 5 the relative errors can be acceptable in engineering applications 2 5 numerical preparation the simulation of the crushing process of the buffer during the impact is the difficult part of the work as illustrated in fig 6 the fluid is defined as a cylindrical region for saving the cpu time the diameter of the fluid domain is 6000 mm the height of the air and water domains is 1400 mm and 4500 mm respectively the mesh generation strategy is similar to that for m4 model validation the fluid domain is divided into 3 parts the central area middle area and boundary area the diameter of the central area is 1 2d4 d4 is the diameter of the projectile see table 3 to obtain accurate results of fsi pressure between the projectile and fluid stress and deformation of structures a local grid refinement method has been adopted the ratio of fluid mesh size in this area to projectile mesh size is 1 5 compared with the central mesh area the middle area has a much larger size with an external diameter of about 5d4 meshed by a coarser grid then it is the boundary mesh area the external diameter of this region is about 28d4 the mesh size in the boundary area is much larger than that in the central area and middle area with a growth rate of 3 3 dynamic crushing of the nose caps 3 1 deformation and failure modes the ale method has been used in the simulation of the dynamic crushing process of the whole buffer the impact speed of the projectile is 100 m s during the impacting process the nose cap has experienced six failure processes before it is completely disintegrated in the beginning the projectile will be launched by an aerial platform before impacting the air water surface fig 7 a the projectile will fly in the air for a certain amount of time at this stage the buffer of the projectile experiences no distinct deformation the only function of the nose cap is to protect the damper and the head of the projectile the perfect streamlined shell of the nose cap can maintain a lower air drag once the buffer contacts the air water interface the tip of the nose cap is almost smashed at the moment we name this failure mode as local failure lf fig 7b then the damper is compressed by both the projectile front and the water surface in the longitudinal direction direction of water impact o y direction leading to large transverse deformation of the foam at the moment the great wedging in forces are imposed on the inner surface of the nose cap in this process the named wedging in forces come from both the pu foam and the head of the projectile as a result progressive buckling dominates the deformation of the nose cap this failure mode is named as wedging in failure wif fig 7c mode which is caused by the lateral expanding o x direction of the nose cap wif mode will last a relatively long time until the nose cap breaks down during the process a visible warping deformation wd fig 7e has been found in the tail of the nose cap as the nose cap front continues to expand in the lateral direction the euler failure mode ef fig 7d has been found in the middle part of the nose cap unlike the progressive expansion of the nose cap in wif mode ef mode caused a sharp increase in the lateral size of the middle part of the nose cap a series of visible cracks suddenly appear in this area leading to the collapse of the middle part of the nose cap after the ef mode the cracks which generate in the ef mode continue to grow longitudinally the nose cap flares as guided by these cracks around the circumference the strips resulting from the growth of cracks move along the longitudinal direction inversing and curling in this process this failure process is named inversion and curling mode ic fig 7f the crushing process is ended with the complete disintegration cd mode fig 7g of the nose cap fig 8 is the classification chart for failure modes of the nose caps during the high speed water entry process it is found that the lf mode has appeared in the whole 25 calculation conditions the area of collapse led by lf mode decreases with the increase of the length of the nose cap the area of stress concentration region in the head decreases with the increase of pu foam density von mises stress distribution results of the wif mode show that the stress concentration regions are almost the half area of the nose cap in most cases in consideration of the great contribution to the lateral expansion of the nose cap wif mode plays the most significant role in the final complete collapse of the nose cap wd mode only appears in the cases of nose cap 4 and 5 it seems that the existence of wd mode is related to the length of the nose cap a non dimensional number l1 d2 is defined for the quantitative study the results reveal that wd mode only occurs when l 1 d 1 1 08 it should be noted that both of the wd and wif modes have caused the lateral expansion of the nose cap but they are caused by different physical mechanisms the former is the result of the superposition of the elastic plastic waves propagating through the nose cap the latter is the inevitable result of excessive deformation led by lateral stretching of the nose cap the results have suggested a possible link between the occurrence of the ef mode and the length of the nose cap after all the ef mode has not occurred in the case 19 20 23 24 and 25 von mises results show that the number of strips is inversely proportional to the density of pu foam the shorter the length of the nose cap the easier it is to observe the inversion and curling of these strips ic mode is a continuation of the ef mode the appearance of ic mode is consistent with that of ef mode in all the cases the nose cap has a thin walled structure with an ogival head and cylindrical body ic mode always occurs on the surface of the cylindrical body it is found that a longitudinal penetrating crack can lead to the final destruction of the remaining structure of the nose cap thus we defined the moment that a longitudinal penetrating crack occurs as the initial occurrence time of the cd mode the ideal outcome is the complete disintegrated cd mode of the nose cap however the complete disintegration of the nose cap has characteristics of randomness from the von mises stress distribution results in all nose cap 2 cases the tail structure of the nose cap has failed to completely collapse it is noted that the failure patterns of the nose cap are similar to that of the composite tubes under axial compression tests conducted by zhang et al 2018 and sun et al 2018 especially the ic mode as shown in fig 9 in the axial and oblique loading experiments of the cfrp tube conducted by sun et al chang 1995 strips led by matrix cracks move along the longitudinal direction progressively curling until the damage of tube the generation and evolution of strips in the ic modes show apparent similarity to that in axial compression tests of composite tubes fig 10 shows the structural diagram of the nose cap the nose cap shell can be divided into three parts the ogival head of the cap the tail part with a cylindrical thin walled structure and the middle part which connects the two parts the red blue and green rectangle dotted line boxes represent the head middle and tail regions of the nose cap we use the acronyms hp mp and tp to denote the three parts lf wd wif ef ic and cd modes are the simulation results of the structural model in fig 10a according to our calculations tp has little contribution to the load reducing performance of the buffer the function of tp is to enable the nose cap to be fixed to the projectile body the wedging in forces imposed by foam and projectile are only acting on the hp and mp of the nose cap hence the von mises stress distribution results of tp have been hidden in the post processing fig 10b leaving that of hp and mp for further study the cd mode in figs 7h and 8 represents the complete disintegration of only hp and mp of the nose cap as shown in fig 10b while cd mode refers to that of the entire structure of the nose cap as shown in fig 10a 3 2 modes classification and load reducing evaluation fig 11 shows the failure mode classification for the nose cap during the water entry process a vertical axis is a non dimensional number t t c t represents the beginning time of the failure mode while t c is our numerical calculation time t c 8 ms in the present work the horizontal axis is the non dimensional number l1 d2 the scatters represent the failure modes observed in the crushing process while colored lines represent different pu foam cases lf mode occurs at the moment when the ogival head touches the air water surface wif mode is following the lf mode in all the cases to study the wif mode quantitatively groups of sensors are set along the longitudinal direction in the outer surface of the nose cap the criterion for determining the occurrence of the wif mode is that more than half of the sensors have a displacement greater than 0 1 mm this criterion is also applied for the ef mode and wd mode the vertical coordinate of scatters in fig 11 represents the beginning time of the failure mode it is found that when l1 d2 0 92 the beginning time of the wif mode in pu100 pu200 pu350 and pu450 cases depend on l1 d2 the longer the length of the nose cap the later wif mode appears for the nose cap 1 t t c of the cd mode is increasing with the increase of ρ p u in other words a higher pu foam density will delay the occurrence of the complete disintegration of the nose cap case 4 and 5 show that the nose cap cannot be completely broken down when ρ p u 350 kg m 3 which has been against our initial design of the buffer after all one of our requirements for the buffer is that the entire structure of the nose cap must be able to fully decompose during the crushing process however the occurrence of cd mode has distinct randomness if we ignore the results of the tail part tp of the nose cap it is found that t t c of complete disintegration of the remaining structure follows a certain rule for nose cap 1 t t c of the cd mode has firstly decreased then increasing with the increase of pu foam density nose caps 2 5 also have a similar law for nose caps 1 3 the lowest t t c appears in the pu100 foam case which means that the hp and mp of the nose cap will completely collapse in the shortest time when the material of the damper is pu100 foam fig 12 shows the time history of t t c of the cd mode the results of five different pu foams reveal that t t c of the cd mode increases with the increase of the length of the nose cap except case 7 marked by red rectangular boxes in figs 11 and 12 t t c of the cd mode in case 7 is much lower than it in a lower pu foam density case simultaneously the wif mode of case 7 occurs dramatically later than that of other cases before the occurrence of the wif mode it is the lf mode that dominants the crushing process during this time the tip of the nose cap and the foam front collapse layer by layer successively the contact area between water and the nose cap increased with time resulting in a greater resultant force from water on the nose cap thus it is easier for the nose cap to be broken under the great impact loads from water and the wedging in force imposed by pu foam the delay of the wif mode has accelerated the disintegration of the nose cap to a certain extent in the pu40 and pu100 cases the length of the nose cap only has a limited effect on t t c of the cd mode when l1 d2 0 92 whereas t t c of the cd mode increases exponentially with the increase of the length of the nose cap when l1 d2 0 92 when the density of pu foam is great than 200 kg m3 t t c of the cd mode increases rapidly with the increase of the length of the nose cap when l1 d2 0 92 whereas the nose caps have failed to break down in our numerical calculation time when l1 d2 0 92 according to our design standards for the buffer pu200 pu350 and pu450 are not fit for the material of the damper in the case that l1 d2 0 92 it should be noted that t t c of the cd mode in all pu40 foam cases is larger than it in pu100 ones it is the weaker wedging in force imposed by the foam that has delayed the complete disintegration of the nose cap the strength and stiffness of the pu40 foam are one or two orders of magnitude lower than pu100 and other pu foams in addition pu40 foam material has a lower poisson ratio among the five different pu foams a much lower strength means the pu foam has entirely collapsed under a very high impact loading before it applies an effective wedging in force to the inner face of the nose cap a lower poisson ratio means a weaker lateral expansion of the structure when the foam is compressed in the longitudinal direction by both the water and the projectile front both of the two factors have led to a larger t t c of the cd mode in the pu40 foam case 3 3 load reducing evaluation fig 13 plots the fsi pressure pressure between projectile front and water forces between buffer and water are not included time history curve of the characteristic element on the cavitator the black line represents the slamming pressure of the light projectile while other colored dot lines represent different pu foam cases 10 pressure sensors have been set in the central area in cavitator surface of the projectile the pressure values are the mean values of pressure captured by these sensors as shown in fig 13f only the front of the pu foam has been broken down in pu200 pu350 and pu450 cases for the nose cap 5 the remaining structure of the pu foam still exists preventing the head of the projectile from contact with water the buffer has failed to collapse even the projectile penetrates the water for 14 ms a similar situation also exists in other cases hence the value of the fsi pressure is zero in these cases the results of peak fsi pressures reveal the significant load reduction performance of the buffers it is found that the peak pressure decreases with the increase of the length of the nose cap which means the longer the length of the nose cap the better the load reducing performance moreover the peak fsi pressure decreases with the increase of pu foam density to estimate the load reducing performance of the buffer the load reducing ratio ϖ is defined by eq faltinsen et al 2000 12 ϖ p l p b p l 100 where p l represents the pressure peak of the light projectile 372 mpa p b represents the pressure peak of the projectile with buffer as illustrated in fig 14 a the results of fsi pressure indicate that pu200 foam is the best material for the damper among the 25 cases with a load reducing ratio of up to 51 nose cap 2 case 8 fig 14b plots the time curves of the peak fsi pressure for different cases t t c of peak fsi pressure increases with the increasing of the length of the nose cap the variation of the time curve for pu40 is similar to that for pu100 compared to pu40 and pu100 curves the time curve for pu200 rises much faster with the increase of pu foam density it will take much more time to reach the peak fsi pressure on one hand a higher density of pu foam material means a better load reduction performance of the buffer on the other hand the buffer cannot be completely broken down when the pu foam density is greater than 200 kg m3 both the load reducing performance and fragility should be taken into account when selecting foam materials for the damper 4 conclusions in this study a composite mitigation structure including the nose cap damper and connector has been designed for reducing the impact load of high speed water entry projectile pu foams of five different densities ranging from 40 kg m3 to 450 kg m3 have been used as the main energy absorbing materials a series of compression tests have been conducted to validate the constitutive model used in the simulation according to the results of fe simulation for the composite buffer we can draw the following conclusions 1 lf wif wd ef ic and cd failure modes have been found in the crushing process of the nose cap the appearance of wd is dependent on the length of the nose cap wd mode just occurs when l1 d2 1 08 but independent of the density of pu foams 2 the wedging in force imposed by pu foam is the key factor leading to the complete disintegration of the nose cap t t c of the wif mode is dependent on l1 d2 but independent on the density of pu foams if l1 d2 0 92 t t c of the wif mode is approaching a constant whereas if l1 d2 0 92 t t c of the wif mode is monotonically increasing with the increase of l1 d2 moreover the delay of the wif mode will accelerate the disintegration of the nose cap the tail part is not included 3 in the case that ρ p u 100 kg m 3 when l1 d2 0 92 t t c of the cd mode is nearly constant when l1 d2 0 92 t t c of the cd mode increases exponentially with the increase of the length of nose cap whereas if ρ p u 100 kg m 3 t t c of the cd mode is monotonically increasing with the increase of the length of the nose cap 4 the load reducing ratio ϖ strongly depends on the length of the nose cap and the density of pu foam taking into account the load reducing performance and destructibility of the nose cap pu200 foam is the best material for the damper among the 25 cases with a load reducing ratio of up to 51 credit authorship contribution statement yao li conceptualization methodology validation investigation software formal analysis writing original draft
