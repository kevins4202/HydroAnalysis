15030,the persistence of the artificial sweetener acesulfame potassium ace during wastewater treatment and subsequently in the aquatic environment has made it a widely used tracer of wastewater inputs to both surface water and groundwater however the recently observed biodegradation of ace during wastewater treatment has questioned the validity of this application in this study we assessed the use of ace not only as a marker of wastewater but also as a transient wastewater tracer that allows both the calculation of mixing ratios and travel times through the aquifer as well as the calibration of transient groundwater flow and mass transport models our analysis was based on data obtained in a nearly 8 year river water and groundwater sampling campaign along a confirmed wastewater receiving riverbank filtration site located close to a drinking water supply system we provide evidence that temperature controls ace concentration and thus its seasonal oscillation river water data showed that ace loads decreased from 1 5 4 mg s 1 in the cold season december to june t 10 c to 0 0 5 mg s 1 in the warm season july to november t 10 c this seasonal variability of 600 was detectable in the aquifer and preserved 3 km with ace concentrations oscillating between loq in the warm season up to 1 μg l 1 in the cold season the large seasonal variation in ace concentrations during wastewater treatment compared to the other sweeteners sucralose cyclamate and saccharin and chloride enables its use as a transient tracer of wastewater inflows and riverbank filtration in addition the arrival time of the ace concentration peak can be used to estimate groundwater flow velocity and mixing ratios thereby demonstrating its potential in the calibration of groundwater numerical models graphical

introduction environmental tracers are chemical compounds that exist naturally from geochemical water rock interactions or rainwater infiltration or are released into surface and groundwater systems through anthropogenic activity tracers have been exploited in assessments of the source trajectory and mixing dynamics of wastewater released into the environment gerber et al 2018 massmann et al 2008 mccance et al 2018 purtschert et al 2008 stoewer et al 2015 turnadge and smerdon 2014 the most useful environmental tracers can be detected at low concentration related to a specific source or process are considerably stable over the time of investigation or exhibit a fluctuating signal that can be related to the input pattern the potassium salt of acesulfame ace is 200 sweeter than sugar which together with its high temperature stability makes it one of the most widely used sugar substitutes whether in food cosmetics or medicines li et al 2021 lino et al 2008 since ace cannot be metabolized in the human body after ingestion it is excreted unchanged through the renal system renwick 1986 consequently most of the consumed ace finally ends up in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and septic systems from where it is discharged into the environment volz et al 1991 as ace is highly hydrophilic following its release from wwtps into streams it spreads easily through the aquatic environment and is frequently detected in surface water groundwater and even drinking water buerge et al 2009 gan et al 2013 scheurer et al 2011 2009 ace has been globally measured in wastewater effluents with

globally ii it is present in wastewater at concentrations well above the loq 0 01 μg l 1 buerge et al 2009 iii once in the aquifer it travels in the dissolved phase at the average groundwater velocity with no relevant losses by chemical or biological attenuation processes datel and hrabankova 2020 hwang et al 2019 roy and bickerton 2010 iv it is either absent or it is present at concentrations orders of magnitude lower in natural groundwater given its anthropogenic origin and v it can be easily analyzed with affordable techniques however more recent reports of its biodegradation during municipal wastewater treatment and via biotic processes have questioned its value as an environmental tracer e g castronovo et al 2017 huang et al 2021 hwang et al 2019 kahl et al 2018 kleinsteuber et al 2019 li et al 2020 van stempvoort et al 2020 buerge et al 2011 reported the dissipation of at least 60 of ace during aerobic incubation and tran et al 2014 the biodegradation of 21 of ace by nitrifying activated sludge burke et al 2014 demonstrated ace attenuation of almost 50 and the temperature dependence of the reaction as ace was eliminated at 20 c but not at 6 5 c castronovo et al 2017 reported ace biodegradation in german and swiss wwtps and the transformation of ace into sulfamic acid furthermore after studying nine german wwtps kahl et al 2018 concluded that ace removal efficiency is highly variable during the year with a clear seasonal pattern especially in small to medium wwtps without oxygen and temperature impediments where the temperature driven removal of ace plays an important role monthly median removal exceeded 95 from july to october november with 15 of the ace removed between january and april despite this seasonal removal van stempvoort et al 2020 demonstrated that the residual concentrations of ace in effluents and septic plumes are still sufficiently high to allow the use of ace as a tracer for identifying the presence or absence of wastewater in groundwater however the suitability of ace as a transient environmental tracer has yet to be determined as daily or weekly oscillations of a tracer are damped after a few meters of traveling through an aquifer brünjes et al 2016 tracers with seasonal oscillations are more suitable for large scale tracing molina giraldo et al 2011 environmental tracers whose concentrations exhibit large oscillations in their amplitude and duration have a broad range of applications herrera et al 2022a b massoudieh 2013 thiros et al 2021 in this study we assess the use of ace as a transient wastewater tracer our results show that due to its very high seasonal variability in the source water ace has several important advantages over other artificial sweeteners e g sucralose suc cyclamate cyc and saccharin sac the seasonal ace concentrations allow for the calculation of groundwater travel times mixing ratios the identification of wastewater sources and reducing uncertainties in groundwater flow and mass transport models moreover its use can improve investigations of riverbank filtration systems that can affect water quality in drinking water supply systems 2 materials and methods a river water and groundwater ace sampling campaign of nearly 8 years duration was carried out along a confirmed wastewater affected riverbank filtration site in addition the transport of ace through the aquifer was simulated in a groundwater flow and ace transport model described below 2 1 study area the investigation area is located in a pre alpine catchment in europe covering an area of 5 km2 it was extensively described in previous studies bichler et al 2014 2016 brünjes et al 2016 stoewer et al 2015 fig 1 in brief the site is characterized by a temperate climate with a long term annual mean precipitation of 1300 mm and a mean air temperature of 8 9 c the temperature follows a clear seasonal oscillation with a peak to peak amplitude of 18 c groundwater recharge estimated according to the fao guideline is between 25 and 65 of total rainfall allen et al 1998 the study area is composed of two fluvio glacial aquifers aquifer 1 and aquifer 2 converging at the confluence of the respective rivers rivers 1 and 2 and whose basements consist of impermeable tertiary rocks fig 1 the aquifers are largely unconfined or semiconfined and are composed of a heterogeneous matrix of gravel sand and clay the thickness of the quaternary sediments ranges from a few meters to 70 m with an average saturated thickness of 15 m and a maximum of 30 m see vertical profiles in fig 1 hydraulic conductivities estimated from pumping tests are in the range of 40 5200 m d 1 similar to other analogous sites theel et al 2020 water column pressure is continuously measured at 31 wells using data loggers the mean discharge of river 1 recorded at a gaging station located approximately 3 km upstream of the investigation area is 8 5 m3 s 1 the flood discharge with a return period of one year is 38 m3 s 1 part of the discharge of the river 1 is diverted by a hydraulic infrastructure channel that starts at the intersection between river 1 and the most upstream boundary of the study area leading to a constant discharge of 1 2 m3 s 1 downstream the diverted water is discharged outside the area of influence for the study area the average discharge of river 2 is 1 3 m3 s 1 in addition 4 km upstream of the study area river 1 receives the effluent of a wwtp at an average rate of 0 11 m3 s 1 brünjes et al 2016 the wwtp serves a population of 27 000 inhabitants the residence time of wastewater in the wwtp is 2 days 50 min pre treatment 26 h main treatment 16 h post treatment the wastewater contribution to river 1 leads to a wastewater load of 1 3 of the volumetric flow rate during average flow conditions the level of river 1 is always above the water table which favors riverbank infiltration from stretches identified in previous studies bichler et al 2016 and highlighted in red in fig 1 the infiltration rate was calculated in the range of 100 400 l s 1 as the difference between the river discharge measured by a doppler flow meter aquaprofiler m pro above and below the riverbank infiltration source close to the confluence of rivers 1 and 2 and 3250 m downstream of the riverbank infiltration source a drinking water supply system extracts an average of 1500 l s 1 the waterwork operates a horizontal drain that uses gravity to remove groundwater from the aquifer and then drives the water to the collector well the last 130 m of the horizontal drain is sealed three different water types at the investigation area can be differentiated based on an earlier study bichler et al 2016 regional recharge harder groundwater rgw bank filtration influenced softer groundwater bf and groundwater with a higher nacl content all three types belong to the calcium magnesium bicarbonate water type that is typical of waters in limestone dominated catchments appelo and postma 2005 hoehn and scholtis 2011 the rgw type characterized by high levels of mineralization tds 577 mg l 1 and a high chloride concentration 9 8 1 8 mg l 1 is not affected by riverbank infiltration bf water is a mixture of rgw and riverbank filtrate and is characterized by less mineralization tds 359 4 mg l 1 and a lower chloride concentration 7 5 1 4 mg l 1 based on mixing ratios of chloride and gadolinium the fraction of riverbank filtrate was estimated to be 76 100 in the infiltration area and 37 67 near the waterwork bichler et al 2016 ace concentrations in this earlier study ranged from loq up to 0 5 μg l 1 bichler et al 2016 water samples with a higher nacl concentration nacl type are restricted to aquifer 2 2 2 sample collection the artificial sweeteners ace suc cyc and sac and chloride were analyzed in the wastewater receiving river as weekly grab samples collected from may 1 2020 to december 17 2021 at three points r1 1 r1 2 and r1 3 in fig 1 this sampling procedure along three different points of the river provides evidence that due to short residence time 6 h and sampling in close vicinity to the wwtp relevant ace degradation in the river stretch of interest can be excluded even though long term ace sampling was not directly available for the wwtp influent effluent the anthropogenic origin of ace was demonstrated by brünjes et al 2016 groundwater ace concentrations were assessed every 2 weeks from march 10 2014 to december 15 2021 the horizontal drain d1 was sampled at its start and end points d1 a and d1 b respectively d1 a was reached using a vertical pipe equipped with a tap and d1 b directly from the collector well 2 3 laboratory analyzes the artificial sweeteners ace suc cyc and sac were analyzed following the method described in scheurer et al 2009 in brief samples were prepared using solid phase extraction and analyzed using liquid chromatography on an hplc system 1200 sl agilent technologies japan connected to an api 4000 q trap triple quadrupole mass spectrometer applied biosystems mds sciex instruments usa operated in negative electrospray ionization mode the loq achieved was 0 02 μg l 1 with a standard deviation of 0 004 μg l 1 chloride was analyzed by ion chromatography using a dionex ic system ic 1000 thermoscientific usa with a loq of 0 1 mg l 1 and a standard deviation of 0 05 mg l 1 2 4 numerical model a two dimensional 2d model encompassing the investigation area was established to simulate groundwater flow and ace transport from river 1 to the drinking water supply system the numerical model was set up in the finite element code feflow which allows the solving of equations describing groundwater flow and mass transport under saturated conditions diersch 2014 a summary of the main features of the model and its parameters is provided in table si 1 the feflow internal grid builder routine was applied to generate a numerical mesh consisting of 15 512 triangular elements and 7 944 nodes the simulation covered the period september 1 2020 to december 31 2021 with an automatic time step control scheme and a maximum time step of 1 day the simulation period was selected to allow the reproduction of ace propagation through the aquifer for more than one complete seasonal biodegradation cycle initial conditions for all hydraulic and transport variables were calculated in a previous steady state simulation representing the mean hydrogeological functioning of the system for the last decade 2012 2021 an initial spin up period of 2 months was considered sufficient for the simulation results to become independent of the initial conditions groundwater inflow through the upstream boundaries of aquifers 1 and 2 was simulated using a cauchy type boundary condition bc with a reference hydraulic head time series based on the levels measured in neighboring wells an ace concentration of 0 μg l 1 was set at these boundaries the downstream boundary was a cauchy type condition with a reference hydraulic head based on the levels measured at the closest monitoring well a free mass outflow bc was applied to this downstream boundary recharge by precipitation was set on the model based on data registered at the local weather station and considering the local infiltration rate the ace concentration in the recharge from precipitation was set to 0 μg l 1 riverbank filtration was reproduced through a well type bc for water flow and a cauchy type bc for ace mass based on the transient seasonal ace concentration measured in river water no flow and no mass flow conditions were applied to all remaining boundaries the horizontal drain collecting groundwater was represented by discrete 1d elements with high hydraulic conductivity at the end of the screened stretch of the drain a well bc was operational with the extraction flow measured using a flow meter the model was automatically calibrated against the hydraulic heads and ace concentrations using fepest which is the feflow integrated version of the model independent parameter estimation code pest doherty 2015 transmissivity specific storage and porosity were calibrated considering 183 pilot points for each of these parameters tikhonov singular value decomposition and svd assist were chosen for regularization by prior information subspace and super parameters respectively initial and preferred values of transmissivity were chosen by taking into account pumping test information and the real saturated thickness in each zone of the aquifer transfer rates associated with cauchy type bcs and the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities linking the two parameters by a ratio of 10 1 were also calibrated a python plugin developed with the integrated interface manager ifm enabled the calibration of well type bcs and the subsequent estimation of the infiltration rate from the riverbank infiltration source 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal oscillations of ace allows its use as transient tracer ace concentrations in the river showed a clear temperature linked seasonal oscillation with maximum concentrations in the range of 0 2 1 μg l 1 occurring between december and june cold season t 10 c and minimum concentrations of loq 0 1 μg l 1 between july and november warm season t 10 c fig 2 and table si 2 a temperature linked seasonal variation in ace concentration was confirmed by calculating the total ace load in river 1 eliminating dilution by elevated discharge ace loads were 1 5 4 mg s 1 during the cold season which were 600 above the loads of 0 0 5 mg s 1 measured during the warm season figs 2b and 3 none of the other sweeteners or chloride showed a clear seasonal oscillation in the river figs 3 4 and table si 2 excluding their use as transient tracers only the sweetener suc showed a slight seasonal oscillation but due to its concentration close to the loq and the small seasonal variability fig 4 it was not a suitable tracer at the scale of investigation a seasonal variability in riverine ace concentrations of 600 is far beyond that expected based on possible seasonal variations in sweetener consumption which in fact is expected to be quite stable over the year kahl et al 2018 lange et al 2012 or even slightly higher in summer li et al 2021 the effect of dilution by discharge over the year is more unpredictable and large variations would be limited to short periods such as the peak that occurred in january 2021 fig 2a the logarithmic correlation r2 0 69 between ace load and river water temperature after correcting the delay between the sampling date for the ace load calculation fig 2b and the temperature measurement fig 2c suggested a temperature control on the ace seasonal biodegradation fig 5 river water temperature was used as proxy for the temperature decay in the wwtp the correlation between river water temperature and wwtp temperature has been previously confirmed for other watersheds wilson and worrall 2021 kahl et al 2018 showed for nine wwtps in germany that ace degradation is strongly dependent on temperature and it is plausible to assume that this observation also applies to our test site the delay between the sampling date for the ace load calculation and the river water temperature was estimated by iteration at 34 days we hypothesize that this delay may be caused by the time it takes for the wastewater temperature to decrease since the sewer system is not affected by a temperature decrease as quickly as an open river and the time bacterial communities including community shifts need to adapt to the new temperature however additional studies and continuous temperature measurements in the river and wwtp would be required which were not available the r2 value can be considered satisfactory considering that many processes influence the measured data including river flow rate wwtp discharge and residence time and consumption pattern ace loads were calculated by daily averaging river flow rates which might add uncertainty to the calculations in addition the calculated daily per capita ace load of 0 8 0 8 mg resulting from the warm season calculated considering 27 000 inhabitants was more than one order of magnitude lower than the daily per capita loads reported for other central european countries e g switzerland 5 7 17 6 mg germany 5 8 12 7 mg austria 4 9 mg lange et al 2012 which indicated that an additional process was responsible for ace removal during the warm season this was supported by also calculating the daily per capita ace load during the cold season which was 8 8 3 mg an amount closely aligned with the loads reported for other central european countries although degradation rate calculations were not within the scope of this study the measured ace concentrations and loads suggest that removal rates within the wwtp were similar to the rates estimated by kahl et al 2018 for other wwtps in germany i e close to 0 during the cold period and close to 100 during the warm period temperature control in ace biodegradation can also explain why ace sampling conducted in the same study area only during the warm season bichler et al 2016 underestimated annual ace inputs to the river although this seasonal oscillation may be less prominent in wastewaters from large wwtps in which both the temperature and available oxygen are controlled kahl et al 2018 this pattern can probably be globally extrapolated to most surface waters receiving wastewater contributions from small and medium wwtps with a significant temperature seasonality especially because the ace concentration in the study area was lower than that measured in other rivers worldwide belton et al 2020 probably due to a population of only 27 000 inhabitants 3 2 ace seasonal oscillation propagates from surface to groundwater the ace concentrations measured in groundwater at d1 a and d1 b fig 1 demonstrated the transfer and persistence of the seasonal oscillation of ace into and through the aquifer fig 6 the ace concentration in groundwater sampled at the drinking water supply system oscillated between loq in the warm season and up to 0 15 μg l 1 in the cold season this seasonal change was propagated by the river water that infiltrated 3250 m upstream of the drinking water supply system indicating a sufficiently conservative behavior through the aquifer within the timeframe of observation and demonstrating that the ace seasonal oscillation can be tracked at distances of several kilometers the similarity of the ace concentrations measured at d1 a and d1 b was consistent with a preferential flow from d1 a to d1 b along the horizontal drain the small reduction in the ace concentration from d1 a to d1 b can be explained by contributions of external water to the drain along this stretch which is screened along most of its length the ace peak in groundwater at d1 a was detected in most years in march around 2 months after the detection in river water fig 6 this finding is analyzed in detail in the following section 3 3 ace can be used to elucidate riverbank filtration and to calibrate numerical groundwater flow and transport models the numerical model reproduced the propagation of the seasonal oscillation in the ace concentration for more than one year the simulated riverbank filtrate propagated along the central eastern part of aquifer 1 from the riverbank infiltration source to the drinking water supply system fig 7 the groundwater ace concentration close to the infiltration area ranged between loq in the warm session and 0 79 μg l 1 in the cold season the similar concentrations in river water and groundwater indicated a very good hydraulic connection at that stretch of the river the model estimated an infiltration rate of 369 l s 1 consistent with the measured differential discharge up and downstream of the riverbank infiltration source at both sampling points of the drinking water supply system d1 a and d1 b the ace concentration ranged from a minimum close to the loq in the warm season to a maximum of almost 0 15 μg l 1 in the cold season fig 8 the alignment of the ace concentrations at the two sampling points indicated the fast flow along the drain riverbank filtrate mixing ratios 80 were calculated in the area closest to the infiltration source fig 9 consistent with the mixing ratios of 76 100 estimated by bichler et al 2016 based on chloride and gadolinium the mixing ratios were reduced to 27 and 22 at d1 a and d1 b respectively the good fit of the non reactive model to the observed ace concentrations and the apparent persistence of the seasonal oscillation 3 km downstream of the riverbank infiltration source highlight the largely conservative behavior of ace in the aquifer as suggested in previous studies of other aquifers e g buerge et al 2009 engelhardt et al 2014a 2013 storck et al 2016 therefore the attenuation of the ace concentration from river to groundwater observation points can be explained by dilution e g liu et al 2014 despite the good connection between d1 a and d1 b mixture along the open drain resulted in a delay of 3 days in the arrival of the ace concentration peak from d1 a to d1 b specifically the average travel time of ace from the riverbank infiltration source to the drinking water supply system was 64 days at d1 a and 67 days at d1 b fig 8b based on the peak concentration with a range between 40 and 90 days the transient behavior of ace allows its use not only as a wastewater marker but also as a transient tracer in the identification of riverbank infiltration sources and in the calculation of travel times and mixing ratios of multiple sources through the aquifer a decrease in the river discharge for a period of more than one month such as observed for river 1 in january 2021 will also contribute to an oscillation of the ace concentration but only if the decrease occurs during the cold season when the ace concentration is high 4 conclusions and implications in this study the temperature dependent river concentration of ace was investigated with respect to its applicability as a transient wastewater tracer the seasonal oscillation in ace concentration was used to optimize a numerical groundwater flow model of a riverbank filtration site affected by wastewater inputs thus contributing both to the prediction of flow path directions and to the calculation of mixing ratios and travel times ace loads in this river system vary seasonally by 600 as a result of the suspected increased in ace degradation during wastewater treatment in the warm season this large variability demonstrated the advantage of ace over other sweeteners suc cyc and sac and chloride as a transient tracer which did not exhibit significant seasonal variability it is therefore important to carefully plan ace sampling campaigns since ace sampling conducted only during the warm season might completely miss ace inputs leading to the underestimation of annual loads the data presented herein show that a minimum of one year of sampling is needed to understand seasonal patterns of wastewater borne ace inputs into rivers and the influence of riverbank filtration on aquifers despite the strong temperature dependence of the ace concentration in river water our modeling indicated ace behaved as a fairly conservative tracer in the aquifer although ace concentrations in the study area were in the lower range of those described globally the seasonal oscillation was still transferred from the river to the aquifer and due to the high groundwater flow velocity in this area preserved over transport distances 3 km which supports its use as a wastewater tracer ace s seasonal oscillation was useful for calculating river water groundwater mixing ratios and travel times of 2 months the range of distances and travel times that can be assessed with ace will depend on the local groundwater temperature chemistry and hydraulic parameters therefore the monitoring scale may need to be adjusted accordingly in summary the use of ace as tracer may facilitate investigations of wastewater contamination in urban areas and riverbank filtration systems subjected to climates with seasonal temperature oscillation moreover as a transient wastewater tracer ace offers new approaches to better calculate groundwater travel times calibrate numerical models and identify wastewater infiltration points and mixing ratios declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

2017 reported ace biodegradation in german and swiss wwtps and the transformation of ace into sulfamic acid furthermore after studying nine german wwtps kahl et al 2018 concluded that ace removal efficiency is highly variable during the year with a clear seasonal pattern especially in small to medium wwtps without oxygen and temperature impediments where the temperature driven removal of ace plays an important role monthly median removal exceeded 95 from july to october november with 15 of the ace removed between january and april despite this seasonal removal van stempvoort et al 2020 demonstrated that the residual concentrations of ace in effluents and septic plumes are still sufficiently high to allow the use of ace as a tracer for identifying the presence or absence of wastewater in groundwater however the suitability of ace as a transient environmental tracer has yet to be determined as daily or weekly oscillations of a tracer are damped after a few meters of traveling through an aquifer brünjes et al 2016 tracers with seasonal oscillations are more suitable for large scale tracing molina giraldo et al 2011 environmental tracers whose concentrations exhibit large oscillations in their amplitude and duration have a broad range of applications herrera et al 2022a b massoudieh 2013 thiros et al 2021 in this study we assess the use of ace as a transient wastewater tracer our results show that due to its very high seasonal variability in the source water ace has several important advantages over other artificial sweeteners e g sucralose suc cyclamate cyc and saccharin sac the seasonal ace concentrations allow for the calculation of groundwater travel times mixing ratios the identification of wastewater sources and reducing uncertainties in groundwater flow and mass transport models moreover its use can improve investigations of riverbank filtration systems that can affect water quality in drinking water supply systems 2 materials and methods a river water and groundwater ace sampling campaign of nearly 8 years duration was carried out along a confirmed wastewater affected riverbank filtration site in addition the transport of ace through the aquifer was simulated in a groundwater flow and ace transport model described below 2 1 study area the investigation area is located in a pre alpine catchment in europe covering an area of 5 km2 it was extensively described in previous studies bichler et al 2014 2016 brünjes et al 2016 stoewer et al 2015 fig 1 in brief the site is characterized by a temperate climate with a long term annual mean precipitation of 1300 mm and a mean air temperature of 8 9 c the temperature follows a clear seasonal oscillation with a peak to peak amplitude of 18 c groundwater recharge estimated according to the fao guideline is between 25 and 65 of total rainfall allen et al 1998 the study area is composed of two fluvio glacial aquifers aquifer 1 and aquifer 2 converging at the confluence of the respective rivers rivers 1 and 2 and whose basements consist of impermeable tertiary rocks fig 1 the aquifers are largely unconfined or semiconfined and are composed of a heterogeneous matrix of gravel sand and clay the thickness of the quaternary sediments ranges from a few meters to 70 m with an average saturated thickness of 15 m and a maximum of 30 m see vertical profiles in fig 1 hydraulic conductivities estimated from pumping tests are in the range of 40 5200 m d 1 similar to other analogous sites theel et al 2020 water column pressure is continuously measured at 31 wells using data loggers the mean discharge of river 1 recorded at a gaging station located approximately 3 km upstream of the investigation area is 8 5 m3 s 1 the flood discharge with a return period of one year is 38 m3 s 1 part of the discharge of the river 1 is diverted by a hydraulic infrastructure channel that starts at the intersection between river 1 and the most upstream boundary of the study area leading to a constant discharge of 1 2 m3 s 1 downstream the diverted water is discharged outside the area of influence for the study area the average discharge of river 2 is 1 3 m3 s 1 in addition 4 km upstream of the study area river 1 receives the effluent of a wwtp at an average rate of 0 11 m3 s 1 brünjes et al 2016 the wwtp serves a population of 27 000 inhabitants the residence time of wastewater in the wwtp is 2 days 50 min pre treatment 26 h main treatment 16 h post treatment the wastewater contribution to river 1 leads to a wastewater load of 1 3 of the volumetric flow rate during average flow conditions the level of river 1 is always above the water table which favors riverbank infiltration from stretches identified in previous studies bichler et al 2016 and highlighted in red in fig 1 the infiltration rate was calculated in the range of 100 400 l s 1 as the difference between the river discharge measured by a doppler flow meter aquaprofiler m pro above and below the riverbank infiltration source close to the confluence of rivers 1 and 2 and 3250 m downstream of the riverbank infiltration source a drinking water supply system extracts an average of 1500 l s 1 the waterwork operates a horizontal drain that uses gravity to remove groundwater from the aquifer and then drives the water to the collector well the last 130 m of the horizontal drain is sealed three different water types at the investigation area can be differentiated based on an earlier study bichler et al 2016 regional recharge harder groundwater rgw bank filtration influenced softer groundwater bf and groundwater with a higher nacl content all three types belong to the calcium magnesium bicarbonate water type that is typical of waters in limestone dominated catchments appelo and postma 2005 hoehn and scholtis 2011 the rgw type characterized by high levels of mineralization tds 577 mg l 1 and a high chloride concentration 9 8 1 8 mg l 1 is not affected by riverbank infiltration bf water is a mixture of rgw and riverbank filtrate and is characterized by less mineralization tds 359 4 mg l 1 and a lower chloride concentration 7 5 1 4 mg l 1 based on mixing ratios of chloride and gadolinium the fraction of riverbank filtrate was estimated to be 76 100 in the infiltration area and 37 67 near the waterwork bichler et al 2016 ace concentrations in this earlier study ranged from loq up to 0 5 μg l 1 bichler et al 2016 water samples with a higher nacl concentration nacl type are restricted to aquifer 2 2 2 sample collection the artificial sweeteners ace suc cyc and sac and chloride were analyzed in the wastewater receiving river as weekly grab samples collected from may 1 2020 to december 17 2021 at three points r1 1 r1 2 and r1 3 in fig 1 this sampling procedure along three different points of the river provides evidence that due to short residence time 6 h and sampling in close vicinity to the wwtp relevant ace degradation in the river stretch of interest can be excluded even though long term ace sampling was not directly available for the wwtp influent effluent the anthropogenic origin of ace was demonstrated by brünjes et al 2016 groundwater ace concentrations were assessed every 2 weeks from march 10 2014 to december 15 2021 the horizontal drain d1 was sampled at its start and end points d1 a and d1 b respectively d1 a was reached using a vertical pipe equipped with a tap and d1 b directly from the collector well 2 3 laboratory analyzes the artificial sweeteners ace suc cyc and sac were analyzed following the method described in scheurer et al 2009 in brief samples were prepared using solid phase extraction and analyzed using liquid chromatography on an hplc system 1200 sl agilent technologies japan connected to an api 4000 q trap triple quadrupole mass spectrometer applied biosystems mds sciex instruments usa operated in negative electrospray ionization mode the loq achieved was 0 02 μg l 1 with a standard deviation of 0 004 μg l 1 chloride was analyzed by ion chromatography using a dionex ic system ic 1000 thermoscientific usa with a loq of 0 1 mg l 1 and a standard deviation of 0 05 mg l 1 2 4 numerical model a two dimensional 2d model encompassing the investigation area was established to simulate groundwater flow and ace transport from river 1 to the drinking water supply system the numerical model was set up in the finite element code feflow which allows the solving of equations describing groundwater flow and mass transport under saturated conditions diersch 2014 a summary of the main features of the model and its parameters is provided in table si 1 the feflow internal grid builder routine was applied to generate a numerical mesh consisting of 15 512 triangular elements and 7 944 nodes the simulation covered the period september 1 2020 to december 31 2021 with an automatic time step control scheme and a maximum time step of 1 day the simulation period was selected to allow the reproduction of ace propagation through the aquifer for more than one complete seasonal biodegradation cycle initial conditions for all hydraulic and transport variables were calculated in a previous steady state simulation representing the mean hydrogeological functioning of the system for the last decade 2012 2021 an initial spin up period of 2 months was considered sufficient for the simulation results to become independent of the initial conditions groundwater inflow through the upstream boundaries of aquifers 1 and 2 was simulated using a cauchy type boundary condition bc with a reference hydraulic head time series based on the levels measured in neighboring wells an ace concentration of 0 μg l 1 was set at these boundaries the downstream boundary was a cauchy type condition with a reference hydraulic head based on the levels measured at the closest monitoring well a free mass outflow bc was applied to this downstream boundary recharge by precipitation was set on the model based on data registered at the local weather station and considering the local infiltration rate the ace concentration in the recharge from precipitation was set to 0 μg l 1 riverbank filtration was reproduced through a well type bc for water flow and a cauchy type bc for ace mass based on the transient seasonal ace concentration measured in river water no flow and no mass flow conditions were applied to all remaining boundaries the horizontal drain collecting groundwater was represented by discrete 1d elements with high hydraulic conductivity at the end of the screened stretch of the drain a well bc was operational with the extraction flow measured using a flow meter the model was automatically calibrated against the hydraulic heads and ace concentrations using fepest which is the feflow integrated version of the model independent parameter estimation code pest doherty 2015 transmissivity specific storage and porosity were calibrated considering 183 pilot points for each of these parameters tikhonov singular value decomposition and svd assist were chosen for regularization by prior information subspace and super parameters respectively initial and preferred values of transmissivity were chosen by taking into account pumping test information and the real saturated thickness in each zone of the aquifer transfer rates associated with cauchy type bcs and the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities linking the two parameters by a ratio of 10 1 were also calibrated a python plugin developed with the integrated interface manager ifm enabled the calibration of well type bcs and the subsequent estimation of the infiltration rate from the riverbank infiltration source 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal oscillations of ace allows its use as transient tracer ace concentrations in the river showed a clear temperature linked seasonal oscillation with maximum concentrations in the range of 0 2 1 μg l 1 occurring between december and june cold season t 10 c and minimum concentrations of loq 0 1 μg l 1 between july and november warm season t 10 c fig 2 and table si 2 a temperature linked seasonal variation in ace concentration was confirmed by calculating the total ace load in river 1 eliminating dilution by elevated discharge ace loads were 1 5 4 mg s 1 during the cold season which were 600 above the loads of 0 0 5 mg s 1 measured during the warm season figs 2b and 3 none of the other sweeteners or chloride showed a clear seasonal oscillation in the river figs 3 4 and table si 2 excluding their use as transient tracers only the sweetener suc showed a slight seasonal oscillation but due to its concentration close to the loq and the small seasonal variability fig 4 it was not a suitable tracer at the scale of investigation a seasonal variability in riverine ace concentrations of 600 is far beyond that expected based on possible seasonal variations in sweetener consumption which in fact is expected to be quite stable over the year kahl et al 2018 lange et al 2012 or even slightly higher in summer li et al 2021 the effect of dilution by discharge over the year is more unpredictable and large variations would be limited to short periods such as the peak that occurred in january 2021 fig 2a the logarithmic correlation r2 0 69 between ace load and river water temperature after correcting the delay between the sampling date for the ace load calculation fig 2b and the temperature measurement fig 2c suggested a temperature control on the ace seasonal biodegradation fig 5 river water temperature was used as proxy for the temperature decay in the wwtp the correlation between river water temperature and wwtp temperature has been previously confirmed for other watersheds wilson and worrall 2021 kahl et al 2018 showed for nine wwtps in germany that ace degradation is strongly dependent on temperature and it is plausible to assume that this observation also applies to our test site the delay between the sampling date for the ace load calculation and the river water temperature was estimated by iteration at 34 days we hypothesize that this delay may be caused by the time it takes for the wastewater temperature to decrease since the sewer system is not affected by a temperature decrease as quickly as an open river and the time bacterial communities including community shifts need to adapt to the new temperature however additional studies and continuous temperature measurements in the river and wwtp would be required which were not available the r2 value can be considered satisfactory considering that many processes influence the measured data including river flow rate wwtp discharge and residence time and consumption pattern ace loads were calculated by daily averaging river flow rates which might add uncertainty to the calculations in addition the calculated daily per capita ace load of 0 8 0 8 mg resulting from the warm season calculated considering 27 000 inhabitants was more than one order of magnitude lower than the daily per capita loads reported for other central european countries e g switzerland 5 7 17 6 mg germany 5 8 12 7 mg austria 4 9 mg lange et al 2012 which indicated that an additional process was responsible for ace removal during the warm season this was supported by also calculating the daily per capita ace load during the cold season which was 8 8 3 mg an amount closely aligned with the loads reported for other central european countries although degradation rate calculations were not within the scope of this study the measured ace concentrations and loads suggest that removal rates within the wwtp were similar to the rates estimated by kahl et al 2018 for other wwtps in germany i e close to 0 during the cold period and close to 100 during the warm period temperature control in ace biodegradation can also explain why ace sampling conducted in the same study area only during the warm season bichler et al 2016 underestimated annual ace inputs to the river although this seasonal oscillation may be less prominent in wastewaters from large wwtps in which both the temperature and available oxygen are controlled kahl et al 2018 this pattern can probably be globally extrapolated to most surface waters receiving wastewater contributions from small and medium wwtps with a significant temperature seasonality especially because the ace concentration in the study area was lower than that measured in other rivers worldwide belton et al 2020 probably due to a population of only 27 000 inhabitants 3 2 ace seasonal oscillation propagates from surface to groundwater the ace concentrations measured in groundwater at d1 a and d1 b fig 1 demonstrated the transfer and persistence of the seasonal oscillation of ace into and through the aquifer fig 6 the ace concentration in groundwater sampled at the drinking water supply system oscillated between loq in the warm season and up to 0 15 μg l 1 in the cold season this seasonal change was propagated by the river water that infiltrated 3250 m upstream of the drinking water supply system indicating a sufficiently conservative behavior through the aquifer within the timeframe of observation and demonstrating that the ace seasonal oscillation can be tracked at distances of several kilometers the similarity of the ace concentrations measured at d1 a and d1 b was consistent with a preferential flow from d1 a to d1 b along the horizontal drain the small reduction in the ace concentration from d1 a to d1 b can be explained by contributions of external water to the drain along this stretch which is screened along most of its length the ace peak in groundwater at d1 a was detected in most years in march around 2 months after the detection in river water fig 6 this finding is analyzed in detail in the following section 3 3 ace can be used to elucidate riverbank filtration and to calibrate numerical groundwater flow and transport models the numerical model reproduced the propagation of the seasonal oscillation in the ace concentration for more than one year the simulated riverbank filtrate propagated along the central eastern part of aquifer 1 from the riverbank infiltration source to the drinking water supply system fig 7 the groundwater ace concentration close to the infiltration area ranged between loq in the warm session and 0 79 μg l 1 in the cold season the similar concentrations in river water and groundwater indicated a very good hydraulic connection at that stretch of the river the model estimated an infiltration rate of 369 l s 1 consistent with the measured differential discharge up and downstream of the riverbank infiltration source at both sampling points of the drinking water supply system d1 a and d1 b the ace concentration ranged from a minimum close to the loq in the warm season to a maximum of almost 0 15 μg l 1 in the cold season fig 8 the alignment of the ace concentrations at the two sampling points indicated the fast flow along the drain riverbank filtrate mixing ratios 80 were calculated in the area closest to the infiltration source fig 9 consistent with the mixing ratios of 76 100 estimated by bichler et al 2016 based on chloride and gadolinium the mixing ratios were reduced to 27 and 22 at d1 a and d1 b respectively the good fit of the non reactive model to the observed ace concentrations and the apparent persistence of the seasonal oscillation 3 km downstream of the riverbank infiltration source highlight the largely conservative behavior of ace in the aquifer as suggested in previous studies of other aquifers e g buerge et al 2009 engelhardt et al 2014a 2013 storck et al 2016 therefore the attenuation of the ace concentration from river to groundwater observation points can be explained by dilution e g liu et al 2014 despite the good connection between d1 a and d1 b mixture along the open drain resulted in a delay of 3 days in the arrival of the ace concentration peak from d1 a to d1 b specifically the average travel time of ace from the riverbank infiltration source to the drinking water supply system was 64 days at d1 a and 67 days at d1 b fig 8b based on the peak concentration with a range between 40 and 90 days the transient behavior of ace allows its use not only as a wastewater marker but also as a transient tracer in the identification of riverbank infiltration sources and in the calculation of travel times and mixing ratios of multiple sources through the aquifer a decrease in the river discharge for a period of more than one month such as observed for river 1 in january 2021 will also contribute to an oscillation of the ace concentration but only if the decrease occurs during the cold season when the ace concentration is high 4 conclusions and implications in this study the temperature dependent river concentration of ace was investigated with respect to its applicability as a transient wastewater tracer the seasonal oscillation in ace concentration was used to optimize a numerical groundwater flow model of a riverbank filtration site affected by wastewater inputs thus contributing both to the prediction of flow path directions and to the calculation of mixing ratios and travel times ace loads in this river system vary seasonally by 600 as a result of the suspected increased in ace degradation during wastewater treatment in the warm season this large variability demonstrated the advantage of ace over other sweeteners suc cyc and sac and chloride as a transient tracer which did not exhibit significant seasonal variability it is therefore important to carefully plan ace sampling campaigns since ace sampling conducted only during the warm season might completely miss ace inputs leading to the underestimation of annual loads the data presented herein show that a minimum of one year of sampling is needed to understand seasonal patterns of wastewater borne ace inputs into rivers and the influence of riverbank filtration on aquifers despite the strong temperature dependence of the ace concentration in river water our modeling indicated ace behaved as a fairly conservative tracer in the aquifer although ace concentrations in the study area were in the lower range of those described globally the seasonal oscillation was still transferred from the river to the aquifer and due to the high groundwater flow velocity in this area preserved over transport distances 3 km which supports its use as a wastewater tracer ace s seasonal oscillation was useful for calculating river water groundwater mixing ratios and travel times of 2 months the range of distances and travel times that can be assessed with ace will depend on the local groundwater temperature chemistry and hydraulic parameters therefore the monitoring scale may need to be adjusted accordingly in summary the use of ace as tracer may facilitate investigations of wastewater contamination in urban areas and riverbank filtration systems subjected to climates with seasonal temperature oscillation moreover as a transient wastewater tracer ace offers new approaches to better calculate groundwater travel times calibrate numerical models and identify wastewater infiltration points and mixing ratios declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15031,dissolved organic matter dom is an essential component of environmental systems it usually originates from two end members including allochthonous and autochthonous sources previously links have been established between dom origins sources and its biogeochemical reactivities however the influence of changes in dom characteristics driven by end member mixing on dom biogeochemical reactivities has not been clarified in this study we investigated variations of dom reactivities responding to the dynamics of dom characteristics induced by different mixing ratios of two dom end members derived from humic acid ha and algae respectively four biogeochemical reactivities of dom were evaluated including biodegradation oh production photodegradation and redox capacity results showed that the variations of dom characteristics due to the two end members mixing significantly impact its biogeochemical reactivities however not all spectral parameters and reactivities followed the conservative mixing behavior in contrast to reactivities of oh production and redox capacity mixed samples showed apparent deviations from conservative linear relationships in biodegradation and photodegradation due to the interaction between the two end members regarding the role of dom properties influencing reactivity changes peak a and m were recognized as the most stable parameters however peak c and suva254 were identified as the most vital contributors for explaining dom reactivity variations these findings suggest that a general model for describing the dynamic relationship between dom source and reactivity cannot be proposed thus the dynamics of dom reactivity in diverse ecosystems cannot be estimated simply by the plus or minus of the reactivity from individual end member the effect of end member mixing should be evaluated in a given reactivity instead of generalization this study provides important insights for further understanding the dynamics of dom s environmental role in different ecosystems influenced by variations of source inputs in future more field investigations are needed to further verify our findings in this study especially in the scenario of end member

data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an essential component of natural organic matter in aquatic systems including inland freshwater and marine systems dissolved organic matter dom is a complex and heterogeneous mixture of natural organic components typically it is composed of two end members originating from terrigenous i e allochthonous and aquatic i e autochthonous sources derrien et al 2018 lee et al 2019a the characteristics of dom are influenced by these sources and is often described by a binary mixture model of the two end members i e allochthonous versus autochthonous perdue and koprivnjak 2007 carter et al 2012 toming et al 2013 chen et al 2016 connolly et al 2021 furthermore the composition and structures of dom components from the two end members show distinct differences mcknight et al 2001 toming et al 2013 liu et al 2020 tak et al 2021 for instance allochthonous dom usually originates mainly from the runoff or leaching of organic matter from soils and higher plants in the terrestrial system and is consequently more humified aromatic and bio refractory derrien et al 2015 2018 in contrast autochthonous dom has higher protein and aliphatic components which are mainly derived from aquatic biotas such as algae bacteria plankton and macrophytes derrien et al 2017 2018 thus it is essential to investigate the dom sources vary within the dynamics of end member ratio for further understanding dom characteristics in diverse ecosystems regarding the crucial role of dom in ecosystems it is indispensable in the carbon cycle relevant to climate change tranvik et al 2018 berggren et al 2022 it also has a crucial impact on the environmental fate of contaminants such as trace heavy metals aiken et al 2011 bravo et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 and persistent organic compounds batista et al 2016 in aquatic systems the most recognized biogeochemical processes driven by dom include photo and biodegradation cory and kling 2018 free radical production page et al 2014 berg et al 2019 redox capacity aeschbacher et al 2012 binding capacity with metal elements wang et al 2022 and selective adsorption on surfaces of minerals lv et al 2016 previously many studies have established the links between dom origins sources and its biogeochemical reactivities aiken et al 2011 jiang et al 2018 fu et al 2021 for example photo and biodegradation of terrestrial dom involve the production of greenhouse gasses e g co2 and ch4 which are essential reaction mechanisms in climate feedback sulzberger and durisch kaiser 2009 cory and kaplan 2012 sleighter et al 2014 studies have reported that elevated terrestrial dom inputs likely enhance dissolved ch4 levels in lakes zhou et al 2018 and aquatic co2 emissions lapierre et al 2013 furthermore terrestrial dominant dom inhibited neurotoxic methylmercury mehg formation jiang et al 2018 but showed a greater affinity for binding hg ii wang et al 2022 further terrestrial dom elevated mehg retention in the water increasing the mehg exposure risk to biota for bioaccumulation jonsson et al 2017 in contrast autochthonous dom may enhance mehg production in an anoxic environment due to its higher biodegradability schartup et al 2015 bravo et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 lei et al 2021 thus the characteristics of dom and its relevant biogeochemical reactivities depend heavily on whether they originate from terrestrial soil and plant material or from in situ sources in water environments leenheer and croue 2003 most previous studies have established the relationship between dom sources e g terrestrial and their biogeochemical reactivities from field investigations and observed the correlations in other words correlation analysis revealed the effect of dom origin in its ecological role in a given environment however validation of such a relationship in a laboratory environment remains scarce tak et al 2021 notably variations in environmental conditions in specific spatial and temporal scales may further alter the observed relationships between dom origins and reactivities which are not comparable for example in the freshwater estuary ocean continuum or lake occurring eutrophication the dom characteristics could be changed due to variations in two end member inputs as a result predicting the corresponding changes in dom reactivity remains a challenge thus a major knowledge gap is that there has been little focus on quantitatively source based changes in dom characteristics to understand the responses of dom s ecological role to environmental changes in particular clarifying the role of the mixing ratio of two end members in the dynamics of dom property could be helpful to further explain the relationship between dom characteristics and its reactivity observed in field investigations maizel et al 2017 bravo et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 lee et al 2019a 2019b based on the above concerns we hypothesize that the dom reactivity co varies with the fluctations of two end member mixing ratios in a conservative behavior this raises an important question that still needs to be verified once the proportions of two end members are identified in a given dom sample can the biogeochemical reactivity be linearly estimated based on the independent performance of each end member reactivity therefore this study focused on the changes in dom biogeochemical reactivities influenced by varying contributions from two typical end members humic acid ha and algae dissolved organic matter adom selected to represent allochthonous and autochthonous dom respectively these two compounds were mixed in different fraction ratios such as 80 terrestrial versus 20 algae fractions to further evaluate the reactivity of the artificially mixed samples by using the end member mixing model the aims of this study were to 1 examine the changing pattern of dom characteristics with varying mixing ratios of the two typical end members 2 track the changes in selected biogeochemical reactivities within different end member mixing ratios and 3 evaluate the relationship of the dom characteristic and reactivities during the two end member mixings the key parameters of dom property in the relationship were also identified this study provides some useful findings to help further understand the relationship between dom biogeochemical reactivity and its sources in diverse ecosystems especially considering the scenarios of end member mixing 2 materials and methods 2 1 dom sample preparation to validate the relationship between dom sources and reactivities two typical organic matter samples including commercial ha and algae in a natural lake were selected as the two end members mixed samples were prepared by mixing the two end member samples in different ratios the ha sample is dominated by terrestrial organic matter purchased from adamas adamas reagent co ltd shanghai china solid ha powder was dissolved in milli q water 18 2 ω cm by 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl to adjust to being neutral ph 7 subsequently the ha solution was re filtered by a polyethersulfone pes syringe membrane 0 22 µm algae were harvested during an algal bloom event in august of 2019 from chaohu lake china s fifth largest freshwater lake 31 42 48 94 n 117 21 48 37 e according to methods described in the supporting information text s1 and lei et al 2021 briefly algae biomass was harvested by a 112 µm mesh size plankton net and transported to the laboratory in a thermal protective cooler after further rinsing and freeze drying samples were ground to a powder 0 2 mm subsequently adom was extracted with deionized water milli q millipore usa w v of 1 100 in a horizontal shaker 200 rpm hy 2a changzhou ronghua instrument ltd china for 16 h under dark conditions at 25 c jiang et al 2017 the extracts were then centrifuged for 30 min at 4000 rpm and filtered through a 0 22 µm pes syringe membrane to eliminate potential particles and microbial interference subsequently the ha and adom stock solutions were diluted to 25 mg l 1 dom as the working solution in addition to further verify the contrasting characteristics of the two end member organic samples we used nuclear magnetic resonance nmr techniques fig s1 text s2 the 13c nmr spectra result showed that the ha sample had relatively greater and discriminable signals of alkyl a and o alkyl carbon o a and carbonyl carbon the ratio of alkyl to o alkyl carbon a o a of the ha sample is located in the typical a o a ratio range of soil organic matter som i e 0 2 1 1 li et al 2019 from different ecosystems meanwhile to prepare the mixing dom samples within various end member mixing ratios the two contrasting types of dom working solutions were mixed at a series of fixed ratios between terrestrial allochthonous f a and aquatic fraction autochthonous f b origins namely 100 0 80 20 60 40 40 60 20 80 and 0 100 corresponding to ha m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 and adom respectively table s1 all dom working solutions were adjusted to be neutral ph 7 to avoid ph interference on all reactivity assays 2 2 uv vis absorption and fluorescence spectra the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of the end member working solution was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the optical properties of the dom were analyzed using an aqualog absorption fluorescence spectrometer horiba japan as described previously jiang et al 2018 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 l mg c 1 m 1 was calculated to estimate the aromaticity and humification of dom weishaar et al 2003 the spectral slope s r is inversely proportional to the molecular weight helms et al 2008 the absorption coefficient a 355 was chosen as a surrogate for the abundance of chromophoric the dom cdom osbum et al 2016 in addition the fluorescence excitation emission eem spectra were measured internal filtering effects ife were minimized by diluting to doc 10 mg l 1 before measuring the spectra including absorption and fluorescence zhou et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 additionally ife was automatically corrected using aqualog eems data processing software and were double checked using originpro 2017 jiang et al 2018 the classic peak pick approach coble et al 2014 was used to identify fluorescence peaks rather than parallel factor analysis parafac because of the limited number of samples murphy et al 2013 in this study five fluorescent components including three humic like components expressed by peaks a c and m and two protein like components represented by peaks t and b were determined by typical dom eem spectra which could be interpreted according to coble et al 2014 the humification index hix and biological index bix values indicate the degree of humification and reflect recent autochthonous or biological contributions i e autochthonous inputs respectively huguet et al 2009 fellman et al 2010 the fluorescence index fi was used as an indicator of origin where thresholds 1 4 and 1 9 was used to differentiate autochthonous and allochthonous sources respectively mcknight et al 2001 more details on the above optical parameter calculations and descriptions are provided in the supporting information tables s2 and s3 2 3 dom biogeochemical reactivity assay 2 3 1 biodegradation assay the biodegradation kinetics experiments were conducted on a multifunctional horizontal oscillator 200 rpm hy 2a changzhou ronghua instrument ltd china at room temperature 21 3 c an interlab polyseed bacterial inoculum purchased from hach company was used as the microorganism source in the dom biodegradation assay further information on the predominant species and relative proportions of bacteria and fungi in this inoculum was obtained by 16s rrna and its gene analysis text s3 fig s2 at the genus level alternaria and bacillus were the dominant species of fungi and bacteria respectively fig s2 briefly 70 ml of dom sample and 10 ml of inoculum were incubated in a 100 ml blue cap bottle and pre covered with aluminum foil to avoid light irradiation resulting in algae growth and dom photodegradation derrien et al 2019 biodegradation kinetic experiments were conducted for 7 days according to wang et al 2021 and text s4 briefly time dependent sampling was conducted on days 0 1 3 5 and 7 all the collected water samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm pes syringe membrane and then stored at 4 c in the dark before analysis two replicates were used for each experiment the biodegraded dom final to initial doc in eq 1 was fitted using the pseudo first order kinetic model for the two carbon fractions eq 2 based on the assumption that dom is composed of two fractions i e autochthonous and allochthonous with different degradabilities and degradation rates jiang et al 2018 liu et al 2021 nonlinear fitting was conducted using matlab 2020b software v 9 9 0 usa the adjusted r 2 value was used to reflect the goodness of fit 1 degraded dom final to initial doc in do c 0 do c t do c 0 2 degraded dom final to initial doc in f a 1 e k 1 t f b 1 e k 2 t where doc0 is the initial dom concentration and doct is the residual concentration of dom after degradation for a given time t f a and f b are the fractions of labile and stable dom respectively f a plus f b was constrained to approximately 100 and k 1 and k 2 are the biodegradation rate constants of the two dom fractions 2 3 2 free radical production assay all experiments were carried out in an rlh 18 8 position photoreaction system roger tech ltd beijing china with a 5 w led white light source at room temperature 21 3 c the hydroxyl radical oh is the most reactive species in photoreactions occurring in aquatic systems gligorovski et al 2015 and oh was measured as a proxy to evaluate the role of dom in free radical production in this study benzoic acid ba a free radical prober was added to the dom samples to produce the final 10 mmol l 1 ba in the reactor for trapping oh the derivative product of ba oxidation p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba was used to quantify the oh production joo et al 2005 zhu et al 2017 at predetermined time intervals 0 6 12 and 24 h 1 ml of the aqueous solution was filtered through a 0 22 µm pes syringe membrane the filtrate was rapidly injected into methanol hplc grade at a ratio of 1 1 v v to quench the regenerated hydroxyl radicals and kept at 4 c in the dark before analysis the p hba concentration was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu japan equipped with a diode array detector spd m20a and a c18 column the mobile phase was a mixture of 0 1 aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile 65 35 v v at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 with a detection wavelength of 255 nm the cumulative oh concentration was determined using eq 3 joo et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 all experiments were conducted at least in duplicate 3 cumulative oh produced p hba 5 87 2 3 3 photodegradation assay the photodegradation experiment was conducted at room temperature 21 3 c using an rlh 18 8 position photoreaction system roger tech ltd beijing china with a 5 w led white light source wavelength 400 nm this light source mimics sunlight irradiation especially the average condition of natural irradiations in the mid latitude regions instead of a specific setup for uv spectra more details on the photodegradation instrument and led spectrum test report were provided in the supporting information fig s3 and fig s4 two end member samples and their mixtures were transferred into borosilicate glass high purity tubes for the 7 day irradiation at room temperature 21 3 c sampling was conducted on days 0 1 3 5 and 7 during the irradiation experiment and then stored in the dark at 4 c until further analysis the photodegradation rate was also fitted using the first order kinetic model of the double pool eq 2 similar to that used in the biodegradation assay 2 3 4 redox capacity assay the electron donating capacity edc and electron accepting capacity eac of the samples were determined using an electrochemical workstation chi 660e shanghai china the mediated electrochemical reduction mer and oxidation meo were carried out in an anoxic glove box 80 n2 10 h2 and 10 co2 30 1 c first all dom samples were adjusted to a neutral ph and aqueous solutions were made anoxic by purging with n2 99 999 for 1 h at room temperature before being transferred into the glovebox then the residual oxygen in the samples was entirely removed by purging with deoxidized n2 again in the glovebox for 30 min and sealed in a 10 ml serum bottle prior to meo and mer analysis the three electrode system consisted of a 9 ml glassy carbon cylinder sigradur g htw germany a saturated ag agcl reference electrode and a platinum wire counter electrode the electrochemical cell was filled with 4 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs 0 1 m kcl 0 1 m na2hpo4 nah2po4 ph 7 and the electrode was equilibrated to the desired potentials i e eh 0 49 v in mer and 0 61 v in meo subsequently 120 μl of the mediators diquat dibromide monohydrate dq 10 mm sigma aldrich switzerland for mer and 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline sulfonic acid abts 99 10 mm maclin shanghai china for meo were spiked resulting in reductive and oxidative currents respectively after constant background currents were attained small amounts 50 200 μl of dom samples 25 mg c l 1 were added to the cells the amount of electron transfer was measured by integrating reductive oxidative current peaks all samples were analyzed in triplicate the edc and eac of dom were normalized and reported as mmole g c 1 2 4 statistical methods based on the two data points e g spectral indices and reactivities corresponding to the two end members i e ha and adom a conservative i e theoretical mixing behavior line was established for further evaluating the concomitant dynamics of dom characteristics and reactivities within end member fraction changing the mean absolute percentage error mape and decisive factor r 2 were used in this study respectively the two indices were calculated using eqs 4 and 5 in this study the prediction evaluation indicators mape and r 2 were used to reflect the actual prediction error in this study as a constrained rule spectral parameters and reactivity satisfying both mape 20 and r 2 0 75 were defined as conforming to a conservative mixing model well 4 mape 1 n i 1 n y i f i y i 5 r 2 1 i y i f i 2 i y i y 2 where y i and f i represent the measured and predicted values derived from the conservative mixing behavior line respectively y represents the average measured values and n represents the number of samples in the calculation r 2 values could be 0 if i y i f i 2 i y i y 2 1 thus negative r 2 is a mathematical rationality which means that the chosen model with its constraints fits the data poorly it should be emphasized that r 2 is not always the square of a number so it can be negative without breaking the mathematical rules all statistical analyses were conducted using origin 2018 microsoft excel 2019 and rstudio 4 2 0 rstudio team 2022 the mantel test was performed to identify the relevant dom spectral indices correlated with a given reactivity then a venn diagram was used to evaluate the stable performance of such key spectral indices regarding their commonalities to different reactivities finally stepwise regression analysis was conducted to clarify the relative contributions of those stable parameters to the variations of each biogeochemical reactivity during the end member mixing process thus the predominant contributor as the best predictor was identified 3 results and discussion 3 1 dom characteristics from the ha to adom the optical results of different mixing ratios were comparable fig 1a as expected the two end members showed contrasting characteristics table s4 the highest values of suva254 hix chromophoric and humic like fluorescent components peaks a c and m were observed in ha in contrast the adom had the greatest bix fi and protein like fluorescent components peaks b and t this agrees with previous observations that autochthonous dom is less aromatic but has more aliphatic and protein components than typical organic matter from soils mcknight et al 2001 yang and hur 2014 jiang et al 2018 within the autochthonous fraction increases with the addition of adom to adjust the mixing ratios the trends of dom optical parameters indicate the origin predominance transitions from allochthonous to autochthonous fig 1a the changing trends corresponded with the observations of a previous study of allochthonous and autochthonous doms tak et al 2021 of all the dom property parameters six dom spectral properties namely peak m c a suva254 a 355 and s r showed good conservative mixing behaviors fig 1b and table s5 mape 20 and r 2 0 75 which are similar to the results obtained in previous studies yang and hur 2014 tak et al 2021 this suggests that these indices depend primarily on the physical mixing of the two end members field investigations have revealed that the spectral slopes ratio exhibits nonlinear patterns stedmon and markager 2003 helms et al 2008 however this study showed that spectral slopes ratio i e s r is a conservative indicator in lab scale mixing experiments without the influence of evident biogeochemical processes as in field studies stedmon and markager 2003 helms et al 2008 additionally suva254 showed the lowest mape 0 75 and the highest r 2 0 999 indicating that aromatic components were relatively stable irrespective of mixing thus these changes are more likely to reflect physical mixing than dom biogeochemical transformations such as flocculation degradation or aggregation however the higher mape 5 80 57 12 or lower r 2 0 31 0 88 among other spectral parameters e g peak b t hix bix and fi fig 1b and table s5 suggest that these optical indices deviated from the end member mixing similar observations especially the non conservative behavior of fi have also been reported korak et al 2014 yang and hur 2014 derrien et al 2019 tak et al 2021 the fi are calculated in the form of the ratio of two fluorescence peaks or areas a b form and the mixing pattern changes of the numerator a and denominator b are not simultaneous thus they are not proportional to the fraction ratios f a and f b unlike suva254 korak et al 2014 yang and hur 2014 in addition it is worth noting that both protein like components peaks b and t deviated slightly from conservative mixing r 2 0 8 mape 20 this may be partially explained by the quenching effect of humic like component wang et al 2015 yang et al 2018 due to the changes in the molecular environment induced as the end member mixing occurred the mutual interference of such specific fluorophores further influenced the quantum yields korak et al 2014 3 2 dom biogeochemical reactivities 3 2 1 biodegradation the biodegradation response to changes in the end member mixing ratio was evaluated through a 7 d kinetic experiment fig 2a table s6 no lag phase was detected for any treatment indicating that the abundance and activity of microorganisms did not limit doc mineralization at the initial stage fig 2a after 7 day incubation the amount of doc corresponding to 59 3 83 3 of the initial doc was mineralized fig 2a table s6 as expected regarding the two end member ha showed a significantly lower degradation degree 59 3 than adom 80 3 in addition through a pseudo first order kinetic fitting the kinetic rate k was more rapid in adom 0 42 d 1 than in ha 0 17 d 1 table s7 the adom is biologically more unstable than terrestrial dom davis and benner 2007 karlsson et al 2007 this is mainly because of the higher bioavailability for microbial community utilization resulting from the richness of non aromatic and low molecular weight mw compounds e g labile proteins and carbohydrates in adom malik et al 2016 regarding the origins of dom plankton and bacteria have a lower c n ratio approximately 6 7 than that observed for vascular plant tissue which is approximately 20 to as high as 100 bianchi and canuel 2011 and soil organic matter approximately 13 to as high as 43 amorim et al 2022 which could explain why adom was more prone to biodegradation karlsson et al 2007 xu and guo 2018 hansen et al 2016 our observation further supports these explanations that ha showed a higher mw and aromaticity than adom fig 1a further we compared kinetic k values in our studies with other reports from diverse ecosystems table s8 the k 1 reported in the literature from soil lake and ocean showed a similar order of magnitudes with our observation for algae derived dom however the k 2 values from the literature were lower by at least two orders of magnitudes with our observation for ha thus the discrepancy of k values between the literature and our study implies that lab scale incubation assay for short time e g days biodegradation could better track the fast decaying of the labile fractions in dom vonk et al 2015 cory and kling 2018 nevertheless this experiment remains instructive for those who want to evaluate the short term fate of dom such as exploring the priming effect birch effect or quantifying the labile component of organic matter in addition we observed an elevating degree of degradation in the mixed samples than in the ha alone fig 2a table s6 during the kinetic process this could be partially explained by positive priming effects pe when the two end members are mixed in terrestrial and aquatic systems priming is a vital process in carbon turnover which refers to the changes in the remineralization rate of recalcitrant organic matter in response to the addition of labile carbon guenet et al 2010 bianchi 2011 furthermore we conducted kinetic model fitting to validate whether pe could explain this observed biodegradation trend in this study previously the first order kinetic model within two carbon pools eq 2 was often used to fit the dom biodegradation process parameter f derived from this kinetic model can represent two distinct carbon pools labile versus recalcitrant jiang et al 2018 liu et al 2021 thus this model has also been used to estimate pe hotchkiss et al 2014 cheng et al 2018 we assumed that the degradation of two fractions f a and f b of carbon pools were independent processes without interactions such as pe the k values for the two carbon pools were derived from the end members alone where k 1 and k 2 were 0 17 and 0 42 d 1 respectively the modeled kinetic curves of the mixed samples were re established based on the fixed f value as this study was initially designed representing various mixing ratios f a f b namely 80 20 60 40 40 60 and 20 80 however unlike the observed kinetic curves i e solid blue line in fig 3a the modeled results i e orange solid line in fig 3a showed a significantly lower biodegradation degree this indicates that the biodegradation of f a and f b was not independent and the mixing behavior induced more biodegradation meanwhile we selected an alternative fitting strategy to fix k values and make f float for cross validation considering the two carbon fractions could be inter changed because of pe with increasing adom modeled fa continuously decreased fig 3b and table s7 implying a transfer of recalcitrant carbon into the labile fraction which could further support the possibility of pe accounting for increasing biodegradation while two fractions mixed thus in this study pe readily occurred when the labile component adom was mixed with the refractory pool ha this suggests that labile carbon inputs triggered the degradation of previously refractory carbon furthermore pe is a biological process that is mainly controlled by the microbial community guenet et al 2010 bianchi et al 2015 therefore elevating microbial activity due to labile carbon i e f b input could also substantially enhance the biodegradation of f b itself thus although the addition of autochthonous fraction f b significantly enhanced the biodegradation of ha the increasing trend with f b did not follow the conservative mixing behavior mape 20 but r 2 0 01 fig s5a and table s5 the role of changing microbial community during the kinetic processes in the mixing samples is worth further investigation 3 2 2 free radical production hydroxyl radicals which are strong oxidants in the environment are produced by the photochemical reactions of dom in aquatic or soil systems page et al 2013 maizel et al 2017 it can react with recalcitrant organic matter further influencing carbon turnover pullin et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 and the environmental fate of contaminants chin et al 2004 gligorovski et al 2015 in this study the oh accumulative concentrations in ha were higher 0 43 µmol l 1 than in adom 0 03 µmol l 1 within 24 h light irradiation fig 2b as the ha fraction allochthonous f a increased the oh cumulative production showed a continuously increasing trend fig 2b fig s5b this increasing pattern co varied with the mixing ratios following a conservative mixing behavior mape 20 r2 0 88 the increasing photoreactivity can explain this observation with f a which is mainly attributed to the elevations of the abundance of chromophoric and aromatic components sun and mopper 2016 cory and kling 2018 meanwhile significant positive correlations between a 355 r 0 96 p 0 003 and suva254 r 0 96 p 0 002 and the cumulative oh observed in our study fig s6a and fig s6b are consistent with previous studies reporting that dom samples with the highest aromatic carbon induced the most oh production page et al 2014 grannas et al 2006 this further indicates that the direct photolysis of aromatic carbon components was an essential pathway for oh production goldstone et al 2002 mopper and zhou 1990 thus during the end member mixing process the aromaticity of dom e g suva254 could be a better proxy for predicting its potential for oh production in photodegradation as discussed later 3 2 3 photodegradation the origin of dom is closely associated with its chemical reactivity including its susceptibility to photochemical degradation hernes and benner 2003 hansen et al 2016 the results showed that 46 9 77 4 of dom samples were photodegraded fig 2c table s9 however regarding the kinetic rates k and final degradation degree after 7 days of photodegradation ha was significantly lower photolability than adom table s10 which was corroborated by other studies yang et al 2018 niu and croué 2019 zhou et al 2020 xu et al 2022 essentially aquatic dom of algae origin is enriched in organic nitrogen in the form of amino acids or peptides brown et al 2004 goldberg et al 2015 yang et al 2018 which are more susceptible to photomineralization by direct photolysis and indirect pathways michaeli and feitelson 1994 amado et al 2007 sun et al 2018 than aromatic components however our observation was opposite with some reports that allochthonous i e terrestrial dom shows greater photodegradation because of the abundant cdom pool including lignin phenols and tannins for higher light absorption berggren et al 2022 hernes and benner 2003 spencer et al 2009 cory and kling 2018 in this study we used white light 400 nm to simulate natural sunlight which differred from using a uv spectrum for photodegradation sun et al 2018 reported that under the visible spectrum the degradation of protein like components is more photoreactive than humic like components additionally previous studies have reported that aromatic or high mw dom could be partially photodegraded into aliphatic or low mw organic components without complete mineralization andrews et al 2000 cory et al 2009 2010 ward et al 2014 yang et al 2018 thus in this study the lower photodegradation of ha is likely to be attributed to the fact that ha is only partially photooxidized rather than completely mineralized future works should be necessary to explore the influences of different light irradiation conditions on dom property generally dom photodegradation is divided into two pathways sulzberger and durisch kaiser 2009 cory and kling 2018 namely i direct photochemical transformation and ii indirect photochemical transformation of dom via free radicals such as 3dom 1o2 and oh attack the latter is the main pathway goldstone et al 2002 however regarding the oh production as aforementioned fig s5b and fig s6 we found a decoupling between photodegradation and free radical production this suggests that the higher oh production does not guarantee a corresponding higher dom photodegradation fig 2b and c although oh is commonly formed in aquatic ecosystems photochemical oh formation has been estimated to contribute negligibly to the observed photooxidation of lake dom page et al 2014 ha goldstone et al 2002 and another organic compound bai et al 2021 thus the oh may play only a minor role in the degradation of humic and fulvic substances hefner et al 2006 minor et al 2007 compared to the other critical photoproduced reactive intermediates such as 3dom and 1o2 cory et al 2009 2010 maizel et al 2017 bai et al 2021 the formation pathways of oh differ from 3dom and 1o2 berg et al 2019 more aliphatic composition of dom correlates with higher quantum yields of 3dom and 1o2 maizel et al 2017 maizel et al 2017 found that the production efficiency of 3dom and 1o2 obviously decreased with dom mw which was further supported by similar observations niu and croué 2019 zhou et al 2020 xu et al 2022 in our study s r showed a conservative pattern and inverse relationship with f a fig 1a which implied that the potential of 3dom and 1o2 formation could increase with the autochthonous fractions i e more aliphatic and lmw moieties finally we also observed a priming like phenomenon in photodegradation as in biodegradation photolability for mixing samples increased with the autochthonous fraction f b fig 2c and fig s5c nevertheless the changing pattern of photolability did not follow conservative mixing behavior fig s5c and table s5 furthermore using the same analysis strategy in biodegradation the modeled photodegradation kinetic curves for the mixed samples were re established fig 4a we assumed that the two fractions of carbon pools i e two end members were independent in the photodegradation process unsurprisingly the modeled results showed significantly less photodegradation in contrast to the assumption is similar to the observation in the biodegradation assay alternatively we also fixed k values 0 11 and 0 40 d 1 for ha and adom respectively and assigned f as a floating variable to track the carbon pool changes as compared to the 1 1 line continuous decreases in fa further suggested that the photorefractory dom e g highly aromatic changed into the labile pool e g nitrogen rich components fig 4b thus the above results indicate an interaction between two end members after mixing which was also observed in yang et al 2018 here we explain this priming like phenomenon in dom photodegradation fig 2c and fig s5c by the dual role of f a the allochthonous fraction due to the high aromatic and humified components which is a tradeoff between 1 i e enhancement high light absorption inducing higher photoreactivity and 2 i e inhibition intra quenching effect and the photorefractory property itself previous studies suggested that a high aromatic fraction of dom e g phenolics as an antioxidant aeschbacher et al 2012 could also play a key role in suppressing photodegradation by quenching free radicals goldstone et al 2002 page et al 2014 ward and cory 2016 thus when f b the autochthonous fraction increases the relative dilution could decrease the quenching effect conversely elevated 3dom and 1o2 with f b could further enhance the degradation we should note that there is lower photodegradation in adom f a 0 than in the mixed samples excepting m 4 f a 80 this is because less light absorption in adom supported by the lower a 355 as observed fig 1 3 2 4 redox capacity redox capacity including edc and eac is an essential biogeochemical reaction of dom kappler et al 2004 peretyazhko and sposito 2006 aeschbacher et al 2012 yang et al 2022 and is defined by its ability to shuttle electrons as a donor or an acceptor redox properties of dom heavily impact the carbon turnover keller et al 2009 rush et al 2021 and the environmental fates of contaminants such as heavy metals gu et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 2020 the edc and eac and electron transfer capacity etc equal to eac plus edc of all samples are shown in fig 2d the eac and edc of the dom samples ranged from 0 24 to 3 89 mmole g c 1 and 0 51 to 6 97 mmole g c 1 respectively both parameters decreased as the autochthonous fraction increased fig 2d the autochthonous end member adom showed the lowest edc 0 51 mmole g c 1 and eac 0 24 mmole g c 1 similarly aeschbacher et al 2012 reported that the fa of pony lake plfa 1r109f a typical autochthonous dom sample sampled from an antarctica lake showed the lowest eac 0 93 mmole g c 1 and edc 0 92 mmole g c 1 among their tested om samples this observation could be explained by the allochthonous dom having a higher condensed aromatic structure e g phenolic and quinone groups aeschbacher et al 2012 previous studies have illustrated that electron accepting quinone and electron donating phenolic moieties are the primary redox active moieties controlling changes in dom redox capacity aeschbacher et al 2012 walpen et al 2018 yang et al 2022 additionally suva254 values can be used to indicate quinone groups in dom cory and mcknight 2005 thus it is unsurprising that the significant positive correlation between eac and suva254 suggests that quinone is the primary electron accepting moiety in the dom samples r 0 93 p 0 008 fig s6d furthermore regarding the variations in mixing ratios we observed a similar changing pattern of edc to oh production a significant positive correlation was observed between edc and oh r 0 98 p 0 001 fig s6c edc is attributed to phenolic molecules which play a prominent role in oh formation page et al 2013 berg et al 2019 however in contrast to edc mape 18 92 and r 2 0 88 the changes in eac in response to the mixing ratio variations showed an obvious deviation from conservative behavior mape 61 68 and r 2 0 64 fig s7 table s5 this scenario suggests that phenolic moieties are more likely to preserve the conservative mixing behavior than quinone moieties 3 3 responses of dom reactivities to characteristic changes due to two end member mixing to further clarify the influence of changes in dom characteristics responding to the end member mixing on its biogeochemical reactivities a partial mantel test was conducted fig 5 the results indicated that dom properties except for peak c significantly affected the oh production and redox capacity including eac edc and etc mantel s p 0 05 and mantel s r 0 4 however regarding the photodegradation and biodegradation except for humic like peaks peaks a c and m the other optical parameters were not statistically significant mantel s p 0 05 and mantel s r 0 4 the significant correlations suggest that the role of some dom properties in controlling its reactivity is general and independent of the mixing behavior in particular higher terrestrial fraction i e f a samples showed higher redox and free radical production reactivity this also supports our previous findings that terrestrial input is so vital that it predominantly influences the role of dom in the environmental fate of contaminants jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2022 conversely the decoupling relationship between some spectral indices e g suva254 fi and hix and the reactivity matrix i e photodegradation and biodegradation may be attributed to the interactive effect e g pe induced by the mixing behavior these results revealed that different dom reactivities respond differently to variations in their properties not all dom characteristics could be applicable to indicate the changes in dom reactivities in the mixing process thus simply predicting reactivity using dom characteristics especially in the scenario of end member mixing must be carefully considered and interpreted additionally to further evaluate the performances of dom spectral parameters in indicating the changing reactivities during the mixing process the terminology of stability was proposed to describe a stable performance we defined the stability of dom spectral parameters to evaluate dom reactivities by two rules including 1 general applicability at least common to two reactivities and 2 following the conservative mixing model meanwhile based on the mantel test fig 5 results we categorized the correlated parameters into three types using a venn diagram which indicates that they commonly have correlations with two three and four reactivities fig 6 for example peaks a and m were significantly correlated with all reactivities i e the highest general applicability therefore both are indicators common to the four reactivities on the other hand peaks a and m also follow the conservative mixing model therefore both can be recognized as the most stable indicators to evaluate dom reactivities irrespective of the two end member mixings in contrast in the cluster of dom spectral parameters common to two reactivities only a 355 suva254 and s r were stable indicators furthermore the relative contributions of these stable spectral indices fig 6 to the variations of each biogeochemical reactivity during the end member mixing process were calculated by stepwise regression analysis of all stable indices humic like peak c was found to have the most profound contribution to explaining the variations of biodegradation negatively 71 photodegradation negatively 66 and redox capacities positively 90 fig 7 interactions between two end members in biodegradation and photodegradation significantly influence the contributions of peak c as compared to in redox capacities additionally for oh production suva254 correlates with aromaticity explaining 94 of the reactivity variation the results support those field findings from diverse dom samples that the characteristic parameters relevant to terrestrial inputs e g peak c and suva254 can be reliable indicators for dom reactivities bieroza et al 2009 maizel et al 2017 mckay et al 2017 manivannan and borisover 2020 wang et al 2021 2022 notably this finding further suggests that the terrestrial end member is relatively predominant when compared to the autochthonous source in affecting the dynamics of dom reactivity additionally because dom spectral measurement is relatively simple the two parameters could be used as rapid predictors for tracking the changes in dom s reactivity during the mixing process however concerning the increases of terrestrial end member inputs into waters induced by climate change and escalating anthropogenic interference further work is needed to verify the predictive role of peak c and suva254 for dom reactivity in field investigations however regarding the stable performance of peak a and m in contrast to peak c and suva254 fig 6 the stable performance of the index does not necessarily mean it is the main contributor these indicators are more widely applied in estimating various reactivities but may reduce their predictability for a specific reactivity thus currently a universal model cannot be proposed and a main contributor should be identified first before further predictions of the given reactivity are made 3 4 environmental implications in environmental systems end member mixing is an essential geophysical process influencing the variations of dom characteristics perdue and koprivnjak 2007 yang and hur 2014 solomon et al 2015 xenopoulos et al 2021 thus understanding the variations of dom characteristics in response to changes in the origins of inputs is a critical step in further evaluating the environmental role and functional traits of dom in diverse ecosystems our study revealed that the variations in dom composition due to mixing the two end member fractions significantly impact its biogeochemical reactivity however mixing effects of the two fractions on reactivity cannot be generalized in particular the non conservative changing patterns of the bio photodegradation potentials observed due to the possible interaction of the two fractions after mixing further illustrate that the biogeochemical complexities of dom act unlike our expectations of simply conservative behavior thus it is not appropriate to evaluate and predict the dom biogeochemical reactivities through simply plus or minus of reactivity from individual end member fractions furthermore it should be emphasized that the terminology recalcitrant and labile widely used to describe dom s low quality and high quality especially in the biodegradation process are relative and floating our observations suggest that the recalcitrant to labile concepts refer to a continuum and could only be validly evaluated on given circumstances and spatiotemporal scale however the changing patterns of dom reactivities highlighted in this study imply that the role of dom is a function of ecosystem properties rather than being only associated with intrinsic characteristics schmidt et al 2011 bianchi et al 2015 secondly in the anthropocene aquatic ecosystems extensively experience stress from anthropogenic activities such as land use change dam construction and nutrient pollution those influences substantially change dom composition and characteristics by affecting the inputs loads of terrestrial and microbial algal source dom xenopoulos et al 2021 for example dam reservoir building and consequent formation of impoundments may serve as a mixing tank for dom derived from the two end members and eutrophication could promote the autochthonous fraction in aquatic dom additionally permafrost thawing and more frequent precipitation due to climate change can lead to increasing terrestrial inputs which could substantially elevate the allochthonous fraction of dom in neighboring aquatic systems peterson et al 2002 wikner and andersson 2012 bauer et al 2013 solomon et al 2015 consequently the dom biogeochemical reactivities would be changing considering the end member mixing effect finally in this study we found that not all dom characteristic parameters could be applicable for evaluating the dynamics of dom reactivity the potential influences of the mixing process on dom characteristics and reactivities need further investigations and dom spectral indices can be used to obtain more reliable clues for clarifying the relationship between dom properties and its reactivities as well as enhance the predictability meanwhile as implied in this study the complexity of mixing driven two fraction interactions in dom suggests that understanding the end member mixing drive changes in dom reactivities will require more comprehensive research that is both mechanistic and holistic 4 conclusion dissolved organic matter play a critical role in diverse ecosystems especially in the aquatic environment furthermore the variations of dom reactivities are influenced by varying contributions from two end members and were evaluated in this study the results showed that the variations of dom characteristics due to the two end members mixing significantly impact the biogeochemical reactivity of the mixture which partially validates our hypothesis however not all spectral parameters and reactivities followed the expected conservative mixing behavior consequently the effect of end member mixing on dom biogeochemistry cannot be generalized in contrast to reactivities of oh production and redox capacity mixed samples showed apparent deviations from conservative linear relationships for the biodegradation and photodegradation due to the interaction between the two end members these findings have significant implications that the dynamics of dom result in variations in reactivity that cannot be estimated merely by the simple 1 1 2 mode thus it is only possible to make estimations specific reactivities by accounting for the performance of an individual end member for instance redox capacity and free radical production additionally of all indices for dom characteristics peak a and m showed the most stable performance for estimating the dynamics of dom reactivity however this does not necessarily mean they are the predominant parameters controlling the reactivity in contrast peak c and suva254 were identified as the contributors most able to explain dom reactivity variations thus regarding the dynamic relationship between the dom source and its reactivity the key contributor of dom property should be identified first before further predictions are made regarding the reactivity therefore in future work more comprehensive studies particularly field investigations are needed to explore the link between dom sources and their biogeochemical reactivity this may help to further clarify the responses of the functional role of dom to varying environmental conditions in diverse ecosystems especially in the context of climate

15031,dissolved organic matter dom is an essential component of environmental systems it usually originates from two end members including allochthonous and autochthonous sources previously links have been established between dom origins sources and its biogeochemical reactivities however the influence of changes in dom characteristics driven by end member mixing on dom biogeochemical reactivities has not been clarified in this study we investigated variations of dom reactivities responding to the dynamics of dom characteristics induced by different mixing ratios of two dom end members derived from humic acid ha and algae respectively four biogeochemical reactivities of dom were evaluated including biodegradation oh production photodegradation and redox capacity results showed that the variations of dom characteristics due to the two end members mixing significantly impact its biogeochemical reactivities however not all spectral parameters and reactivities followed the conservative mixing behavior in contrast to reactivities of oh production and redox capacity mixed samples showed apparent deviations from conservative linear relationships in biodegradation and photodegradation due to the interaction between the two end members regarding the role of dom properties influencing reactivity changes peak a and m were recognized as the most stable parameters however peak c and suva254 were identified as the most vital contributors for explaining dom reactivity variations these findings suggest that a general model for describing the dynamic relationship between dom source and reactivity cannot be proposed thus the dynamics of dom reactivity in diverse ecosystems cannot be estimated simply by the plus or minus of the reactivity from individual end member the effect of end member mixing should be evaluated in a given reactivity instead of generalization this study provides important insights for further understanding the dynamics of dom s environmental role in different ecosystems influenced by variations of source inputs in future more field investigations are needed to further verify our findings in this study especially in the scenario of end member

data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an essential component of natural organic matter in aquatic systems including inland freshwater and marine systems dissolved organic matter dom is a complex and heterogeneous mixture of natural organic components typically it is composed of two end members originating from terrigenous i e allochthonous and aquatic i e autochthonous sources derrien et al 2018 lee et al 2019a the characteristics of dom are influenced by these sources and is often described by a binary mixture model of the two end members i e allochthonous versus autochthonous perdue and koprivnjak 2007 carter et al 2012 toming et al 2013 chen et al 2016 connolly et al 2021 furthermore the composition and structures of dom components from the two end members show distinct differences mcknight et al 2001 toming et al 2013 liu et al 2020 tak et al 2021 for instance allochthonous dom usually originates mainly from the runoff or leaching of organic matter from soils and higher plants in the terrestrial system and is consequently more humified aromatic and bio refractory derrien et al 2015 2018 in contrast autochthonous dom has higher protein and aliphatic components which are mainly derived from aquatic biotas such as algae bacteria plankton and macrophytes derrien et al 2017 2018 thus it is essential to investigate the dom sources vary within the dynamics of end member ratio for further understanding dom characteristics in diverse ecosystems regarding the crucial role of dom in ecosystems it is indispensable in the carbon cycle relevant to climate change tranvik et al 2018 berggren et al 2022 it also has a crucial impact on the environmental fate of contaminants such as trace heavy metals aiken et al 2011 bravo et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 and persistent organic compounds batista et al 2016 in aquatic systems the most recognized biogeochemical processes driven by dom include photo and biodegradation cory and kling 2018 free radical production page et al 2014 berg et al 2019 redox capacity aeschbacher et al 2012 binding capacity with metal elements wang et al 2022 and selective adsorption on surfaces of minerals lv et al 2016 previously many studies have established the links between dom origins sources and its biogeochemical reactivities aiken et al 2011 jiang et al 2018 fu et al 2021 for example photo and biodegradation of terrestrial dom involve the production of greenhouse gasses e g co2 and ch4 which are essential reaction mechanisms in climate feedback sulzberger and durisch kaiser 2009 cory and kaplan 2012 sleighter et al 2014 studies have reported that elevated terrestrial dom inputs likely enhance dissolved ch4 levels in lakes zhou et al 2018 and aquatic co2 emissions lapierre et al 2013 furthermore terrestrial dominant dom inhibited neurotoxic methylmercury mehg formation jiang et al 2018 but showed a greater affinity for binding hg ii wang et al 2022 further terrestrial dom elevated mehg retention in the water increasing the mehg exposure risk to biota for bioaccumulation jonsson et al 2017 in contrast autochthonous dom may enhance mehg production in an anoxic environment due to its higher biodegradability schartup et al 2015 bravo et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 lei et al 2021 thus the characteristics of dom and its relevant biogeochemical reactivities depend heavily on whether they originate from terrestrial soil and plant material or from in situ sources in water environments leenheer and croue 2003 most previous studies have established the relationship between dom sources e g terrestrial and their biogeochemical reactivities from field investigations and observed the correlations in other words correlation analysis revealed the effect of dom origin in its ecological role in a given environment however validation of such a relationship in a laboratory environment remains scarce tak et al 2021 notably variations in environmental conditions in specific spatial and temporal scales may further alter the observed relationships between dom origins and reactivities which are not comparable for example in the freshwater estuary ocean continuum or lake occurring eutrophication the dom characteristics could be changed due to variations in two end member inputs as a result predicting the corresponding changes in dom reactivity remains a challenge thus a major knowledge gap is that there has been little focus on quantitatively source based changes in dom characteristics to understand the responses of dom s ecological role to environmental changes in particular clarifying the role of the mixing ratio of two end members in the dynamics of dom property could be helpful to further explain the relationship between dom characteristics and its reactivity observed in field investigations maizel et al 2017 bravo et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 lee et al 2019a 2019b based on the above concerns we hypothesize that the dom reactivity co varies with the fluctations of two end member mixing ratios in a conservative behavior this raises an important question that still needs to be verified once the proportions of two end members are identified in a given dom sample can the biogeochemical reactivity be linearly estimated based on the independent performance of each end member reactivity therefore this study focused on the changes in dom biogeochemical reactivities influenced by varying contributions from two typical end members humic acid ha and algae dissolved organic matter adom selected to represent allochthonous and autochthonous dom respectively these two compounds were mixed in different fraction ratios such as 80 terrestrial versus 20 algae fractions to further evaluate the reactivity of the artificially mixed samples by using the end member mixing model the aims of this study were to 1 examine the changing pattern of dom characteristics with varying mixing ratios of the two typical end members 2 track the changes in selected biogeochemical reactivities within different end member mixing ratios and 3 evaluate the relationship of the dom characteristic and reactivities during the two end member mixings the key parameters of dom property in the relationship were also identified this study provides some useful findings to help further understand the relationship between dom biogeochemical reactivity and its sources in diverse ecosystems especially considering the scenarios of end member mixing 2 materials and methods 2 1 dom sample preparation to validate the relationship between dom sources and reactivities two typical organic matter samples including commercial ha and algae in a natural lake were selected as the two end members mixed samples were prepared by mixing the two end member samples in different ratios the ha sample is dominated by terrestrial organic matter purchased from adamas adamas reagent co ltd shanghai china solid ha powder was dissolved in milli q water 18 2 ω cm by 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl to adjust to being neutral ph 7 subsequently the ha solution was re filtered by a polyethersulfone pes syringe membrane 0 22 µm algae were harvested during an algal bloom event in august of 2019 from chaohu lake china s fifth largest freshwater lake 31 42 48 94 n 117 21 48 37 e according to methods described in the supporting information text s1 and lei et al 2021 briefly algae biomass was harvested by a 112 µm mesh size plankton net and transported to the laboratory in a thermal protective cooler after further rinsing and freeze drying samples were ground to a powder 0 2 mm subsequently adom was extracted with deionized water milli q millipore usa w v of 1 100 in a horizontal shaker 200 rpm hy 2a changzhou ronghua instrument ltd china for 16 h under dark conditions at 25 c jiang et al 2017 the extracts were then centrifuged for 30 min at 4000 rpm and filtered through a 0 22 µm pes syringe membrane to eliminate potential particles and microbial interference subsequently the ha and adom stock solutions were diluted to 25 mg l 1 dom as the working solution in addition to further verify the contrasting characteristics of the two end member organic samples we used nuclear magnetic resonance nmr techniques fig s1 text s2 the 13c nmr spectra result showed that the ha sample had relatively greater and discriminable signals of alkyl a and o alkyl carbon o a and carbonyl carbon the ratio of alkyl to o alkyl carbon a o a of the ha sample is located in the typical a o a ratio range of soil organic matter som i e 0 2 1 1 li et al 2019 from different ecosystems meanwhile to prepare the mixing dom samples within various end member mixing ratios the two contrasting types of dom working solutions were mixed at a series of fixed ratios between terrestrial allochthonous f a and aquatic fraction autochthonous f b origins namely 100 0 80 20 60 40 40 60 20 80 and 0 100 corresponding to ha m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 and adom respectively table s1 all dom working solutions were adjusted to be neutral ph 7 to avoid ph interference on all reactivity assays 2 2 uv vis absorption and fluorescence spectra the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of the end member working solution was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the optical properties of the dom were analyzed using an aqualog absorption fluorescence spectrometer horiba japan as described previously jiang et al 2018 the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 l mg c 1 m 1 was calculated to estimate the aromaticity and humification of dom weishaar et al 2003 the spectral slope s r is inversely proportional to the molecular weight helms et al 2008 the absorption coefficient a 355 was chosen as a surrogate for the abundance of chromophoric the dom cdom osbum et al 2016 in addition the fluorescence excitation emission eem spectra were measured internal filtering effects ife were minimized by diluting to doc 10 mg l 1 before measuring the spectra including absorption and fluorescence zhou et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 additionally ife was automatically corrected using aqualog eems data processing software and were double checked using originpro 2017 jiang et al 2018 the classic peak pick approach coble et al 2014 was used to identify fluorescence peaks rather than parallel factor analysis parafac because of the limited number of samples murphy et al 2013 in this study five fluorescent components including three humic like components expressed by peaks a c and m and two protein like components represented by peaks t and b were determined by typical dom eem spectra which could be interpreted according to coble et al 2014 the humification index hix and biological index bix values indicate the degree of humification and reflect recent autochthonous or biological contributions i e autochthonous inputs respectively huguet et al 2009 fellman et al 2010 the fluorescence index fi was used as an indicator of origin where thresholds 1 4 and 1 9 was used to differentiate autochthonous and allochthonous sources respectively mcknight et al 2001 more details on the above optical parameter calculations and descriptions are provided in the supporting information tables s2 and s3 2 3 dom biogeochemical reactivity assay 2 3 1 biodegradation assay the biodegradation kinetics experiments were conducted on a multifunctional horizontal oscillator 200 rpm hy 2a changzhou ronghua instrument ltd china at room temperature 21 3 c an interlab polyseed bacterial inoculum purchased from hach company was used as the microorganism source in the dom biodegradation assay further information on the predominant species and relative proportions of bacteria and fungi in this inoculum was obtained by 16s rrna and its gene analysis text s3 fig s2 at the genus level alternaria and bacillus were the dominant species of fungi and bacteria respectively fig s2 briefly 70 ml of dom sample and 10 ml of inoculum were incubated in a 100 ml blue cap bottle and pre covered with aluminum foil to avoid light irradiation resulting in algae growth and dom photodegradation derrien et al 2019 biodegradation kinetic experiments were conducted for 7 days according to wang et al 2021 and text s4 briefly time dependent sampling was conducted on days 0 1 3 5 and 7 all the collected water samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm pes syringe membrane and then stored at 4 c in the dark before analysis two replicates were used for each experiment the biodegraded dom final to initial doc in eq 1 was fitted using the pseudo first order kinetic model for the two carbon fractions eq 2 based on the assumption that dom is composed of two fractions i e autochthonous and allochthonous with different degradabilities and degradation rates jiang et al 2018 liu et al 2021 nonlinear fitting was conducted using matlab 2020b software v 9 9 0 usa the adjusted r 2 value was used to reflect the goodness of fit 1 degraded dom final to initial doc in do c 0 do c t do c 0 2 degraded dom final to initial doc in f a 1 e k 1 t f b 1 e k 2 t where doc0 is the initial dom concentration and doct is the residual concentration of dom after degradation for a given time t f a and f b are the fractions of labile and stable dom respectively f a plus f b was constrained to approximately 100 and k 1 and k 2 are the biodegradation rate constants of the two dom fractions 2 3 2 free radical production assay all experiments were carried out in an rlh 18 8 position photoreaction system roger tech ltd beijing china with a 5 w led white light source at room temperature 21 3 c the hydroxyl radical oh is the most reactive species in photoreactions occurring in aquatic systems gligorovski et al 2015 and oh was measured as a proxy to evaluate the role of dom in free radical production in this study benzoic acid ba a free radical prober was added to the dom samples to produce the final 10 mmol l 1 ba in the reactor for trapping oh the derivative product of ba oxidation p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba was used to quantify the oh production joo et al 2005 zhu et al 2017 at predetermined time intervals 0 6 12 and 24 h 1 ml of the aqueous solution was filtered through a 0 22 µm pes syringe membrane the filtrate was rapidly injected into methanol hplc grade at a ratio of 1 1 v v to quench the regenerated hydroxyl radicals and kept at 4 c in the dark before analysis the p hba concentration was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu japan equipped with a diode array detector spd m20a and a c18 column the mobile phase was a mixture of 0 1 aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile 65 35 v v at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 with a detection wavelength of 255 nm the cumulative oh concentration was determined using eq 3 joo et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 all experiments were conducted at least in duplicate 3 cumulative oh produced p hba 5 87 2 3 3 photodegradation assay the photodegradation experiment was conducted at room temperature 21 3 c using an rlh 18 8 position photoreaction system roger tech ltd beijing china with a 5 w led white light source wavelength 400 nm this light source mimics sunlight irradiation especially the average condition of natural irradiations in the mid latitude regions instead of a specific setup for uv spectra more details on the photodegradation instrument and led spectrum test report were provided in the supporting information fig s3 and fig s4 two end member samples and their mixtures were transferred into borosilicate glass high purity tubes for the 7 day irradiation at room temperature 21 3 c sampling was conducted on days 0 1 3 5 and 7 during the irradiation experiment and then stored in the dark at 4 c until further analysis the photodegradation rate was also fitted using the first order kinetic model of the double pool eq 2 similar to that used in the biodegradation assay 2 3 4 redox capacity assay the electron donating capacity edc and electron accepting capacity eac of the samples were determined using an electrochemical workstation chi 660e shanghai china the mediated electrochemical reduction mer and oxidation meo were carried out in an anoxic glove box 80 n2 10 h2 and 10 co2 30 1 c first all dom samples were adjusted to a neutral ph and aqueous solutions were made anoxic by purging with n2 99 999 for 1 h at room temperature before being transferred into the glovebox then the residual oxygen in the samples was entirely removed by purging with deoxidized n2 again in the glovebox for 30 min and sealed in a 10 ml serum bottle prior to meo and mer analysis the three electrode system consisted of a 9 ml glassy carbon cylinder sigradur g htw germany a saturated ag agcl reference electrode and a platinum wire counter electrode the electrochemical cell was filled with 4 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs 0 1 m kcl 0 1 m na2hpo4 nah2po4 ph 7 and the electrode was equilibrated to the desired potentials i e eh 0 49 v in mer and 0 61 v in meo subsequently 120 μl of the mediators diquat dibromide monohydrate dq 10 mm sigma aldrich switzerland for mer and 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline sulfonic acid abts 99 10 mm maclin shanghai china for meo were spiked resulting in reductive and oxidative currents respectively after constant background currents were attained small amounts 50 200 μl of dom samples 25 mg c l 1 were added to the cells the amount of electron transfer was measured by integrating reductive oxidative current peaks all samples were analyzed in triplicate the edc and eac of dom were normalized and reported as mmole g c 1 2 4 statistical methods based on the two data points e g spectral indices and reactivities corresponding to the two end members i e ha and adom a conservative i e theoretical mixing behavior line was established for further evaluating the concomitant dynamics of dom characteristics and reactivities within end member fraction changing the mean absolute percentage error mape and decisive factor r 2 were used in this study respectively the two indices were calculated using eqs 4 and 5 in this study the prediction evaluation indicators mape and r 2 were used to reflect the actual prediction error in this study as a constrained rule spectral parameters and reactivity satisfying both mape 20 and r 2 0 75 were defined as conforming to a conservative mixing model well 4 mape 1 n i 1 n y i f i y i 5 r 2 1 i y i f i 2 i y i y 2 where y i and f i represent the measured and predicted values derived from the conservative mixing behavior line respectively y represents the average measured values and n represents the number of samples in the calculation r 2 values could be 0 if i y i f i 2 i y i y 2 1 thus negative r 2 is a mathematical rationality which means that the chosen model with its constraints fits the data poorly it should be emphasized that r 2 is not always the square of a number so it can be negative without breaking the mathematical rules all statistical analyses were conducted using origin 2018 microsoft excel 2019 and rstudio 4 2 0 rstudio team 2022 the mantel test was performed to identify the relevant dom spectral indices correlated with a given reactivity then a venn diagram was used to evaluate the stable performance of such key spectral indices regarding their commonalities to different reactivities finally stepwise regression analysis was conducted to clarify the relative contributions of those stable parameters to the variations of each biogeochemical reactivity during the end member mixing process thus the predominant contributor as the best predictor was identified 3 results and discussion 3 1 dom characteristics from the ha to adom the optical results of different mixing ratios were comparable fig 1a as expected the two end members showed contrasting characteristics table s4 the highest values of suva254 hix chromophoric and humic like fluorescent components peaks a c and m were observed in ha in contrast the adom had the greatest bix fi and protein like fluorescent components peaks b and t this agrees with previous observations that autochthonous dom is less aromatic but has more aliphatic and protein components than typical organic matter from soils mcknight et al 2001 yang and hur 2014 jiang et al 2018 within the autochthonous fraction increases with the addition of adom to adjust the mixing ratios the trends of dom optical parameters indicate the origin predominance transitions from allochthonous to autochthonous fig 1a the changing trends corresponded with the observations of a previous study of allochthonous and autochthonous doms tak et al 2021 of all the dom property parameters six dom spectral properties namely peak m c a suva254 a 355 and s r showed good conservative mixing behaviors fig 1b and table s5 mape 20 and r 2 0 75 which are similar to the results obtained in previous studies yang and hur 2014 tak et al 2021 this suggests that these indices depend primarily on the physical mixing of the two end members field investigations have revealed that the spectral slopes ratio exhibits nonlinear patterns stedmon and markager 2003 helms et al 2008 however this study showed that spectral slopes ratio i e s r is a conservative indicator in lab scale mixing experiments without the influence of evident biogeochemical processes as in field studies stedmon and markager 2003 helms et al 2008 additionally suva254 showed the lowest mape 0 75 and the highest r 2 0 999 indicating that aromatic components were relatively stable irrespective of mixing thus these changes are more likely to reflect physical mixing than dom biogeochemical transformations such as flocculation degradation or aggregation however the higher mape 5 80 57 12 or lower r 2 0 31 0 88 among other spectral parameters e g peak b t hix bix and fi fig 1b and table s5 suggest that these optical indices deviated from the end member mixing similar observations especially the non conservative behavior of fi have also been reported korak et al 2014 yang and hur 2014 derrien et al 2019 tak et al 2021 the fi are calculated in the form of the ratio of two fluorescence peaks or areas a b form and the mixing pattern changes of the numerator a and denominator b are not simultaneous thus they are not proportional to the fraction ratios f a and f b unlike suva254 korak et al 2014 yang and hur 2014 in addition it is worth noting that both protein like components peaks b and t deviated slightly from conservative mixing r 2 0 8 mape 20 this may be partially explained by the quenching effect of humic like component wang et al 2015 yang et al 2018 due to the changes in the molecular environment induced as the end member mixing occurred the mutual interference of such specific fluorophores further influenced the quantum yields korak et al 2014 3 2 dom biogeochemical reactivities 3 2 1 biodegradation the biodegradation response to changes in the end member mixing ratio was evaluated through a 7 d kinetic experiment fig 2a table s6 no lag phase was detected for any treatment indicating that the abundance and activity of microorganisms did not limit doc mineralization at the initial stage fig 2a after 7 day incubation the amount of doc corresponding to 59 3 83 3 of the initial doc was mineralized fig 2a table s6 as expected regarding the two end member ha showed a significantly lower degradation degree 59 3 than adom 80 3 in addition through a pseudo first order kinetic fitting the kinetic rate k was more rapid in adom 0 42 d 1 than in ha 0 17 d 1 table s7 the adom is biologically more unstable than terrestrial dom davis and benner 2007 karlsson et al 2007 this is mainly because of the higher bioavailability for microbial community utilization resulting from the richness of non aromatic and low molecular weight mw compounds e g labile proteins and carbohydrates in adom malik et al 2016 regarding the origins of dom plankton and bacteria have a lower c n ratio approximately 6 7 than that observed for vascular plant tissue which is approximately 20 to as high as 100 bianchi and canuel 2011 and soil organic matter approximately 13 to as high as 43 amorim et al 2022 which could explain why adom was more prone to biodegradation karlsson et al 2007 xu and guo 2018 hansen et al 2016 our observation further supports these explanations that ha showed a higher mw and aromaticity than adom fig 1a further we compared kinetic k values in our studies with other reports from diverse ecosystems table s8 the k 1 reported in the literature from soil lake and ocean showed a similar order of magnitudes with our observation for algae derived dom however the k 2 values from the literature were lower by at least two orders of magnitudes with our observation for ha thus the discrepancy of k values between the literature and our study implies that lab scale incubation assay for short time e g days biodegradation could better track the fast decaying of the labile fractions in dom vonk et al 2015 cory and kling 2018 nevertheless this experiment remains instructive for those who want to evaluate the short term fate of dom such as exploring the priming effect birch effect or quantifying the labile component of organic matter in addition we observed an elevating degree of degradation in the mixed samples than in the ha alone fig 2a table s6 during the kinetic process this could be partially explained by positive priming effects pe when the two end members are mixed in terrestrial and aquatic systems priming is a vital process in carbon turnover which refers to the changes in the remineralization rate of recalcitrant organic matter in response to the addition of labile carbon guenet et al 2010 bianchi 2011 furthermore we conducted kinetic model fitting to validate whether pe could explain this observed biodegradation trend in this study previously the first order kinetic model within two carbon pools eq 2 was often used to fit the dom biodegradation process parameter f derived from this kinetic model can represent two distinct carbon pools labile versus recalcitrant jiang et al 2018 liu et al 2021 thus this model has also been used to estimate pe hotchkiss et al 2014 cheng et al 2018 we assumed that the degradation of two fractions f a and f b of carbon pools were independent processes without interactions such as pe the k values for the two carbon pools were derived from the end members alone where k 1 and k 2 were 0 17 and 0 42 d 1 respectively the modeled kinetic curves of the mixed samples were re established based on the fixed f value as this study was initially designed representing various mixing ratios f a f b namely 80 20 60 40 40 60 and 20 80 however unlike the observed kinetic curves i e solid blue line in fig 3a the modeled results i e orange solid line in fig 3a showed a significantly lower biodegradation degree this indicates that the biodegradation of f a and f b was not independent and the mixing behavior induced more biodegradation meanwhile we selected an alternative fitting strategy to fix k values and make f float for cross validation considering the two carbon fractions could be inter changed because of pe with increasing adom modeled fa continuously decreased fig 3b and table s7 implying a transfer of recalcitrant carbon into the labile fraction which could further support the possibility of pe accounting for increasing biodegradation while two fractions mixed thus in this study pe readily occurred when the labile component adom was mixed with the refractory pool ha this suggests that labile carbon inputs triggered the degradation of previously refractory carbon furthermore pe is a biological process that is mainly controlled by the microbial community guenet et al 2010 bianchi et al 2015 therefore elevating microbial activity due to labile carbon i e f b input could also substantially enhance the biodegradation of f b itself thus although the addition of autochthonous fraction f b significantly enhanced the biodegradation of ha the increasing trend with f b did not follow the conservative mixing behavior mape 20 but r 2 0 01 fig s5a and table s5 the role of changing microbial community during the kinetic processes in the mixing samples is worth further investigation 3 2 2 free radical production hydroxyl radicals which are strong oxidants in the environment are produced by the photochemical reactions of dom in aquatic or soil systems page et al 2013 maizel et al 2017 it can react with recalcitrant organic matter further influencing carbon turnover pullin et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 and the environmental fate of contaminants chin et al 2004 gligorovski et al 2015 in this study the oh accumulative concentrations in ha were higher 0 43 µmol l 1 than in adom 0 03 µmol l 1 within 24 h light irradiation fig 2b as the ha fraction allochthonous f a increased the oh cumulative production showed a continuously increasing trend fig 2b fig s5b this increasing pattern co varied with the mixing ratios following a conservative mixing behavior mape 20 r2 0 88 the increasing photoreactivity can explain this observation with f a which is mainly attributed to the elevations of the abundance of chromophoric and aromatic components sun and mopper 2016 cory and kling 2018 meanwhile significant positive correlations between a 355 r 0 96 p 0 003 and suva254 r 0 96 p 0 002 and the cumulative oh observed in our study fig s6a and fig s6b are consistent with previous studies reporting that dom samples with the highest aromatic carbon induced the most oh production page et al 2014 grannas et al 2006 this further indicates that the direct photolysis of aromatic carbon components was an essential pathway for oh production goldstone et al 2002 mopper and zhou 1990 thus during the end member mixing process the aromaticity of dom e g suva254 could be a better proxy for predicting its potential for oh production in photodegradation as discussed later 3 2 3 photodegradation the origin of dom is closely associated with its chemical reactivity including its susceptibility to photochemical degradation hernes and benner 2003 hansen et al 2016 the results showed that 46 9 77 4 of dom samples were photodegraded fig 2c table s9 however regarding the kinetic rates k and final degradation degree after 7 days of photodegradation ha was significantly lower photolability than adom table s10 which was corroborated by other studies yang et al 2018 niu and croué 2019 zhou et al 2020 xu et al 2022 essentially aquatic dom of algae origin is enriched in organic nitrogen in the form of amino acids or peptides brown et al 2004 goldberg et al 2015 yang et al 2018 which are more susceptible to photomineralization by direct photolysis and indirect pathways michaeli and feitelson 1994 amado et al 2007 sun et al 2018 than aromatic components however our observation was opposite with some reports that allochthonous i e terrestrial dom shows greater photodegradation because of the abundant cdom pool including lignin phenols and tannins for higher light absorption berggren et al 2022 hernes and benner 2003 spencer et al 2009 cory and kling 2018 in this study we used white light 400 nm to simulate natural sunlight which differred from using a uv spectrum for photodegradation sun et al 2018 reported that under the visible spectrum the degradation of protein like components is more photoreactive than humic like components additionally previous studies have reported that aromatic or high mw dom could be partially photodegraded into aliphatic or low mw organic components without complete mineralization andrews et al 2000 cory et al 2009 2010 ward et al 2014 yang et al 2018 thus in this study the lower photodegradation of ha is likely to be attributed to the fact that ha is only partially photooxidized rather than completely mineralized future works should be necessary to explore the influences of different light irradiation conditions on dom property generally dom photodegradation is divided into two pathways sulzberger and durisch kaiser 2009 cory and kling 2018 namely i direct photochemical transformation and ii indirect photochemical transformation of dom via free radicals such as 3dom 1o2 and oh attack the latter is the main pathway goldstone et al 2002 however regarding the oh production as aforementioned fig s5b and fig s6 we found a decoupling between photodegradation and free radical production this suggests that the higher oh production does not guarantee a corresponding higher dom photodegradation fig 2b and c although oh is commonly formed in aquatic ecosystems photochemical oh formation has been estimated to contribute negligibly to the observed photooxidation of lake dom page et al 2014 ha goldstone et al 2002 and another organic compound bai et al 2021 thus the oh may play only a minor role in the degradation of humic and fulvic substances hefner et al 2006 minor et al 2007 compared to the other critical photoproduced reactive intermediates such as 3dom and 1o2 cory et al 2009 2010 maizel et al 2017 bai et al 2021 the formation pathways of oh differ from 3dom and 1o2 berg et al 2019 more aliphatic composition of dom correlates with higher quantum yields of 3dom and 1o2 maizel et al 2017 maizel et al 2017 found that the production efficiency of 3dom and 1o2 obviously decreased with dom mw which was further supported by similar observations niu and croué 2019 zhou et al 2020 xu et al 2022 in our study s r showed a conservative pattern and inverse relationship with f a fig 1a which implied that the potential of 3dom and 1o2 formation could increase with the autochthonous fractions i e more aliphatic and lmw moieties finally we also observed a priming like phenomenon in photodegradation as in biodegradation photolability for mixing samples increased with the autochthonous fraction f b fig 2c and fig s5c nevertheless the changing pattern of photolability did not follow conservative mixing behavior fig s5c and table s5 furthermore using the same analysis strategy in biodegradation the modeled photodegradation kinetic curves for the mixed samples were re established fig 4a we assumed that the two fractions of carbon pools i e two end members were independent in the photodegradation process unsurprisingly the modeled results showed significantly less photodegradation in contrast to the assumption is similar to the observation in the biodegradation assay alternatively we also fixed k values 0 11 and 0 40 d 1 for ha and adom respectively and assigned f as a floating variable to track the carbon pool changes as compared to the 1 1 line continuous decreases in fa further suggested that the photorefractory dom e g highly aromatic changed into the labile pool e g nitrogen rich components fig 4b thus the above results indicate an interaction between two end members after mixing which was also observed in yang et al 2018 here we explain this priming like phenomenon in dom photodegradation fig 2c and fig s5c by the dual role of f a the allochthonous fraction due to the high aromatic and humified components which is a tradeoff between 1 i e enhancement high light absorption inducing higher photoreactivity and 2 i e inhibition intra quenching effect and the photorefractory property itself previous studies suggested that a high aromatic fraction of dom e g phenolics as an antioxidant aeschbacher et al 2012 could also play a key role in suppressing photodegradation by quenching free radicals goldstone et al 2002 page et al 2014 ward and cory 2016 thus when f b the autochthonous fraction increases the relative dilution could decrease the quenching effect conversely elevated 3dom and 1o2 with f b could further enhance the degradation we should note that there is lower photodegradation in adom f a 0 than in the mixed samples excepting m 4 f a 80 this is because less light absorption in adom supported by the lower a 355 as observed fig 1 3 2 4 redox capacity redox capacity including edc and eac is an essential biogeochemical reaction of dom kappler et al 2004 peretyazhko and sposito 2006 aeschbacher et al 2012 yang et al 2022 and is defined by its ability to shuttle electrons as a donor or an acceptor redox properties of dom heavily impact the carbon turnover keller et al 2009 rush et al 2021 and the environmental fates of contaminants such as heavy metals gu et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 2020 the edc and eac and electron transfer capacity etc equal to eac plus edc of all samples are shown in fig 2d the eac and edc of the dom samples ranged from 0 24 to 3 89 mmole g c 1 and 0 51 to 6 97 mmole g c 1 respectively both parameters decreased as the autochthonous fraction increased fig 2d the autochthonous end member adom showed the lowest edc 0 51 mmole g c 1 and eac 0 24 mmole g c 1 similarly aeschbacher et al 2012 reported that the fa of pony lake plfa 1r109f a typical autochthonous dom sample sampled from an antarctica lake showed the lowest eac 0 93 mmole g c 1 and edc 0 92 mmole g c 1 among their tested om samples this observation could be explained by the allochthonous dom having a higher condensed aromatic structure e g phenolic and quinone groups aeschbacher et al 2012 previous studies have illustrated that electron accepting quinone and electron donating phenolic moieties are the primary redox active moieties controlling changes in dom redox capacity aeschbacher et al 2012 walpen et al 2018 yang et al 2022 additionally suva254 values can be used to indicate quinone groups in dom cory and mcknight 2005 thus it is unsurprising that the significant positive correlation between eac and suva254 suggests that quinone is the primary electron accepting moiety in the dom samples r 0 93 p 0 008 fig s6d furthermore regarding the variations in mixing ratios we observed a similar changing pattern of edc to oh production a significant positive correlation was observed between edc and oh r 0 98 p 0 001 fig s6c edc is attributed to phenolic molecules which play a prominent role in oh formation page et al 2013 berg et al 2019 however in contrast to edc mape 18 92 and r 2 0 88 the changes in eac in response to the mixing ratio variations showed an obvious deviation from conservative behavior mape 61 68 and r 2 0 64 fig s7 table s5 this scenario suggests that phenolic moieties are more likely to preserve the conservative mixing behavior than quinone moieties 3 3 responses of dom reactivities to characteristic changes due to two end member mixing to further clarify the influence of changes in dom characteristics responding to the end member mixing on its biogeochemical reactivities a partial mantel test was conducted fig 5 the results indicated that dom properties except for peak c significantly affected the oh production and redox capacity including eac edc and etc mantel s p 0 05 and mantel s r 0 4 however regarding the photodegradation and biodegradation except for humic like peaks peaks a c and m the other optical parameters were not statistically significant mantel s p 0 05 and mantel s r 0 4 the significant correlations suggest that the role of some dom properties in controlling its reactivity is general and independent of the mixing behavior in particular higher terrestrial fraction i e f a samples showed higher redox and free radical production reactivity this also supports our previous findings that terrestrial input is so vital that it predominantly influences the role of dom in the environmental fate of contaminants jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2022 conversely the decoupling relationship between some spectral indices e g suva254 fi and hix and the reactivity matrix i e photodegradation and biodegradation may be attributed to the interactive effect e g pe induced by the mixing behavior these results revealed that different dom reactivities respond differently to variations in their properties not all dom characteristics could be applicable to indicate the changes in dom reactivities in the mixing process thus simply predicting reactivity using dom characteristics especially in the scenario of end member mixing must be carefully considered and interpreted additionally to further evaluate the performances of dom spectral parameters in indicating the changing reactivities during the mixing process the terminology of stability was proposed to describe a stable performance we defined the stability of dom spectral parameters to evaluate dom reactivities by two rules including 1 general applicability at least common to two reactivities and 2 following the conservative mixing model meanwhile based on the mantel test fig 5 results we categorized the correlated parameters into three types using a venn diagram which indicates that they commonly have correlations with two three and four reactivities fig 6 for example peaks a and m were significantly correlated with all reactivities i e the highest general applicability therefore both are indicators common to the four reactivities on the other hand peaks a and m also follow the conservative mixing model therefore both can be recognized as the most stable indicators to evaluate dom reactivities irrespective of the two end member mixings in contrast in the cluster of dom spectral parameters common to two reactivities only a 355 suva254 and s r were stable indicators furthermore the relative contributions of these stable spectral indices fig 6 to the variations of each biogeochemical reactivity during the end member mixing process were calculated by stepwise regression analysis of all stable indices humic like peak c was found to have the most profound contribution to explaining the variations of biodegradation negatively 71 photodegradation negatively 66 and redox capacities positively 90 fig 7 interactions between two end members in biodegradation and photodegradation significantly influence the contributions of peak c as compared to in redox capacities additionally for oh production suva254 correlates with aromaticity explaining 94 of the reactivity variation the results support those field findings from diverse dom samples that the characteristic parameters relevant to terrestrial inputs e g peak c and suva254 can be reliable indicators for dom reactivities bieroza et al 2009 maizel et al 2017 mckay et al 2017 manivannan and borisover 2020 wang et al 2021 2022 notably this finding further suggests that the terrestrial end member is relatively predominant when compared to the autochthonous source in affecting the dynamics of dom reactivity additionally because dom spectral measurement is relatively simple the two parameters could be used as rapid predictors for tracking the changes in dom s reactivity during the mixing process however concerning the increases of terrestrial end member inputs into waters induced by climate change and escalating anthropogenic interference further work is needed to verify the predictive role of peak c and suva254 for dom reactivity in field investigations however regarding the stable performance of peak a and m in contrast to peak c and suva254 fig 6 the stable performance of the index does not necessarily mean it is the main contributor these indicators are more widely applied in estimating various reactivities but may reduce their predictability for a specific reactivity thus currently a universal model cannot be proposed and a main contributor should be identified first before further predictions of the given reactivity are made 3 4 environmental implications in environmental systems end member mixing is an essential geophysical process influencing the variations of dom characteristics perdue and koprivnjak 2007 yang and hur 2014 solomon et al 2015 xenopoulos et al 2021 thus understanding the variations of dom characteristics in response to changes in the origins of inputs is a critical step in further evaluating the environmental role and functional traits of dom in diverse ecosystems our study revealed that the variations in dom composition due to mixing the two end member fractions significantly impact its biogeochemical reactivity however mixing effects of the two fractions on reactivity cannot be generalized in particular the non conservative changing patterns of the bio photodegradation potentials observed due to the possible interaction of the two fractions after mixing further illustrate that the biogeochemical complexities of dom act unlike our expectations of simply conservative behavior thus it is not appropriate to evaluate and predict the dom biogeochemical reactivities through simply plus or minus of reactivity from individual end member fractions furthermore it should be emphasized that the terminology recalcitrant and labile widely used to describe dom s low quality and high quality especially in the biodegradation process are relative and floating our observations suggest that the recalcitrant to labile concepts refer to a continuum and could only be validly evaluated on given circumstances and spatiotemporal scale however the changing patterns of dom reactivities highlighted in this study imply that the role of dom is a function of ecosystem properties rather than being only associated with intrinsic characteristics schmidt et al 2011 bianchi et al 2015 secondly in the anthropocene aquatic ecosystems extensively experience stress from anthropogenic activities such as land use change dam construction and nutrient pollution those influences substantially change dom composition and characteristics by affecting the inputs loads of terrestrial and microbial algal source dom xenopoulos et al 2021 for example dam reservoir building and consequent formation of impoundments may serve as a mixing tank for dom derived from the two end members and eutrophication could promote the autochthonous fraction in aquatic dom additionally permafrost thawing and more frequent precipitation due to climate change can lead to increasing terrestrial inputs which could substantially elevate the allochthonous fraction of dom in neighboring aquatic systems peterson et al 2002 wikner and andersson 2012 bauer et al 2013 solomon et al 2015 consequently the dom biogeochemical reactivities would be changing considering the end member mixing effect finally in this study we found that not all dom characteristic parameters could be applicable for evaluating the dynamics of dom reactivity the potential influences of the mixing process on dom characteristics and reactivities need further investigations and dom spectral indices can be used to obtain more reliable clues for clarifying the relationship between dom properties and its reactivities as well as enhance the predictability meanwhile as implied in this study the complexity of mixing driven two fraction interactions in dom suggests that understanding the end member mixing drive changes in dom reactivities will require more comprehensive research that is both mechanistic and holistic 4 conclusion dissolved organic matter play a critical role in diverse ecosystems especially in the aquatic environment furthermore the variations of dom reactivities are influenced by varying contributions from two end members and were evaluated in this study the results showed that the variations of dom characteristics due to the two end members mixing significantly impact the biogeochemical reactivity of the mixture which partially validates our hypothesis however not all spectral parameters and reactivities followed the expected conservative mixing behavior consequently the effect of end member mixing on dom biogeochemistry cannot be generalized in contrast to reactivities of oh production and redox capacity mixed samples showed apparent deviations from conservative linear relationships for the biodegradation and photodegradation due to the interaction between the two end members these findings have significant implications that the dynamics of dom result in variations in reactivity that cannot be estimated merely by the simple 1 1 2 mode thus it is only possible to make estimations specific reactivities by accounting for the performance of an individual end member for instance redox capacity and free radical production additionally of all indices for dom characteristics peak a and m showed the most stable performance for estimating the dynamics of dom reactivity however this does not necessarily mean they are the predominant parameters controlling the reactivity in contrast peak c and suva254 were identified as the contributors most able to explain dom reactivity variations thus regarding the dynamic relationship between the dom source and its reactivity the key contributor of dom property should be identified first before further predictions are made regarding the reactivity therefore in future work more comprehensive studies particularly field investigations are needed to explore the link between dom sources and their biogeochemical reactivity this may help to further clarify the responses of the functional role of dom to varying environmental conditions in diverse ecosystems especially in the context of climate

15032,poly 3 hydroxybutyrate phb was accumulated in full scale municipal waste activated sludge at pilot scale after accumulation the fate of the phb rich biomass was evaluated over two weeks as a function of initial ph 5 5 7 0 and 10 and incubation temperature 25 37 and 55 c with or without aeration phb became consumed under aerobic conditions as expected with first order rate constants in the range of 0 19 to 0 55 d 1 under anaerobic conditions up to 63 percent of the phb became consumed within the first day initial ph 7 55 c subsequently with continued anaerobic conditions the polymer content remained stable in the biomass degradation rates were lower for acidic anaerobic incubation conditions at a lower temperature 25 c polymer thermal properties were measured in the dried phb rich biomass and for the polymer recovered by solvent extraction using dimethyl carbonate phb quality changes in dried biomass indicated by differences in polymer melt enthalpy correlated to differences in the extent of phb extractability differences in the expressed phb in biomass melt enthalpy that correlated to the polymer extractability suggested that yields of polymer recovery by extraction can be influenced by the state or quality of the polymer generated during downstream processing different post accumulation process biomass management environments were found to influence the polymer quality and can also influence the extraction of non polymer biomass an acidic post accumulation environment resulted in higher melt enthalpies in the biomass and consequently higher extraction efficiencies overall acidic environmental conditions were found to be favourable for preserving both quantity and quality after phb accumulation in activated sludge graphical abstract keywords polyhydroxyalkanoate pha poly 3 hydroxybutyrate phb waste activated sludge biopolymer downstream processing polymer properties data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction polyhydroxyalkanoates phas are a family of naturally occurring polyesters that accumulate intracellularly in many species of microorganisms as an endogenous organic substrate dawes and senior 1973 these microorganisms accumulate pha when they are subject to dynamic environments when for example surplus organic carbon sources become suddenly available while other growth factors such as nitrogen and phosphorus are limiting van loosdrecht et al 1997 majone et al 1999 reis et al 2003 phas can be accumulated in microbial biomass within engineered bioprocesses to significant levels 040 to 090 grams pha per gram organic mass estévez alonso et al 2021 accumulated intracellular pha can be extracted and purified purified phas exhibit thermoplastic properties similar to fossil derived polyesters raza et al 2018 compared to fossil based plastics plastics made from pha are bio based and can be completely biodegradable thus phas are an anticipated renewable resource for use in applications especially where biodegradation is required phas are produced commercially today with pure culture methods using refined substrates and sterilisation pha plastics compete with a higher selling price compared to conventional petroleum derived plastics and this limits pha market penetration plastics europe 2020 vandi et al 2018 cost reduction has been an underlying motivation driving much fundamental research and development in methods and processes for pha production over the past two decades much advancement has been made in the use of open culture production methods and waste organic residuals for substrates as a principal strategy to reduce pha production costs estévez alonso et al 2021 reis et al 2003 municipal biological wastewater treatment processes produce significant amounts of waste activated sludge municipal activated sludge can exhibit a significant degree of enrichment for the pha storing phenotype and can be directly used for pha accumulation pei et al 2022c and estévez alonso et al 2021 pha accumulating bacteria can exist in the waste activated sludge due to the dynamics in the process environments or dynamics in daily loading conditions which make metabolism involving polymer storage inherently a good selective strategy for survival van loosdrecht et al 1997 in recent years technical viability for using waste activated sludge for pha production has progressed from lab to pilot scale estévez alonso et al 2021 bengtsson et al 2017 valentino et al 2018 pilot scale production trials have exhibited stable outcomes in quantity and quality of polymers produced with average biomass pha content with respect to volatile solids vs of 0 4gpha gvs estévez alonso et al 2021 reis et al 2003 more recent investigations suggest expectations for optimal waste activated sludge accumulation to reach about 0 64gpha gvs which is similar to typical expectations in general for both pure and open culture production methods alike pei et al 2022a the direct use of activated sludge for pha production has two main process components pha accumulation and downstream processing dsp pha accumulation is an aerobic bioprocess where the activated sludge is fed with a volatile fatty acid vfa rich substrate to reach the maximum possible biomass pha content dsp starts after pha accumulation with steps to separate process water and recover a purified pha from the biomass suspended solids dsp methods are less well understood for the up scaling of open culture pha production and are a current knowledge gap needed for industrial scale developments estévez alonso et al 2021 dsp steps are critical to preserving polymer quantity and quality within the harvested post accumulation pha rich biomass and contribute heavily to the overall process economics werker et al 2020 kourmentza et al 2017 published research developments for dsp are commonly focused on specific purification steps towards this aim comparisons are made for different approaches or conditions for smaller subsamples from a batch of pha rich biomass preserved directly after accumulation by laboratory scale centrifugation followed by thermal drying or lyophilisation however the fate of the pha directly after accumulation and the stability of the freshly made product has not been systematically studied microorganisms metabolise pha not only during starvation but also to mitigate stresses müller santos et al 2021 changes in environmental conditions i e osmotic pressure oxygen level ph and temperature after pha accumulation can also promote pha mass loss and property changes abiotic random scission due to β elimination in the presence of h or oh will reduce molecular weight lauzier et al 1994 intracellular and extracellular pha depolymerases are anticipated to still be active directly after the pha accumulation process intracellular pha depolymerases that are integral to the surface of the pha granules jendrossek 2009 they are reported to act on intracellular pha in its so called native amorphous hydrated state jendrossek 2009 oeding and schlegel 1973 ong et al 2017 meanwhile extracellular depolymerases are understood to degrade pha from denatured granules from lysed cells and for this semi crystalline polymer in nature ong et al 2017 jendrossek and handrick 2002 directly after the pha accumulation process in the absence of any cell lysis pha will be stored intracellularly in host cells as bioactive functioning granules therefore factors and environments that can influence the level of intracellular pha depolymerase activity should at least initially determine the polymer fate the metabolism of intracellular pha degradation is still not completely clear for poly 3 hydroxybutyrate phb the depolymerase enzyme hydrolysis leads to 3 hydroxybutyrate or 3 hydroxybutyryl coenzyme a and then enters the β oxidation cycle to be further metabolised eggers and steinbüchel 2013 uchino et al 2007 gebauer and jendrossek 2006 jendrossek and handrick 2002 the degradation process may require the activation of released 3 hydroxybutyrate to 3 hydroxybutyryl coenzyme a which is an energy consuming reaction eggers and steinbüchel 2013 the intracellular depolymerase activity level can be influenced by environmental conditions and or polymer properties environmental conditions such as temperature ph and oxygen concentration can affect enzyme production activity and stability due to enzyme substrate specificity research on intracellular depolymerase properties requires native pha granules which can be challenging to isolate jendrossek and handrick 2002 hence it is not straightforward to systematically evaluate optimum temperatures or ph levels for all possible and potentially different intracellular depolymerase activities during the initial steps of dsp material management methods can include a need in the logistics to stage the freshly produced pha rich biomass with temporary storage handling and time scales of the industrial processes before the final dsp steps of purification can result in pha mass and property losses for example even heating rates in biomass thermal drying significantly influence product molecular weight estévez alonso et al 2022 the risks for polymer loss and property changes directly after the pha accumulation may be expected to be negligible in gram laboratory and even kilogramme pilot scale pha production research and development work due to the relatively low volumes and masses of material to be handled the steps of dsp can be managed quickly minutes to a few hours at the industrial scale with significantly higher expected process volumes and masses of material to handle duty cycles for each fresh batch will be longer hours to days pha rich biomass can be produced at a number of distributed sites and at least some dsp steps including final drying can be handled more centrally with improved scale of economy as done today for municipal sludge management therefore the transport of dewatered pha rich biomass may benefit the production economics quicker handling requires higher throughput larger equipment and associated capital costs smaller equipment would require that pha rich biomass be temporarily stored in dsp feed tanks the stability of the pha in the fresh crude product of accumulated pha rich biomass has not been reported in the research literature the effects of time and environmental conditions in the storage of pha rich biomass fate are overlooked therefore it was of interest to explicitly evaluate how well freshly accumulated pha survived this stage with environmental conditions from acidic to basic ph mesophilic to thermophilic temperatures and with or without the presence of oxygen for the present investigation the effect of environmental conditions ph temperature aeration on the fate of freshly accumulated phb in municipal activated sludge was evaluated a pilot scale process was operated with an acetic acid feedstock to yield a phb rich biomass the harvested phb rich biomass mixed liquor was divided into parallel batches parallel batches were ph adjusted and incubated at selected temperatures with and without aeration sampling and monitoring of polymer fate over time for mass balances and property evaluations were undertaken and interpreted as reported herein 2 materials and methods 2 1 phb accumulation waste activated sludge was obtained from bath wastewater treatment plant wwtp rilland bath the netherlands this wwtp treats a mixture of municipal and industrial influent wastewater for 470 000 person equivalents the wwtp includes primary treatment followed by a modified ludzack ettinger activated sludge biological process phosphorus is removed by fecl 3 precipitation batches of fresh grab samples of gravity belt thickened was 56 7gts l were taken and delivered on september 5 th november 4 th and december 3 rd 2019 the thickened waste activated sludge was stored at 5 c pending its use in accumulation experiments accumulation production experiments were performed with respective batches on september 25 th november 5 th and december 4 th 2019 the freshly accumulated phb rich biomass was the starting material used for the principal incubation experiments control incubation experiments were also performed with the same activated sludge but without any polymer accumulation the feedstock for phb rich biomass production was 20gcod l acetic acid vwr the netherlands with added nh 4 cl and kh 2 po 4 vwr the netherlands for a cod n p by weight of 100 1 0 05 the ph was adjusted to 5 0 0 5 with naoh vwr the netherlands the use of acetic acid ensured that the produced polymer was phb lemos et al 2006 the pilot scale accumulation process was carried out in a jacketed stainless steel 200l reactor with 167l working volume as described in pei et al 2022a figure s1 accumulation experiments were initiated by loading the reactor with a set mass of the thickened waste activated sludge that was diluted with tap water to a starting suspended solids concentration of about 4gvss l the reactor was operated at 25 c with constant mixing 230rpm and aeration 50l min before the accumulation process started a period of steady aeration was applied for about 12h hours to reach a steady level of endogenous respiration this steady level was determined from respiration levels based on the dissolved oxygen trends pei et al 2022a the accumulation process was fed batch with a constant process volume and constant aeration aeration maintained dissolved oxygen levels over 1 mg o 2 l reactor volume continuous circulation through a clarifier 16l maintained a constant overall process volume with retention of the suspended solids the substrate was pumped in discrete pulses of a fixed volume to target peak pulse substrate concentrations of 100mgcod l pulse input timing was from feedback control that was triggered by respiration level monitoring based on dissolved oxygen trend measurements jumo ecoline o do jumo gmbh co kg germany as previously described by werker et al 2020 the process started with an acclimation step morgan sagastume et al 2017 using three acclimation pulses as previously reported pei et al 2022b after the third acclimation cycle the accumulation process was directly started during accumulation feed pulses were given intact with the substrate uptake rate based on dissolved oxygen trends and the tight series of input pulses were thereby given without excess substrate supply and build up in the reactor over 20 h 2 2 phb rich biomass incubation experiments three replicate batches of phb rich biomass were produced and used directly after 20 h accumulation for the purposes of the incubation experiments accumulation was terminated by switching off aeration but mechanical mixing was sustained to maintain a well mixed liquor after accumulations ph was around 8 and since a final pulse of the substrate was given before aeration was terminated the initial background acetic acid concentration was about 100mgcod l for each incubation experiment three 10l grab samples of mixed liquor were taken from the accumulation reactor the initial ph of the grab samples was adjusted to ph 55 7 and 10 using 1m hcl or 1m naoh respectively during the incubation experiment ph was thereafter monitored but not further controlled respective batches of ph adjusted mixed liquor were then distributed in replicate 170ml aliquots to 21 250ml stoppered serum bottles and 9 500ml erlenmeyer flasks with silicone sponge stopper serum bottle headspace was exchanged with nitrogen gas with overpressure to establish and maintain anaerobic incubation conditions a discofix one way stopcock b braun germany together with a 40mm needle was

after the initial re drying before solvent addition the polymer film thermal properties were characterised by tga and dsc as described below the dried ground biomass solids and the extracted phb films were assessed by tga tga 2 metller toledo switzerland for biomass phb content and thermal stability chan et al 2017 representative sub samples of about 5 and 2 mg of dried biomass or recovered polymer

samples were inserted into the tga at 80 c with nitrogen purge gas at 50ml min the temperature was increased 10 c min to 105 c and held for 15 min drying wherein removed moisture or residual solvent weight could be estimated temperature was increased 10 c min to 550 c and held for 30 min phb mass could be estimated from the characteristic rapid mass loss occurring between 225 and 350 c at 550 c the purge gas was changed to air at 50ml min sample ash content was estimated from the weight lost after incubation at 550 c with air atmosphere after 30 min the biomass phb content as gphb gvss was derived from the background corrected characteristic polymer decomposition peak detectable from the derivative thermogravimetric trend as described in chan et al 2017 using in house matlab data processing algorithms mathworks ma usa non phb biomass npb was estimated as vss minus phb mass subsequently the mass ratio of phb and non phb biomass f phb was calculated reference samples included pha rich biomass with known polymer content 45 1 0 6 gpha gvss and pure phb 98 purity biomer germany instrument temperature measurement was calibrated based on curie temperature with a nickel standard following mettler toledo methods differential scanning calorimetry dsc 3 mettler toledo switzerland of the polymer in the dried biomass and extracted films was performed based on previously described methods chan et al 2017 about 5 and 2 mg dried biomass and recovered polymer were used from each sample respectively weighed samples in vented crucibles were inserted and held for 5 min at 70 c with nitrogen purge gas at 50 ml min a first heat and quench cycle followed with heating and cooling at 10 c min to 185 c and back to 70 c a second heat ramp at 10 c min to 185 c was applied followed by

heated at 10 c min to 40 c melt and crystallisation enthalpies were estimated with respect to the mass of phb in the sample estimated from tga measurements for the same samples reference samples

indium standards according to mettler toledo methods statistical analyses including multilinear regression and t tests were performed with graphpad prism version 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 incubation and preservation of accumulated phb quantity three batches of pilot scale phb rich biomass were produced the measured maximum biomass polymer contents at the end of 20 h of accumulation were 0 37 0 53 and 0 50gphb gvss respectively each batch of the phb rich biomass was characterised by elemental analysis to obtain a representative estimate of the npb cod content for making cod mass balances acetic acid results in the accumulation of phb and the elemental composition of phb is c 4 h 6 o 2 for phb 1 67 gcod gphb is applied combining information of vs and phb contents with elemental analysis the non phb biomass compositions were estimated and found to be consistent between batches as shown in table 1 the average cod of the npb was found to be 1 36gcod gnpb and this value was applied in the cod mass balance evaluations the npb composition and theoretical cod conversion factor are similar to what was reported in the literature ranging from 1 37 to 1 48gcod gnpb chen et al 2020 trends in development for biomass phb content are typically expressed as phb concentration over the total vss concentration during accumulation in the research literature this ratio is indicative of the performance of the active biomass during an accumulation process towards reaching a steady relative level of the accumulated polymer in the biomass it is the value measured directly by tga alternatively the phb to npb ratio shows trends of the relative fate of phb with respect to npb biomass phb content is converted to a phb to npb ratio as follows 1 f p h b phb mass npb mass phb content 1 phb content the phb to npb ratio on a cod basis was estimated with the conversion factors for phb 1 67 gcod gphb and for npb 1 36 gcod gnpb from the elemental analyses the phb to non phb biomass ratio f phb reported on the relative gain or loss of phb with respect to non phb biomass solids during aerobic or anaerobic incubations typical results of trends are shown for the phb to npb ratios in the set of incubations for initial ph 7 for aerobic or anaerobic conditions at selected temperatures fig 1 similar plots of results for the other initial ph sets of incubations are provided as supplementary information figure s3 and figure s4 under aerobic conditions without further exogenous substrate supply after phb accumulation intracellular phb is expected to be consumed the trends of consumption as shown in fig 1 and si were fitted to the model of a shrinking particle with least squares regression analysis in this model phb removal rate decreases asymptotically following a 2 3 power law as a function of f phb tamis et al 2014 the integrated rate function solved for f phb is as follows 2 f p h b f 0 3 1 3 k t c x 0 c x 1 3 3 where f phb is phb to non phb biomass ratio cod basis f 0 is the initial phb to non phb biomass ratio c x0 c x is the ratio between the initial and final non phb biomass for fitting the model eq 2 was linearised and the experimentally determined average f phb and c x0 c x values from replicate experiments as a function of time were used to estimate the rate constant k and intercept f 0 by linear regression analysis eq 3 3 f p h b 3 f 0 3 k 1 3 t c x 0 c x 1 3 as illustrated in fig 1 a and si and similarly for all the initial ph conditions and temperatures with aerobic incubation the shrinking particle model represented the decay of phb mass to negligible levels the aerobic groups served as the benchmark for the polymer fate due to an expected depolymerase activity stimulated by famine conditions and influenced due to different environmental conditions of initial ph and temperature tamis et al 2014 the estimated rate constant k from the model distinguished between levels of depolymerase activity due to initial ph and temperature table 2 rate constant k ranged from 0 19 to 0 55 d 1 depending on the initial ph and temperature the k value for the initial ph 7 and 25 c was similar to the k value reported by koller et al 2015 in which pure culture pha rich biomass was incubated aerobically at ph 7 and room temperature in the current study alkaline ph consistently exhibited relatively higher k values for any given incubation temperature for initial ph 5 5 and 7 groups the rate constant k increased when the temperature increased from 25 c to 37 c and then decreased when the temperature further increased to 55 c for the initial ph 10 group the rate constant k increased from 25 c to 37 c then remained at a similar level when the temperature further increased to 55 c within three temperature conditions the maximum depolymerase activity is the highest between 25 and 55 c mild acidic conditions and elevated temperatures also stimulated higher depolymerase activities relative to neutral initial ph conditions therefore for an activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant with operating ph between 7 and 8 and temperatures between 15 and 30 c mild stresses in ph and temperature in combination with oxygen supply are detrimental to the objectives of polymer product conservation henze 1997 however if aeration cannot be avoided then acidic conditions and lower temperatures are preferred using the same starting phb rich biomass the incubations under strictly anaerobic conditions showed a different kind of characteristic trend fig 1 b compared to the aerobic benchmark cases fig 1 a since the polymer metabolism due to depolymerase activity requires energy anaerobic conditions under famine were expected to inhibit excessive polymer loss as predicted by the aerobic model described by eq 2 however on the contrary an initial loss in the relative amount of phb was observed over the first day before the phb level with respect to non phb biomass became stabilised over at least 8 days of continued incubation even under anaerobic conditions a limited amount of the accumulated polymer became rapidly metabolised to estimate for differences in the effect of environmental conditions on the initial relative anaerobic phb loss an average degradation rate over the first day was estimated for f phb and is summarised in table 3 the activated sludge used in the present study was a nitrification denitrification biomass this activated sludge is anticipated to be dominated by obligate or facultative aerobic microorganisms therefore anaerobic conditions would be expected to inhibit depolymerase activity due to a lack of energy flow to kick off the metabolism jendrossek 2009 oeding and schlegel 1973 ong et al 2017 lower temperatures and neutral or mild acidic conditions offered the greatest degree of polymer preservation one of the possible reasons for higher or lower initial albeit limited degradation rate under anaerobic conditions could be due to an imposed environmental stress on the freshly accumulated phb rich biomass to deal with stress microorganisms may metabolise pha müller santos et al 2021 this ability and extent of losses seem to be further influenced by initial ph and temperature under alkaline conditions rates of loss are indicated to be highest between 25 and 55 c however under neutral or mildly acidic conditions the extent of loss is observed to have increased with temperatures up to 55 c and decreased with lower ph these results support that lower ph is preferred to limit the extent of polymer degradation the phb to non phb biomass f phb indicated the depolymerase activity level and the relative change of phb if anaerobic incubation were effective in solubilising npb then f phb would be expected to increase in time however in the balance after initial phb losses and up to 8 days of incubation the amount of phb relative to npb remained stable a cod mass balance on phb was applied to determine if this stability corresponded to the absolute or relative preservation of the accumulated polymer in the phb rich biomass the concentration of polymer for each sampling time was calculated from the cod mass balance 4 tcod scod cod npb cod phb where tcod and scod were measured and the cod ratio of phb and npb were determined from tga measurements coupled to phb and estimated npb cod content per unit mass since the three different accumulation batches started with different absolute phb concentrations relative phb concentrations with respect to the initial level are reported enabling a direct comparison of trends fig 2 figure s5 and figure s6 for the aerobic group trends of phb concentration fig 2 a figure s5 and figure s6 reflect the trends of f phb fig 1 a over 2 weeks the amount of the polymer decreased to negligible levels 4 5 of initial phb irrespective of environmental conditions applied aerobically phb is expected to be hydrolysed into 3 hydroxybutyrate and then converted to co 2 jendrossek and handrick 2002 phb levels under anaerobic conditions fig 2 b figure s5 and figure s6 exhibited an initial rapid decrease of up to 82 of phb cod within the first few days in control experiment 2 phb powder was incubated with water at acidic neutral and alkaline ph for more than 30 days and no 3 hydroxybutyrate or vfas were measured this confirmed that the phb hydrolysis was slow without microbial activity present it also supports that the initial rapid phb loss was due to biological activity after the fast initial degradation the polymer amount stabilised therefore both phb concentrations and npb concentrations remained constant this observation is similar to what was reported by shamsul huda et al 2013 and huda et al 2016 methanogenesis onset was observed for the cases of initial ph of 10 at 37 and 55 c after about 8 days with the onset of methanogenesis phb losses resumed losses over time during anaerobic incubation of both phb and npb suspended solids may suggest lysis of some phb containing biomass as it was also discussed by huda et al 2016 selective staining and microscopy methods have revealed different morphotypes of pha storing microorganisms also expressing differences in cell rigidity pei et al 2022b not all cell types will be equally robust to environmental stress and this is therefore a challenge for downstream processing of mixed culture biomass optimal conditions for polymer quality preservation and recovery for some morphotypes may result in undue losses or conversely reduced yields for recovery from other morphotypes anaerobic conditions with exogenously supplied phb in control experiment 1 resulted in rapid complete removal of added polymer powder after an initial lag phase with an initial ph of 7 figure s7 the lag phase was longer and the degradation rate was slower given an initial ph of 10 the lag phase was also prolonged with an initial ph of 5 5 exogenous phb was readily degraded as illustrated by control experiment 1 figure s7 and endogenous phb remained stable for several days under anaerobic conditions notwithstanding conditions that promoted an initial degree of polymer metabolisation thus at least a fraction of the phb rich biomass can remain robustly intact and stored polymer contents can be preserved anaerobically exploration for mechanisms and methods for mitigating the observed metabolisation of polymer mass is part of the ongoing investigation the main fermentation products during anaerobic incubation were acetate butyrate and propionate phb degradation is understood to follow steps starting with depolymerase activity releasing 3 hydroxybutyrate however no build up of 3 hydroxybutyrate was measured only volatile fatty acid formation similar to the results reported by huda et al 2016 soluble hydrolysis products may be released if host cells hydrolyse an excess of phb and cannot metabolise it further under anaerobic conditions these soluble products are readily fermented into acetate and butyrate the theoretical levels of acetate and butyrate formation were estimated based on loss of phb and the expected stoichiometry 2ch 3 chohch 2 coo 2ch 3 coo ch 3 ch 2 2coo h for the extracellular depolymerase activity as reported by stieb and schink 1984 in the control incubation experiment 1 the exogenous supplied phb formed acetate and butyrate following the stoichiometry reported by stieb and schink 1984 for the phb rich biomass incubations as shown in table s1 the predicted levels of butyrate were similar to the measured butyrate concentration for acetate the measured concentration was higher compared to the predicted levels these results suggested that butyrate formation was due to phb fermentation the acetate levels were due to both phb and npb fermentation during anaerobic incubations shamsul huda et al 2013 huda et al 2016 the propionate only came from npb fermentation confirmation of the interpreted phb transformation would require further experiments one approach could be using stable isotopes as tracers the fermentation products during phb rich biomass anaerobic incubation experiments suggested that intracellular phb or the metabolites of phb may become released to the matrix and are rapidly fermented in control experiment 3 where phb powder was incubated with commercially available lipase enzyme an increasing level of 3 hydroxybutyrate was observed figure s8 this suggests that extracellular phb hydrolysis can be carried out by generic enzymes that react to ester bonds anaerobic conditions naturally preserved the accumulated phb for a period of time better than aerobic conditions however even in the best case scenario initial ph 7 and 25 c around 42 of the polymer was lost within the experimental period therefore for temporary staging with storage or transportation of the phb rich biomass anaerobic conditions alone are not sufficient and results support that lower temperatures or ph levels need to be applied shortly after the accumulation process is terminated in previous work up to pilot scale phb rich biomass acidification down to ph 2 has been applied to induce higher polymer thermal stability before final dewatering and drying werker et al 2020 however even for this lower ph acidification treatment and wet biomass storage at 4 c molecular weight loss still occurred at a quite slow but measurable rate selective staining with confocal microscopy evaluation was applied to phb rich biomass incubated anaerobically with initial ph of 5 5 at 55 c over 14 days as shown in fig 3 the selective staining revealed a dominance of intact cell structures containing pha granules pei et al 2022b therefore preserved phb presented as still being intracellular after the anaerobic incubation pei et al 2022b neglecting the initial anaerobic phb degradation intracellular phb preservation was found to be possible due to a lack of oxygen supply intracellular depolymerase activity levels were influenced by ph and temperature but were not prevented when oxygen was supplied it has also been reported that environmental conditions can cause pha granules to coalesce and become disrupted as functioning carbonosomes sedlacek et al 2019b the crystallisation of the polymer is reported to ensue upon dehydration but before that the polymer in a hydrated amorphous structure may form crystalline associations like a gel which could impede the intracellular depolymerase activity porter and yu 2011b obruca et al 2017 meanwhile the granules within intact cells may remain kept away from extracellular depolymerases which were anyway found to be inhibited by acidic conditions 3 2 incubation and changes to accumulated phb extractability the observed trends of phb concentration illustrated in fig 2 b could be a mixture of effects including discussed changes in granule structure or function in situ polymer crystallisation depolymerase activity attenuation with time and cell function losses due to prolonged anaerobic incubation increased temperatures to the thermophilic range are reported to induce changes in polymer morphology but will also increase depolymerase activity levels effects of ph on inferred in situ pha crystallisation have not been conclusive porter and yu 2011b a a higher crystallisation rate with alkaline conditions than neutral and acidic ph has been reported but results of opposite trends with ph are also published sedlacek et al 2019a porter and yu 2011a it is not a trivial matter to measure for changes in the polymer nature in situ without altering the polymer as a consequence of the measurement approach exploration of approaches is part of the ongoing investigation the present study processed biomass samples using a standardised acidic wash and thermal drying protocol even if sample processing influences the polymer nature it was interesting to observe if the incubation with different applied environmental conditions would result in systematic trends of polymer quality in the biomass differences in polymer quality due to the incubation were assessed based on thermal decomposition temperature t d polymer melt enthalpy δ h m and extractability thermal properties were assessed for the polymer in the dried biomass and for the extracted polymer an advantage of phb for the present investigation is that the homopolymer normally exhibits a relatively high crystallinity and crystallisation rate laycock et al 2014 this behaviour enables the evaluation of the melt and crystallisation behaviour of the polymer even in dried biomass samples results are summarised in table 4 acidic washing of the pha rich biomass is a method to enhance thermal stability chan et al 2017 the t d for the phb in the biomass was consistent at 286 2 c incubation did not influence the ability to harmonise for similarly enhanced polymer thermal stability before solvent extraction neglecting a measurement outlier ph 7 and 55 c extraction resulted in recovered phb with higher average thermal stability 297 1 c as is expected npb has been shown to influence polymer thermal stability kopinke et al 1996 phb melt peaks and enthalpies were quantified for the second heating ramp after a first melt and quench at 10 c min cycle to standardise the sample thermal history typical examples of the melting curve measured by dsc for the phb standard phb in biomass and phb films are shown in fig 4 the melt peak temperature was estimated t m and the peak melting enthalpy was referenced to the amount of phb in the weighed sample the melting temperature for the polymer in the biomass at the beginning and the end of the incubation did not show a significant difference based on independent samples t test p 37 the average melting temperature for the polymer in the biomass values t m 175 3 c n 12 were higher compared to the reference phb t m 170 c the extracted film melting temperatures before incubation t m 176 2 c n 3 were significantly higher compared to the film after incubation t m 169 1 c n 9 based on independent samples t test p 05 the average extracted film melting temperatures before incubation t m 176 2 c was also higher compared to the reference phb t m 170 c in contrast the extracted film after incubation t m 169 1 c n 9 showed similar melting temperatures compared to the reference phb t m 170 c before incubation the melting temperature showed no significant differences between the polymer in biomass and the extracted films p 50 however after incubation the melting temperatures for the polymer in the biomass t m 172 3 c n 9 were on average 3 c significantly higher compared to the extracted phb film t m 169 1 c n 9 based on independent samples t test p 05 the systematic average difference of melt temperatures for the polymer in the biomass versus in the extracted films can be an artefact of differences in heat transfer properties film versus powdered phb rich biomass resulting in a lag in heat flux to and from the polymer in the biomass menczel and prime 2008 different incubation conditions were not found to significantly influence 95 ci the average distributed polymer inclusion melting temperatures as expressed in the biomass in any systematic way and with respect to the standardised sample treatment protocol an average decrease in melt temperature for the extracted polymer after the incubation does indicate that the extracted polymer thermal properties now as a blended mixture were changed by the incubation the polymer melt enthalpy in the biomass was on average lower and more variable than for the corresponding extracted polymer δ h m 49 22j gphb for phb in biomass versus δ h m 90 8j gphb for extracted phb variability of the extracted phb melt enthalpy was not correlated to the recovered phb purity which ranged from 42 to 94 wt percent phb the reference phb expressed a melting enthalpy of 98 j gphb melting temperature and melting enthalpy depend on the crystalline lamellae thickness this thickness varies with crystallisation conditions laycock et al 2013 crystallisation conditions for the polymer in all samples compared were the same based on the second dsc melt and quench cycle therefore the expressed changes for polymer in biomass average melt enthalpy and extracted polymer melting temperature were interpreted to reflect significant effects on polymer properties due to the incubation the significance and fundamental interpretation of these effects require further investigation the variability of the expressed phb melt enthalpy for the polymer in the biomass could be coupled and correlated to the incubation conditions in general higher phb in biomass enthalpies were found given before incubation lower incubation temperatures or lower incubation ph conditions table 4 the melt enthalpy of semi crystalline polymers relates to the degree of crystallinity with respect to the thermal history of the sample phb is expected to be able to reach a crystallinity of 60 percent laycock et al 2013 while the direct estimation of polymer crystallinity from melt enthalpy measurements cannot be made with certainty relative differences are indicative a high relative crystallinity for phb compared to the random co polymer of poly 3 hydroxybutyrate co 3 hydroxyvalerate makes it a more challenging polymer to extract especially when using so called pha poor solvents werker et al 2020 longer extraction times or higher extraction temperatures are necessary to reach high extraction efficiencies for phb with all other things being equal the phb extraction efficiencies are shown in table 4 the uncertainty of extraction efficiencies is considered to have come from the uncertainty of polymer content measurement in biomass which has been estimated to be around 2 chan et al 2017 the lower the pha content of the biomass the more sensitive the mass balance was for measurement uncertainty of the biomass pha content the one main outlier is the final sample incubated at 25 c and ph 10 this sample has a pha content estimated at 17 5 table s2 if this value were to be increased to 19 the outcome would give a 100 percent extraction efficiency thus this outlier is understood to be effectively 100 percent polymer recovery from the extraction mass balance evaluations an average 77 19 percent of phb was extractable from the phb rich biomass samples of notable interest from multilinear regression analysis of the extraction data table 4 was the finding that variability in extractability was positively correlated to the measured phb in biomass melt enthalpy p 0023 therefore the greater the expressed potential for the phb in the biomass to crystallise the better was the phb extractability the sampling protocol involving an acid wash thermal drying and a melt and quench cycle before the melt enthalpy evaluation cannot represent the property of the phb in situ however the standardised sample protocol still permitted observation and measurement for a change in polymer quality that had an interpreted bearing on the polymer extractability these results suggest that recovery yields in the dsp are influenced by the condition of the polymer in the biomass which can be affected by the applied methods of recovery ph condition influenced the polymer condition from the start an acidic pretreatment was found to be preferred for improved extractability the recovered polymer was not pure and because the solvent was evaporated from the extracted solids the solubilised npb was also evaluated on average 8 2 percent of the npb was co extracted with the recovered polymer therefore biomass with lower phb content yielded an extracted polymer of lower purity for the total extracted solids multilinear regression analysis suggested that less npb was extracted given lower temperature incubations p 0367 higher incubation temperatures solubilise more npb table s1 and may result in solvent soluble npb the solvent soluble npb will be extracted and will follow in the solvent as potential contaminants in the final extracted polymer post extraction washing steps to remove extracted contaminants add further cost to the recovery process therefore phb rich biomass pretreatment and its impact on the total extract polymer purity require further systematic fundamental and techno economic evaluations towards optimised dsp economy 4 conclusions intracellular depolymerase activity for a mixed culture phb rich biomass can be constrained by anaerobic conditions but changes in environmental conditions may nevertheless cause significant polymer losses even for short term storage up to 48 h extracellular depolymerase activity for a mixed culture phb rich biomass is limited for an extended period of time so long as the phb remains intracellular acid environmental conditions are preferred to preserve quantity and quality for recovery of phb from phb rich biomass following a mixed culture accumulation process the melting enthalpy of phb in the biomass following a standardised sample workup can be indicative of the phb extractability from the biomass acknowledgements this work was

15032,poly 3 hydroxybutyrate phb was accumulated in full scale municipal waste activated sludge at pilot scale after accumulation the fate of the phb rich biomass was evaluated over two weeks as a function of initial ph 5 5 7 0 and 10 and incubation temperature 25 37 and 55 c with or without aeration phb became consumed under aerobic conditions as expected with first order rate constants in the range of 0 19 to 0 55 d 1 under anaerobic conditions up to 63 percent of the phb became consumed within the first day initial ph 7 55 c subsequently with continued anaerobic conditions the polymer content remained stable in the biomass degradation rates were lower for acidic anaerobic incubation conditions at a lower temperature 25 c polymer thermal properties were measured in the dried phb rich biomass and for the polymer recovered by solvent extraction using dimethyl carbonate phb quality changes in dried biomass indicated by differences in polymer melt enthalpy correlated to differences in the extent of phb extractability differences in the expressed phb in biomass melt enthalpy that correlated to the polymer extractability suggested that yields of polymer recovery by extraction can be influenced by the state or quality of the polymer generated during downstream processing different post accumulation process biomass management environments were found to influence the polymer quality and can also influence the extraction of non polymer biomass an acidic post accumulation environment resulted in higher melt enthalpies in the biomass and consequently higher extraction efficiencies overall acidic environmental conditions were found to be favourable for preserving both quantity and quality after phb accumulation in activated sludge graphical abstract

introduction polyhydroxyalkanoates phas are a family of naturally occurring polyesters that accumulate intracellularly in many species of microorganisms as an endogenous organic substrate dawes and senior 1973 these microorganisms accumulate pha when they are subject to dynamic environments when for example surplus organic carbon sources become suddenly available while other growth factors such as nitrogen and phosphorus are limiting van loosdrecht et al 1997 majone et al 1999 reis et al 2003 phas can be accumulated in microbial biomass within engineered bioprocesses to significant levels 040 to 090 grams pha per gram organic mass estévez alonso et al 2021 accumulated intracellular pha can be extracted and purified purified phas exhibit thermoplastic properties similar to fossil derived polyesters raza et al 2018 compared to fossil based plastics plastics made from pha are bio based and can be completely biodegradable thus phas are an anticipated renewable resource for use in applications especially where biodegradation is required phas are produced commercially today with pure culture methods using refined substrates and sterilisation pha plastics compete with a higher selling price compared to conventional petroleum derived plastics and this limits pha market penetration plastics europe 2020 vandi et al 2018 cost reduction has been an underlying motivation driving much fundamental research and development in methods and processes for pha production over the past two decades much advancement has been made in the use of open culture production methods and waste organic residuals for substrates as a principal strategy to reduce pha production costs estévez alonso et al 2021 reis et al 2003 municipal biological wastewater treatment processes produce significant amounts of waste activated sludge municipal activated sludge can exhibit a significant degree of enrichment for the pha storing phenotype and can be directly used for pha accumulation pei et al 2022c and estévez alonso et al 2021 pha accumulating bacteria can exist in the waste activated sludge due to the dynamics in the process environments or dynamics in daily loading conditions which make metabolism involving polymer storage inherently a good selective strategy for survival van loosdrecht et al 1997 in recent years technical viability for using waste activated sludge for pha production has progressed from lab to pilot scale estévez alonso et al 2021 bengtsson et al 2017 valentino et al 2018 pilot scale production trials have exhibited stable outcomes in quantity and quality of polymers produced with average biomass pha content with respect to volatile solids vs of 0 4gpha gvs estévez alonso et al 2021 reis et al 2003 more recent investigations suggest expectations for optimal waste activated sludge accumulation to reach about 0 64gpha gvs which is similar to typical expectations in general for both pure and open culture production methods alike pei et al 2022a the direct use of activated sludge for pha production has two main process components pha accumulation and downstream processing dsp pha accumulation is an aerobic bioprocess where the activated sludge is fed with a volatile fatty acid vfa rich substrate to reach the maximum possible biomass pha content dsp starts after pha accumulation with steps to separate process water and recover a purified pha from the biomass suspended solids dsp methods are less well understood for the up scaling of open culture pha production and are a current knowledge gap needed for industrial scale developments estévez alonso et al 2021 dsp steps are critical to preserving polymer quantity and quality within the harvested post accumulation pha rich biomass and contribute heavily to the overall process economics werker et al 2020 kourmentza et al 2017 published research developments for dsp are commonly focused on specific purification steps towards this aim comparisons are made for different approaches or conditions for smaller subsamples from a batch of pha rich biomass preserved directly after accumulation by laboratory scale centrifugation followed by thermal drying or lyophilisation however the fate of the pha directly after accumulation and the stability of the freshly made product has not been systematically studied microorganisms metabolise pha not only during starvation but also to mitigate stresses müller santos et al 2021 changes in environmental conditions i e osmotic pressure oxygen level ph and temperature after pha accumulation can also promote pha mass loss and property changes abiotic random scission due to β elimination in the presence of h or oh will reduce molecular weight lauzier et al 1994 intracellular and extracellular pha depolymerases are anticipated to still be active directly after the pha accumulation process intracellular pha depolymerases that are integral to the surface of the pha granules jendrossek 2009 they are reported to act on intracellular pha in its so called native amorphous hydrated state jendrossek 2009 oeding and schlegel 1973 ong et al 2017 meanwhile extracellular depolymerases are understood to degrade pha from denatured granules from lysed cells and for this semi crystalline polymer in nature ong et al 2017 jendrossek and handrick 2002 directly after the pha accumulation process in the absence of any cell lysis pha will be stored intracellularly in host cells as bioactive functioning granules therefore factors and environments that can influence the level of intracellular pha depolymerase activity should at least initially determine the polymer fate the metabolism of intracellular pha degradation is still not completely clear for poly 3 hydroxybutyrate phb the depolymerase enzyme hydrolysis leads to 3 hydroxybutyrate or 3 hydroxybutyryl coenzyme a and then enters the β oxidation cycle to be further metabolised eggers and steinbüchel 2013 uchino et al 2007 gebauer and jendrossek 2006 jendrossek and handrick 2002 the degradation process may require the activation of released 3 hydroxybutyrate to 3 hydroxybutyryl coenzyme a which is an energy consuming reaction eggers and steinbüchel 2013 the intracellular depolymerase activity level can be influenced by environmental conditions and or polymer properties environmental conditions such as temperature ph and oxygen concentration can affect enzyme production activity and stability due to enzyme substrate specificity research on intracellular depolymerase properties requires native pha granules which can be challenging to isolate jendrossek and handrick 2002 hence it is not straightforward to systematically evaluate optimum temperatures or ph levels for all possible and potentially different intracellular depolymerase activities during the initial steps of dsp material management methods can include a need in the logistics to stage the freshly produced pha rich biomass with temporary storage handling and time scales of the industrial processes before the final dsp steps of purification can result in pha mass and property losses for example even heating rates in biomass thermal drying significantly influence product molecular weight estévez alonso et al 2022 the risks for polymer loss and property changes directly after the pha accumulation may be expected to be negligible in gram laboratory and even kilogramme pilot scale pha production research and development work due to the relatively low volumes and masses of material to be handled the steps of dsp can be managed quickly minutes to a few hours at the industrial scale with significantly higher expected process volumes and masses of material to handle duty cycles for each fresh batch will be longer hours to days pha rich biomass can be produced at a number of distributed sites and at least some dsp steps including final drying can be handled more centrally with improved scale of economy as done today for municipal sludge management therefore the transport of dewatered pha rich biomass may benefit the production economics quicker handling requires higher throughput larger equipment and associated capital costs smaller equipment would require that pha rich biomass be temporarily stored in dsp feed tanks the stability of the pha in the fresh crude product of accumulated pha rich biomass has not been reported in the research literature the effects of time and environmental conditions in the storage of pha rich biomass fate are overlooked therefore it was of interest to explicitly evaluate how well freshly accumulated pha survived this stage with environmental conditions from acidic to basic ph mesophilic to thermophilic temperatures and with or without the presence of oxygen for the present investigation the effect of environmental conditions ph temperature aeration on the fate of freshly accumulated phb in municipal activated sludge was evaluated a pilot scale process was operated with an acetic acid feedstock to yield a phb rich biomass the harvested phb rich biomass mixed liquor was divided into parallel batches parallel batches were ph adjusted and incubated at selected temperatures with and without aeration sampling and monitoring of polymer fate over time for mass balances and property evaluations were undertaken and interpreted as reported herein 2 materials and methods 2 1 phb accumulation waste activated sludge was obtained from bath wastewater treatment plant wwtp rilland bath the netherlands this wwtp treats a mixture of municipal and industrial influent wastewater for 470 000 person equivalents the wwtp includes primary treatment followed by a modified ludzack ettinger activated sludge biological process phosphorus is removed by

sludge was stored at 5 c pending its use in accumulation experiments accumulation production experiments were performed with respective batches on september 25 th november 5 th and december 4 th 2019 the freshly accumulated phb rich biomass was the starting material used for the principal incubation experiments control incubation experiments were also performed with the same activated sludge but without any polymer accumulation the feedstock for phb rich biomass production was 20gcod l acetic acid vwr the netherlands with added nh 4 cl and kh 2 po 4 vwr the netherlands for a cod n p by weight of 100 1 0 05 the ph was adjusted to 5 0 0 5 with naoh vwr the netherlands the use of acetic acid ensured that the produced polymer was phb lemos et al 2006 the pilot scale accumulation process was carried out in a jacketed stainless steel 200l reactor with 167l working volume as described in pei et al 2022a figure s1 accumulation experiments were initiated by loading the reactor with a set mass of the thickened waste activated sludge that was diluted with tap water to a starting suspended solids concentration of about 4gvss l the reactor was operated at 25 c with constant mixing 230rpm and aeration 50l min before the accumulation process started a period of steady aeration was applied for about 12h hours to reach a steady level of endogenous respiration this steady level was determined from respiration levels based on the dissolved oxygen trends pei et al 2022a the accumulation process was fed batch with a constant process volume and constant aeration aeration maintained dissolved oxygen levels over 1 mg o 2 l reactor volume continuous circulation through a clarifier 16l maintained a constant overall process volume with retention of the suspended solids the substrate was pumped in discrete pulses of a fixed volume to target peak pulse substrate concentrations of 100mgcod l pulse input timing was from feedback control that was triggered by respiration level monitoring based on dissolved oxygen trend measurements jumo ecoline o do jumo gmbh co kg germany as previously described by werker et al 2020 the process started with an acclimation step morgan sagastume et al 2017 using three acclimation pulses as previously reported pei et al 2022b after the third acclimation cycle the accumulation process was directly started during accumulation feed pulses were given intact with the substrate uptake rate based on dissolved oxygen trends and the tight series of input pulses were thereby given without excess substrate supply and build up in the reactor over 20 h 2 2 phb rich biomass incubation experiments three replicate batches of phb rich biomass were produced and used directly after 20 h accumulation for the purposes of the incubation experiments accumulation was terminated by switching off aeration but mechanical mixing was sustained to maintain a well mixed liquor after accumulations ph was around 8 and since a final pulse of the substrate was given before aeration was terminated the initial background acetic acid concentration was about 100mgcod l for each incubation experiment three 10l grab samples of mixed liquor were taken from the accumulation reactor the initial ph of the grab samples was adjusted to ph 55 7 and 10 using 1m hcl or 1m naoh respectively during the incubation experiment ph was thereafter monitored but not further controlled respective batches of ph adjusted mixed liquor were then distributed in replicate 170ml aliquots to 21 250ml stoppered serum bottles and 9 500ml erlenmeyer flasks with silicone sponge stopper serum bottle headspace was exchanged with nitrogen gas with overpressure to establish and maintain anaerobic incubation conditions a discofix one way stopcock b braun germany together with a 40mm needle was connected to each of the anaerobic serum bottles this connection had a radially and axially movable swivel lock for a safe and quick connection and it was used for liquid gas sampling erlenmeyer flasks with porous silicone sponge stoppers were used for aerobic incubations serum bottles and erlenmeyer flasks were incubated on an orbital shaker table at 120rpm and at a constant selected temperature 25 37 or 55 c the incubation period was for up to 15 days during weekdays daily grab samples were taken in triplicate using 3 of the incubation vessels for each condition defined by initial ph incubation temperature and with or without aeration the remaining unsampled serum bottles provided a mass of material for end point assessment with the characterisation of the resulting suspended solids and polymer quality 2 3 control incubation experiments control experiment 1 was conducted to evaluate the fate of exogenous phb due to extracellular depolymerase activity as a function of initial ph three 1 3l jacketed batch reactors were operated isothermally at 37 c in batch mode under selected constant ph 55 7 and 10 ph was monitored and controlled by dosing inorganic acid base to ensure anaerobic conditions the reactors were flushed with n 2 gas an aliquot of nominally 200g waste activated sludge containing negligible pha also from bath wwtp was incubated with 2

13ml dimethyl carbonate dmc sigma aldrich reagentplus 99 to target a maximum theoretical polymer concentration of nominally 20mgphb ml but lower in some cases due to limitations in the available

after the initial re drying before solvent addition the polymer film thermal properties were characterised by tga and dsc as described below the dried ground biomass solids and the extracted phb films were assessed by tga tga 2 metller toledo switzerland for biomass phb content and thermal stability chan et al 2017 representative sub samples of about 5 and 2 mg of dried biomass or recovered polymer were used respectively the method includes the estimation of sample residual moisture solvent and phb contents as well as the overall dried sample organic and inorganic fractions briefly pre weighed samples were inserted into the tga at 80 c with nitrogen purge gas at 50ml min the temperature was increased 10 c min to 105 c and held for 15 min drying wherein removed moisture or residual solvent weight could be estimated temperature was increased 10 c min to 550 c and held for 30 min phb mass could be estimated from the characteristic rapid mass loss occurring between 225 and 350 c at 550 c the purge gas was changed to air at 50ml min sample ash content was estimated from the weight lost after incubation at 550 c with air atmosphere after 30 min the biomass phb content as gphb gvss was derived from the background corrected characteristic polymer decomposition peak detectable from the derivative thermogravimetric trend as described in chan et al 2017 using in house matlab data processing algorithms mathworks ma usa non phb biomass npb was estimated as vss minus phb mass subsequently the mass ratio of phb and non phb biomass f phb was calculated reference samples included pha rich biomass with known polymer content 45 1 0 6 gpha gvss and pure phb 98 purity biomer germany instrument temperature measurement was calibrated based on curie temperature with a nickel standard following mettler toledo methods differential scanning calorimetry dsc 3 mettler toledo switzerland of the polymer in the dried biomass and extracted films was performed based on previously described methods chan et al 2017 about 5 and 2 mg dried biomass and recovered polymer were used from each sample respectively weighed samples in vented crucibles were inserted and held for 5 min at 70 c with nitrogen purge gas at 50 ml min a first heat and quench cycle followed with heating and cooling at 10 c min to 185 c and back to 70 c a second heat ramp at 10 c min to 185 c was applied followed by

heated at 10 c min to 40 c melt and crystallisation enthalpies were estimated with respect to the mass of phb in the sample estimated from tga measurements for the same samples reference samples

indium standards according to mettler toledo methods statistical analyses including multilinear regression and t tests were performed with graphpad prism version 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 incubation and preservation of accumulated phb quantity three batches of pilot scale phb rich biomass were produced the measured maximum biomass polymer contents at the end of 20 h of accumulation were 0 37 0 53 and 0 50gphb gvss respectively each batch of the phb rich biomass was characterised by elemental analysis to obtain a representative estimate of the npb cod content for making cod mass balances acetic acid results in the accumulation of phb and the elemental composition of phb is c 4 h 6 o 2 for phb 1 67 gcod gphb is applied combining information of vs and phb contents with elemental analysis the non phb biomass compositions were estimated and found to be consistent between batches as shown in table 1 the average cod of the npb was found to be 1 36gcod gnpb and this value was applied in the cod mass balance evaluations the npb composition and theoretical cod conversion factor are similar to what was reported in the literature ranging from 1 37 to 1 48gcod gnpb chen et al 2020 trends in development for biomass phb content are typically expressed as phb concentration over the total vss concentration during accumulation in the research literature this ratio is indicative of the performance of the active biomass during an accumulation process towards reaching a steady relative level of the accumulated polymer in the biomass it is the value measured directly by tga alternatively the phb to npb ratio shows trends of the relative fate of phb with respect to npb biomass phb content is converted to a phb to npb ratio as follows 1 f p h b phb mass npb mass phb content 1 phb content the phb to npb ratio on a cod basis was estimated with the conversion factors for phb 1 67 gcod gphb and for npb 1 36 gcod gnpb from the elemental analyses the phb to non phb biomass ratio f phb reported on the relative gain or loss of phb with respect to non phb biomass solids during aerobic or anaerobic incubations typical results of trends are shown for the phb to npb ratios in the set of incubations for initial ph 7 for aerobic or anaerobic conditions at selected temperatures fig 1 similar plots of results for the other initial ph sets of incubations are provided as supplementary information figure s3 and figure s4 under aerobic conditions without further exogenous substrate supply after phb accumulation intracellular phb is expected to be consumed the trends of consumption as shown in fig 1 and si were fitted to the model of a shrinking particle with least squares regression analysis in this model phb removal rate decreases asymptotically following a 2 3 power law as a function of f phb tamis et al 2014 the integrated rate function solved for f phb is as follows 2 f p h b f 0 3 1 3 k t c x 0 c x 1 3 3 where f phb is phb to non phb biomass ratio cod basis f 0 is the initial phb to non phb biomass ratio c x0 c x is the ratio between the initial and final non phb biomass for fitting the model eq 2 was linearised and the experimentally determined average f phb and c x0 c x values from replicate experiments as a function of time were used to estimate the rate constant k and intercept f 0 by linear regression analysis eq 3 3 f p h b 3 f 0 3 k 1 3 t c x 0 c x 1 3 as illustrated in fig 1 a and si and similarly for all the initial ph conditions and temperatures with aerobic incubation the shrinking particle model represented the decay of phb mass to negligible levels the aerobic groups served as the benchmark for the polymer fate due to an expected depolymerase activity stimulated by famine conditions and influenced due to different environmental conditions of initial ph and temperature tamis et al 2014 the estimated rate constant k from the model distinguished between levels of depolymerase activity due to initial ph and temperature table 2 rate constant k ranged from 0 19 to 0 55 d 1 depending on the initial ph and temperature the k value for the initial ph 7 and 25 c was similar to the k value reported by koller et al 2015 in which pure culture pha rich biomass was incubated aerobically at ph 7 and room temperature in the current study alkaline ph consistently exhibited relatively higher k values for any given incubation temperature for initial ph 5 5 and 7 groups the rate constant k increased when the temperature increased from 25 c to 37 c and then decreased when the temperature further increased to 55 c for the initial ph 10 group the rate constant k increased from 25 c to 37 c then remained at a similar level when the temperature further increased to 55 c within three temperature conditions the maximum depolymerase activity is the highest between 25 and 55 c mild acidic conditions and elevated temperatures also stimulated higher depolymerase activities relative to neutral initial ph conditions therefore for an activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant with operating ph between 7 and 8 and temperatures between 15 and 30 c mild stresses in ph and temperature in combination with oxygen supply are detrimental to the objectives of polymer product conservation henze 1997 however if aeration cannot be avoided then acidic conditions and lower temperatures are preferred using the same starting phb rich biomass the incubations under strictly anaerobic conditions showed a different kind of characteristic trend fig 1 b compared to the aerobic benchmark cases fig 1 a since the polymer metabolism due to depolymerase activity requires energy anaerobic conditions under famine were expected to inhibit excessive polymer loss as predicted by the aerobic model described by eq 2 however on the contrary an initial loss in the relative amount of phb was observed over the first day before the phb level with respect to non phb biomass became stabilised over at least 8 days of continued incubation even under anaerobic conditions a limited amount of the accumulated polymer became rapidly metabolised to estimate for differences in the effect of environmental conditions on the initial relative anaerobic phb loss an average degradation rate over the first day was estimated for f phb and is summarised in table 3 the activated sludge used in the present study was a nitrification denitrification biomass this activated sludge is anticipated to be dominated by obligate or facultative aerobic microorganisms therefore anaerobic conditions would be expected to inhibit depolymerase activity due to a lack of energy flow to kick off the metabolism jendrossek 2009 oeding and schlegel 1973 ong et al 2017 lower temperatures and neutral or mild acidic conditions offered the greatest degree of polymer preservation one of the possible reasons for higher or lower initial albeit limited degradation rate under anaerobic conditions could be due to an imposed environmental stress on the freshly accumulated phb rich biomass to deal with stress microorganisms may metabolise pha müller santos et al 2021 this ability and extent of losses seem to be further influenced by initial ph and temperature under alkaline conditions rates of loss are indicated to be highest between 25 and 55 c however under neutral or mildly acidic conditions the extent of loss is observed to have increased with temperatures up to 55 c and decreased with lower ph these results support that lower ph is preferred to limit the extent of polymer degradation the phb to non phb biomass f phb indicated the depolymerase activity level and the relative change of phb if anaerobic incubation were effective in solubilising npb then f phb would be expected to increase in time however in the balance after initial phb losses and up to 8 days of incubation the amount of phb relative to npb remained stable a cod mass balance on phb was applied to determine if this stability corresponded to the absolute or relative preservation of the accumulated polymer in the phb rich biomass the concentration of polymer for each sampling time was calculated from the cod mass balance 4 tcod scod cod npb cod phb where tcod and scod were measured and the cod ratio of phb and npb were determined from tga measurements coupled to phb and estimated npb cod content per unit mass since the three different accumulation batches started with different absolute phb concentrations relative phb concentrations with respect to the initial level are reported enabling a direct comparison of trends fig 2 figure s5 and figure s6 for the aerobic group trends of phb concentration fig 2 a figure s5 and figure s6 reflect the trends of f phb fig 1 a over 2 weeks the amount of the polymer decreased to negligible levels 4 5 of initial phb irrespective of environmental conditions applied aerobically phb is expected to be hydrolysed into 3 hydroxybutyrate and then converted to co 2 jendrossek and handrick 2002 phb levels under anaerobic conditions fig 2 b figure s5 and figure s6 exhibited an initial rapid decrease of up to 82 of phb cod within the first few days in control experiment 2 phb powder was incubated with water at acidic neutral and alkaline ph for more than 30 days and no 3 hydroxybutyrate or vfas were measured this confirmed that the phb hydrolysis was slow without microbial activity present it also supports that the initial rapid phb loss was due to biological activity after the fast initial degradation the polymer amount stabilised therefore both phb concentrations and npb concentrations remained constant this observation is similar to what was reported by shamsul huda et al 2013 and huda et al 2016 methanogenesis onset was observed for the cases of initial ph of 10 at 37 and 55 c after about 8 days with the onset of methanogenesis phb losses resumed losses over time during anaerobic incubation of both phb and npb suspended solids may suggest lysis of some phb containing biomass as it was also discussed by huda et al 2016 selective staining and microscopy methods have revealed different morphotypes of pha storing microorganisms also expressing differences in cell rigidity pei et al 2022b not all cell types will be equally robust to environmental stress and this is therefore a challenge for downstream processing of mixed culture biomass optimal conditions for polymer quality preservation and recovery for some morphotypes may result in undue losses or conversely reduced yields for recovery from other morphotypes anaerobic conditions with exogenously supplied phb in control experiment 1 resulted in rapid complete removal of added polymer powder after an initial lag phase with an initial ph of 7 figure s7 the lag phase was longer and the degradation rate was slower given an initial ph of 10 the lag phase was also prolonged with an initial ph of 5 5 exogenous phb was readily degraded as illustrated by control experiment 1 figure s7 and endogenous phb remained stable for several days under anaerobic conditions notwithstanding conditions that promoted an initial degree of polymer metabolisation thus at least a fraction of the phb rich biomass can remain robustly intact and stored polymer contents can be preserved anaerobically exploration for mechanisms and methods for mitigating the observed metabolisation of polymer mass is part of the ongoing investigation the main fermentation products during anaerobic incubation were acetate butyrate and propionate phb degradation is understood to follow steps starting with depolymerase activity releasing 3 hydroxybutyrate however no build up of 3 hydroxybutyrate was measured only volatile fatty acid formation similar to the results reported by huda et al 2016 soluble hydrolysis products may be released if host cells hydrolyse an excess of phb and cannot metabolise it further under anaerobic conditions these soluble products are readily fermented into acetate and butyrate the theoretical levels of acetate and butyrate formation were estimated based on loss of phb and the expected stoichiometry 2ch 3 chohch 2 coo 2ch 3 coo ch 3 ch 2 2coo h for the extracellular depolymerase activity as reported by stieb and schink 1984 in the control incubation experiment 1 the exogenous supplied phb formed acetate and butyrate following the stoichiometry reported by stieb and schink 1984 for the phb rich biomass incubations as shown in table s1 the predicted levels of butyrate were similar to the measured butyrate concentration for acetate the measured concentration was higher compared to the predicted levels these results suggested that butyrate formation was due to phb fermentation the acetate levels were due to both phb and npb fermentation during anaerobic incubations shamsul huda et al 2013 huda et al 2016 the propionate only came from npb fermentation confirmation of the interpreted phb transformation would require further experiments one approach could be using stable isotopes as tracers the fermentation products during phb rich biomass anaerobic incubation experiments suggested that intracellular phb or the metabolites of phb may become released to the matrix and are rapidly fermented in control experiment 3 where phb powder was incubated with commercially available lipase enzyme an increasing level of 3 hydroxybutyrate was observed figure s8 this suggests that extracellular phb hydrolysis can be carried out by generic enzymes that react to ester bonds anaerobic conditions naturally preserved the accumulated phb for a period of time better than aerobic conditions however even in the best case scenario initial ph 7 and 25 c around 42 of the polymer was lost within the experimental period therefore for temporary staging with storage or transportation of the phb rich biomass anaerobic conditions alone are not sufficient and results support that lower temperatures or ph levels need to be applied shortly after the accumulation process is terminated in previous work up to pilot scale phb rich biomass acidification down to ph 2 has been applied to induce higher polymer thermal stability before final dewatering and drying werker et al 2020 however even for this lower ph acidification treatment and wet biomass storage at 4 c molecular weight loss still occurred at a quite slow but measurable rate selective staining with confocal microscopy evaluation was applied to phb rich biomass incubated anaerobically with initial ph of 5 5 at 55 c over 14 days as shown in fig 3 the selective staining revealed a dominance of intact cell structures containing pha granules pei et al 2022b therefore preserved phb presented as still being intracellular after the anaerobic incubation pei et al 2022b neglecting the initial anaerobic phb degradation intracellular phb preservation was found to be possible due to a lack of oxygen supply intracellular depolymerase activity levels were influenced by ph and temperature but were not prevented when oxygen was supplied it has also been reported that environmental conditions can cause pha granules to coalesce and become disrupted as functioning carbonosomes sedlacek et al 2019b the crystallisation of the polymer is reported to ensue upon dehydration but before that the polymer in a hydrated amorphous structure may form crystalline associations like a gel which could impede the intracellular depolymerase activity porter and yu 2011b obruca et al 2017 meanwhile the granules within intact cells may remain kept away from extracellular depolymerases which were anyway found to be inhibited by acidic conditions 3 2 incubation and changes to accumulated phb extractability the observed trends of phb concentration illustrated in fig 2 b could be a mixture of effects including discussed changes in granule structure or function in situ polymer crystallisation depolymerase activity attenuation with time and cell function losses due to prolonged anaerobic incubation increased temperatures to the thermophilic range are reported to induce changes in polymer morphology but will also increase depolymerase activity levels effects of ph on inferred in situ pha crystallisation have not been conclusive porter and yu 2011b a a higher crystallisation rate with alkaline conditions than neutral and acidic ph has been reported but results of opposite trends with ph are also published sedlacek et al 2019a porter and yu 2011a it is not a trivial matter to measure for changes in the polymer nature in situ without altering the polymer as a consequence of the measurement approach exploration of approaches is part of the ongoing investigation the present study processed biomass samples using a standardised acidic wash and thermal drying protocol even if sample processing influences the polymer nature it was interesting to observe if the incubation with different applied environmental conditions would result in systematic trends of polymer quality in the biomass differences in polymer quality due to the incubation were assessed based on thermal decomposition temperature t d polymer melt enthalpy δ h m and extractability thermal properties were assessed for the polymer in the dried biomass and for the extracted polymer an advantage of phb for the present investigation is that the homopolymer normally exhibits a relatively high crystallinity and crystallisation rate laycock et al 2014 this behaviour enables the evaluation of the melt and crystallisation behaviour of the polymer even in dried biomass samples results are summarised in table 4 acidic washing of the pha rich biomass is a method to enhance thermal stability chan et al 2017 the t d for the phb in the biomass was consistent at 286 2 c incubation did not influence the ability to harmonise for similarly enhanced polymer thermal stability before solvent extraction neglecting a measurement outlier ph 7 and 55 c extraction resulted in recovered phb with higher average thermal stability 297 1 c as is expected npb has been shown to influence polymer thermal stability kopinke et al 1996 phb melt peaks and enthalpies were quantified for the second heating ramp after a first melt and quench at 10 c min cycle to standardise the sample thermal history typical examples of the melting curve measured by dsc for the phb standard phb in biomass and phb films are shown in fig 4 the melt peak temperature was estimated t m and the peak melting enthalpy was referenced to the amount of phb in the weighed sample the melting temperature for the polymer in the biomass at the beginning and the end of the incubation did not show a significant difference based on independent samples t test p 37 the average melting temperature for the polymer in the biomass values t m 175 3 c n 12 were higher compared to the reference phb t m 170 c the extracted film melting temperatures before incubation t m 176 2 c n 3 were significantly higher compared to the film after incubation t m 169 1 c n 9 based on independent samples t test p 05 the average extracted film melting temperatures before incubation t m 176 2 c was also higher compared to the reference phb t m 170 c in contrast the extracted film after incubation t m 169 1 c n 9 showed similar melting temperatures compared to the reference phb t m 170 c before incubation the melting temperature showed no significant differences between the polymer in biomass and the extracted films p 50 however after incubation the melting temperatures for the polymer in the biomass t m 172 3 c n 9 were on average 3 c significantly higher compared to the extracted phb film t m 169 1 c n 9 based on independent samples t test p 05 the systematic average difference of melt temperatures for the polymer in the biomass versus in the extracted films can be an artefact of differences in heat transfer properties film versus powdered phb rich biomass resulting in a lag in heat flux to and from the polymer in the biomass menczel and prime 2008 different incubation conditions were not found to significantly influence 95 ci the average distributed polymer inclusion melting temperatures as expressed in the biomass in any systematic way and with respect to the standardised sample treatment protocol an average decrease in melt temperature for the extracted polymer after the incubation does indicate that the extracted polymer thermal properties now as a blended mixture were changed by the incubation the polymer melt enthalpy in the biomass was on average lower and more variable than for the corresponding extracted polymer δ h m 49 22j gphb for phb in biomass versus δ h m 90 8j gphb for extracted phb variability of the extracted phb melt enthalpy was not correlated to the recovered phb purity which ranged from 42 to 94 wt percent phb the reference phb expressed a melting enthalpy of 98 j gphb melting temperature and melting enthalpy depend on the crystalline lamellae thickness this thickness varies with crystallisation conditions laycock et al 2013 crystallisation conditions for the polymer in all samples compared were the same based on the second dsc melt and quench cycle therefore the expressed changes for polymer in biomass average melt enthalpy and extracted polymer melting temperature were interpreted to reflect significant effects on polymer properties due to the incubation the significance and fundamental interpretation of these effects require further investigation the variability of the expressed phb melt enthalpy for the polymer in the biomass could be coupled and correlated to the incubation conditions in general higher phb in biomass enthalpies were found given before incubation lower incubation temperatures or lower incubation ph conditions table 4 the melt enthalpy of semi crystalline polymers relates to the degree of crystallinity with respect to the thermal history of the sample phb is expected to be able to reach a crystallinity of 60 percent laycock et al 2013 while the direct estimation of polymer crystallinity from melt enthalpy measurements cannot be made with certainty relative differences are indicative a high relative crystallinity for phb compared to the random co polymer of poly 3 hydroxybutyrate co 3 hydroxyvalerate makes it a more challenging polymer to extract especially when using so called pha poor solvents werker et al 2020 longer extraction times or higher extraction temperatures are necessary to reach high extraction efficiencies for phb with all other things being equal the phb extraction efficiencies are shown in table 4 the uncertainty of extraction efficiencies is considered to have come from the uncertainty of polymer content measurement in biomass which has been estimated to be around 2 chan et al 2017 the lower the pha content of the biomass the more sensitive the mass balance was for measurement uncertainty of the biomass pha content the one main outlier is the final sample incubated at 25 c and ph 10 this sample has a pha content estimated at 17 5 table s2 if this value were to be increased to 19 the outcome would give a 100 percent extraction efficiency thus this outlier is understood to be effectively 100 percent polymer recovery from the extraction mass balance evaluations an average 77 19 percent of phb was extractable from the phb rich biomass samples of notable interest from multilinear regression analysis of the extraction data table 4 was the finding that variability in extractability was positively correlated to the measured phb in biomass melt enthalpy p 0023 therefore the greater the expressed potential for the phb in the biomass to crystallise the better was the phb extractability the sampling protocol involving an acid wash thermal drying and a melt and quench cycle before the melt enthalpy evaluation cannot represent the property of the phb in situ however the standardised sample protocol still permitted observation and measurement for a change in polymer quality that had an interpreted bearing on the polymer extractability these results suggest that recovery yields in the dsp are influenced by the condition of the polymer in the biomass which can be affected by the applied methods of recovery ph condition influenced the polymer condition from the start an acidic pretreatment was found to be preferred for improved extractability the recovered polymer was not pure and because the solvent was evaporated from the extracted solids the solubilised npb was also evaluated on average 8 2 percent of the npb was co extracted with the recovered polymer therefore biomass with lower phb content yielded an extracted polymer of lower purity for the total extracted solids multilinear regression analysis suggested that less npb was extracted given lower temperature incubations p 0367 higher incubation temperatures solubilise more npb table s1 and may result in solvent soluble npb the solvent soluble npb will be extracted and will follow in the solvent as potential contaminants in the final extracted polymer post extraction washing steps to remove extracted contaminants add further cost to the recovery process therefore phb rich biomass pretreatment and its impact on the total extract polymer purity require further systematic fundamental and techno economic evaluations towards optimised dsp economy 4 conclusions intracellular depolymerase activity for a mixed culture phb rich biomass can be constrained by anaerobic conditions but changes in environmental conditions may nevertheless cause significant polymer losses even for short term storage up to 48 h extracellular depolymerase activity for a mixed culture phb rich biomass is limited for an extended period of time so long as the phb remains intracellular acid environmental conditions are preferred to preserve quantity and quality for recovery of phb from phb rich biomass following a mixed culture accumulation process the melting enthalpy of phb in the biomass following a standardised sample workup can be indicative of the phb extractability from the biomass acknowledgements this work was

15033,biological sulfidogenic processes bsps have been considered effective biotechnologies for the treatment of organic deficit acid mine drainage amd and heavy metal recovery however high rate sulfide production relies on the continuous addition of exogenous organic substrates as electron donors to facilitate dissimilatory sulfate reduction which substantially increases the operational cost and co2 emission and also limits the wide application of bsps in amd treatment in this study we proposed a novel chemoautotrophic elemental sulfur disproportionation sd process as an alternative to conventional bsps for treating amd in which sulfur disproportionating bacteria sdb disproportionates sulfur to sulfide and sulfate without organic substrate supplementation during the 393 day lab scale test we observed that the sulfur disproportionating reactor sdr achieved a stable high rate sulfide production with a maximal rate of 21 10 mg s l h at an organic substrate free condition this high rate of sulfide production suggested that the sd process could provide sufficient sulfide to precipitate metal ions from amd thermodynamics analysis and batch tests further revealed that alkalinity rather than sulfate was the critical factor influencing the sd process suggesting that the abundant sulfate present in amd would not inhibit the sd process the critical condition of sd in the sdr was therefore determined microbial community analysis showed that dissulfurimicrobium sp was the dominant sdb during the long term operation regardless of dynamic sulfate and or alkalinity concentrations which provides evidence that sdb can be employed for sustainable and high rate sulfide production for engineering purposes a multi stage amd treatment system equipped with a sdr removed over 99 of the influent metals i e fe al zn cu pb from amd except for mn this study demonstrated that the novel sd process is a green and promising biotechnology for the sustainable treatment of organic deficient metal laden wastewater such as amd graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords elemental sulfur metal laden wastewater sulfide sulfur disproportionating bacteria amd treatment mine water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction biological sulfidogenic processes bsps mediated by sulfate reducing bacteria srb have been considered effective biotechnologies for metal laden wastewater treatment including acid mine drainage amd treatment in which the biogenic sulfide produced by srb can precipitate heavy metals with insoluble metal sulfides being the byproducts gopi kiran et al 2017 rambabu et al 2020 srb are generally heterotrophic and need to utilize organics or hydrogen as electron donors to reduce sulfate to sulfide guo et al 2021 however amd is deficient in organic carbon 10 mg l suggesting the necessity of a high amount of exogenous organic addition to sustain the sulfidogenic processes sun et al 2018 oyetibo et al 2021 santos et al 2022 dosing a large amount of organic chemicals such as glucose acetate or methanol into amd dramatically increases the operational cost and probably induces secondary pollution due to the residual organics it raises a question if abundant sulfide could be continuously generated in a biological process without adding external organic matter if feasible this process would be more cost effective and eco friendly than sulfate reduction when treating amd chemoautotrophic elemental sulfur s0 disproportionation sd could be an ideal candidate approach briefly sd mediated by sulfur disproportionating bacteria sdb can disproportionate s0 into sulfide and sulfate eq 1 canfield and thamdrup 1994 johnston et al 2005 although sd reaction is endergonic under standard conditions thamdrup et al 1993 this biological process has been frequently observed in various natural environments such as marine sediment estuarine coastal sediments haloalkaline lake and groundwater finster et al 1998 poser et al 2016 allioux et al 2020 müller et al 2020 moreover diverse sdb were identified such as dissulfurispira thermophila caldimicrobium thiodismutans dissulfurimicrobium hydrothermale dissulfuribacter thermophilus which offers its potential for amd treatment slobodkin et al 2013 umezawa et al 2020 2021 however there are some knowledge gaps that need to be well addressed before its application in practice high rate sd process is the prerequisite for efficient amd treatment but the extent of sd process is reported at a low level due to the impact of positive gibbs free energy of this reaction canfield and thamdrup 1994 could high rate and stable sd process be achieved from a long term perspective to our knowledge this study was the first attempt to develop a practically useful sd process for amd treatment 1 4 s 0 4 h 2 o so 4 2 3 h s 5 h δ g 0 10 2 kj mo l 1 s 0 since estuarine and coastal sediments have been found to be sdb habitats around the world and their abundance was 105 106 cells cm3 finster 2008 in this study we collected the estuary sediment from pearl river and used it as the inoculum the inoculum was then cultivated with s0 and necessary nutrients but without organic carbon to a evaluate the feasibility and long term stability of high rate sd based sulfidogenic bioreactor for treating amd b determine the presence of sd in the bioreactor and c identify the functional bacteria participating in sulfidogenic process the findings obtained in this study would provide an easy controlled and cost effective biotechnology for metal laden wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum collection and cultivation the inoculum was collected from modaomen estuary sediment 113 24 14 e 21 57 44 n in august 2018 as the main entrance of the xijiang river flowing into the south china sea modaomen estuary is a typical partially mixed sub estuary of the pearl river estuary the bottom water at sampling sites was characterized by oxygen deficit weakly alkaline and high salinity 30 jia et al 2021 the detailed chemical and microbiological characterization about the sediment can be found in table s1 and fig s1 in supporting information respectively the sediment was collected and immediately transferred to our lab it was then cultured under anoxic conditions with necessary nutrients and s fine powder purity 99 5 particle size 20 40 µm in a sealed bottle with a working volume of 2 l the growth medium consisted of the following compositions g l 0 1 nh4cl 0 02 k2hpo4 3h2o 0 01 kh2po4 1 0 nahco3 and 1 ml l of trace elements solution jiang et al 2013 the sealed bottle was then incubated at 500 revolutions per minute rpm in a thermostatic room 30 c for 30 days 2 2 bioreactor setup and operation a laboratory scale acrylic sulfur disproportionating bioreactor sdr with an inner diameter of 50 mm and a height of 58 cm was packed with commercial s0 particles purity 99 resulting in an effective volume of 0 58 l the sdr was seeded with the acclimated sediment from the sealed bottle and was fed with synthetic amd to minimize the toxicities of heavy metals the sulfidogenic bioreactor is usually set up behind metal precipitators during amd treatment in practice chen et al 2016 as such the posterior sulfidogenic bioreactor receives sulfate rich and metal free amd in this study the sulfidogenic bioreactor simulated this scenario the compositions of synthetic amd are presented in table s2 which was similar to those reported previously kiran et al 2018 sahinkaya et al 2019 the sdr was continuously operated for 393 days in the temperature controlled chamber 30 c which was partitioned into six phases see table s3 for the detailed operational parameters to explore the effects of alkalinity and or sulfate on system performance the hydraulic retention time hrt of the bioreactor was maintained at 10 h throughout the whole operational period by controlling the influent flow rate with a peristaltic pump water samples were collected every 2 days to measure the concentrations of total dissolved sulfide h2s hs and s2 sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate as well as ph value in the influent and effluent in order to determine the capacity of the sd process to remove heavy metals a sd based amd treatment system was designed as per sun et al 2020a and is presented in fig 1 the heavy metals were removed in main stream and sulfide was produced from sdr in side stream during the heavy metal removal procedure synthetic amd was continually fed into the sd based amd treatment system at a flow rate of 1 0 l day the fe ions were first removed by improving the ph with naoh in module 1 cu pb and zn were subsequently precipitated by sulfide from sdr in module 2 al and some mn ions were last precipitated as al oh 3 and mn oh 2 by further adjusting the ph in module 3 more operational parameters and details of the sd based amd treatment system were described in text s1 the system performance was evaluated by determining the differences in heavy metal concentrations i e fe al mn zn pb cu between the influent and effluent 2 3 batch test sulfur disproportionation determination to investigate if the sulfide produced in the sulfidogenic bioreactor was from sd a batch test was conducted in triplicates using the active sludge from sdr after the long term operation before the batch test the sludge was washed with deoxygenated deionized water to remove residual sulfide completely and was then evenly distributed to 75 ml serum bottles containing 65 ml sterile anoxic medium the sludge concentration was 3 40 0 54 g mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss l excessive s0 5 0 g l was added to provide sufficient sulfur source for sdb growth and respiration 1 0 g l nahco3 was also supplemented to provide inorganic carbon source and balance the ph the serum bottles were purged with nitrogen gas and then sealed with rubber stoppers to create an anaerobic environment the batch tests were conducted in a temperature controlled chamber 25 c and lasted for 34 h during which water samples were taken to measure the concentrations of sulfide and sulfate the ph values were also determined at the beginning and end of the batch test 2 4 chemical analysis the concentrations of sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate were analyzed with an ion chromatograph ic 16

to characterize the microbial community evolution tendency during the long term operation the microbial genomic dna was extracted with fastdnatm spin kit for soil mp biomedicals ca usa as per the manufacturer s instructions the v4 and v5 hypervariable regions of 16s rrna genes were amplified with a primer pair 515f 907r to target the bacterial domain the illumina novaseq sequencing pe250 service was provided by novogene bio tech inc beijing china the data processing followed the pipeline described by previous studies qiu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 the raw data of bioinformatics obtained in this study are available under accession numbers prjna914080 2 6 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was employed to assess the difference in sulfide production rates sprs in sdr with different bicarbonate and sulfate concentrations at the 95 confidence level p 0 05 the statistical analysis was conducted in originpro 2019 3 results 3 1 long term performance of sulfur disproportionating sulfidogenic bioreactor a laboratory scale sdr was continuously operated for 393 days to evaluate its long term feasibility and stability for sulfide production in the absence of organics fig 2 during the first three phases the effects of different alkalinity concentrations on the sd process were studied during phase i with 1000 mg l nahco3 addition 58 52 5 22 mg s l sulfide were generated resulting in 5 85 0 52 mg s l h of sulfide production rates sprs fig 2a and c with elevated nahco3 concentration from 1000 mg l in phase i to 3000 mg l in phase iii the sprs gradually increased to 18 22 2 71 mg s l h with the maximum sprs reached 21 10 mg s l h in phase iii the present results indicate that alkalinity was an important factor influencing the sd process sulfate is usually present in the pretreated amd in practice sun et al 2020a sulfate was therefore added into the influent to determine if its presence and concentration affect the sd process as shown in phase iv in the presence of 688 42 19 63 mg s l sulfate fig 2b the sprs were 17 10 1 23 mg s l h which is similar to that observed in phase iii where sulfate was absent the present result indicates that sulfate presence did not have a substantial influence on the sd process when the influent nahco3 concentration was decreased to 1000 mg l and sulfate concentration was constant during phase v the sprs decreased to 11 59 1 94 mg s l h further suggesting the crucial role of alkalinity in regulating the sd process during phase vi the influent sulfate concentration was the only parameter that was adjusted in which its concentration was increased to an environmentally relevant level 1211 73 41 65 mg s l sun et al 2020a as expected there was no substantial difference in sprs between phase v and vi additionally since sd produces protons we observed that ph dropped from 8 50 0 22 in the influent to 6 87 0 20 in the effluent fig 2a therefore the sd process can be optimized to achieve stable and high rate sulfide production and the presence of sulfate has a minor influence on sd process demonstrating the feasibility of sd for amd treatment 3 2 sulfur disproportionation contributed to sulfide production to further confirm that sulfide production was primarily attributable to the sd process a batch test was conducted using the enriched sludge collected from sdr results showed that the concentrations of sulfide and sulfate gradually increased as time went by in the absence of organics and reached 83 99 3 16 mg s l and 27 48 0 61 mg s l at the end of the experiment respectively fig 3 the molar ratio of sulfide to sulfate concentration was calculated as 3 11 0 28 on average which is slightly higher than the stoichiometric ratio of sd reaction 3 eq 1 this could be the result of the presence of polysulfide disproportionation since polysulfide could be generated chemically at neutral or alkali condition in the presence of sulfide and s0 if polysulfides could be the substrate for sd the ratio of sulfide to sulfate could be 3 6 4 3 poser et al 2016 which is higher than the theoretical value of elemental sulfur disproportionation 3 in addition the ph value at the end of the batch test was lower than that at the beginning 8 46 0 04 vs 7 05 0 02 which is consistent with the proton production during sd qiu et al 2022 this result illustrates that the generated sulfide in sdr was mainly resulted from the sd process 3 3 microbial community diversity and compositions as aforementioned an increased concentration of nahco3 contributed a considerable amount of sulfide production in this study even in the presence of a high concentration of sulfate the sulfidogenic bioreactor performance highly relied on the sdb activity thus sludge samples were collected from the different phases of sdr for 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing analysis to illustrate the effects of alkalinity and or sulfate on the dynamic variations in bacterial abundance related to sd the tendency of the rarefaction curves to approach a saturation plateau indicated that the sequencing depth is sufficient to represent the diversity of the microbial community fig s2 the bacterial community was predominated by five phyla constituting 92 3 of the community fig s3 before nahco3 and sulfate addition day 0 proteobacteria 77 2 bacteroidetes 8 8 chloroflexi 3 5 firmicutes 1 5 acidobacteria 1 3 after adding nahco3 and sulfate to the sdr for a long term period day 375 the abundance of dominant proteobacteria and acidobacteria decreased to 69 9 and 0 1 respectively however bacteroidetes chloroflexi and firmicutes increased to 10 2 5 6 and 4 0 respectively the genus level distributions of the bacterial community were presented in fig 4 in the seeding sludge day 0 eight sulfidogenic genera were identified in the bioreactor such as desulfofustis 2 57 dissulfurimicrobium 1 55 desulfurivibrio 0 11 desulfuromonas 0 02 desulfocapsa 0 05 pseudomonas 0 22 geobacter 0 29 and desulfurella 0 13 during the long term operation it was observed that dissulfurimicrobium dominated the microbial community and its relative abundance remarkably increased from 1 55 in the seeding sludge to 8 44 fig 4 after 149 days of cultivation after the influent sulfate concentration increased to 688 42 mg s l and 1211 73 mg s l on average in phase iv and vi days 194 and 375 the abundance of dissulfurimicrobium maintained at 8 90 and 8 08 similarly the relative abundance of geobacter desulfurella and pseudomonas also increased to 0 63 0 51 and 1 0 on day 375 respectively in addition the relative abundance of desulfuromonas also had a small increase from 0 02 to 0 08 after the long term operation but was still at a low level in contrast the abundance of desulfofustis gradually decreased from 2 57 on day 0 to less than 0 05 in other phases as for the genera desulfurivibrio and desulfocapsa their abundances decreased to an undetected level in the last phase besides sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob were also present in the bioreactor after the long term operation such as sulfurovum thiomonas halothiobacillus and thiobacillus inagaki et al 2004 zhang et al 2018c fig 4 the relative abundance of dominant sob sulfurovum increased dramatically from 1 8 in the seeding sludge to 48 5 on day 149 and maintained stably in the subsequent phases 3 4 performance of heavy metal removal as shown in fig 1 the sdr is integrated into a multi stage amd treatment process to generate sulfide for metal precipitation as fe ions were removed from amd in a prior treatment step with schwertmannite formation sun et al 2020a schoepfer and burton 2021 99 9 98 9 and 99 9 of cu zn and pb were precipitated as sulfide metals in module 2 under the ph of 6 14 0 06 respectively when the ph was further adjusted to 7 19 0 12 in module 3 99 6 of the influent al and 73 3 of the influent mn were removed respectively since the solubility products of manganese sulfides 2 5 10 13 2 5 10 10 and manganese hydroxides 1 9 10 13 are relatively high sahinkaya et al 2011 neculita and rosa 2019 mn is difficult to be completely removed in a sulfidogenic treatment system which is similar to previous studies bai et al 2013 sahinkaya et al 2019 the results in figs 2 and 5 demonstrate that the sd based amd treatment system was capable of generating sufficient sulfide to efficiently remove metals from amd without electron donor addition the metal removal efficiencies are comparable to other sulfidogenic amd treatment systems see table s4 zhang et al 2016 kiran et al 2018 liu et al 2018 4 discussion 4 1 identification of sdb in the sdr eight sulfidogenic genera were identified in the sdr among them desulfofustis desulfurivibrio desulfuromonas and desulfocapsa associating with sulfate reduction were present which could also be capable of disproportionating s0 frederiksen and finster 2003 finster 2008 poser et al 2013 desulfurella was reported to possess the capability of both s0 reduction and sd slobodkin and slobodkina 2019 dissulfurimicrobium was an obligate s0 disproportionator slobodkin et al 2016 yvenou et al 2021 the obligate sdb dissulfurimicrobium became the predominant sulfidogenic genera after nahco3 addition and sulfate had a minor influence on its abundance and activity which provides evidences that sdb in the chemoautotrophic system can be employed for sustainable and high rate sulfide production for the engineering purposes while the abundance of other bacteria that could be capable of sd decreased to a low level during the long term operation which indicated that dissulfurimicrobium was the only dominant sdb besides two dissimilatory sulfur reducers pseudomonas and geobacter were also identified in the bioreactor wang et al 2018 florentino et al 2019 but their relative abundance was all lower than 1 0 in this study it could be inferred the minor role of s0 reduction in sulfide production due to the lack of organic carbon and sd was the main contributor of sulfide production in sdr of note abundant sob was present in the bioreactor during the long term operation it may indicate a possible oxygen leak into sdr or o2 might enter the system along with the influent since we did not remove the dissolved oxygen from the influent as such the presence of sulfide and oxygen could promote sob activity the lower actual s2 so4 2 ratio in the sdr than the theoretical one may also indicate the potential sulfide oxidation fig 2b however the performance of the sdr was not affected even in the presence of a small amount of oxygen fig 2a suggesting that the sdr was robust however in practical application it is still necessary to provide a more anaerobic environment to reduce the additional loss of sulfide 4 2 critical conditions to initiate sulfur disproportionation process in the sdr in this study chemoautotrophic sd was demonstrated to be a feasible alternative against sulfate reducing sulfidogenic process since it does not require exogenous carbon sources however sd process is endothermic under standard conditions eq 1 implying that the ambient conditions such as ph sulfate and sulfide concentration could be critical to the stability of sdr thus thermodynamic analysis was conducted to determine the critical parameters during sd process according to the δg of sd reaction the details described in text s2 sd is thermodynamically favorable when ph is above 5 4 6 0 with sulfate concentrations ranging from 50 to 1000 mg s l and sulfide concentration maintaining at 100 mg s l fig 6 a when sulfide concentrations range from 10 to 200 mg s l and sulfate concentration is maintained at 1000 mg s l fig 6b sd reaction is exothermal as long as the ph is above 4 6 6 4 this indicates that ph could be the more important factor over sulfide and sulfate concentrations florentino et al 2015 therefore sufficient alkalinity was supplied to avoid a substantial decrease in ph during the experiment as a result the sd based sulfidogenic bioreactor achieved practically useful sprs which were also comparable to those previously reported in sulfate reducing biosystems treating amd table s4 ucar et al 2011 costa et al 2017 sahinkaya et al 2018 yildiz et al 2019 of note the aqueous solubility of s0 is approximately 5 µg l at 25 c which means that it has poor bioaccessibility to microbiomes sun et al 2020b the high rate sulfide production obtained in this study could be due to the presence of polysulfide zhang et al 2021 poser et al 2013 reported that polysulfide could be an important intermediate during sd under neutral conditions polysulfide could be generated from an abiotic reaction between sulfide and s0 zhang et al 2018a 2018b the ph values inside the bioreactor were closed to neutral conditions fig 2a providing appropriate conditions for polysulfide formation 2 10 0 02 mg s l polysulfide were also detected in the effluent of the sdr data not shown indicating that polysulfide plays a role in the sd process 4 3 practical implication the sd process could achieve high rate and stable sulfide production with nahco3 addition but without the assistance of external organic carbon actually in practical applications the low cost and locally available alkaline minerals such as limestone dolomite calcite or other alkaline waste materials could be used to substitute nahco3 in the buffer tank prior to sdr module 4 kaur et al 2018 wang et al 2019 silva et al 2021 which could further reduce the operational cost caused by sulfide generation and facilitate sd due to the capture of sulfate ion by calcium minerals it should be noted that the raw amd is acidic before ph amelioration as discussed above sd could occur when ph is above 4 6 based on theoretical calculation to further reduce the operational cost caused by alkalinity addition it merits further studies on the sd process operated at low ph additionally although the seeding sludge used in this study was collected from the estuarine sediment the inoculum collected from other natural and engineered ecosystems could also be feasible for engineering purposes if favorable conditions were provided wu et al 2013 for instance qiu et al 2022 utilized anaerobic sludge collected from a sewage treatment plant as the seeding sludge of s0 pbrs treating nitrate contaminated wastewater and achieved highly efficient nitrogen removal via sdb enrichment the widespread existence of sdb also shows that sd could play a non negligible role in mediating the globally biochemical sulfur cycle in which the sulfide produced by sd may participate in the biogeochemical cycle of other elements which merits further investigation 5 conclusion in this study a novel sd process was demonstrated to achieve efficient sulfide production without addition of external organics which could be used for cost effective amd treatment the main findings are shown as follows a novel sulfur disproportionating reactor was successfully developed with the inoculum collected from estuarine sediment without external electron donor addition sulfur disproportionation process in the sdr produced 200 mg s l sulfide with a maximum spr of 21 10 mg s l h which demonstrates its capacity to precipitate metals from amd even though sulfate is unfavorable to the sulfur disproportionation process the sdr worked well in the long term trial fed with the pretreated amd bearing 1211 73 41 65 mg s l sulfate alkalinity and ph are critical parameters to maintain the sd process at a high rate especially when sulfate is present the sulfide in the effluent of sdr could efficiently remove over 99 of the heavy metals i e fe al zn cu pb from amd except for mn to avoid the toxic effects induced by metal ions in raw amd the sdr is suggested to be installed as a rear or side stream reactor in a sd driven amd treatment system therefore the newly developed organic free sd process could be a more cost effective and sustainable approach to generate sulfide

15033,biological sulfidogenic processes bsps have been considered effective biotechnologies for the treatment of organic deficit acid mine drainage amd and heavy metal recovery however high rate sulfide production relies on the continuous addition of exogenous organic substrates as electron donors to facilitate dissimilatory sulfate reduction which substantially increases the operational cost and co2 emission and also limits the wide application of bsps in amd treatment in this study we proposed a novel chemoautotrophic elemental sulfur disproportionation sd process as an alternative to conventional bsps for treating amd in which sulfur disproportionating bacteria sdb disproportionates sulfur to sulfide and sulfate without organic substrate supplementation during the 393 day lab scale test we observed that the sulfur disproportionating reactor sdr achieved a stable high rate sulfide production with a maximal rate of 21 10 mg s l h at an organic substrate free condition this high rate of sulfide production suggested that the sd process could provide sufficient sulfide to precipitate metal ions from amd thermodynamics analysis and batch tests further revealed that alkalinity rather than sulfate was the critical factor influencing the sd process suggesting that the abundant sulfate present in amd would not inhibit the sd process the critical condition of sd in the sdr was therefore determined microbial community analysis showed that dissulfurimicrobium sp was the dominant sdb during the long term operation regardless of dynamic sulfate and or alkalinity concentrations which provides evidence that sdb can be employed for sustainable and high rate sulfide production for engineering purposes a multi stage amd treatment system equipped with a sdr removed over 99 of the influent metals i e fe al zn cu pb from amd except for mn this study demonstrated that the novel sd process is a green and promising biotechnology for the sustainable treatment of organic deficient metal laden wastewater such as amd graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords elemental sulfur metal laden wastewater sulfide sulfur disproportionating bacteria amd treatment mine water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction biological sulfidogenic processes bsps mediated by sulfate reducing bacteria srb have been considered effective biotechnologies for metal laden wastewater treatment including acid mine drainage amd treatment in which the biogenic sulfide produced by srb can precipitate heavy metals with insoluble metal sulfides being the byproducts gopi kiran et al 2017 rambabu et al 2020 srb are generally heterotrophic and need to utilize organics or hydrogen as electron donors to reduce sulfate to sulfide guo et al 2021 however amd is deficient in organic carbon 10 mg l suggesting the necessity of a high amount of exogenous organic addition to sustain the sulfidogenic processes sun et al 2018 oyetibo et al 2021 santos et al 2022 dosing a large amount of organic chemicals such as glucose acetate or methanol into amd dramatically increases the operational cost and probably induces secondary pollution due to the residual organics it raises a question if abundant sulfide could be continuously generated in a biological process without adding external organic matter if feasible this process would be more cost effective and eco friendly than sulfate reduction when treating amd chemoautotrophic elemental sulfur s0 disproportionation sd could be an ideal candidate approach briefly sd mediated by sulfur disproportionating bacteria sdb can disproportionate s0 into sulfide and sulfate eq 1 canfield and thamdrup 1994 johnston et al 2005 although sd reaction is endergonic under standard conditions thamdrup et al 1993 this biological process has been frequently observed in various natural environments such as marine sediment estuarine coastal sediments haloalkaline lake and groundwater finster et al 1998 poser et al 2016 allioux et al 2020 müller et al 2020 moreover diverse sdb were identified such as dissulfurispira thermophila caldimicrobium thiodismutans dissulfurimicrobium hydrothermale dissulfuribacter thermophilus which offers its potential for amd treatment slobodkin et al 2013 umezawa et al 2020 2021 however there are some knowledge gaps that need to be well addressed before its application in practice high rate sd process is the prerequisite for efficient amd treatment but the extent of sd process is reported at a low level due to the impact of positive gibbs free energy of this reaction canfield and thamdrup 1994 could high rate and stable sd process be achieved from a long term perspective to our knowledge this study was the first attempt to develop a practically useful sd process for amd treatment 1 4 s 0 4 h 2 o so 4 2 3 h s 5 h δ g 0 10 2 kj mo l 1 s 0 since estuarine and coastal sediments have been found to be sdb habitats around the world and their abundance was 105 106 cells cm3 finster 2008 in this study we collected the estuary sediment from pearl river and used it as the inoculum the inoculum was then cultivated with s0 and necessary nutrients but without organic carbon to a evaluate the feasibility and long term stability of high rate sd based sulfidogenic bioreactor for treating amd b determine the presence of sd in the bioreactor and c identify the functional bacteria participating in sulfidogenic process the findings obtained in this study would provide an easy controlled and cost effective biotechnology for metal laden wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum collection and cultivation the inoculum was collected from modaomen estuary sediment 113 24 14 e 21 57 44 n in august 2018 as the main entrance of the xijiang river flowing into the south china sea modaomen estuary is a typical partially mixed sub estuary of the pearl river estuary the bottom water at sampling sites was characterized by oxygen deficit weakly alkaline and high salinity 30 jia et al 2021 the detailed chemical and microbiological characterization about the sediment can be found in table s1 and fig s1 in supporting information respectively the sediment was collected and immediately transferred to our lab it was then cultured under anoxic conditions with necessary nutrients and s fine powder purity 99 5 particle size 20 40 µm in a sealed bottle with a working volume of 2 l the growth medium consisted of the following compositions g l 0 1 nh4cl 0 02 k2hpo4 3h2o 0 01 kh2po4 1 0 nahco3 and 1 ml l of trace elements solution jiang et al 2013 the sealed bottle was then incubated at 500 revolutions per minute rpm in a thermostatic room 30 c for 30 days 2 2 bioreactor setup and operation a laboratory scale acrylic sulfur disproportionating bioreactor sdr with an inner diameter of 50 mm and a height of 58 cm was packed with commercial s0 particles purity 99 resulting in an effective volume of 0 58 l the sdr was seeded with the acclimated sediment from the sealed bottle and was fed with synthetic amd to minimize the toxicities of heavy metals the sulfidogenic bioreactor is usually set up behind metal precipitators during amd treatment in practice chen et al 2016 as such the posterior sulfidogenic bioreactor receives sulfate rich and metal free amd in this study the sulfidogenic bioreactor simulated this scenario the compositions of synthetic amd are presented in table s2 which was similar to those reported previously kiran et al 2018 sahinkaya et al 2019 the sdr was continuously operated for 393 days in the temperature controlled chamber 30 c which was partitioned into six phases see table s3 for the detailed operational parameters to explore the effects of alkalinity and or sulfate on system performance the hydraulic retention time hrt of the bioreactor was maintained at 10 h throughout the whole operational period by controlling the influent flow rate with a peristaltic pump water samples were collected every 2 days to measure the concentrations of total dissolved sulfide h2s hs and s2 sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate as well as ph value in the influent and effluent in order to determine the capacity of the sd process to remove heavy metals a sd based amd treatment system was designed as per sun et al 2020a and is presented in fig 1 the heavy metals were removed in main stream and sulfide was produced from sdr in side stream during the heavy metal removal procedure synthetic amd was continually fed into the sd based amd treatment system at a flow rate of 1 0 l day the fe ions were first removed by improving the ph with naoh in module 1 cu pb and zn were subsequently precipitated by sulfide from sdr in module 2 al and some mn ions were last precipitated as al oh 3 and mn oh 2 by further adjusting the ph in module 3 more operational parameters and details of the sd based amd treatment system were described in text s1 the system performance was evaluated by determining the differences in heavy metal concentrations i e fe al mn zn pb cu between the influent and effluent 2 3 batch test sulfur disproportionation determination to investigate if the sulfide produced in the sulfidogenic bioreactor was from sd a batch test was conducted in triplicates using the active sludge from sdr after the long term operation before the batch test the sludge was washed with deoxygenated deionized water to remove residual sulfide completely and was then evenly distributed to 75 ml serum bottles containing 65 ml sterile anoxic medium the sludge concentration was 3 40 0 54 g mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss l excessive s0 5 0 g l was added to provide sufficient sulfur source for sdb growth and respiration 1 0 g l nahco3 was also supplemented to provide inorganic carbon source and balance the ph the serum bottles were purged with nitrogen gas and then sealed with rubber stoppers to create an anaerobic environment the batch tests were conducted in a temperature controlled chamber 25 c and lasted for 34 h during which water samples were taken to measure the concentrations of sulfide and sulfate the ph values were also determined at the beginning and end of the batch test 2 4 chemical analysis the concentrations of sulfate sulfite and thiosulfate were analyzed with an ion chromatograph ic 16

to characterize the microbial community evolution tendency during the long term operation the microbial genomic dna was extracted with fastdnatm spin kit for soil mp biomedicals ca usa as per the manufacturer s instructions the v4 and v5 hypervariable regions of 16s rrna genes were amplified with a primer pair 515f 907r to target the bacterial domain the illumina novaseq sequencing pe250 service was provided by novogene bio tech inc beijing china the data processing followed the pipeline described by previous studies qiu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 the raw data of bioinformatics obtained in this study are available under accession numbers prjna914080 2 6 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was employed to assess the difference in sulfide production rates sprs in sdr with different bicarbonate and sulfate concentrations at the 95 confidence level p 0 05 the statistical analysis was conducted in originpro 2019 3 results 3 1 long term performance of sulfur disproportionating sulfidogenic bioreactor a laboratory scale sdr was continuously operated for 393 days to evaluate its long term feasibility and stability for sulfide production in the absence of organics fig 2 during the first three phases the effects of different alkalinity concentrations on the sd process were studied during phase i with 1000 mg l nahco3 addition 58 52 5 22 mg s l sulfide were generated resulting in 5 85 0 52 mg s l h of sulfide production rates sprs fig 2a and c with elevated nahco3 concentration from 1000 mg l in phase i to 3000 mg l in phase iii the sprs gradually increased to 18 22 2 71 mg s l h with the maximum sprs reached 21 10 mg s l h in phase iii the present results indicate that alkalinity was an important factor influencing the sd process sulfate is usually present in the pretreated amd in practice sun et al 2020a sulfate was therefore added into the influent to determine if its presence and concentration affect the sd process as shown in phase iv in the presence of 688 42 19 63 mg s l sulfate fig 2b the sprs were 17 10 1 23 mg s l h which is similar to that observed in phase iii where sulfate was absent the present result indicates that sulfate presence did not have a substantial influence on the sd process when the influent nahco3 concentration was decreased to 1000 mg l and sulfate concentration was constant during phase v the sprs decreased to 11 59 1 94 mg s l h further suggesting the crucial role of alkalinity in regulating the sd process during phase vi the influent sulfate concentration was the only parameter that was adjusted in which its concentration was increased to an environmentally relevant level 1211 73 41 65 mg s l sun et al 2020a as expected there was no substantial difference in sprs between phase v and vi additionally since sd produces protons we observed that ph dropped from 8 50 0 22 in the influent to 6 87 0 20 in the effluent fig 2a therefore the sd process can be optimized to achieve stable and high rate sulfide production and the presence of sulfate has a minor influence on sd process demonstrating the feasibility of sd for amd treatment 3 2 sulfur disproportionation contributed to sulfide production to further confirm that sulfide production was primarily attributable to the sd process a batch test was conducted using the enriched sludge collected from sdr results showed that the concentrations of sulfide and sulfate gradually increased as time went by in the absence of organics and reached 83 99 3 16 mg s l and 27 48 0 61 mg s l at the end of the experiment respectively fig 3 the molar ratio of sulfide to sulfate concentration was calculated as 3 11 0 28 on average which is slightly higher than the stoichiometric ratio of sd reaction 3 eq 1 this could be the result of the presence of polysulfide disproportionation since polysulfide could be generated chemically at neutral or alkali condition in the presence of sulfide and s0 if polysulfides could be the substrate for sd the ratio of sulfide to sulfate could be 3 6 4 3 poser et al 2016 which is higher than the theoretical value of elemental sulfur disproportionation 3 in addition the ph value at the end of the batch test was lower than that at the beginning 8 46 0 04 vs 7 05 0 02 which is consistent with the proton production during sd qiu et al 2022 this result illustrates that the generated sulfide in sdr was mainly resulted from the sd process 3 3 microbial community diversity and compositions as aforementioned an increased concentration of nahco3 contributed a considerable amount of sulfide production in this study even in the presence of a high concentration of sulfate the sulfidogenic bioreactor performance highly relied on the sdb activity thus sludge samples were collected from the different phases of sdr for 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing analysis to illustrate the effects of alkalinity and or sulfate on the dynamic variations in bacterial abundance related to sd the tendency of the rarefaction curves to approach a saturation plateau indicated that the sequencing depth is sufficient to represent the diversity of the microbial community fig s2 the bacterial community was predominated by five phyla constituting 92 3 of the community fig s3 before nahco3 and sulfate addition day 0 proteobacteria 77 2 bacteroidetes 8 8 chloroflexi 3 5 firmicutes 1 5 acidobacteria 1 3 after adding nahco3 and sulfate to the sdr for a long term period day 375 the abundance of dominant proteobacteria and acidobacteria decreased to 69 9 and 0 1 respectively however bacteroidetes chloroflexi and firmicutes increased to 10 2 5 6 and 4 0 respectively the genus level distributions of the bacterial community were presented in fig 4 in the seeding sludge day 0 eight sulfidogenic genera were identified in the bioreactor such as desulfofustis 2 57 dissulfurimicrobium 1 55 desulfurivibrio 0 11 desulfuromonas 0 02 desulfocapsa 0 05 pseudomonas 0 22 geobacter 0 29 and desulfurella 0 13 during the long term operation it was observed that dissulfurimicrobium dominated the microbial community and its relative abundance remarkably increased from 1 55 in the seeding sludge to 8 44 fig 4 after 149 days of cultivation after the influent sulfate concentration increased to 688 42 mg s l and 1211 73 mg s l on average in phase iv and vi days 194 and 375 the abundance of dissulfurimicrobium maintained at 8 90 and 8 08 similarly the relative abundance of geobacter desulfurella and pseudomonas also increased to 0 63 0 51 and 1 0 on day 375 respectively in addition the relative abundance of desulfuromonas also had a small increase from 0 02 to 0 08 after the long term operation but was still at a low level in contrast the abundance of desulfofustis gradually decreased from 2 57 on day 0 to less than 0 05 in other phases as for the genera desulfurivibrio and desulfocapsa their abundances decreased to an undetected level in the last phase besides sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob were also present in the bioreactor after the long term operation such as sulfurovum thiomonas halothiobacillus and thiobacillus inagaki et al 2004 zhang et al 2018c fig 4 the relative abundance of dominant sob sulfurovum increased dramatically from 1 8 in the seeding sludge to 48 5 on day 149 and maintained stably in the subsequent phases 3 4 performance of heavy metal removal as shown in fig 1 the sdr is integrated into a multi stage amd treatment process to generate sulfide for metal precipitation as fe ions were removed from amd in a prior treatment step with schwertmannite formation sun et al 2020a schoepfer and burton 2021 99 9 98 9 and 99 9 of cu zn and pb were precipitated as sulfide metals in module 2 under the ph of 6 14 0 06 respectively when the ph was further adjusted to 7 19 0 12 in module 3 99 6 of the influent al and 73 3 of the influent mn were removed respectively since the solubility products of manganese sulfides 2 5 10 13 2 5 10 10 and manganese hydroxides 1 9 10 13 are relatively high sahinkaya et al 2011 neculita and rosa 2019 mn is difficult to be completely removed in a sulfidogenic treatment system which is similar to previous studies bai et al 2013 sahinkaya et al 2019 the results in figs 2 and 5 demonstrate that the sd based amd treatment system was capable of generating sufficient sulfide to efficiently remove metals from amd without electron donor addition the metal removal efficiencies are comparable to other sulfidogenic amd treatment systems see table s4 zhang et al 2016 kiran et al 2018 liu et al 2018 4

model deep learning attention based mechanism time series big data data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in the face of water shortages around the world the demand for high quality drinking water is growing with the advancement of water purification technologies drinking water treatment plants dwtps are challenged to process increasingly complex water quality due to climate change and population growth and to comply with more stringent regulations to protect public health li et al 2021 coagulation is one of the most important processes in dwtps coagulation aggregates particles into bigger sizes which are then settled in a subsequent process to remove solid and organic matter determining coagulant dosage is a time consuming process that incorporates the nonlinear relationships of numerous features heddam 2021 this complication is affected by raw water quality zhang et al 2013 along with quick mixing hydraulic factors and environmental conditions sohrabi et al 2018 improperly managed coagulant dosage results in inadequate particle settling and removal excessive load on filters and increased treatment costs narges et al 2021 previous studies have attempted to develop mathematical models for determining coagulant dosage bazer bachi et al 1990 van leeuwen et al 1999 however mathematical models generally include factors that require real time measurements or are based on assumptions that are difficult to apply in practice haghiri et al 2018 mathematical models lack an understanding of the overall dynamics of the water treatment processes and may have difficulties managing nonlinear relationships among constituents prevalent in the coagulation process li et al 2021 due to the lack of accurate timely and effective prediction models many dwtps rely on manual coagulation dosage determination based on operator knowledge outcomes may not be guaranteed because the coagulation effect can only be detected in the future zhang and stanley 1999 dwtps fail to respond to unexpected situations such as the absence of operators due to an emergency e g covid 19 therefore forecasting optimal coagulant dosing is critical for the effective operation of dwtps data driven techniques using machine learning have drawn attention in process monitoring since they have fewer restrictions on the assumptions yin et al 2016 and are supported by a huge amount of data that are accessible nowadays with the advance in computing machine learning has been developed and improved bringing innovation in forecasting coagulant dosage machine learning can manage complicated nonlinear relationships and have a comprehensive understanding of the overall dynamics of water treatment processes li et al 2021 machine learning can monitor and predict water quality determine coagulation dosage and eventually assist in automatic process control li et al 2021 previously machine learning models were used to develop process models for simulating water treatment processes artificial neural networks anns one of the widely used machine learning models have been employed for modeling optimal coagulant dosage because they allow the implementation of nonlinearity and time varying dynamic models in the water treatment process for example griffiths and andrews 2011 used an ann model to predict coagulant dosage shi et al 2022 determined the coagulant dosage based on uv visible spectra of raw water due to the limitation of ann which has the potential to be trapped in local minima an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis was applied showing improved accuracies kim and parnichkun 2017 narges et al 2021 however these studies used short term data which are not sufficient to reflect the impact of weather and climate change most of the proposed algorithms used cluster analysis with multiple sub models that could not handle all conditions as a whole moreover all of them were based on a cross sectional approach that did not consider the effect of time series characteristics deep learning a subset of machine learning was developed to solve the problems in processing raw data and discovering their representation lecun et al 2015 goodfellow et al 2016 although deep learning has shown strong feature extraction ability and sufficient data mining ability few studies have applied deep learning to predict the dynamics of the coagulation process li et al 2021 due to the lack of a large amount of data for training recently a convolutional neural network cnn was used to predict the coagulant dosage from floc images yamamura et al 2020 in the development of deep learning algorithms recurrent neural networks rnn were introduced to process sequential data to extract hidden information across different sequence lengths and positions in time one of the mathematical challenges of learning long term dependencies in rnn is vanishing gradients which hide information and lengthen the learning process long short term memory lstm model was developed to solve the problem by controlling weight with self loops goodfellow et al 2016 gated recurrent unit gru was proposed in a simpler structure often showing enhanced performance gru has been successfully applied to environmental fields for predicting air pollutant concentration huang and kuo 2018 zhou et al 2019 water level zhang et al 2018 and water quality liu et al 2019 given that raw water characteristics in dwtps change with time and season it is necessary to adopt a model that can process time series datasets for predicting coagulant dosage a recent breakthrough in deep learning for sequential data is a attention based mechanism which is intended to enhance the performance of lengthy input sequences godoy rojas et al 2022 attention based models allow identifying relevant parts of the input sequence data to improve prediction in the target time series zhao et al 2020 the attention based models have demonstrated improved predictive performance in the control and monitoring of the industrial process fang et al 2021 godoy rojas et al 2022 hydrology noor et al 2022 and surface water quality li and li 2023 the attention based model is expected to improve predictive performance in the water treatment process this study aims to develop a deep learning model based on the attention based mechanism using long term data for water treatment processes a newly developed attention based recurrent deep learning model called graph attention based multivariate time series forecasting model gamtf was employed the model was developed as a multiple output deep learning model as opposed to a conventional single output model to determine the coagulant dosage and predict the resulting settled water turbidity simultaneously the performance of the gamtf model was compared to selected conventional machine learning models to evaluate the performance of time series models against cross sectional models the proposed model can serve as a reliable decision making system for coagulant dosage for real time application to the best of our knowledge the deep learning approach especially the graph attention based one considering a multivariate time series dataset is the first attempt at coagulation modeling in water treatment processes in supporting the learning ability the dataset employed in this study is the largest compared to other studies in water treatment process modeling 2 methodology 2 1 data acquisition the data used in this study were acquired from the seokseong water treatment plant wtp located in buyeo gun chungcheongnam do korea the wtp and its intake at hyundo are located 76 km and 3 km away from daecheong dam respectively the wtp is a conventional treatment facility consisting of coagulation flocculation sedimentation filtration and disinfection fig 1 the wtp has an operating capacity of 103 600 m3 day and supplies potable water to residents of nonsan shi and buyeo gun water quantity and quality are automatically monitored using sensors at the inlet of receiving basin flow rate ph temperature alkalinity electrical conductivity and turbidity since the ec sensor was not set for temperature adjustment all the ec values were adjusted the type poly aluminum chloride or poly aluminum chloride sulfate and amount of coagulant are determined based on the knowledge of the operators considering the quality of raw water and the operation conditions of the water treatment processes all monitored data and coagulant amounts are recorded in real time in the supervisory control and data acquisition scada system and transferred to the local database and finally to the main database system data are first recorded in minutes and then averaged over 15 min and 1 hour due to storage capacity data per minute are stored only for a limited number of years and the hourly data are stored permanently in the main database system hourly datasets with 93 516 data points between 2011 and 2021 since system installation were obtained from the database server 2 2 data preprocessing and analysis raw data were preprocessed joo et al 2000 using the following steps i data lagging ii imputation of outliers and missing values and iii normalization data lagging was conducted to ensure a true input output relationship as the raw water quality in the current time step must match the features of the subsequent process in the future time step based on the hydraulic retention time hrt of each process and between processes hrt was calculated by dividing the volume of each internal tank or pipe by the average flow rate griffiths and andrews 2011 the hrt was assumed to be constant to maintain a one to one relationship between raw water quality and the water feature of subsequent processes and their time series characteristics therefore the raw water and the coagulant dosage data were moved forward to the corresponding settled water turbidity measurement outlier detection was based on the prior information to remove unrealistic values as there were no records of erroneous outliers they were kept in the datasets these spikes were expected to enhance the robustness of the model when handling unexpected outliers in real practice while reducing model performance in the case of noise the detected outliers and missing values were imputed using moving averages with a window size of 3 all data values were normalized to rescale the data range to 0 and 1 1 x si x i x min x max x min x si 0 1 where xsi is the scaled value and xmin and xmax are the minimum and the maximum values of the samples normalization enhances the reliability of the model by lowering the estimation error and fastening the learning process sola and sevilla 1997 after pre processing the number of datasets was reduced to 75 653 the dataset in this study was formated as a multivariate time series and processed according to the timeframe the dataset was divided into two sets training data with 69 819 data points between 2011 and 2020 except 2012 and 2017 due to missing values and test data with 5834 data points between january and august 2021 it should be noted that the models were trained with the coagulant dosage values in real practice in the dwtp to ensure reliable dwtp practice the coagulant dosage based on the operators experience and expertise was assumed to be the ground truth descriptive statistics were used to understand the features of the acquired data the measure of central tendency e g mean and median dispersion e g range standard deviation coefficient of variation and quartiles and association e g correlation was calculated for each feature 2 3 model algorithms 2 3 1 multiple linear regression multiple linear regression mlr is used to estimate the linear relationship between two or more independent features and one dependent feature pedregosa et al 2011 2 s t β 0 β 1 x t i β i x t 1 ϵ where ˆst is the dependent valuable xi t are the independent features β ˆ i is the coefficient for each independent feature β ˆ 0 is the y intercept and ϵˆ is the error term mlr has been used to predict the coagulant dosage to emphasize the importance of using raw water features that correlate highly with the coagulant dosage heddam 2021 shi et al 2022 in this case the coagulant dosage was set as a dependent feature and raw water features were set as independent features 2 3 2 random forest random forest rf is a fast and simple method that handles data with nonlinear relationships and has a high tolerance for outliers zhang et al 2021 the rf is a set of tree predictors each tree based on the values of an independently sampled random vector with the same distribution across all trees in the forest breiman 2001 the rf starts with many randomly generated bootstrap samples from the original training data and each bootstrap sample is fitted using a regression tree breiman 2001 a limited selection of input features randomly chosen from the total set is considered for binary partitioning for each node per tree breiman 2001 the criterion for splitting the regression tree is based on selecting the input feature with the lowest gini index rodriguez galiano et al 2015 3 gini 1 j 1 m p i 2 where pi denotes the probability of an element being classified for a distinct class for each tree the data splitting procedure was repeated from the root node in each internal node of a rule until a predefined stop condition was achieved zhou et al 2016 the predicted value is determined by averaging through all trees the rf model has been widely used in water fields such as coagulant dosage and turbidity prediction gu et al 2020 heddam 2021 zhang et al 2021 2 3 3 gate recurrent neural network gru was introduced to solve the problems of long term memory and gradient in backpropagation chung et al 2014 gru is considered easier to implement due to its simpler structure than lstm with update and reset gates the update gate determines how much past memory to retain and the reset gate determines how to integrate the current input with the previous memory kumar et al 2018 two input features input vector x t and previous output vector h t 1 are fed into the model each time the output of each gate can be generated by logical operations and nonlinear transformations of the inputs wang et al 2018 the following describes the relationship between input and output chung et al 2014 4 z t σ g w z x t u z h t 1 b z r t σ g w r x t u r h t 1 b r h t ϕ h w h x t u h r t h t 1 b h h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t where z t r t and h t denote the update gate reset gate and candidate activation respectively σ is the sigmoid function denotes hadamard product w and u are related weight matrices and b is bias 2 3 4 graph attention based multivariate time series forecasting model gamtf combines gru with two graph attention layers in parallel fig 2 to learn the interdependence of multivariate time series in both feature and temporal dimensions where each univariate time series is treated as an individual feature the model was modified based on multivariate time series anomaly detection via graph attention network zhao et al 2020 with a target number of outputs and a fine tuner instead of the reconstruction model to help improve model training and generalization ability detailed information can be referred to zhao et al 2020 a 1 d convolution layer was used to extract high level features from each time series input dos santos and gatti 2014 then two graph attention layers the feature oriented graph attention layer and the time oriented graph attention layer were built before a gru to treat the time series as a complete graph zhao et al 2020 these two layers consist of three parts encoder processor and decoder encoder e x χ g encodes observed state sequence to a graph g v e g as a hidden layer where v v i i 1 n are vertices and e e ij i j 1 n are edges feature oriented graph and time oriented graph follow different encoding strategies the feature oriented graph captures the relationships between adjacent nodes with each node representing a different feature and each edge denoting the relationship between two corresponding features i e v i f v x t w t i i 1 f where f v is the encode function for vertices the time oriented graph captures the temporal dependencies in time series considering all the timestamps within a sliding window as a complete graph i e v i f v x i 1 x i f i t w t encoded nodes are fully connected to create the graph a shared linear transformation parametrized by a weight matrix w is applied to every node the edge feature was created by applying a shared attention function e ij a w v i w v j this attention function is learnable and can be replaced by any feedforward neural network layer processor g g g firstly generates attention weight for every edge based on features of connected vertices 5 α ij exp e ij k n i rexp e ik where n i is neighborhoods of node i then features are aggregated from each edge to update node features 6 v i σ j n i α ijw v j where σ is a nonlinear activation function the processor can be multi step depending on graph complexity and model capability the final output of the processor is an updated graph g decoder d g g χ extracts values from the updated graph i e for feature oriented graph x t w t i g v v i i 1 f where g v is the decode function for vertices the final output is converted into original data format hamilton et al 2017 after the graph attention process the output from the 1 d convolution layer and two graph attention layers are concatenated and fed into the gru to capture the sequential patterns in the time series finally the output of the gru is fed into a fully connected forecasting based model for the final result note that our forecast model will output one value as the prediction s t s t the loss function for the forecast model can be formulated as mean square error 7 l f s t s t 2 2 4 model implementation the procedures of model implementation are shown in fig 3 three types of input and output combinations were fed into models and their performances were evaluated and compared 1 the raw water features were fed to predict the coagulant dosage this combination would be used as a baseline for evaluating the performance of different models 2 settled water turbidity was added to the input to assess the impact of settled water turbidity which serves as a conditional feature to control coagulant dosage in the model learning process 3 the raw water features were developed to predict both the coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity which is the ultimate proposed model note that the past values of coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity were included as input features for gru and gmatf due to time series data characteristics all models were carefully adjusted with their hyper parameters to expect their best performance regarding the dataset in rf the number of regression trees i e 500 and the number of input features per node the minimum number of 2 were optimized in gru epochs 16 24 learning rates 0 001 batch sizes 16 and dropout 0 3 were optimized in gamtf epochs 17 32 100 learning rates 0 0001 batch sizes 16 dropout 0 3 and kernel sizes 5 were optimized python 3 8 was used in this study pandas pandas development team 2020 was used for data imputation with a rolling function mlr and rf models were imported from sklearn pedregosa et al 2011 and the gru model was imported from pytorch paszke et al 2019 2 5 evaluation of model performance model performance was measured using the correlation coefficient r coefficient of determination r 2 and the root mean squared error rmse 8 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 9 r 2 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n y

respectively the lower rmse the higher r and r 2 values indicate better performance to determine the contribution of each feature to the model performance a feature importance analysis was conducted feature importance function from the rf model package was used for gamtf each input feature was eliminated in turn and their performance was evaluated 3 results and discussion 3 1 data analysis the raw water quality data show significant variations over the past 11 years fig 4 turbidity values were generally low with an average of 3 ntu table 1 lacking severe episodes because the raw water is withdrawn from the deep water of the lake so that the water quality is rather stable due to the dilution effect of the lake high turbidity of the raw water occurred during the summer rainy season although the values were not directly proportional to the amount of rainfall the raw water turbidity showed a significantly high coefficient of variation 2 and 1 16 respectively for the training and test data with a sharp rise up to around 92 ntu in august 2011 table 1 fig 4 other major turbidity rises were observed in the summer of 2016 2020 and 2021 with peaks below 55 ntu this variation in turbidity could only be seen in datasets over long periods of time previous studies using only a few years of the dataset were unable to capture such variations the coagulant dosage increased dramatically during the summer rainy season in 2011 2016 2020 and 2021 correspondingly in summer settled water turbidity sometimes exceeded 1 ntu which is the guideline value for settlement effluent temperature ph and ec showed seasonal fluctuations throughout the years the temperature peaked in summer while ph and ec reached troughs the correlation results fig 5 show that the coagulant dosage and raw water turbidity have the highest correlation with 0 77 and 0 88 respectively in the training and test data however the correlations between coagulant dosage and raw water turbidity for each year varied from 0 007 to 0 92 a high correlation is shown in data with high turbidity for each year this variation proves the need for large datasets to extract sufficient information for the model to learn coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity also show a high correlation because settled water turbidity is the consequence of the coagulation process however their correlations for each year also varied from 0 066 to 0 82 a high correlation was also found in data showing high turbidity of raw water for each year similar variations are observed in the correlations between other raw water features and coagulant dosage the statistical properties of the training and test data were different while the mean and the standard deviation of all water features did not show much difference between the training and test data the ranges of all water features were significantly different for example the maximum turbidity episode in the training data was 92 ntu in 2011 while that in the test data was only 18 ntu the minimum and maximum amount of coagulant used in the test data were 89 times and 50 of those in the training data respectively the coagulant dosage in the training data shows a high correlation with the turbidity of raw and settled water 0 65 however the coagulant dosage in the test data shows a high correlation 0 75 with all the water features except flow rate and ec of the raw water most of the water features in the test data also show a high correlation 0 6 between them except for flow rate while only temperature and alkalinity show a high correlation 0 6 with ec and or ph in the training data 3 2 prediction of coagulant dosage using raw water features the first model approach involved raw water features as input to predict coagulant dosage the resulting mlr model presents that coagulant dosage had a positive relationship with flow rate temperature and turbidity while it had a negative relationship with ph and alkalinity 11 y coagulant 0 0165 x flow rate 1 4475 x turbidity 11 6378 x ph 0 5121 x alkalinity 0 2312 x temperature 0 0960 x ec 70 5504 mlr predictions for the coagulant dosage showed a trend similar to the actual values until mid july but the predicted dosages tended to be lower than the actual dosages afterward during the rainy season when raw water turbidity was high fig 6 a mlr predictions for the high dosage range tilted from the identity line being lower than actual values fig 7 a rf performed better in the high coagulant dosage range after mid july fig 6b which contradicts the results presented by heddam 2021 and had lower prediction accuracy than mlr fig 7b gru prediction presents a smooth trend without depicting the details of each data point fig 6c the results of the gru model show two distinct clusters of low and high coagulant dosage in the test data fig 7c the smooth trend in august was translated into nearly uniform predictions of around 65 75 l hr corresponding to the actual values in the range of 40 100 l hr the gamtf predictions agreed with the actual values over the entire test period providing detailed prediction behavior fig 6d the results also agreed with the actual values around the identity line fig 7d the gamtf model demonstrated accurate predictive capability even at extremely high coagulant dosage demand 100 l hr whereas all the other models failed this is important for the effective operation of dwtp the performance results tables 1 and 2 show that the gamtf model outperformed the other models with the highest r 0 97 and r2 0 94 and the lowest rmse 3 55 l hr the gamtf model could follow the trend in both low and high cases showing a wider range of practical usage the performances of mlr rf and gru models were less accurate after mid july for treating water with high turbidity as evidenced by some previous studies kim and parnichkun 2017 jayaweera et al 2019 gamtf as well as gru considering time series outperformed the other models with a cross sectional approach that takes input data only at the current time step without considering past information the results demonstrate the importance of considering information on the past status of each feature and capturing their sequential patterns to predict the coagulant dosage in the water treatment process between the deep learning models gamtf outperformed gru demonstrating the advantage of adding the graph attention based mechanism the attention based mechanism significantly improved model performance which is consistent with the results of the previous studies godoy rojas et al 2022 noor et al 2022 li and li 2023 while the gru embeds feature information in the hidden layer without considering pairwise relationships between features in the wtp data gamtf can improve the prediction of coagulant dosage from specific pairwise dependences captured through two graph attention layers the feature oriented graph attention layer can focus on the specific pairwise relationships instead of all feature together relationships in other models this allows the model to better understand interactions between water features remove redundant information and give more weight to important water features to predict coagulant dosage the time oriented graph attention layer considers pairwise interaction between different timeframes including non adjacent ones zhao et al 2020 this allows the model to capture the importance of each timeframe for predicting coagulant dosage and the long term dependences between timeframes of water features the outputs of the two graph attention layers are fed into the gru component in the gamtf which enhances the analysis of sequential patterns that are present in the wtp data particularly the use of long term data over 9 years was important for properly training deep learning models the amount of training data required by deep learning models is huge compared to conventional machine learning models this was a major limitation in the application of deep learning to environmental fields in the past when only intermittent water quality measurements were available through laboratory experiments the advancement and widespread implementation of online sensors have enabled long term data accumulation through real time measurements long term data also include the impact of different weather conditions on raw water quality over the years which cannot be realized with short term data as the deep learning models were trained with long term data the model could handle various instances found in the dataset wang et al 2021 and learn the interrelationships between features the models using long term data in this study provide better prediction accuracies compared to the machine learning models using short term data in previous studies griffiths and andrews 2011 kim and parnichkun 2017 heddam 2021 narges et al 2021 no previous studies have used long term multi year datasets to train their models although one of the previous studies trained each model for different raw water conditions and achieved relatively high accuracy kim and parnichkun 2017 their models were unable to handle the dataset as a whole under various circumstances instead gamtf offers a predictive model that can handle a full range of different raw water conditions gamtf however has a higher computational load requiring more computation time than other conventional models the lower computational efficiency of attention based model has also been reported in the previous studies haq and harigovindan 2022 li and li 2023 like other deep learning models gamtf requires a large amount of training data for proper learning compared to machine learning models 3 3 prediction of coagulant dosage using raw water features and settled water turbidity the second modeling approach added settled water turbidity as an input the prediction results of each model figs 6e h and 7e h were similar to those in the previous section the resulting mlr model presents a relationship similar to the raw water features and a positive linear relationship with the settled water turbidity 12 y coagulant 0 0165 x flow rate 1 3377 x turbidity 10 9212 x ph 0 5093 x alkalinity 0 2359 x temperature 0 1005 x ec 6 5789 x swturbidity 62 8919 for mlr the accuracy of the test data was slightly reduced table 2 rf predictions in the high dosage range were more scattered around the identity line fig 7f gru predictions were similar to the previous section figs 6g and 7g the performance of gamtf was slightly reduced in the high range such that the predicted values tended to be lower than the actual values after mid july figs 6h and 7h adding settled water turbidity as an input did not significantly enhance the performance of gamtf and degraded the performance of the other models table 2 this is probably due to the sequential order between coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity this is consistent with a previous study jayaweera et al 2019 of a high turbidity model in which settled water turbidity was excluded from the best input combination another possible explanation refers to the size of the sedimentation basin of seokseong wtp since it is over twice the size of sedimentation basins of other general wtps particles are mostly precipitated by gravity and more affected by the condition of the sedimentation tank such as floc size rather than the amount of coagulant 3 4 prediction of both coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity using raw water features both coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity were predicted from raw water features using gamtf because it outperformed other models the model prediction for coagulant dosage was slightly less compared to the single output models in the previous sections tables 2 and 3 this may be due to the model s usage of information for prediction in the single output model all information stored in the model was used to predict the coagulant dosage and the hyper parameters of the model were adjusted by the difference between only the predicted and actual value of the coagulant dosage in the double output model the stored information of the model was shared between the two outputs increasing the prediction difficulties hence the performance was slightly reduced another possible reason is the limitation in connecting the settled water turbidity hidden features and other input features a higher dimension encoder could help solve the problem which is a potential future work the prediction accuracy for settled water turbidity appears to be lower than that for the coagulant dosage this was due to the difference in coagulant dosage predictions which were translated into predictions of settled water turbidity and should not be construed as inaccurate gamtf was able to follow trends for both coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity fig 6i j the predicted coagulant dosage values were lower than actual amounts until mid july when treating raw water with low turbidity but were higher afterward when treating raw water with high turbidity while settled water turbidity remained below 1 ntu this indicates that implementing model prediction based on long term data can reduce chemical costs for treating low turbidity while increasing the amount of coagulant for treating high turbidity to ensure that the settled water turbidity complies with guidelines contrary to the results of the single output models the model exhibited an improved prediction of coagulant dosage particularly for extremely high dosage demand cases fig 7i this modeling approach offers a better decision support system by suggesting coagulant dosage based on raw water quality and previous dosage along with predicted settled water turbidity operators can adjust the coagulant dosage considering the predicted settled water turbidity this will give an alert if the settled water turbidity is expected to exceed the standard so that follow up can be taken 3 5 feature importance analysis the results of the feature importance analysis table 3 show that eliminating each feature at a time did not significantly affect the model performance this is different from the feature importance result derived from the rf model which identified raw water turbidity 0 78 as the most important feature followed by flow rate 0 07 and alkalinity 0 05 of raw water it is probably because the information given by each feature could be inferred from other input features as its attention based mechanism considered the hidden inter relationship between features and the multivariate time series approach considered the past states of features the model structure could facilitate robust predictive performance 4 conclusion the study developed a novel prediction model with attention based mechanisms and a multivariate time series dataset to improve the coagulant dosage prediction and maintain effluent quality with potential cost savings a deep learning forecasting model was employed to address the limited performance of the conventional machine learning models and improve the coagulant dosage determination system according to changes in raw water quality the graph attention neural network was first implemented in the water treatment domain and long term multivariate time series characteristic was first considered in the coagulation process this is the first attempt to use big data for deep learning applications in water treatment processes this study shows the importance of using big data for properly training deep learning models because long term data contain the impact of various weather conditions over many years that cannot be realized with short term data the gamtf model successfully predicted coagulant dosage and outperformed other conventional machine learning models the attention based mechanism used in the gamtf model improved the prediction accuracy by considering hidden interrelationships between features compared to cross sectional models time series models enhanced predictive performance by considering past feature states the gamtf model also successfully predicted both coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity simultaneously the double output model offers an improved decision support system by presenting coagulant dosage predictions together with the resulting settled water turbidity this research could be extended to be combined with the scada system to determine the appropriate and economical dosage during the coagulation process of actual dwtps due to the lack of coagulant dosage data based on frequent jar tests this study may have limitations in predicting the optimal coagulant dosage for given conditions given the appropriate value of coagulant dosage and a sufficient amount of data this approach will contribute to predicting optimal coagulant dosage in other dwpts this method could also be used for other water related processes involving sequential data information declaration of

model deep learning attention based mechanism time series big data data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in the face of water shortages around the world the demand for high quality drinking water is growing with the advancement of water purification technologies drinking water treatment plants dwtps are challenged to process increasingly complex water quality due to climate change and population growth and to comply with more stringent regulations to protect public health li et al 2021 coagulation is one of the most important processes in dwtps coagulation aggregates particles into bigger sizes which are then settled in a subsequent process to remove solid and organic matter determining coagulant dosage is a time consuming process that incorporates the nonlinear relationships of numerous features heddam 2021 this complication is affected by raw water quality zhang et al 2013 along with quick mixing hydraulic factors and environmental conditions sohrabi et al 2018 improperly managed coagulant dosage results in inadequate particle settling and removal excessive load on filters and increased treatment costs narges et al 2021 previous studies have attempted to develop mathematical models for determining coagulant dosage bazer bachi et al 1990 van leeuwen et al 1999 however mathematical models generally include factors that require real time measurements or are based on assumptions that are difficult to apply in practice haghiri et al 2018 mathematical models lack an understanding of the overall dynamics of the water treatment processes and may have difficulties managing nonlinear relationships among constituents prevalent in the coagulation process li et al 2021 due to the lack of accurate timely and effective prediction models many dwtps rely on manual coagulation dosage determination based on operator knowledge outcomes may not be guaranteed because the coagulation effect can only be detected in the future zhang and stanley 1999 dwtps fail to respond to unexpected situations such as the absence of operators due to an emergency e g covid 19 therefore forecasting optimal coagulant dosing is critical for the effective operation of dwtps data driven techniques using machine learning have drawn attention in process monitoring since they have fewer restrictions on the assumptions yin et al 2016 and are supported by a huge amount of data that are accessible nowadays with the advance in computing machine learning has been developed and improved bringing innovation in forecasting coagulant dosage machine learning can manage complicated nonlinear relationships and have a comprehensive understanding of the overall dynamics of water treatment processes li et al 2021 machine learning can monitor and predict water quality determine coagulation dosage and eventually assist in automatic process control li et al 2021 previously machine learning models were used to develop process models for simulating water treatment processes artificial neural networks anns one of the widely used machine learning models have been employed for modeling optimal coagulant dosage because they allow the implementation of nonlinearity and time varying dynamic models in the water treatment process for example griffiths and andrews 2011 used an ann model to predict coagulant dosage shi et al 2022 determined the coagulant dosage based on uv visible spectra of raw water due to the limitation of ann which has the potential to be trapped in local minima an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis was applied showing improved accuracies kim and parnichkun 2017 narges et al 2021 however these studies used short term data which are not sufficient to reflect the impact of weather and climate change most of the proposed algorithms used cluster analysis with multiple sub models that could not handle all conditions as a whole moreover all of them were based on a cross sectional approach that did not consider the effect of time series characteristics deep learning a subset of machine learning was developed to solve the problems in processing raw data and discovering their representation lecun et al 2015 goodfellow et al 2016 although deep learning has shown strong feature extraction ability and sufficient data mining ability few studies have applied deep learning to predict the dynamics of the coagulation process li et al 2021 due to the lack of a large amount of data for training recently a convolutional neural network cnn was used to predict the coagulant dosage from floc images yamamura et al 2020 in the development of deep learning algorithms recurrent neural networks rnn were introduced to process sequential data to extract hidden information across different sequence lengths and positions in time one of the mathematical challenges of learning long term dependencies in rnn is vanishing gradients which hide information and lengthen the learning process long short term memory lstm model was developed to solve the problem by controlling weight with self loops goodfellow et al 2016 gated recurrent unit gru was proposed in a simpler structure often showing enhanced performance gru has been successfully applied to environmental fields for predicting air pollutant concentration huang and kuo 2018 zhou et al 2019 water level zhang et al 2018 and water quality liu et al 2019 given that raw water characteristics in dwtps change with time and season it is necessary to adopt a model that can process time series datasets for predicting coagulant dosage a recent breakthrough in deep learning for sequential data is a attention based mechanism which is intended to enhance the performance of lengthy input sequences godoy rojas et al 2022 attention based models allow identifying relevant parts of the input sequence data to improve prediction in the target time series zhao et al 2020 the attention based models have demonstrated improved predictive performance in the control and monitoring of the industrial process fang et al 2021 godoy rojas et al 2022 hydrology noor et al 2022 and surface water quality li and li 2023 the attention based model is expected to improve predictive performance in the water treatment process this study aims to develop a deep learning model based on the attention based mechanism using long term data for water treatment processes a newly developed attention based recurrent deep learning model called graph attention based multivariate time series forecasting model gamtf was employed the model was developed as a multiple output deep learning model as opposed to a conventional single output model to determine the coagulant dosage and predict the resulting settled water turbidity simultaneously the performance of the gamtf model was compared to selected conventional machine learning models to evaluate the performance of time series models against cross sectional models the proposed model can serve as a reliable decision making system for coagulant dosage for real time application to the best of our knowledge the deep learning approach especially the graph attention based one considering a multivariate time series dataset is the first attempt at coagulation modeling in water treatment processes in supporting the learning ability the dataset employed in this study is the largest compared to other studies in water treatment process modeling 2 methodology 2 1 data acquisition the data used in this study were acquired from the seokseong water treatment plant wtp located in buyeo gun chungcheongnam do korea the wtp and its intake at hyundo are located 76 km and 3 km away from daecheong dam respectively the wtp is a conventional treatment facility consisting of coagulation flocculation sedimentation filtration and disinfection fig 1 the wtp has an operating capacity of 103 600 m3 day and supplies potable water to residents of nonsan shi and buyeo gun water quantity and quality are automatically monitored using sensors at the inlet of receiving basin flow rate ph temperature alkalinity electrical conductivity and turbidity since the ec sensor was not set for temperature adjustment all the ec values were adjusted the type poly aluminum chloride or poly aluminum chloride sulfate and amount of coagulant are determined based on the knowledge of the operators considering the quality of raw water and the operation conditions of the water treatment processes all monitored data and coagulant amounts are recorded in real time in the supervisory control and data acquisition scada system and transferred to the local database and finally to the main database system data are first recorded in minutes and then averaged over 15 min and 1 hour due to storage capacity data per minute are stored only for a limited number of years and the hourly data are stored permanently in the main database system hourly datasets with 93 516 data points between 2011 and 2021 since system installation were obtained from the database server 2 2 data preprocessing and analysis raw data were preprocessed joo et al 2000 using the following steps i data lagging ii imputation of outliers and missing values and iii normalization data lagging was conducted to ensure a true input output relationship as the raw water quality in the current time step must match the features of the subsequent process in the future time step based on the hydraulic retention time hrt of each process and between processes hrt was calculated by dividing the volume of each internal tank or pipe by the average flow rate griffiths and andrews 2011 the hrt was assumed to be constant to maintain a one to one relationship between raw water quality and the water feature of subsequent processes and their time series characteristics therefore the raw water and the coagulant dosage data were moved forward to the corresponding settled water turbidity measurement outlier detection was based on the prior information to remove unrealistic values as there were no records of erroneous outliers they were kept in the datasets these spikes were expected to enhance the robustness of the model when handling unexpected outliers in real practice while reducing model performance in the case of noise the detected outliers and missing values were imputed using moving averages with a window size of 3 all data values were normalized to rescale the data range to 0 and 1 1 x si x i x min x max x min x si 0 1 where xsi is the scaled value and xmin and xmax are the minimum and the maximum values of the samples normalization enhances the reliability of the model by lowering the estimation error and fastening the learning process sola and sevilla 1997 after pre processing the number of datasets was reduced to 75 653 the dataset in this study was formated as a multivariate time series and processed according to the timeframe the dataset was divided into two sets training data with 69 819 data points between 2011 and 2020 except 2012 and 2017 due to missing values and test data with 5834 data points between january and august 2021 it should be noted that the models were trained with the coagulant dosage values in real practice in the dwtp to ensure reliable dwtp practice the coagulant dosage based on the operators experience and expertise was assumed to be the ground truth descriptive statistics were used to understand the features of the acquired data the measure of central tendency e g mean and median dispersion e g range standard deviation coefficient of variation and quartiles and association e g correlation was calculated for each feature 2 3 model algorithms 2 3 1 multiple linear regression multiple linear regression mlr is used to estimate the linear relationship between two or more independent features and one dependent feature pedregosa et al 2011 2 s t β 0 β 1 x t i β i x t 1 ϵ where ˆst is the dependent valuable xi t are the independent features β ˆ i is the coefficient for each independent feature β ˆ 0 is the y intercept and ϵˆ is the error term mlr has been used to predict the coagulant dosage to emphasize the importance of using raw water features that correlate highly with the coagulant dosage heddam 2021 shi et al 2022 in this case the coagulant dosage was set as a dependent feature and raw water features were set as independent features 2 3 2 random forest random forest rf is a fast and simple method that handles data with nonlinear relationships and has a high tolerance for outliers zhang et al 2021 the rf is a set of tree predictors each tree based on the values of an independently sampled random vector with the same distribution across all trees in the forest breiman 2001 the rf starts with many randomly generated bootstrap samples from the original training data and each bootstrap sample is fitted using a regression tree breiman 2001 a limited selection of input features randomly chosen from the total set is considered for binary partitioning for each node per tree breiman 2001 the criterion for splitting the regression tree is based on selecting the input feature with the lowest gini index rodriguez galiano et al 2015 3 gini 1 j 1 m p i 2 where pi denotes the probability of an element being classified for a distinct class for each tree the data splitting procedure was repeated from the root node in each internal node of a rule until a predefined stop condition was achieved zhou et al 2016 the predicted value is determined by averaging through all trees the rf model has been widely used in water fields such as coagulant dosage and turbidity prediction gu et al 2020 heddam 2021 zhang et al 2021 2 3 3 gate recurrent neural network gru was introduced to solve the problems of long term memory and gradient in backpropagation chung et al 2014 gru is considered easier to implement due to its simpler structure than lstm with update and reset gates the update gate determines how much past memory to retain and the reset gate determines how to integrate the current input with the previous memory kumar et al 2018 two input features input vector x t and previous output vector h t 1 are fed into the model each time the output of each gate can be generated by logical operations and nonlinear transformations of the inputs wang et al 2018 the following describes the relationship between input and output chung et al 2014 4 z t σ g w z x t u z h t 1 b z r t σ g w r x t u r h t 1 b r h t ϕ h w h x t u h r t h t 1 b h h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t where z t r t and h t denote the update gate reset gate and candidate activation respectively σ is the sigmoid function denotes hadamard product w and u are related weight matrices and b is bias 2 3 4 graph attention based multivariate time series forecasting model gamtf combines gru with two graph attention layers in parallel fig 2 to learn the interdependence of multivariate time series in both feature and temporal dimensions where each univariate time series is treated as an individual feature the model was modified based on multivariate time series anomaly detection via graph attention network zhao et al 2020 with a target number of outputs and a fine tuner instead of the reconstruction model to help improve model training and generalization ability detailed information can be referred to zhao et al 2020 a 1 d convolution layer was used to extract high level features from each time series input dos santos and gatti 2014 then two graph attention layers the feature oriented graph attention layer and the time oriented graph attention layer were built before a gru to treat the time series as a complete graph zhao et al 2020 these two layers consist of three parts encoder processor and decoder encoder e x χ g encodes observed state sequence to a graph g v e g as a hidden layer where v v i i 1 n are vertices and e e ij i j 1 n are edges feature oriented graph and time oriented graph follow different encoding strategies the feature oriented graph captures the relationships between adjacent nodes with each node representing a different feature and each edge denoting the relationship between two corresponding features i e v i f v x t w t i i 1 f where f v is the encode function for vertices the time oriented graph captures the temporal dependencies in time series considering all the timestamps within a sliding window as a complete graph i e v i f v x i 1 x i f i t w t encoded nodes are fully connected to create the graph a shared linear transformation parametrized by a weight matrix w is applied to every node the edge feature was created by applying a shared attention function e ij a w v i w v j this attention function is learnable and can be replaced by any feedforward neural network layer processor g g g firstly generates attention weight for every edge based on features of connected vertices 5 α ij exp e ij k n i rexp e ik where n i is neighborhoods of node i then features are aggregated from each edge to update node features 6 v i σ j n i α ijw v j where σ is a nonlinear activation function the processor can be multi step depending on graph complexity and model capability the final output of the processor is an updated graph g decoder d g g χ extracts values from the updated graph i e for feature oriented graph x t w t i g v v i i 1 f where g v is the decode function for vertices the final output is converted into original data format hamilton et al 2017 after the graph attention process the output from the 1 d convolution layer and two graph attention layers are concatenated and fed into the gru to capture the sequential patterns in the time series finally the output of the gru is fed into a fully connected forecasting based model for the final result note that our forecast model will output one value as the prediction s t s t the loss function for the forecast model can be formulated as mean square error 7 l f s t s t 2 2 4 model implementation the procedures of model implementation are shown in fig 3 three types of input and output combinations were fed into models and their performances were evaluated and compared 1 the raw water features were fed to predict the coagulant dosage this combination would be used as a baseline for evaluating the performance of different models 2 settled water turbidity was added to the input to assess the impact of settled water turbidity which serves as a conditional feature to control coagulant dosage in the model learning process 3 the raw water features were developed to predict both the coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity which is the ultimate proposed model note that the past values of coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity were included as input features for gru and gmatf due to time series data characteristics all models were carefully adjusted with their hyper parameters to expect their best performance regarding the dataset in rf the number of regression trees i e 500 and the number of input features per node the minimum number of 2 were optimized in gru epochs 16 24 learning rates 0 001 batch sizes 16 and dropout 0 3 were optimized in gamtf epochs 17 32 100 learning rates 0 0001 batch sizes 16 dropout 0 3 and kernel sizes 5 were optimized python 3 8 was used in this study pandas pandas development team 2020 was used for data imputation with a rolling function mlr and rf models were imported from sklearn pedregosa et al 2011 and the gru model was imported from pytorch paszke et al 2019 2 5 evaluation of model performance model performance was measured using the correlation coefficient r coefficient of determination r 2 and the root mean squared error rmse 8 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 9 r 2 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n y

respectively the lower rmse the higher r and r 2 values indicate better performance to determine the contribution of each feature to the model performance a feature importance analysis was conducted feature importance function from the rf model package was used for gamtf each input feature was eliminated in turn and their performance was evaluated 3 results and discussion 3 1 data analysis the raw water quality data show significant variations over the past 11 years fig 4 turbidity values were generally low with an average of 3 ntu table 1 lacking severe episodes because the raw water is withdrawn from the deep water of the lake so that the water quality is rather stable due to the dilution effect of the lake high turbidity of the raw water occurred during the summer rainy season although the values were not directly proportional to the amount of rainfall the raw water turbidity showed a significantly high coefficient of variation 2 and 1 16 respectively for the training and test data with a sharp rise up to around 92 ntu in august 2011 table 1 fig 4 other major turbidity rises were observed in the summer of 2016 2020 and 2021 with peaks below 55 ntu this variation in turbidity could only be seen in datasets over long periods of time previous studies using only a few years of the dataset were unable to capture such variations the coagulant dosage increased dramatically during the summer rainy season in 2011 2016 2020 and 2021 correspondingly in summer settled water turbidity sometimes exceeded 1 ntu which is the guideline value for settlement effluent temperature ph and ec showed seasonal fluctuations throughout the years the temperature peaked in summer while ph and ec reached troughs the correlation results fig 5 show that the coagulant dosage and raw water turbidity have the highest correlation with 0 77 and 0 88 respectively in the training and test data however the correlations between coagulant dosage and raw water turbidity for each year varied from 0 007 to 0 92 a high correlation is shown in data with high turbidity for each year this variation proves the need for large datasets to extract sufficient information for the model to learn coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity also show a high correlation because settled water turbidity is the consequence of the coagulation process however their correlations for each year also varied from 0 066 to 0 82 a high correlation was also found in data showing high turbidity of raw water for each year similar variations are observed in the correlations between other raw water features and coagulant dosage the statistical properties of the training and test data were different while the mean and the standard deviation of all water features did not show much difference between the training and test data the ranges of all water features were significantly different for example the maximum turbidity episode in the training data was 92 ntu in 2011 while that in the test data was only 18 ntu the minimum and maximum amount of coagulant used in the test data were 89 times and 50 of those in the training data respectively the coagulant dosage in the training data shows a high correlation with the turbidity of raw and settled water 0 65 however the coagulant dosage in the test data shows a high correlation 0 75 with all the water features except flow rate and ec of the raw water most of the water features in the test data also show a high correlation 0 6 between them except for flow rate while only temperature and alkalinity show a high correlation 0 6 with ec and or ph in the training data 3 2 prediction of coagulant dosage using raw water features the first model approach involved raw water features as input to predict coagulant dosage the resulting mlr model presents that coagulant dosage had a positive relationship with flow rate temperature and turbidity while it had a negative relationship with ph and alkalinity 11 y coagulant 0 0165 x flow rate 1 4475 x turbidity 11 6378 x ph 0 5121 x alkalinity 0 2312 x temperature 0 0960 x ec 70 5504 mlr predictions for the coagulant dosage showed a trend similar to the actual values until mid july but the predicted dosages tended to be lower than the actual dosages afterward during the rainy season when raw water turbidity was high fig 6 a mlr predictions for the high dosage range tilted from the identity line being lower than actual values fig 7 a rf performed better in the high coagulant dosage range after mid july fig 6b which contradicts the results presented by heddam 2021 and had lower prediction accuracy than mlr fig 7b gru prediction presents a smooth trend without depicting the details of each data point fig 6c the results of the gru model show two distinct clusters of low and high coagulant dosage in the test data fig 7c the smooth trend in august was translated into nearly uniform predictions of around 65 75 l hr corresponding to the actual values in the range of 40 100 l hr the gamtf predictions agreed with the actual values over the entire test period providing detailed prediction behavior fig 6d the results also agreed with the actual values around the identity line fig 7d the gamtf model demonstrated accurate predictive capability even at extremely high coagulant dosage demand 100 l hr whereas all the other models failed this is important for the effective operation of dwtp the performance results tables 1 and 2 show that the gamtf model outperformed the other models with the highest r 0 97 and r2 0 94 and the lowest rmse 3 55 l hr the gamtf model could follow the trend in both low and high cases showing a wider range of practical usage the performances of mlr rf and gru models were less accurate after mid july for treating water with high turbidity as evidenced by some previous studies kim and parnichkun 2017 jayaweera et al 2019 gamtf as well as gru considering time series outperformed the other models with a cross sectional approach that takes input data only at the current time step without considering past information the results demonstrate the importance of considering information on the past status of each feature and capturing their sequential patterns to predict the coagulant dosage in the water treatment process between the deep learning models gamtf outperformed gru demonstrating the advantage of adding the graph attention based mechanism the attention based mechanism significantly improved model performance which is consistent with the results of the previous studies godoy rojas et al 2022 noor et al 2022 li and li 2023 while the gru embeds feature information in the hidden layer without considering pairwise relationships between features in the wtp data gamtf can improve the prediction of coagulant dosage from specific pairwise dependences captured through two graph attention layers the feature oriented graph attention layer can focus on the specific pairwise relationships instead of all feature together relationships in other models this allows the model to better understand interactions between water features remove redundant information and give more weight to important water features to predict coagulant dosage the time oriented graph attention layer considers pairwise interaction between different timeframes including non adjacent ones zhao et al 2020 this allows the model to capture the importance of each timeframe for predicting coagulant dosage and the long term dependences between timeframes of water features the outputs of the two graph attention layers are fed into the gru component in the gamtf which enhances the analysis of sequential patterns that are present in the wtp data particularly the use of long term data over 9 years was important for properly training deep learning models the amount of training data required by deep learning models is huge compared to conventional machine learning models this was a major limitation in the application of deep learning to environmental fields in the past when only intermittent water quality measurements were available through laboratory experiments the advancement and widespread implementation of online sensors have enabled long term data accumulation through real time measurements long term data also include the impact of different weather conditions on raw water quality over the years which cannot be realized with short term data as the deep learning models were trained with long term data the model could handle various instances found in the dataset wang et al 2021 and learn the interrelationships between features the models using long term data in this study provide better prediction accuracies compared to the machine learning models using short term data in previous studies griffiths and andrews 2011 kim and parnichkun 2017 heddam 2021 narges et al 2021 no previous studies have used long term multi year datasets to train their models although one of the previous studies trained each model for different raw water conditions and achieved relatively high accuracy kim and parnichkun 2017 their models were unable to handle the dataset as a whole under various circumstances instead gamtf offers a predictive model that can handle a full range of different raw water conditions gamtf however has a higher computational load requiring more computation time than other conventional models the lower computational efficiency of attention based model has also been reported in the previous studies haq and harigovindan 2022 li and li 2023 like other deep learning models gamtf requires a large amount of training data for proper learning compared to machine learning models 3 3 prediction of coagulant dosage using raw water features and settled water turbidity the second modeling approach added settled water turbidity as an input the prediction results of each model figs 6e h and 7e h were similar to those in the previous section the resulting mlr model presents a relationship similar to the raw water features and a positive linear relationship with the settled water turbidity 12 y coagulant 0 0165 x flow rate 1 3377 x turbidity 10 9212 x ph 0 5093 x alkalinity 0 2359 x temperature 0 1005 x ec 6 5789 x swturbidity 62 8919 for mlr the accuracy of the test data was slightly reduced table 2 rf predictions in the high dosage range were more scattered around the identity line fig 7f gru predictions were similar to the previous section figs 6g and 7g the performance of gamtf was slightly reduced in the high range such that the predicted values tended to be lower than the actual values after mid july figs 6h and 7h adding settled water turbidity as an input did not significantly enhance the performance of gamtf and degraded the performance of the other models table 2 this is probably due to the sequential order between coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity this is consistent with a previous study jayaweera et al 2019 of a high turbidity model in which settled water turbidity was excluded from the best input combination another possible explanation refers to the size of the sedimentation basin of seokseong wtp since it is over twice the size of sedimentation basins of other general wtps particles are mostly precipitated by gravity and more affected by the condition of the sedimentation tank such as floc size rather than the amount of coagulant 3 4 prediction of both coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity using raw water features both coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity were predicted from raw water features using gamtf because it outperformed other models the model prediction for coagulant dosage was slightly less compared to the single output models in the previous sections tables 2 and 3 this may be due to the model s usage of information for prediction in the single output model all information stored in the model was used to predict the coagulant dosage and the hyper parameters of the model were adjusted by the difference between only the predicted and actual value of the coagulant dosage in the double output model the stored information of the model was shared between the two outputs increasing the prediction difficulties hence the performance was slightly reduced another possible reason is the limitation in connecting the settled water turbidity hidden features and other input features a higher dimension encoder could help solve the problem which is a potential future work the prediction accuracy for settled water turbidity appears to be lower than that for the coagulant dosage this was due to the difference in coagulant dosage predictions which were translated into predictions of settled water turbidity and should not be construed as inaccurate gamtf was able to follow trends for both coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity fig 6i j the predicted coagulant dosage values were lower than actual amounts until mid july when treating raw water with low turbidity but were higher afterward when treating raw water with high turbidity while settled water turbidity remained below 1 ntu this indicates that implementing model prediction based on long term data can reduce chemical costs for treating low turbidity while increasing the amount of coagulant for treating high turbidity to ensure that the settled water turbidity complies with guidelines contrary to the results of the single output models the model exhibited an improved prediction of coagulant dosage particularly for extremely high dosage demand cases fig 7i this modeling approach offers a better decision support system by suggesting coagulant dosage based on raw water quality and previous dosage along with predicted settled water turbidity operators can adjust the coagulant dosage considering the predicted settled water turbidity this will give an alert if the settled water turbidity is expected to exceed the standard so that follow up can be taken 3 5 feature importance analysis the results of the feature importance analysis table 3 show that eliminating each feature at a time did not significantly affect the model performance this is different from the feature importance result derived from the rf model which identified raw water turbidity 0 78 as the most important feature followed by flow rate 0 07 and alkalinity 0 05 of raw water it is probably because the information given by each feature could be inferred from other input features as its attention based mechanism considered the hidden inter relationship between features and the multivariate time series approach considered the past states of features the model structure could facilitate robust predictive performance 4 conclusion the study developed a novel prediction model with attention based mechanisms and a multivariate time series dataset to improve the coagulant dosage prediction and maintain effluent quality with potential cost savings a deep learning forecasting model was employed to address the limited performance of the conventional machine learning models and improve the coagulant dosage determination system according to changes in raw water quality the graph attention neural network was first implemented in the water treatment domain and long term multivariate time series characteristic was first considered in the coagulation process this is the first attempt to use big data for deep learning applications in water treatment processes this study shows the importance of using big data for properly training deep learning models because long term data contain the impact of various weather conditions over many years that cannot be realized with short term data the gamtf model successfully predicted coagulant dosage and outperformed other conventional machine learning models the attention based mechanism used in the gamtf model improved the prediction accuracy by considering hidden interrelationships between features compared to cross sectional models time series models enhanced predictive performance by considering past feature states the gamtf model also successfully predicted both coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity simultaneously the double output model offers an improved decision support system by presenting coagulant dosage predictions together with the resulting settled water turbidity this research could be extended to be combined with the scada system to determine the appropriate and economical dosage during the coagulation process of actual dwtps due to the lack of coagulant dosage data based on frequent jar tests this study may have limitations in predicting the optimal coagulant dosage for given conditions given the appropriate value of coagulant dosage and a sufficient amount of data this approach will contribute to predicting optimal coagulant dosage in other dwpts this method could also be used for other water related processes involving sequential data information declaration of
