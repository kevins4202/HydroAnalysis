13505,a combined advanced oxidation process based on the electrochemical oxidation of chloramphenicol chl on a boron doped diamond bdd electrode under uv irradiation was investigated the influence of the main process parameters current density ph temperature and chloride concentration on chl degradation and mineralization was assessed an estimation of the energy consumption required to mineralize chl was also made the results showed that chl can be completely degraded and extensively mineralized by 3 h uv assisted anodic oxidation on bdd the process can be further accelerated by chlorides as these species act as precursors for the photo induced formation of radical species contributing to chl oxidation under optimal conditions 300 ma m 2 0 01 m nacl ambient temperature and ph 10 complete chl removal occurred after 150 min of treatment and approximately 95 mineralization was achieved in 180 min overall the results obtained suggest that the investigated process may represent a promising approach to treat wastewaters containing chl or other recalcitrant antibiotics keywords chloramphenicol antibiotic removal boron doped diamond advanced oxidation processes uv 1 introduction recently the presence of pollutants such as personal care products and pharmaceuticals in municipal and industrial wastewaters has raised growing concern due to the negative effects that these substances can have on ecosystems and human health 1 this is especially the case of antibiotics which are known to promote the selection of multi resistant bacterial strains 2 furthermore these compounds or their metabolites can have toxic effects on several organisms and also act as endocrine disruptors 3 4 chloramphenicol chl is a broad spectrum antibiotic with a high degree of activity against a wide range of bacteria and some anaerobic microorganisms 5 in the 90 s the european union and several other countries banned the use of chl in food producing animals because of potential adverse effects on humans however it is still widely used for disinfection or prophylactic purposes in aquaculture especially shrimp farming 6 according to data from the major aquaculture producing countries the use of chl is second only to that of oxytetracycline 7 this fact and the risk of the spread of antibiotic resistance from aquaculture to humans 8 have prompted efforts to find effective methods for its removal from aqueous effluents however the high stability of chl makes conventional wastewater treatments largely ineffective in achieving the desired results 9 for example chien et al 10 showed that up to 64 days were needed to degrade chl in aquaculture pond sediment slurries by local microbial communities besides the rate of chl degradation increased significantly under anaerobic conditions finally it should be considered that during degradation toxic intermediates or final products containing the nitrobenzene group can easily be formed 11 12 for the above reasons powerful methods such as the advanced oxidation processes aops have been explored as a means for the removal of chl from water 13 aops are based on the effect of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oh or other radical species on organic pollutants 14 as a result of this attack the pollutants are degraded and finally mineralized the removal of chl from aqueous effluents by aops has been investigated in some recent studies using uv h2o2 15 16 uv cl2 17 uv persulfate 18 19 fenton photo fenton 20 21 photocatalysis 22 and electrochemical oxidation 23 electrochemistry based methods can be regarded as an inherently low impact technology they rely on the action of electrons which are environmentally friendly species and allow in situ production of a large range of compounds often without the need of addition of external reagents and thus with low generation of wastes furthermore they are versatile and easily scalable 24 recently re evaluated also for the possibility of powering with renewable energy 25 they are used in numerous applications ranging from electrosynthesis to treatment and recovery also combined with other consolidated methodologies 26 regarding the electrochemical processes 27 the use of boron doped diamond bdd electrodes has proved to be very promising because of the chemical inertness long term stability and excellent electrochemical properties of these anodic materials 28 32 a remarkable feature of bdd electrodes is that the hydroxyl radicals generated from water discharge are weakly bound to the anode surface making them highly reactive 33 furthermore additional oxidizing species such as hydrogen peroxide active chlorine and persulfate can be produced during the treatment contributing to the degradation of organic compounds 34 the nature of the supporting electrolyte also strongly affects both the rate and efficiency of the electrochemical treatment 35 in a study by our research group on the oxidation of coumarin on bdd electrodes it was found that the degradation and the mineralization of this compound were synergistically enhanced under uv irradiation 36 similar results were obtained in other uv assisted electrochemical treatments using the same electrodes for example a synergistic effect was observed for the degradation of phenol in the presence of chloride which was attributed to the simultaneous electro generation of hydroxyl and chlorine radicals 37 in another study on the removal of progesterone a clear synergistic effect was detected when conductive diamond electrochemical oxidation was coupled with uv irradiation 38 however in research performed on the photo assisted degradation of five common pollutants on bdd electrodes synergistic effects were highlighted only for some of them 39 suggesting that their occurrence also depends on the chemical nature of the pollutant this study was aimed at assessing whether a combined treatment based on uv irradiation and anodic oxidation on bdd electrodes could be beneficial for the degradation and mineralization of chl another goal of this research was to highlight possible synergistic effects on chl degradation to achieve the above objectives a lab scale apparatus containing a thin film bdd anode and a low power uv c light source was designed and used to evaluate the effects of current density ph temperature and chloride concentration on chl degradation and mineralization the results obtained indicated that chl can be completely degraded and extensively mineralized by proper selection of process conditions 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and preparation of antibiotic

absorption spectrum exhibits a maximum fig 1 using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2700 shimadzu co kyoto japan equipped with a 1 cm quartz cells a shimadzu analyzer toc l csh csn shimadzu co kyoto japan was used to evaluate the toc content the analysis of active chlorine was made through the reaction with n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd in a buffered solution method en iso 7393 2 chlorates and perchlorates were quantified using a dionex ics 1100 ion chromatography system for chlorates an ionpac as12a anionic column with a simple isocratic carbonate bicarbonate eluent was used while perchlorates were monitored by an eluent generator dionex rfc 30 and an ionpac as16 anionic column gradient from 35 to 38 mm in 8 min with a flow rate of 1 5 ml min 1 the detection limit of both ions was 100 μg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical degradation in the absence and presence of uv irradiation the degradation of chl was preliminarily investigated using uv photolysis and electrochemical oxidation on bdd electrodes either alone or in combination on a solution containing 100 mg l 1 chl and 0 05 m sulfate the results shown in fig 2 indicate that over the examined time range 180 min none of the tested treatments resulted in complete degradation or mineralization uv irradiation alone led to very poor chl degradation with a final chl removal of about 20 which agreed with other literature data 16 17 the final mineralization value was less than 5 suggesting that photostable compounds were produced from the photolysis of the molecule the low quantum yield value for direct photolysis at 254 nm equal to 0 025 supports the results found 42 unlike photolysis the dark anodic oxidation with the bdd electrode extended considerably the chl degradation leading to a final removal of approximately 75 this improvement can be attributed to the electro generation of weakly physisorbed oh radicals which are powerful and unselective oxidants however it took at least four hours to achieve a degradation of 95 data not reported here which can likely be ascribed to mass transfer limitations in the oxidation process significantly faster removal was observed with the combined uv bdd treatment the initial antibiotic concentration being reduced by 90 after three hours contrary to what was observed with other compounds subjected to the same treatment such as coumarin 36 the improvement was already evident in the first few minutes of electrolysis this may be due to a higher susceptibility of the chl molecule to uv attack and or to the uv mediated activation of electrogenerated oxidants chl degradation followed apparent first order kinetics the estimated rate constants k for the treatments were kuv 0 0014 min 1 r2 0 976 kbdd 0 0065 min 1 r2 0 992 and kuv bdd 0 0115 min 1 r2 0 979 the estimated kinetic constants k for the treatments were kuv 0 0014 min 1 r2 0 976 kbdd 0 0065 min 1 r2 0 992 and kuv bdd 0 0115 min 1 r2 0 979 the kinetic constant of the combined process was higher than the sum of those of single treatments was lower than the constant of the combined process indicating that the degradation of chl by electrochemical oxidation is synergistically enhanced by uv radiations similarly in the mineralization of the antibiotic fig 2b photolysis alone was ineffective in diminishing the toc content while anodic oxidation alone or combined with uv resulted in mineralization of about 70 and 80 respectively since mineralization proceeds almost simultaneously with degradation the formation of persistent organic by products from chl would seem to be excluded although this hypothesis should be tested by chromatographic analyses and mass balance calculations the evolution of uv vis spectra during the treatment fig 1 provides some support to this hypothesis as can be seen uv spectra of chl exhibited two peaks at 216 and 278 nm the former can be attributed to the π π transition of the nitro group and the second to the π π transition of nitrophenyl moiety 43 during degradation the intensity of both peaks decreased but no new peaks appeared mineralization data were well described an apparent zero order kinetic also in this case the kinetic constant for the combined treatment kuv bdd 0 1712 mg l 1 min 1 r2 0 981 was higher than the sum of those of single processes kuv 0 0101 mg l 1 min 1 r2 0 981 kbdd 0 144 mg l 1 min 1 r2 0 99 confirming the occurrence of synergistic effect in the photo assisted oxidation treatment first order kinetics indicates that the overall degradation process is controlled by the diffusion of the substrate to the electrode whereas zero order kinetics suggests that the electrochemical and or photochemical production of oxidant species are rate limiting 44 45 an apparent zero order behavior may arise from different situations such as saturation of the electrode surface by the substrate low current density or low light supply 46 these latter conditions could give rise to inadequate production of active species with a negative effect on the treatment performance in this case a controlled increase in current density and or uv power could lead to an improvement in the degradation efficiency however since these solutions imply an increase in energy consumption 47 an effective process optimization should be performed by minimizing total investment and operating costs for the system of interest an alternative and perhaps more cost effective strategy could be based on the addition of chemicals such as chloride acting as precursors of radicals chloride is commonly found in natural waters as well as in municipal and industrial effluents so that its addition might not be necessary 3 2 effect of chloride it is generally accepted 48 that bdd electrodes behave as a continuous source of hydroxyl radicals weakly physo sorbed on the electrode eq 6 and to a lower extent of other less powerful oxidants 49 like hydrogen peroxide eq 7 ozone eq 8a and 8b or depending on the electrolyte composition peroxo like compounds eq 9 and 9b 34 additional radical species can be formed from primary oxidizing species eq 10 6 h 2 o b d d o h h e 7 2 o h h 2 o 2 8a o h o h e 8b o 2

solution bulk and at the electrode surface the enhanced degradation of pollutants in combined photo electrochemical processes can be explained by the ability of uv light at the investigated wavelength 254 nm to decompose the peroxides electrogenerated on the bdd surface into highly oxidizing radical species eqs 11 13 in the bulk of the solution thus reducing mass transfer limitations 37 38 11 h 2 o 2 h ν 2 o h 12 o 3 h 2 o h ν 2 o h o 2 13 s 2 o 8 2 h ν 2 s o 4 in solutions containing chloride ions their oxidation leads to chlorine evolution eq 14 from subsequent hydrolysis depending on the ph conditions hypochlorous acid and or hypochlorite ions can be produced eq 15 activation of these reaction products by uv light can lead to the formation of other radical species that attack chl eq 16 37 50 greatly increasing the extent of degradation 14 2 c l c l 2 2 e 15 c l 2 h 2 o h c l o h c l 16 h c l o h ν c l o h to assess the effect of chloride a set of experiments was made in which nacl concentration was progressively increased up to 0 02 m as is evident from fig 3 a the presence of 0 01 m nacl produced a significant enhancement of the degradation of chl which was completely removed after 150 min this is likely a consequence of the combined production of active chlorine eqs 14 16 and hydroxyl radicals further additions of chloride however reduced the degradation even below the value obtained with the supporting electrolyte alone this can be explained by the interaction of the chloride derived species with the electrogenerated hydroxyl radicals leading to their neutralization in addition to the oh scavenging effect persistent chloro organic compounds might also be formed causing an increase in the residual organic content fig 3b shows that chl mineralization improved over the entire chloride concentration range suggesting a key role for active chlorine related species in the complete oxidation of chl the test with 0 01 m chloride outperformed all the others by halving the treatment time compared to that without chloride however after 3 h the residual organic carbon content was about 10 to exclude the possibility that such an improvement was due only to the electrochemical production of active chlorine and not to the radical species produced by photolysis an additional test was performed in the dark with 0 1 m chloride under these conditions both degradation and mineralization were significantly slowed down this is very likely a consequence of the absence of two important uv related effects a the production of additional radical species and b the partial inhibition of the conversion of chloride into species like chlorates and perchlorates competing with the target pollutant 31 34 36 39 for the above reasons all subsequent tests were carried out with 0 01 m chloride 3 3 effect of current density current density is expected to have a beneficial effect on degradation as it promotes the electro generation of oxidants in the present study this parameter was varied between 100 and 500 am 2 data in fig 4 confirm that an increase in current density accelerated both degradation and mineralization at 500 am 2 chl was completely removed after 90 min and at the end of the 3 h treatment more than 95 of the antibiotic was also mineralized from an industrial viewpoint high current densities imply high energy consumption suggesting that a compromise should be made between process time and cost in the specific case 80 chl degradation required the passage of only 270 c at 100 am 2 while at 300 and 500 am 2 the electric charge increased by about three times fig 5 this can be explained by the occurrence at high current densities of nonproductive side reactions such as the oxidation of water eq 17 and hydroxyl radicals eq 18 to oxygen 17 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e 18 2 o h o 2 2 h 2 e the curves describing the chl removal efficiencies at 300 and 500 am 2 were almost overlapped probably because the concentration of antibiotic was a limiting factor for the degradation process based on the chl removal yields it can be stated that 500 am 2 was the most advantageous current density as it involved the same amount of electric charge of the process at 300 am 2 but with a reduction of about 40 of the total degradation time regarding mineralization at this current density the amount of electric charge increased by approximately 35 and hence also the energy consumption was higher table 1 mce at 100 am 2 was higher than those at 300 and 500 am 2 by about 15 and 18 respectively fig 4c reflecting the lower consumption of oh due to competitive side reactions the decreasing trend of mce with time at higher current density can be due to changes in mass transfer resulting from the reduction of the organics content during oxidation a further contribution can originate from the formation of by products presumably short linear carboxylic acids less susceptible to the oh driven oxidation 41 a further contribution could originate from the formation of by products presumably short chain carboxylic acids less susceptible to the oh driven oxidation 41 using a reasonably low value for current density is also motivated by the need to control the amounts of chlorates and perchlorates that are electro generated in chloride containing media 51 according to some studies the formation of these by products is mitigated in photo assisted oxidation processes on bdd electrodes 39 other studies report only a decrease in hypochlorite and a substantially unchanged chlorate content 36 chlorates and perchlorates are harmful products and must be properly removed although this requires harsher process conditions 52 for all the above reasons a current density of 300 am 2 was chosen as the best compromise in terms of treatment time energy consumption and production of undesired intermediates 3 4 effect of ph results in fig 6 a shows that chl removal was only slightly influenced by ph a small negative effect was observed at ph 3 but at the end of the treatment the removal was essentially equal to that at higher ph on the contrary mineralization was greatly influenced with alkaline conditions promoting a significant acceleration in mineralization fig 6b the substantial delay accumulated at the circumneutral and acidic ph was attenuated but not eliminated at the end of the treatment at ph 10 only one hour was required to achieve a toc removal of 60 while at neutral and acid ph the treatment needed to be prolonged to 1 5 and 2 h respectively the effect of ph on chl mineralization can be related to the chemical properties of this compound the pka value of chl is 11 53 which means that at ph 11 the molecule is dissociated by 50 in its anionic form this form is easily attacked and mineralized by the electrophilic radical species present in the bulk solution such as active chlorine and hydroxyl radicals furthermore under alkaline conditions the molar extinction coefficient of chl increases enhancing its reactivity under uv irradiation 54 however the molar extinction coefficients of acidic neutral and alkaline chl solutions calculated at 278 and 254 nm are rather similar about 9 8 1 1 l m 1 cm 1 and 5 2 0 6 l m 1 cm 1 respectively and cannot completely justify the observed behavior the oxidizing mixture known as active chlorine is composed of different species namely chlorine e0 1 358 v hypochlorous acid e0 1 611 v and or hypochlorite e0 0 81 v 55 whose prevalence is mainly determined by the ph conditions among them due to its high standard potential hclo represents the most powerful oxidant therefore the most oxidizing conditions should be expected in the ph range 4 5 7 5 where due to the pka value 7 5 at 25 c and the pk of equation 15 4 6 at 25 c this species prevails for the same reason the worst conditions should be those associated with the prevalence of the hypochlorite i e above ph 9 however the experimental results contradict these hypotheses making it necessary to consider new arguments it is likely that at lower ph the reactions transforming hocl into cl rather than to oh prevail reducing the treatment effectiveness 56 this effect can be partially counterbalanced by the fact that the standard potential of the hydroxyl radical at acidic ph 2 7 v vs she is higher than at alkaline conditions 1 9 v 57 however the oh driven oxidation of chl under acidic conditions implies enhanced production of recalcitrant by products 17 especially halonitromethanes and trichloronitromethane thus resulting in poorer initial performances in any case the improvement obtained at higher ph values does not justify the need for a ph adjustment unless the solution is highly acidic 3 5 effect of temperature the influence of temperature on a combined uv bdd treatment is very difficult to predict in fact although an increase in temperature increases the diffusion rate of reagents favoring the oxidative reactions high temperatures can decrease the solubility of chlorine in the solution with a negative effect on degradation the results in fig 7 show that in the investigated temperature range 25 55 c this parameter had a positive effect on both degradation fig 7a and mineralization fig 7b at 55 c chl was completed removed in about 2 h and at the end of the treatment 3 h the mineralization extent was greater than 95 this suggests a likely reduction of mass transfer resistance for the diffusing species which is a major limitation of the bdd electrode induced by heating it is interesting to note that when the photo assisted treatment was carried out in a non thermostated reactor the temperature of the solution increased from ambient temperature to about 35 c in 3 h it can therefore be hypothesized that even on a larger scale the natural heating of the processed solution induced by energy dissipation could allow the treatment to be performed without any additional input of thermal energy 3 6 inorganic by products the main disadvantage of treating solutions containing chlorides present in the matrix or deriving from the molecule degradation 58 on bdd anodes is represented by the risk of electrogenerating hazardous chloro compounds previous studies revealed that the production of these species is significantly attenuated by combination with uv c light hurwitz et al 37 for instance observed a 30 and 90 reduction in trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas production respectively as well as a dramatic decrease in the solution toxicity compared to anodic oxidation on bdd alone it was hypothesized that the photoelectrochemical reaction might occur through a different mechanism that does not involve if not marginally the formation of these products or that in the combined method the depletion rate of these products exceeded the formation rate avoiding their accumulation the discussion is more complex for inorganic species as few data are available 59 often not totally in agreement with each other these species are formed at higher concentrations than organic chlorinated species rising serious concern furthermore quite energetic conditions are required for their final reconversion to chloride 52 finally the expected attenuation deriving from the combination of the anodic oxidation with the uv irradiation is still debated especially with regard to chlorates in fact in some cases the photoelectrochemical treatment resulted in a reduction of their concentration 39 while in others it did not affect their content 36 to clarify this point the evolution of chlorinated inorganic compounds i e active chlorine chlorates and perchlorates in the test conducted with uv light at 300 am 2 ph 10 35 c and 0 01 m nacl was monitored fig 8 shows that under the conditions adopted active chlorine accumulates to a limited extent and its concentration tends to decrease significantly after about 90 min due to the subsequent conversion to products with a higher oxidation state the perchlorate content reached a maximum of 5 ppm after three hours of electrolysis but they were not detectable 100 ppb detection limit for up to 2 h the most critical point is represented by chlorates whose concentration increased rapidly up to 250 mg l 1 after the three hours of reaction 4 conclusions antibiotic pollution is causing increasing concern worldwide due to the spreading of antibiotic resistance and the potential impact that these compounds may have on the environment in this study we have shown that a photo assisted electrochemical process can be effectively used for the degradation of chl an antibiotic that is still widely used in aquaculture and shrimp farming despite its harmful effects on humans electrochemical oxidation on bdd electrodes coupled with uv irradiation promoted synergistically chl degradation and mineralization small additions of chloride further improved the treatment efficiency allowing nearly complete antibiotic mineralization after 3 h at ambient temperature ph 10 and applied current density of 300 ma m 2 this can be explained by the formation of chlorine based radical species reinforcing the fast but nonselective oxidation ability of hydroxyl radicals it was also found that natural heating of the aqueous solution caused by energy dissipation improved the treatment performance due to the positive effect of temperature on chl removal taken together these results suggest that a combined process based on uv irradiation and electrochemical oxidation on bdd electrodes may represent an effective strategy for the removal of chl or other recalcitrant antibiotics from aqueous effluents these electrodes have the advantage of exhibiting great mechanical and electrochemical stability even when exposed to highly energetic uv radiation furthermore the possibility of tailoring the anodes in different geometric shapes and configurations allows the scaling up of the process as well as an effective optimization of the fluid dynamic conditions in the reactor however to avoid potential health risks the possible formation of unwanted by products especially chlorates should be carefully monitored declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

and perchlorates were quantified using a dionex ics 1100 ion chromatography system for chlorates an ionpac as12a anionic column with a simple isocratic carbonate bicarbonate eluent was used while perchlorates were monitored by an eluent generator dionex rfc 30 and an ionpac as16 anionic column gradient from 35 to 38 mm in 8 min with a flow rate of 1 5 ml min 1 the detection limit of both ions was 100 μg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical degradation in the absence and presence of uv irradiation the degradation of chl was preliminarily investigated using uv photolysis and electrochemical oxidation on bdd electrodes either alone or in combination on a solution containing 100 mg l 1 chl and 0 05 m sulfate the results shown in fig 2 indicate that over the examined time range 180 min none of the tested treatments resulted in complete degradation or mineralization uv irradiation alone led to very poor chl degradation with a final chl removal of about 20 which agreed with other literature data 16 17 the final mineralization value was less than 5 suggesting that photostable compounds were produced from the photolysis of the molecule the low quantum yield value for direct photolysis at 254 nm equal to 0 025 supports the results found 42 unlike photolysis the dark anodic oxidation with the bdd electrode extended considerably the chl degradation leading to a final removal of approximately 75 this improvement can be attributed to the electro generation of weakly physisorbed oh radicals which are powerful and unselective oxidants however it took at least four hours to achieve a degradation of 95 data not reported here which can likely be ascribed to mass transfer limitations in the oxidation process significantly faster removal was observed with the combined uv bdd treatment the initial antibiotic concentration being reduced by 90 after three hours contrary to what was observed with other compounds subjected to the same treatment such as coumarin 36 the improvement was already evident in the first few minutes of electrolysis this may be due to a higher susceptibility of the chl molecule to uv attack and or to the uv mediated activation of electrogenerated oxidants chl degradation followed apparent first order kinetics the estimated rate constants k for the treatments were kuv 0 0014 min 1 r2 0 976 kbdd 0 0065 min 1 r2 0 992 and kuv bdd 0 0115 min 1 r2 0 979 the estimated kinetic constants k for the treatments were kuv 0 0014 min 1 r2 0 976 kbdd 0 0065 min 1 r2 0 992 and kuv bdd 0 0115 min 1 r2 0 979 the kinetic constant of the combined process was higher than the sum of those of single treatments was lower than the constant of the combined process indicating that the degradation of chl by electrochemical oxidation is synergistically enhanced by uv radiations similarly in the mineralization of the antibiotic fig 2b photolysis alone was ineffective in diminishing the toc content while anodic oxidation alone or combined with uv resulted in mineralization of about 70 and 80 respectively since mineralization proceeds almost simultaneously with degradation the formation of persistent organic by products from chl would seem to be excluded although this hypothesis should be tested by chromatographic analyses and mass balance calculations the evolution of uv vis spectra during the treatment fig 1 provides some support to this hypothesis as can be seen uv spectra of chl exhibited two peaks at 216 and 278 nm the former can be attributed to the π π transition of the nitro group and the second to the π π transition of nitrophenyl moiety 43 during degradation the intensity of both peaks decreased but no new peaks appeared mineralization data were well described an apparent zero order kinetic also in this case the kinetic constant for the combined treatment kuv bdd 0 1712 mg l 1 min 1 r2 0 981 was higher than the sum of those of single processes kuv 0 0101 mg l 1 min 1 r2 0 981 kbdd 0 144 mg l 1 min 1 r2 0 99 confirming the occurrence of synergistic effect in the photo assisted oxidation treatment first order kinetics indicates that the overall degradation process is controlled by the diffusion of the substrate to the electrode whereas zero order kinetics suggests that the electrochemical and or photochemical production of oxidant species are rate limiting 44 45 an apparent zero order behavior may arise from different situations such as saturation of the electrode surface by the substrate low current density or low light supply 46 these latter conditions could give rise to inadequate production of active species with a negative effect on the treatment performance in this case a controlled increase in current density and or uv power could lead to an improvement in the degradation efficiency however since these solutions imply an increase in energy consumption 47 an effective process optimization should be performed by minimizing total investment and operating costs for the system of interest an alternative and perhaps more cost effective strategy could be based on the addition of chemicals such as chloride acting as precursors of radicals chloride is commonly found in natural waters as well as in municipal and industrial effluents so that its addition might not be necessary 3 2 effect of chloride it is generally accepted 48 that bdd electrodes behave as a continuous source of hydroxyl radicals weakly physo sorbed on the electrode eq 6 and to a lower extent of other less powerful oxidants 49 like hydrogen peroxide eq 7 ozone eq 8a and 8b or depending on the electrolyte composition peroxo like compounds eq 9 and 9b 34 additional radical species can be formed from primary oxidizing species eq 10 6 h 2 o b d d o h h e 7 2 o h h 2 o 2 8a o h o h e 8b o 2

solution bulk and at the electrode surface the enhanced degradation of pollutants in combined photo electrochemical processes can be explained by the ability of uv light at the investigated wavelength 254 nm to decompose the peroxides electrogenerated on the bdd surface into highly oxidizing radical species eqs 11 13 in the bulk of the solution thus reducing mass transfer limitations 37 38 11 h 2 o

conditions hypochlorous acid and or hypochlorite ions can be produced eq 15 activation of these reaction products by uv light can lead to the formation of other radical species that attack chl eq 16 37 50 greatly increasing the extent of degradation 14 2 c l c l 2 2 e 15 c l 2 h 2 o h c l o h c l 16 h c l o h ν c l o h to assess the effect of chloride a set of experiments was made in which nacl concentration was progressively increased up to 0 02 m as is evident from fig 3 a the presence of 0 01 m nacl produced a significant enhancement of the degradation of chl which was completely removed after 150 min this is likely a consequence of the combined production of active chlorine eqs 14 16 and hydroxyl radicals further additions of chloride however reduced the degradation even below the value obtained with the supporting electrolyte alone this can be explained by the interaction of the chloride derived species with the electrogenerated hydroxyl radicals leading to their neutralization in addition to the oh scavenging effect persistent chloro organic compounds might also be formed causing an increase in the residual organic content fig 3b shows that chl mineralization improved over the entire chloride concentration range suggesting a key role for active chlorine related species in the complete oxidation of chl the test with 0 01 m chloride outperformed all the others by halving the treatment time compared to that without chloride however after 3 h the residual organic carbon content was about 10 to exclude the possibility that such an improvement was due only to the electrochemical production of active chlorine and not to the radical species produced by photolysis an additional test was performed in the dark with 0 1 m chloride under these conditions both degradation and mineralization were significantly slowed down this is very likely a consequence of the absence of two important uv related effects a the production of additional radical species and b the partial inhibition of the conversion of chloride into species like chlorates and perchlorates competing with the target pollutant 31 34 36 39 for the above reasons all subsequent tests were carried out with 0 01 m chloride 3 3 effect of current density current density is expected to have a beneficial effect on degradation as it promotes the electro generation of oxidants in the present study this parameter was varied between 100 and 500 am 2 data in fig 4 confirm that an increase in current density accelerated both degradation and mineralization at 500 am 2 chl was completely removed after 90 min and at the end of the 3 h treatment more than 95 of the antibiotic was also mineralized from an industrial viewpoint high current densities imply high energy consumption suggesting that a compromise should be made between process time and cost in the specific case 80 chl degradation required the passage of only 270 c at 100 am 2 while at 300 and 500 am 2 the electric charge increased by about three times fig 5 this can be explained by the occurrence at high current densities of nonproductive side reactions such as the oxidation of water eq 17 and hydroxyl radicals eq 18 to oxygen 17 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e 18 2 o h o 2 2 h 2 e the curves describing the chl removal efficiencies at 300 and 500 am 2 were almost overlapped probably because the concentration of antibiotic was a limiting factor for the degradation process based on the chl removal yields it can be stated that 500 am 2 was the most advantageous current density as it involved the same amount of electric charge of the process at 300 am 2 but with a reduction of about 40 of the total degradation time regarding mineralization at this current density the amount of electric charge increased by approximately 35 and hence also the energy consumption was higher table 1 mce at 100 am 2 was higher than those at 300 and 500 am 2 by about 15 and 18 respectively fig 4c reflecting the lower consumption of oh due to competitive side reactions the decreasing trend of mce with time at higher current density can be due to changes in mass transfer resulting from the reduction of the organics content during oxidation a further contribution can originate from the formation of by products presumably short linear carboxylic acids less susceptible to the oh driven oxidation 41 a further contribution could originate from the formation of by products presumably short chain carboxylic acids less susceptible to the oh driven oxidation 41 using a reasonably low value for current density is also motivated by the need to control the amounts of chlorates and perchlorates that are electro generated in chloride containing media 51 according to some studies the formation of these by products is mitigated in photo assisted oxidation processes on bdd electrodes 39 other studies report only a decrease in hypochlorite and a substantially unchanged chlorate content 36 chlorates and perchlorates are harmful products and must be properly removed although this requires harsher process conditions 52 for all the above reasons a current density of 300 am 2 was chosen as the best compromise in terms of treatment time energy consumption and production of undesired intermediates 3 4 effect of ph results in fig 6 a shows that chl removal was only slightly influenced by ph a small negative effect was observed at ph 3 but at the end of the treatment the removal was essentially equal to that at higher ph on the contrary mineralization was greatly influenced with alkaline conditions promoting a significant acceleration in mineralization fig 6b the substantial delay accumulated at the circumneutral and acidic ph was attenuated but not eliminated at the end of the treatment at ph 10 only one hour was required to achieve a toc removal of 60 while at neutral and acid ph the treatment needed to be prolonged to 1 5 and 2 h respectively the effect of ph on chl mineralization can be related to the chemical properties of this compound the pka value of chl is 11 53 which means that at ph 11 the molecule is dissociated by 50 in its anionic form this form is easily attacked and mineralized by the electrophilic radical species present in the bulk solution such as active chlorine and hydroxyl radicals furthermore under alkaline conditions the molar extinction coefficient of chl increases enhancing its reactivity under uv irradiation 54 however the molar extinction coefficients of acidic neutral and alkaline chl solutions calculated at 278 and 254 nm are rather similar about 9 8 1 1 l m 1 cm 1 and 5 2 0 6 l m 1 cm 1 respectively and cannot completely justify the observed behavior the oxidizing mixture known as active chlorine is composed of different species namely chlorine e0 1 358 v hypochlorous acid e0 1 611 v and or hypochlorite e0 0 81 v 55 whose prevalence is mainly determined by the ph conditions among them due to its high standard potential hclo represents the most powerful oxidant therefore the most oxidizing conditions should be expected in the ph range 4 5 7 5 where due to the pka value 7 5 at 25 c and the pk of equation 15 4 6 at 25 c this species prevails for the same reason the worst conditions should be those associated with the prevalence of the hypochlorite i e above ph 9 however the experimental results contradict these hypotheses making it necessary to consider new arguments it is likely that at lower ph the reactions transforming hocl into cl rather than to oh prevail reducing the treatment effectiveness 56 this effect can be partially counterbalanced by the fact that the standard potential of the hydroxyl radical at acidic ph 2 7 v vs she is higher than at alkaline conditions 1 9 v 57 however the oh driven oxidation of chl under acidic conditions implies enhanced production of recalcitrant by products 17 especially halonitromethanes and trichloronitromethane thus resulting in poorer initial performances in any case the improvement obtained at higher ph values does not justify the need for a ph adjustment unless the solution is highly acidic 3 5 effect of temperature the influence of temperature on a combined uv bdd treatment is very difficult to predict in fact although an increase in temperature increases the diffusion rate of reagents favoring the oxidative reactions high temperatures can decrease the solubility of chlorine in the solution with a negative effect on degradation the results in fig 7 show that in the investigated temperature range 25 55 c this parameter had a positive effect on both degradation fig 7a and mineralization fig 7b at 55 c chl was completed removed in about 2 h and at the end of the treatment 3 h the mineralization extent was greater than 95 this suggests a likely reduction of mass transfer resistance for the diffusing species which is a major limitation of the bdd electrode induced by heating it is interesting to note that when the photo assisted treatment was carried out in a non thermostated reactor the temperature of the solution increased from ambient temperature to about 35 c in 3 h it can therefore be hypothesized that even on a larger scale the natural heating of the processed solution induced by energy dissipation could allow the treatment to be performed without any additional input of thermal energy 3 6 inorganic by products the main disadvantage of treating solutions containing chlorides present in the matrix or deriving from the molecule degradation 58 on bdd anodes is represented by the risk of electrogenerating hazardous chloro compounds previous studies revealed that the production of these species is significantly attenuated by combination with uv c light hurwitz et al 37 for instance observed a 30 and 90 reduction in trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas production respectively as well as a dramatic decrease in the solution toxicity compared to anodic oxidation on bdd alone it was hypothesized that the photoelectrochemical reaction might occur through a different mechanism that does not involve if not marginally the formation of these products or that in the combined method the depletion rate of these products exceeded the formation rate avoiding their accumulation the discussion is more complex for inorganic species as few data are available 59 often not totally in agreement with each other these species are formed at higher concentrations than organic chlorinated species rising serious concern furthermore quite energetic conditions are required for their final reconversion to chloride 52 finally the expected attenuation deriving from the combination of the anodic oxidation with the uv irradiation is still debated especially with regard to chlorates in fact in some cases the photoelectrochemical treatment resulted in a reduction of their concentration 39 while in others it did not affect their content 36 to clarify this point the evolution of chlorinated inorganic compounds i e active chlorine chlorates and perchlorates in the test conducted with uv light at 300 am 2 ph 10 35 c and 0 01 m nacl was monitored fig 8 shows that under the conditions adopted active chlorine accumulates to a limited extent and its concentration tends to decrease significantly after about 90 min due to the subsequent conversion to products with a higher oxidation state the perchlorate content reached a maximum of 5 ppm after three hours of electrolysis but they were not detectable 100 ppb detection limit for up to 2 h the most critical point is represented by chlorates whose concentration increased rapidly up to 250 mg l 1 after the three hours of reaction 4 conclusions antibiotic pollution is causing increasing concern worldwide due to the spreading of antibiotic resistance and the potential impact that these compounds may have on the environment in this study we have shown that a photo assisted electrochemical process can be effectively used for the degradation of chl an antibiotic that is still widely used in aquaculture and shrimp farming despite its harmful effects on humans electrochemical oxidation on bdd electrodes coupled with uv irradiation promoted synergistically chl degradation and mineralization small additions of chloride further improved the treatment efficiency allowing nearly complete antibiotic mineralization after 3 h at ambient temperature ph 10 and applied current density of 300 ma m 2 this can be explained by the formation of chlorine based radical species reinforcing the fast but nonselective oxidation ability of hydroxyl radicals it was also found that natural heating of the aqueous solution caused by energy dissipation improved the treatment performance due to the positive effect of temperature on chl removal taken together these results suggest that a combined process based on uv irradiation and electrochemical oxidation on bdd electrodes may represent an effective strategy for the removal of chl or other recalcitrant antibiotics from aqueous effluents these electrodes have the advantage of exhibiting great mechanical and electrochemical stability even when exposed to highly energetic uv radiation furthermore the possibility of tailoring the anodes in different geometric shapes and configurations allows the scaling up of the process as well as an effective optimization of the fluid dynamic conditions in the reactor however to avoid potential health risks the possible formation of unwanted by products especially chlorates should be carefully monitored declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13506,chemical crystallization circulating pellet fluidized bed reactor cpfbr systems are widely used in water softening applications and softening parameters and effects may be governed by certain rules for the optimum treatment of water at different levels of hardness in this study pilot tests were conducted on a cpfbr system with water at eight different levels of hardness specifically the effects of the differences in hardness alkalinity and calcium and magnesium concentrations on the softening rules and regulation of the cpfbr were analyzed the results showed that when na2co3 and naoh were added simultaneously the removal rate of ca2 was positively correlated with the dosage of na2co3 while ph was positively correlated with the dosage of naoh under the experimental water quality conditions when ca2 180 mg l mg2 70 mg l and ph 11 no fine calcium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide pellets were discharged with the water and the turbidity of the effluent did not increase for water with a higher concentration of mg2 than that of ca2 the morphology of calcium carbonate crystals element contents on crystal pellet surfaces and fine pellets flowing out with water were all affected by mg2 based on the analyses and summary of the crystallization softening rules for water at various hardness levels key supportive data and regulation methods are provided for the engineering design and application of such cpfbr systems keywords chemical crystallization circulating pellet fluidized bed multi source water quality softening hardness turbidity 1 introduction chemical crystallization circulating pellet fluidized bed reactor cpfbr technology has been used for water softening applications in the netherlands since the 1980s 1 2 and has since been applied to remove phosphorus 3 4 fluorine 5 7 and heavy metals 8 9 from water many scholars have analyzed the chemical crystallization pellets in detail mainly with regard to the crystallization kinetics 10 12 simulation analyses 13 14 influencing factors on softening 15 however most of the published studies were carried out at laboratory tests or using pilot tests and simulations for a limited set of water quality conditions or a single water quality condition thus far to the best of our knowledge only few reports have performed a comparative research on crystallization softening under various water hardness conditions in conjunction with in depth analyses of its rules and the influence of calcium and magnesium contents of water and various performance parameters through the analysis and induction of the crystallization softening process under various water quality conditions it can be found that particular principles or research results summarized under a single condition are not applicable to all water quality conditions especially in regard to the softening crystallization process dosage and simulation calculations for example schetters et al reported on the recovery and utilization of calcium carbonate pellets in amsterdam s crystallization pellet fluidized bed on a productive scale but they did not calculate and analyze the crystallization amount under different water quality conditions 16 a pilot scale study by hu et al showed that the pellet growth rate and bed growth rate in amsterdam s crystallization pellet fluidized bed were related to the ascending velocity particle size and supersaturation and they provided the corresponding calculation model but only for a single water quality condition so the calculation model may not be applicable under different water quality conditions 17 hofman et al summarized the pellet softening technology used in holland for the last 20 years with regard to three aspects namely the treatment effects environmental benefits and costs 18 with the increasing application of this technology in recent years some scholars summarized and compared the softening parameters under various water quality conditions for example tang et al characterized pellets from a pilot scale pellet reactor treating 16 water types at 8 danish drinking water treatment plants to investigate the variations in pellet characteristics and how they depend on the influent water composition 19 analyses of pilot test processes within a cpfbr softening system under diverse water quality conditions achieved with multiple sources of water would be useful for understanding chemical crystallization regulation from a broader perspective and the correlation between crystallization softening parameters or processes and calcium and magnesium contents need to be studied this will enable improved predictions and control of the softening process of chemical crystallization circulating granulation fluidized bed softening technology for water with different hardness in particular it is very important to study the applicability of such systems to different water quality conditions process design parameters and operations so as to achieve optimal effects in this study eight water sources with different types of water quality were tested at the pilot scale within a cpfbr softening system common problems were studied in detail such as the relationship of chemical agent types and dosages with different calcium and magnesium contents the relationship of effluent turbidity with calcium ions magnesium ions and ph in water and the influence of magnesium on the crystallization softening process in high magnesium and low calcium water quality conditions n mg2 n ca2 3 these results will provide a useful supporting framework for subsequent research system regulation engineering designs and applications of cpfbr softening systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 test water quality during the period from 2018 to 2019 cpfbr pilot tests were carried out on water samples with different levels of hardness and other water quality parameters that were obtained from eight different water sources the source water quality data are shown in table 1 as shown by the source water quality tests results diverse types of water were tested including hard water temporary and permanent types high magnesium water with the highest concentration of mg2 being 108 mg l high calcium water with the highest concentration of ca2 being 382 mg l high turbidity water with the highest turbidity being 43 5 ntu and low turbidity water with the turbidity being below 1 ntu these different water quality conditions were used to verify the adaptability of cpfbr to different water quality crystallization effects 2 2 instrument analysis and methods the following instruments and methods were used for evaluating different characteristics ph was evaluated using the hach portable ph meter hq40d hardness as well as ca2 and mg2 concentrations were calculated using ethylenediaminetetraacetic titration alkalinity was assessed via acid base titration hach portable turbidimeter 2100q was employed to determine turbidity surface morphology of crystalline pellets was obtained via scanning electron microscopy sem quanta feg 250 instrument compounds on the surface of crystalline pellets were identified using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy thermofisher k alpha 2 3 test equipment and process description the pilot test system is shown in fig 1 the core piece of equipment in the cpfbr pilot test system was the chemical reactor which represents an improvement over the amsterdam reactor cpfbr helps the circulation growth of pellets based on the amsterdam reactor the pellet size tends to be uniform in the crystal growth process from the bottom to the top of the reactor the cpfbr can effectively prevent the problem of uneven pellet size extend the discharge time improve the crystallization efficiency reduce the reactor height increase the pellet discharge size and ensure the high removal efficiencies of total hardness and ca2 20 21 the cpfbr pilot system was mainly composed of the chemical reactor chemical dosing systems a seed crystal dosing system and a pellet collection system the pilot test reactor was made of carbon steel with a height of 6 m and a diameter of 600 mm the maximum treatment capacity of the single reactor was 30 m3 h the water to be treated was pumped into the cpfbr by a pipeline pump where it was allowed to react with the softening agent naoh na2co3 in the fluidized bed seed crystals were mixed with water and then injected into the cpfbr through a pellet pump mature pellets dimeter 2 3 mm were discharged into a pellet storage box and acid was used to adjust the ph of the effluent from the fluidized bed specifically the effluent was mixed thoroughly by a static mixer and the ph was adjusted to 7 8 for discharge garnets with a size ranging from 0 2 0 4 mm and a density of 3 93 g cm3 were used as seeds in the pellet reactor the mass concentrations of naoh and na2co3 were 30 and 10 respectively sulphuric acid h2so4 was used to adjust ph and its mass concentration was 98 3 results and discussion 3 1 relationship between the calcium content and dosage in water with different levels of hardness and its regulation hard water is generally categorized as water dominated by temporary hardness and that dominated by permanent hardness 22 23 naoh or ca oh 2 should be added to water dominated by temporary hardness for the crystallization reaction while na2co3 should be added to water dominated by permanent hardness the dosage of chemicals in water needs to be calculated according to the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 in water naoh reacts with hco3 and ca2 at a ratio of 1 1 theoretically the dosage of naoh can be calculated according to the concentrations of hco3 and ca2 in water however the actual crystallization process of calcium carbonate requires a certain driving force and the reaction process may not reach completion therefore the actual dosage is generally more than the theoretically calculated dosage 20 as shown in fig 2 the relationship of the ph and molar concentration of naoh in water with a certain ca2 molar concentration was determined via testing of water sources 2 3 4 and 6 the results show that with an increase in ph the naoh concentration exceeded its theoretical dosage after many tests it was concluded that when ph 11 the optimal dosage of naoh was 1 1 5 times the required ca2 removal concentration and when ph 11 the optimal dosage of naoh was 1 5 2 0 times of the required ca2 removal concentration this can be observed for water sources 2 3 and 4 in the figure however when chemical substances such as scale inhibitor hinder the crystallization process the proportion will increase according to water source 6 in the figure the dosage of naoh should be set to 2 5 3 0 times the concentration of ca2 to be removed in order to crystallize calcium carbonate therefore when the cpfbr softens the water quality it is necessary to adjust and control the dosage and type according to the water quality characteristics and the content of calcium and magnesium in the water so as to achieve a better treatment effect when the permanent hardness in water is high i e hco3 is insufficient na2co3 needs to be added during the crystallization process naoh and na2co3 were added simultaneously during the operation of the crystallization fluidized bed and the reactions observed in water and during the formation of calcium carbonate also occur theoretically at the same time however a large number of experiments were carried out on water source 5 and the results showed that the removal rate of ca2 in water was positively correlated with the amount of na2co3 added in water while the ph of water was positively correlated with the amount of naoh added in water as shown in figs 3 and 4 therefore if the molar concentration of hco3 in water is less than that of ca2 and adding naoh alone cannot meet the hardness removal requirements it is necessary to build a na2co3 dosing system and to reasonably allocate the na2co3 and naoh dosing ratio according to the hardness removal requirements and treatment cost 3 2 principle governing the effluent turbidity by calcium and magnesium content in water with different levels of hardness and regulation crystallization of calcium carbonate in water involves heterogeneous nucleation but if there are relatively high levels of calcium and magnesium ions in water and the heterogeneous nucleation rate is limited homogeneous nucleation of calcium carbonate will occur 12 24 at this time due to homogeneous nucleation calcium carbonate crystals magnesium hydroxide or magnesium carbonate crystals tend to flow out with the water in the effluent of the crystallization fluidized bed thus resulting in an increase in the turbidity of the effluent the increase in effluent turbidity is generally caused by calcium and magnesium ions which is mainly due to the fact that calcium carbonate crystals magnesium hydroxide or magnesium carbonate cannot crystallize on the seed surface and therefore flow out with the water when the level of calcium ions in water is relatively low calcium carbonate crystallizes sufficiently and the turbidity of the effluent remains unchanged as shown in fig 5 a it can be seen from fig 5 a that the turbidity of water source 2 3 and 4 hardly changes with the increase in ph because at this point the calcium carbonate crystal formed is completely crystallized on the surface of the crystal seed however when the concentration of calcium and magnesium ions in water is high the effluent turbidity will increase with an increase in ph as shown in fig 5 b as can be seen from fig 5 b when the ph exceeds 11 the turbidity increases significantly up to 100 ntu this is because the presence of mg2 is also a main factor that causes an increase in turbidity there are generally two cases of turbidity caused by mg2 in water i when the concentration of magnesium ion in water is low and the ph 11 a large amount of mg oh 2 is formed in this case if the ph 11 is controlled the turbidity will not increase this conclusion can be proven by water source 2 3 and 4 in fig 5 a ii when the concentration of mg2 in water is high and the ph 11 the supersaturation of magnesium hydroxide is far higher than that of the dissolution product ksp of magnesium hydroxide thus a large amount of magnesium hydroxide is formed magnesium hydroxide is difficult to crystallize so most of it will flow out with the water the increase in effluent turbidity is not determined by the crystallization efficiency of the reactor although reasonable control of the operating conditions of the reactor will improve the crystallization efficiency the crystallization rate is limited however if the concentration of calcium ion in water is too high a large number of calcium carbonate crystals rapidly form through homogeneous nucleation which cannot be instantly crystallized on the seed surface and will inevitably flow out with the water in this case the turbidity of effluent from the crystallization fluidized bed will increase which will affect the effluent and require an additional treatment process according to the research on different water quality conditions carried out with many pilot tests the influence rules of different calcium and magnesium ion concentrations on effluent turbidity have been summarized in fig 6 in zone i the concentration of calcium ions is lower than 180 mg l and the concentration of magnesium ions is lower than 70 mg l at this point calcium ions can fully crystallize and magnesium ions do not form a large amount of mg oh 2 when ph 11 thus the effluent turbidity remains unchanged in zone ii the concentration of calcium ions is lower than 180 mg l concertation of magnesium ions is higher than 70 mg l calcium ions can fully crystallize and magnesium ions will be affected by the ph of the water when the ph is lower than 11 the turbidity of effluent will increase significantly due to the formation of magnesium hydroxide in zone iii the concentration of calcium ions is higher than 180 mg l concentration of magnesium ions is lower than 70 mg l calcium ions have a relatively high concentration and cannot fully crystallize and the turbidity of effluent is increased due to calcium carbonate crystals in zone iv the concentration of calcium ions is higher than 180 mg l and the concentration of magnesium ions is higher than 70 mg l i e the concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions are all relatively high further the turbidity of effluent is mainly caused by calcium carbonate crystals formed when the ph is lower than 11 and calcium carbonate crystals and magnesium hydroxide crystals are observed when the ph is higher than 11 an increase in the effluent turbidity of a cpfbr may require further solid liquid separation measures or acid dissolution for turbidity related to calcium and magnesium hydroxide particles in the subsequent process however these steps will increase the operation costs therefore accurate determinations of the turbidity of effluent from a crystallization fluidized bed according to different water quality conditions is the key to achieving an optimal process design and operation regulations 3 3 influences of magnesium ions on the crystallization of calcium carbonate during the crystallization process with regard to general groundwater and surface water quality the concentration of calcium ions is higher than that of magnesium ions and the crystallization process of calcium carbonate is nearly unaffected by magnesium ions however the concentration of magnesium ions in water source 8 was higher than that of calcium ions and the molar concentration was n mg2 n ca2 3 in such situations to reduce the magnesium ions or total hardness in water the ph of water should be increased to greater than 11 consequently the magnesium ions will be greatly reduced as shown in fig 7 a high concentration of magnesium ions in water may also affect the crystallization of calcium carbonate in water 25 as shown in fig 8 a because the crystallization capacity of magnesium ions was not as good as that of calcium carbonate there were many cracks on the surface of pellets produced by crystallization in water with a relatively high level of magnesium ions these pellets were not as smooth as those produced in water with a relatively high level of calcium ions moreover following the crystallization of magnesium ions their adhesion morphology was obviously different from that of calcium carbonate as shown in fig 8 b the x ray diffraction xrd composition analysis of the pellets as shown in fig 9 showed that magnesium hydroxide content accounted for 2 6 of the pellets and the calcium carbonate content accounted for 97 4 of the pellets these results indicate two notable points first some crystals of magnesium hydroxide participated in the crystallization of calcium carbonate second although the content of magnesium hydroxide was not high it affected the crystal structure and surface morphology of calcium carbonate the xrd analysis was also carried out on solid pellets that caused the turbidity to increase in the effluent as shown in fig 10 the xrd analysis showed that magnesium carbonate and magnesium oxide accounted for 35 3 and 2 5 of the material content respectively which were far higher values than the percentage of magnesium ion content in crystal pellets this finding indicated that the increase in turbidity which occurred due to the compounds of amorphous magnesium ions in solid pellets that constitute the effluent was significantly augmented 4 conclusion through detailed analyses on the softening effect and the governing principle of the cpfbr pilot system with various water sources the following conclusions were obtained 1 the content of ca2 in water has certain rules in relation to the chemical agent type and dosage when naoh and na2co3 are added into water simultaneously the removal rate of ca2 has a positive correlation with the dosage of na2co3 in water while the ph value has a positive correlation with the dosage of naoh 2 the results showed that the effluent turbidity of a cpfbr system has certain rules in relation to the concentration of calcium and magnesium ions and the ph of water the effluent turbidity of a cpfbr system is affected by the concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions as well as ph in tests performed with different water quality conditions the turbidity of effluent remains unchanged when ca2 180 mg l mg2 70 mg l and ph 11 3 for water with a mg2 concentration higher than its ca2 concentration the crystal

13506,chemical crystallization circulating pellet fluidized bed reactor cpfbr systems are widely used in water softening applications and softening parameters and effects may be governed by certain rules for the optimum treatment of water at different levels of hardness in this study pilot tests were conducted on a cpfbr system with water at eight different levels of hardness specifically the effects of the differences in hardness alkalinity and calcium and magnesium concentrations on the softening rules and regulation of the cpfbr were analyzed the results showed that when na2co3 and naoh were added simultaneously the removal rate of ca2 was positively correlated with the dosage of na2co3 while ph was positively correlated with the dosage of naoh under the experimental water quality conditions when ca2 180 mg l mg2 70 mg l and ph 11 no fine calcium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide pellets were discharged with the water and the turbidity of the effluent did not increase for water with a higher concentration of mg2 than that of ca2 the morphology of calcium carbonate crystals element contents on crystal pellet surfaces and fine pellets flowing out with water were all affected by mg2 based on the analyses and summary of the crystallization softening rules for water at various hardness levels key supportive data and regulation methods are provided for the engineering design and application of such cpfbr systems keywords chemical crystallization circulating pellet fluidized bed multi source water quality softening hardness turbidity 1 introduction chemical crystallization circulating pellet fluidized bed reactor cpfbr technology has been used for water softening applications in the netherlands since the 1980s 1 2 and has since been applied to remove phosphorus 3 4 fluorine 5 7 and heavy metals 8 9 from water many scholars have analyzed the chemical crystallization pellets in detail mainly with regard to the crystallization kinetics 10 12 simulation analyses 13 14 influencing factors on softening 15 however most of the published studies were carried out at laboratory tests or using pilot tests and simulations for a limited set of water quality conditions or a single water quality condition thus far to the best of our knowledge only few reports have performed a comparative research on crystallization softening under various water hardness conditions in conjunction with in depth analyses of its rules and the influence of calcium and magnesium contents of water and various performance parameters through the analysis and induction of the crystallization softening process under various water quality conditions it can be found that particular principles or research results summarized under a single condition are not applicable to all water quality conditions especially in regard to the softening crystallization process dosage and simulation calculations for example schetters et al reported on the recovery and utilization of calcium carbonate pellets in amsterdam s crystallization pellet fluidized bed on a productive scale but they did not calculate and analyze the crystallization amount under different water quality conditions 16 a pilot scale study by hu et al showed that the pellet growth rate and bed growth rate in amsterdam s crystallization pellet fluidized bed were related to the ascending velocity particle size and supersaturation and they provided the corresponding calculation model but only for a single water quality condition so the calculation model may not be applicable under different water quality conditions 17 hofman et al summarized the pellet softening technology used in holland for the last 20 years with regard to three aspects namely the treatment effects environmental benefits and costs 18 with the increasing application of this technology in recent years some scholars summarized and compared the softening parameters under various water quality conditions for example tang et al characterized pellets from a pilot scale pellet reactor treating 16 water types at 8 danish drinking water treatment plants to investigate the variations in pellet characteristics and how they depend on the influent water composition 19 analyses of pilot test processes within a cpfbr softening system under diverse water quality conditions achieved with multiple sources of water would be useful for understanding chemical crystallization regulation from a broader perspective and the correlation between crystallization softening parameters or processes and calcium and magnesium contents need to be studied this will enable improved predictions and control of the softening process of chemical crystallization circulating granulation fluidized bed softening technology for water with different hardness in particular it is very important to study the applicability of such systems to different water quality conditions process design parameters and operations so as to achieve optimal effects in this study eight water sources with different types of water quality were tested at the pilot scale within a cpfbr softening system common problems were studied in detail such as the relationship of chemical agent types and dosages with different calcium and magnesium contents the relationship of effluent turbidity with calcium ions magnesium ions and ph in water and the influence of magnesium on the crystallization softening process in high magnesium and low calcium water quality conditions n mg2 n ca2 3 these results will provide a useful supporting framework for subsequent research system regulation engineering designs and applications of cpfbr softening systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 test water quality during the period from 2018 to 2019 cpfbr pilot tests were carried out on water samples with different levels of hardness and other water quality parameters that were obtained from eight different water sources the source water quality data are shown in table 1 as shown by the source water quality tests results diverse types of water were tested including hard water temporary and permanent types high magnesium water with the highest concentration of mg2 being 108 mg l high calcium water with the highest concentration of ca2 being 382 mg l high turbidity water with the highest turbidity being 43 5 ntu and low turbidity water with the turbidity being below 1 ntu these different water quality conditions were used to verify the adaptability of cpfbr to different water quality crystallization effects 2 2 instrument analysis and methods the following instruments and methods were used for evaluating different characteristics ph was evaluated using the hach portable ph meter hq40d hardness as well as ca2 and mg2 concentrations were calculated using ethylenediaminetetraacetic titration alkalinity was assessed via acid base titration hach portable turbidimeter 2100q was employed to determine turbidity surface morphology of crystalline pellets was obtained via scanning electron microscopy sem quanta feg 250 instrument compounds on the surface of crystalline pellets were identified using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy thermofisher k alpha 2 3 test equipment and process description the pilot test system is shown in fig 1 the core piece of equipment in the cpfbr pilot test system was the chemical reactor which represents an improvement over the amsterdam reactor cpfbr helps the circulation growth of pellets based on the amsterdam reactor the pellet size tends to be uniform in the crystal growth process from the bottom to the top of the reactor the cpfbr can effectively prevent the problem of uneven pellet size extend the discharge time improve the crystallization efficiency reduce the reactor height increase the pellet discharge size and ensure the high removal efficiencies of total hardness and ca2 20 21 the cpfbr pilot system was mainly composed of the chemical reactor chemical dosing systems a seed crystal dosing system and a pellet collection system the pilot test reactor was made of carbon steel with a height of 6 m and a diameter of 600 mm the maximum treatment capacity of the single reactor was 30 m3 h the water to be treated was pumped into the cpfbr by a pipeline pump where it was allowed to react with the softening agent naoh na2co3 in the fluidized bed seed crystals were mixed with water and then injected into the cpfbr through a pellet pump mature pellets dimeter 2 3 mm were discharged into a pellet storage box and acid was used to adjust the ph of the effluent from the fluidized bed specifically the effluent was mixed thoroughly by a static mixer and the ph was adjusted to 7 8 for discharge garnets with a size ranging from 0 2 0 4 mm and a density of 3 93 g cm3 were used as seeds in the pellet reactor the mass concentrations of naoh and na2co3 were 30 and 10 respectively sulphuric acid h2so4 was used to adjust ph and its mass concentration was 98 3 results and discussion 3 1 relationship between the calcium content and dosage in water with different levels of hardness and its regulation hard water is generally categorized as water dominated by temporary hardness and that dominated by permanent hardness 22 23 naoh or ca oh 2 should be added to water dominated by temporary hardness for the crystallization reaction while na2co3 should be added to water dominated by permanent hardness the dosage of chemicals in water needs to be calculated according to the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 in water naoh reacts with hco3 and ca2 at a ratio of 1 1 theoretically the dosage of naoh can be calculated according to the concentrations of hco3 and ca2 in water however the actual crystallization process of calcium carbonate requires a certain driving force and the reaction process may not reach completion therefore the actual dosage is generally more than the theoretically calculated dosage 20 as shown in fig 2 the relationship of the ph and molar concentration of naoh in water with a certain ca2 molar concentration was determined via testing of water sources 2 3 4 and 6 the results show that with an increase in ph the naoh concentration exceeded its theoretical dosage after many tests it was concluded that when ph 11 the optimal dosage of naoh was 1 1 5 times the required ca2 removal concentration and when ph 11 the optimal dosage of naoh was 1 5 2 0 times of the required ca2 removal concentration this can be observed for water sources 2 3 and 4 in the figure however when chemical substances such as scale inhibitor hinder the crystallization process the proportion will increase according to water source 6 in the figure the dosage of naoh should be set to 2 5 3 0 times the concentration of ca2 to be removed in order to crystallize calcium carbonate therefore when the cpfbr softens the water quality it is necessary to adjust and control the dosage and type according to the water quality characteristics and the content of calcium and magnesium in the water so as to achieve a better treatment effect when the permanent hardness in water is high i e hco3 is insufficient na2co3 needs to be added during the crystallization process naoh and na2co3 were added simultaneously during the operation of the crystallization fluidized bed and the reactions observed in water and during the formation of calcium carbonate also occur theoretically at the same time however a large number of experiments were carried out on water source 5 and the results showed that the removal rate of ca2 in water was positively correlated with the amount of na2co3 added in water while the ph of water was positively correlated with the amount of naoh added in water as shown in figs 3 and 4 therefore if the molar concentration of hco3 in water is less than that of ca2 and adding naoh alone cannot meet the hardness removal requirements it is necessary to build a na2co3 dosing system and to reasonably allocate the na2co3 and naoh dosing ratio according to the hardness removal requirements and treatment cost 3 2 principle governing the effluent turbidity by calcium and magnesium content in water with different levels of hardness and regulation crystallization of calcium carbonate in water involves heterogeneous nucleation but if there are relatively high levels of calcium and magnesium ions in water and the heterogeneous nucleation rate is limited homogeneous nucleation of calcium carbonate will occur 12 24 at this time due to homogeneous nucleation calcium carbonate crystals magnesium hydroxide or magnesium carbonate crystals tend to flow out with the water in the effluent of the crystallization fluidized bed thus resulting in an increase in the turbidity of the effluent the increase in effluent turbidity is generally caused by calcium and magnesium ions which is mainly due to the fact that calcium carbonate crystals magnesium hydroxide or magnesium carbonate cannot crystallize on the seed surface and therefore flow out with the water when the level of calcium ions in water is relatively low calcium carbonate crystallizes sufficiently and the turbidity of the effluent remains unchanged as shown in fig 5 a it can be seen from fig 5 a that the turbidity of water source 2 3 and 4 hardly changes with the increase in ph because at this point the calcium carbonate crystal formed is completely crystallized on the surface of the crystal seed however when the concentration of calcium and magnesium ions in water is high the effluent turbidity will increase with an increase in ph as shown in fig 5 b as can be seen from fig 5 b when the ph exceeds 11 the turbidity increases significantly up to 100 ntu this is because the presence of mg2 is also a main factor that causes an increase in turbidity there are generally two cases of turbidity caused by mg2 in water i when the concentration of magnesium ion in water is low and the ph 11 a large amount of mg oh 2 is formed in this case if the ph 11 is controlled the turbidity will not increase this conclusion can be proven by water source 2 3 and 4 in fig 5 a ii when the concentration of mg2 in water is high and the ph 11 the supersaturation of magnesium hydroxide is far higher than that of the dissolution product ksp of magnesium hydroxide thus a large amount of magnesium hydroxide is formed magnesium hydroxide is difficult to crystallize so most of it will flow out with the water the increase in effluent turbidity is not determined by the crystallization efficiency of the reactor although reasonable control of the operating conditions of the reactor will improve the crystallization efficiency the crystallization rate is limited however if the concentration of calcium ion in water is too high a large number of calcium carbonate crystals rapidly form through homogeneous nucleation which cannot be instantly crystallized on the seed surface and will inevitably flow out with the water in this case the turbidity of effluent from the crystallization fluidized bed will increase which will affect the effluent and require an additional treatment process according to the research on different water quality conditions carried out with many pilot tests the influence rules of different calcium and magnesium ion concentrations on effluent turbidity have been summarized in fig 6 in zone i the concentration of calcium ions is lower than 180 mg l and the concentration of magnesium ions is lower than 70 mg l at this point calcium ions can fully crystallize and magnesium ions do not form a large amount of mg oh 2 when ph 11 thus the effluent turbidity remains unchanged in zone ii the concentration of calcium ions is lower than 180 mg l concertation of magnesium ions is higher than 70 mg l calcium ions can fully crystallize and magnesium ions will be affected by the ph of the water when the ph is lower than 11 the turbidity of effluent will increase significantly due to the formation of magnesium hydroxide in zone iii the concentration of calcium ions is higher than 180 mg l concentration of magnesium ions is lower than 70 mg l calcium ions have a relatively high concentration and cannot fully crystallize and the turbidity of effluent is increased due to calcium carbonate crystals in zone iv the concentration of calcium ions is higher than 180 mg l and the concentration of magnesium ions is higher than 70 mg l i e the concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions are all relatively high further the turbidity of effluent is mainly caused by calcium carbonate crystals formed when the ph is lower than 11 and calcium carbonate crystals and magnesium hydroxide crystals are observed when the ph is higher than 11 an increase in the effluent turbidity of a cpfbr may require further solid liquid separation measures or acid dissolution for turbidity related to calcium and magnesium hydroxide particles in the subsequent process however these steps will increase the operation costs therefore accurate determinations of the turbidity of effluent from a crystallization fluidized bed according to different water quality conditions is the key to achieving an optimal process design and operation regulations 3 3

however only 2 5 of it is freshwater and due to limitations of distribution and technology only less than 1 of the freshwater is readily available for the humanity and ecosystem as a result according to a survey of the world health organization who the life of about 40 of the world population is affected by water shortage 1 3 the limited freshwater resources are now facing severe and fast increasing pressure of contaminations including heavy metal pollution heavy metal contamination usually comes from industrial activities such as mining smelting combustion of coal and pipelines for water transportation 4 for instance a public health crisis due to lead contamination of drinking water erupted in the city of flint michigan in 2014 when the municipality changed its water source from lake huron to the flint river 5 flint river water had high chloride high chloride to sulfate mass ratio and no corrosion inhibitor triggering a perfect storm of lead leaching into drinking water other major pathways for heavy metals to pollute the water system include the wastewaters pathway and the air pathway heavy metals may enter the ecosystem through untreated or incompletely treated industrial wastewaters they may also enter the atmosphere through industrial exhaust emissions and then precipitate with rain or natural settlement into soil or water systems 6 unlike organic matter heavy metals are not biodegradable they will circulate in the ecosystem for a long time and be enriched by organisms moving up the food chain which is a process called bioaccumulation consequently these heavy metals may ultimately be picked up by humans through the food supply and be absorbed at a level much higher than they exist in contaminated water bodies 7 heavy metals can interfere with the functionality or destroy the structure of proteins in organisms by complexing and cause a variety of acute or chronic diseases 8 for example lead can destroy the nervous system and the immune system and cadmium can destroy the liver and kidney conventional technologies for heavy metal ions removal include coagulation and flocculation adsorption ion exchange electrochemical treatment flotation membrane filtration and chemical precipitation 9 12 coagulation and flocculation are widely used in water treatment due to their low cost 13 however coagulants and flocculants such as aluminum sulfate alum poly aluminum chloride ferric chloride and ferrous sulfate cannot remove heavy metal completely 14 15 most regular adsorbents such as activated carbon 16 18 and zeolites are expensive for the treatment of large volumes of contaminated waters 19 20 bioadsorbents are relatively inexpensive but they are of low efficiency in wastewater treatment 16 21 22 common ion exchange resins have a low capacity for exchanging heavy metal ions and need frequent regeneration which ensues high operation costs 19 23 electrochemical treatment can remove heavy metal ions efficiently but it consumes plenty of electricity and might produce toxic and flammable gases during the operation 15 24 25 chemical precipitation includes hydroxide precipitation carbonate precipitation 26 sulfide precipitation and chelating precipitation 9 14 it can efficiently remove heavy metal ions including lead ions at high concentration but its efficiency is limited when metal concentration is low furthermore chemical precipitation tends to form fine particles which are slow to settle down by gravity or expensive to remove by centrifugation as illustrative examples zeng et al 27 investigated a novel approach involving mechanochemically activating caco3 through wet ball milling for lead removal pb2 were selectively precipitated by caco3 particles from zn2 pb2 containing wastewater with lead removal of 99 while most zn2 were preserved in soluble form this approach however is inherently energy intensive and is only beneficial when the recovery of a valuable metal ion such as zn2 is a major objective along with pb2 removal matlock et al 28 investigated chemical precipitation by 1 3 benzene diamide ethanethiol dianion bdet2 for lead removal from battery industry wastewater it was found that the bdet2 bound soft heavy metals including pb2 from aqueous stock solutions as highly stable metal ligand compounds more than 99 4 removal of lead from the battery wastewaters with an average initial concentration of 3 61 ppm at ph around 1 5 was accomplished within 15 min using an equimolar dose of the bdetk2 and the precipitates remained stable during 30 day leaching tests this approach resulted in a high residual pb2 concentration of about 0 5 ppm in the supernatant as for membrane separation processes conventional microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf 29 30 membranes cannot remove heavy metal ions since they do not have surface charge and their pore sizes are too large for that purpose nanofiltration nf membranes have surface charges but their pores even though much smaller than that of uf and mf are still much larger than the size of hydrated heavy metal ions and can only partially reject them 31 32 reverse osmosis ro membranes can be used for heavy metal removal however the flux of ro membranes is low and the required operating transmembrane pressures are high leading to high operating cost and energy consumption 33 efforts have been carried out to treat heavy metal contaminated waters using membranes other than ro enabled by different technologies for instance hajdu et al 34 integrated the removal of lead ions from an aqueous solution by capturing lead ions using biodegradable poly gamma glutamic acid cross linked nanoparticles 80 350 nm which were then removed by uf filtration the nanoparticle enabled uf filtration could remove more than 99 8 of the lead ions from water to produce a permeate satisfying the standard of drinking water recommended by the who when the lead concentration in feed was 21 ppm however the use of nanoparticles would increase the cost of treatment and nanoparticles could be an environmental hazard themselves xu et al 35 proposed covalent organic framework cof modified pvdf uf membranes for lead removal which achieved a relatively low lead removal of 92 4 at a feed lead ion concentration of 30 ppm however the permeate lead concentration was 2 28 ppm far above the drinking water standard recommended by who 36 of particular relevance macchi et al 37 studied the carbonate precipitation for lead removal from wastewaters of battery manufacturing typically containing 3 7 ppm pb2 with the precipitates separated by filtration using 0 45 μm mf membrane under the best conditions i e ph 9 5 with a theoretically predicted dissolved inorganic carbon dic of 0 15 mm the residual pb2 concentration in permeate was around 0 2 ppm the authors did not test the effects of dic instead they relied on dissolved co2 in aqueous solutions which varied with solution ph for carbonate precipitation chen et al compared the chemical precipitation of zn2 cu2 and pb2 using lime ca oh 2 soda ash na2co3 and sodium sulfide na2s as precipitants from aqueous solutions of 100 ppm heavy metal ions using a 0 45 μm mf membrane for filtration with the best conditions the removal of 99 99 was achieved with all three precipitants for copper and zinc the best removal of 99 75 was achieved for pb2 with sodium sulfide as the precipitant leaving a permeate lead concentration of 0 25 ppm or above more specifically the maximal lead removals with lime or soda ash precipitation were only 76 14 and 97 78 respectively corresponding to permeate lead concentrations of 23 86 and 2 22 ppm respectively while both these two studies pointed to a promising approach of enabling mf for lead removal by carbonate precipitation the focus was on chemical precipitation and mf filtration was used merely as a means of separating the precipitates from the colloidal suspension since settling of the ultrafine particles proved to be extremely difficult 38 in the current research we systematically investigated the feasibility of using carbonate precipitation to enable mf and uf filtration for lead removal from aqueous solutions experiments were carried out at three different ph levels i e 7 5 8 5 and 10 0 using two different commercial membranes i e mv020 mf of 0 2 μm and uh050 uf of 50 kda cutoff molecular mass and at five different dic concentration i e 0 0 5 1 2 and 4 mm it was demonstrated that carbonate precipitation could enable lead removal using both mf and uf membranes from the aqueous solution containing 5 ppm pb2 to produce water satisfying canadian drinking water standard i e 10 ppb and not surprisingly mf offered the highest fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 material

lead nitrate solution of 100 000 ppm pb2 was prepared and stored in dark fresh feed solutions were prepared by taking an appropriate volume of the stock solution diluting it to close but higher than 5 ppm using degassed deionized water of 17 mω cm 1 resistivities adding an appropriate amount of nahco3 adjust ph using 0 1 m naoh solution and then adding degassed deionized water to the right total volume the deionized water was degassed by vacuuming at 10 psi for 30 min to eliminate the dissolved carbon dioxide the dic concentration of feed solution was 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 2 or 4 mm and the ph was 7 5 8 5 9 5 10 or 10 5 it should be noted that dic aqueous solution is a ph buffer with pka1 of ph6 4 and pka2 of ph10 3 adjusting feed solution to ph10 5 needed to break the ph buffering capacity of the dic solution in the most demanding case i e to adjust 4 mm dic solution to ph10 5 the addition of approximately 0 5 mmol 20 mg naoh is required for 1 l feed solution 2 3 chemical precipitation enabled membrane filtration chemical precipitation enabled membrane filtration cpemf experiments were carried out with a dead end filtration cell illustrated in fig 1 where v1 v2 v3 g1 g2 and g3 were valves and pressure gauges for controlling the pressure of the feed chamber a membrane with an effective area of 0 0013 m2 was mounted at the bottom of the filtration cell on a filter paper placed at the surface of a sintered metal plate above the membrane there was a feed chamber with a capacity of 325 ml equipped with a magnetic stirrer the pressure was applied to the feed chamber from a nitrogen cylinder via a pressure regulator operating pressure of 43 5 psig was applied for uh050 uf membrane and 15 psig for mv020 mf membrane the permeate weight was automatically recorded by a computer every ten seconds in this filtration system the properties of membranes as specified by manufacturers are list in table 1 table 1 lists the properties of the two membranes used in this study that were specified by the manufacturers the mf and uf membranes were both made of hydrophobic polymers i e polyvinylidenefluoride pvdf and polyethersulfone pesh respectively the membrane was washed by deionized water before being mounted to the filtration cell after assembling the filtration system 300 ml of feed solution was loaded into the feed chamber and the magnetic stir was turned on then the pressure was adjusted to the predetermined value to start filtration the initial 10 g of permeate was discarded and the next 10 g of permeate was collected mixed with 0 2 ml nitric acid 68 70 and then subjected to measurement of lead ion concentration using a flame atomic absorption spectrometer faas thermo fisher scientific another 3 g of permeate was collected to measure ph by a ph meter fisher scientific after collecting the above samples the permeate was collected into a vessel placed on a balance and the permeate weight was recorded automatically by a computer every 10 s until the amount of the collected permeate became 100 g then the used membrane was removed from the filtration cell rinsed with deionized water and its surface was cleaned with a rubber scraper the membrane was rinsed again with deionized water before being stored in deionized water for the next round of tests the average flux of the membranes can be calculated by the following equation 39 1 j w ρ t a where j is the flux m3 h 1 m 2 of the membrane w is the weight kg of permeate collected during filtration time t h ρ is the permeate density kg m 3 and a is the effective area m2 of the membrane which was 0

2 6 solubility of lead ions in feed the concentration of lead ion pb2 in the suspension of alkaline precipitation by naoh could be described by the following equations 2 p b 2 2 o h p b o h 2 3 k s p p b o h 2 p b 2 o h 2 4 p b 2 k s p p b o h 2 10 p h k s p h 2 o 2 where k s p p b o h 2 and k s p h 2 o are the solubility product constant of the equilibrium constant of the formation reaction of pb oh 2 which is 1 43 10 15 mol 3 l 3 at 25 c and water which is 1 01 10 14 mol 2 l 2 at 25 c 40 the solubility of pbco3 is described by the following equilibrium where k s p p b c o 3 is the solubility

o 3 c o 3 2 consider the decrease of dic concentration by precipitation in the form of pbco3 per equations 5 and 6 dic at equilibrium is 11 d i c d i c 0 p b 2 0 p b 2 where dic 0 and pb2 0 are the initial concentration of dic and pb2 in the feed respectively solving equations 6 8 9 10 and 11 would allow the calculation of pb2 at given ph and nahco3 concentration which is the dic 0 pb2 was 5 ppm i e 0 0241 mm in all experiments the solubility of pbco3 is much smaller than that of pb oh 2 and pb hco3 2 in the ph range of 7 5 10 5 therefore precipitation in the forms of pb oh 2 and pb hco 2 are deemed to be negligible when dic existed in the feed solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical precipitation of pb2 by naoh and na2co3 cpemf is in essence the combination of chemical precipitation and membrane filtration it is therefore of interest to exam the lead removal by chemical precipitation as the baseline for comparison macchi et al 37 reported that the best conditions for carbonate precipitation of pb2 from battery manufacturing wastewater were ph 9 5 at which the saturation dic was 0 15 mm when the suspension was at equilibrium with air at 25 c on the other hand the optimal condition of carbonate precipitation reported by chen et al 38 was with a dic concentration of 0 724 mm i e pb dic molar ratio 1 0 1 5 at pb2 concentration of 0 4826 mm and a ph of 7 9 the ph range of 7 5 10 5 and dic concentration range of 0 4 mm we choose in this study covered optimal values of ph and dic in both studies table 2 presents both the calculated and experimental pb2 in the supernatant of chemical precipitation using two different chemicals i e naoh or nahco3 at different ph and dic concentrations the calculated values were determined using equations presented in section 2 6 while the experimental values were obtained by determining the pb2 in the supernatant of centrifuging feed solution after adjusting its ph and dic concentration to a pre set value the pb2 of naoh precipitation i e 0 mm dic was calculated using equation 4 and that of dic precipitation was calculated using equations 6 8 9 10 and 11 because the solubility of pbco3 is much lower than that of pb oh 2 or pb hco3 2 under the same conditions i e ph and temperature as well as dic concentration when applicable all three anions i e oh h c o 3 and c o 3 2 were available in chemical precipitation except for 0 mm dic where only oh was available as can been seen from table 2 the calculated pb2 in the supernatant i e the saturation pb2 decreased exponentially with ph when dic concentration was constant however the experimental pb2 in the supernatant was lowest at ph 8 5 at the same dic concentration for all tested dic nahco3 levels furthermore the experimental pb2 in supernatant decreased with the increase of dic concentration when compared at the same ph level comparison between the calculated and experimental data reveals that there are two different scenarios at 0 mm dic the saturation concentration of pb oh 2 at ph 7 0 and ph 8 5 are 2957 04 ppm and 29 57 ppm respectively both higher than the initial concentration of pb2 i e 5 ppm therefore all the pb2 should be soluble and the calculated pb2 concentration should both be 5 ppm theoretically no pb2 removal should have been achieved by centrifuging a solution and this is reflected by the experimental pb2 of the supernatant at ph 7 5 and 0 mm dic which was 4 58 ppm at ph 8 5 however the experimental pb2 was 1 16 0 19 ppm which was significantly lower than the initial pb2 of 5 ppm the partial pb2 removal achieved in this case was hypothetically caused by the local high ph when naoh solution was added to adjust ph which led to the formation of a small amount of pb oh 2 precipitation that was removed by centrifugation this hypothesis is in accordance with the detection of particles in the samples where the solubility of pb oh 2 was higher than 5 ppm table 4 it is worth noting that although the solubility of pb oh 2 at ph 10 5 is 0 003 ppm the experimental pb2 at this ph shows that essentially no lead removal was achieved by centrifugation this phenomenon was hypothetically related to the size and zeta potential of pb oh 2 particles at ph 10 5 which will be discussed more in detail in later sections in all other combinations of ph and dic concentration as listed in table 2 the experimental pb2 in supernatant was higher than the calculated value indicating that the experimental pb2 in supernatant was controlled not by the solubility of pb ho 2 and pbco3 but by the completeness of particles removal via centrifugation which relied heavily on particle morphology e g particle shape size and size distribution particle density and particle zeta potential the data indicate that ph 8 5 is the ph that forms the particles of most favorable features since the lowest pb2 in the supernatant was observed at this ph at all dic levels this point will be revisited in later sections it is worth noting that the lowest experimental pb2 130 ppb which was achieved at ph 8 5 and 4 0 mm dic i e nahco3 was more than 13 times the drinking water standard of who 10 ppb 36 3 2 flux and lead removal of cpemf table 3 summarizes the permeate flux and pb2 of cpemf under different conditions table 2 the permeate flux was with clear trends decreasing with the increase of either ph or dic concentration when other conditions were the same on the other hand as also summarized in table 3 the effects of the membrane ph and dic concentration on pb2 rejection had much more complex patterns first the uf membrane only showed modest advantage over the mf membranes when lead rejection is concerned when other conditions were the same indicating that membrane pore size was not controlling in terms of pb2 rejection under the tested conditions second ph 8 5 was the optimal ph in terms of pb2 removal with rare exceptions when compared at the same membrane and dic concentration third there was optimal dic in terms of lead rejection at each ph which was 1 0 mm dic at ph 8 5 and 2 0 mm at ph 7 5 or ph 10 regardless of the membrane it is of interest to note that the lead concentration in permeate was very close to the drinking water standard of who i e 10 ppb at 1 mm dic and ph 8 5 when either mf 11 3 0 9 or uf 8 6 6 2 ppb was used the flux of mf membrane at ph8 5 and 1 mm dic was 6409 35 kg h 1 m 2 at a transmembrane pressure of 15 psig which was 6 17 times of the flux obtained with the uf membrane at 43 5 psig under the same ph and dic concentration i e 1038 17 kg h 1 m 2 this superb flux of mf in comparison to that of uf is not a surprise due to the much larger pore size of the former than the latter however it represents a huge advantage of mf in process design when lead rejection is satisfactory by both membranes 3 3 particle size as shown in table 4 the average particle size of pb oh 2 particles at 0 mm dic had a tendency of decreasing with the increase of ph as for the average size of pbco3 particles ph 8 5 always had the largest average particle size among the tested ph levels corresponding to the lowest permeate pb2 concentration and therefore highest pb2 removal at ph 8 5 as afore discussed when compared at the same dic concentration it is worth noting that all particles had a size larger than 200 nm which was the pore size of the mf membrane with the only exceptions being at ph 8 5 0 dic and ph 7 5 4 mm dic when 5 7 particles had a size of 60 33 nm and 9 3 particles had a size of 27 1 nm respectively 3 4 zeta potential as shown in fig 2 the zeta potentials of particles in feed solutions were negative for all dic concentrations include 0 mm dic in general the absolute value of the negative zeta potential of particles increased with ph and dic concentration these trends are particularly evident in the ph range of 7 5 9 5 and dic range of 0 0 25 mm when compared at the same ph the zeta potential of the 0 dic sample was remarkably lower than that of 0 25 mm the effect of ph on zeta potential was significant for 0 mm dic samples the zeta potential of pb oh 2 particles decreased from 29 27 mv to 41 20 mv when ph increased from 8 5 to 10 5 in the case of chemical precipitation with 0 25 mm dic the zeta potentials were decreased sharply from the range of 25 to 35 mv at ph 7 5 to between 38 and 43 mv at ph 8 5 depending on the dic concentration and became more negative when ph further increased to ph 9 5 and then 10 5 but at a much smaller pace fluctuating between 40 and 45 mv in the ph range of 9 5 10 5 the general trend of the effect of ph on the zeta potentials of pb oh 2 and pbco3 particles are in line with those documented in the literature on other minerals 43 it is worth noting that 4 0 mm dic offered the smallest zeta potential among the tested dic concentration range when comparing at the same ph levels zeta 43 44 potential is the electrical potential at the slipping plane adjacent to the stagnant liquid layer attached to the surface of the dispersed particles in a colloid its magnitude depends on the net electrical charge at the particle surface the properties of the counter ions or polar molecules in the liquid phase and the viscosity and conductivity of the liquid although zeta potential does not equal to the particle surface potential it is the only means for researchers to characterize surface charges of particles dispersed in a colloid and has recently been employed by researchers for the characterization of the surface charges of particles such as microalgal cells 45 46 and precipitate in chemical precipitation 38 3 5 particle morphology fig 3 shows the morphology of pb oh 2 particles i e the particles with 0 mm dic and pbco3 particles i e particles obtained using na2co3 as the alkali in feed solution at initial ph 8 5 the pbco3 particles were snowflake like particles the particles were so thin that the darkening of the shadow could be observed at the overlap of two particles these particles may form an agglomerate layer with small pores on the surface of the membrane which would be able to reject fine particles this might have facilitated the adsorption of free pb2 cations in solution on to the partially negatively charged particle surfaces on the other hand the pb oh 2 precipitates were denser particles 3 6 parameters affecting chemical precipitation dic concentration and ph affect the efficiency of lead removal by chemical precipitation by determining the extent of precipitation solubility size and morphology of particles and the zeta potential high zeta potential absolute value leads to high electric repulsion force between charged particles which makes the particles difficult to aggregate and sediment by gravity or centrifugation it has been established that a colloid is of good stability when zeta potential is between 40 0 and 60 0 mv and is unstable between 16 mv and 30 mv 43 this explains why the pb oh 2 particles were more difficult to precipitate at ph 10 5 41 20 mv than that at ph 8 5 zeta potential 29 27 mv even though the solubility of pb2 at ph 10 5 0 003 ppm is much smaller than that at ph 8 5 29 57 ppm in the case of carbonate precipitation the zeta potentials of pbco3 particles were between 37 mv and 47 mm when ph changed from 8 5 to 10 5 with the lowest being at ph 8 5 and 4 0 mm dic the fact that the zeta potentials were at levels that provides good stability of colloid explains the difficulties experienced in lead removal by carbonate precipitation in the best case scenario which was achieved at ph 8 5 and 4 0 mm dic the pb2 concentration was 130 ppb table 2 which was 13 times of the canadian drinking water standard 3 7 parameters affecting removal in cpemf lead ion has a radius of 1 22 a and cannot be retained by uf or mf via size rejection based on the experimental data we propose the following mechanisms to explain cpemf as shown in table 2 when ph is 8 5 or higher the solubility of pbco3 at all the tested dic concentrations i e in the range of 0 25 4 0 mm is much lower than the who standard of 10 ppb with the highest being 4 6 ppb at ph 8 5 and 0 25 mm dic therefore the pb2 removal in cpemf in such conditions is governed by the removal of fine pbco3 particles by membrane filtration as shown in table 4 almost all of the particles were larger than the pore size of mf membranes which was 0 2 μm when feed ph was 8 5 or 10 therefore it is logical to expect that most of the particles would be retained by the mf membrane and even more so by the uf membrane which had a molecular cutoff of 50 kda table 1 as shown in fig 4 the absolute value of the negative zeta potentials of pbco3 particles at ph 10 5 was much higher than that at ph 8 5 when compared at the same dic concentration this is likely the reason that the particle size at ph 10 is much smaller than that at ph 8 5 when compared at the same dic concentration table 4 the smaller particle size could be the primary reason that the lead concentration in the permeate of cpemf using both mf and uf were much higher at ph 10 than at ph 8 5 with rare exception table 2 data presented in table 2 also shown a significant effect of dic concentration on lead removal of cpemf and the optimal dic concentration was 1 mm at ph 8 5 and 2 mm at ph 10 however as shown in fig 4 1 0 mm and 2 0 mm dic corresponded to the highest zeta potential in the tested dic concentration range of 0 4 mm at both ph 8 5 and ph 10 0 these results suggest that zeta potential is not the only factor affecting lead removal by cpemf table 4 reports that the size of particles in chemical precipitation were all larger than 200 nm the pore size of the mf with rare exceptions however the fact that a substantial amount of lead existed in the permeate of all the cpemf conditions suggest that there were nano scale particles that were smaller than the cutoff of uf membrane existed in the feed but eluded the detection of the particle analyzer hypothetically the partially charged pbco3 particles as suggested by their zeta potentials with a size large enough to be rejected by the membranes used in cpemf would form a layer alias cake on the membrane surface this charged layer would help reject fine particles carrying the same partial charge fig 4 the layer formed at 1 mm or 2 mm which had the largest charge intensity as reflected by their zeta potential would be the most efficient in rejecting these fine particles and therefore result in the lowest lead concentration in permeate 4 conclusions in this study the removal of lead from an aqueous system using cpemf was investigated it was demonstrated that this is an efficient technology with the potential of using conventional mf or uf membrane to remove lead ions from aqueous solutions to satisfy drinking water standards when conditions are optimized the best conditions that emerged from this study are cpemf at ph 8 5 and 1 mm dic using either mf or uf in terms of lead rejection however mf membranes are more advantageous than uf membranes because of their tremendously superb fluxes and low operational pressure the mechanism of this technology hypothetically involved the formation of partially charged particles that were mostly larger than the pore size of the membrane which would form a cake layer on membrane surface to prevent the passage of fine particles carrying the same charges by electric rejection both ph and dic concentration are important parameter determining the efficiency of lead removal by cpemf hypothetically via their influence of the solubility of pbco3 zeta potential and therefore size of particles and the rejection of partially charged nano scale particles by a fouling layer on membrane surface that is of the same partial charges it should be noted that organic and inorganic contaminants in different forms such as suspended solids cod and bod could intervene with the formation of particles affecting the solubility morphology and charges of particles and therefore strongly affect the effectiveness of lead removal by cpemf therefore although this paper demonstrated that on principle cpemf has the potential to be cost effective approach for treatment of waters contaminated by lead and possibly other heavy metal ions conditions need to be optimized for very wastewater on a case by case basis declaration of competing interest the

13507,in this study the removal of pb2 ions by chemical precipitation enabled membrane filtration cpemf was investigated two different membranes i e microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf and five

however only 2 5 of it is freshwater and due to limitations of distribution and technology only less than 1 of the freshwater is readily available for the humanity and ecosystem as a result according to a survey of the world health organization who the life of about 40 of the world population is affected by water shortage 1 3 the limited freshwater resources are now facing severe and fast increasing pressure of contaminations including heavy metal pollution heavy metal contamination usually comes from industrial activities such as mining smelting combustion of coal and pipelines for water transportation 4 for instance a public health crisis due to lead contamination of drinking water erupted in the city of flint michigan in 2014 when the municipality changed its water source from lake huron to the flint river 5 flint river water had high chloride high chloride to sulfate mass ratio and no corrosion inhibitor triggering a perfect storm of lead leaching into drinking water other major pathways for heavy metals to pollute the water system include the wastewaters pathway and the air pathway heavy metals may enter the ecosystem through untreated or incompletely treated industrial wastewaters they may also enter the atmosphere through industrial exhaust emissions and then precipitate with rain or natural settlement into soil or water systems 6 unlike organic matter heavy metals are not biodegradable they will circulate in the ecosystem for a long time and be enriched by organisms moving up the food chain which is a process called bioaccumulation consequently these heavy metals may ultimately be picked up by humans through the food supply and be absorbed at a level much higher than they exist in contaminated water bodies 7 heavy metals can interfere with the functionality or destroy the structure of proteins in organisms by complexing and cause a variety of acute or chronic diseases 8 for example lead can destroy the nervous system and the immune system and cadmium can destroy the liver and kidney conventional technologies for heavy metal ions removal include coagulation and flocculation adsorption ion exchange electrochemical treatment flotation membrane filtration and chemical precipitation 9 12 coagulation and flocculation are widely used in water treatment due to their low cost 13 however coagulants and flocculants such as aluminum sulfate alum poly aluminum chloride ferric chloride and ferrous sulfate cannot remove heavy metal completely 14 15 most regular adsorbents such as activated carbon 16 18 and zeolites are expensive for the treatment of large volumes of contaminated waters 19 20 bioadsorbents are relatively inexpensive but they are of low efficiency in wastewater treatment 16 21 22 common ion exchange resins have a low capacity for exchanging heavy metal ions and need frequent regeneration which ensues high operation costs 19 23 electrochemical treatment can remove heavy metal ions efficiently but it consumes plenty of electricity and might produce toxic and flammable gases during the operation 15 24 25 chemical precipitation includes hydroxide precipitation carbonate precipitation 26 sulfide precipitation and chelating precipitation 9 14 it can efficiently remove heavy metal ions including lead ions at high concentration but its efficiency is limited when metal concentration is low furthermore chemical precipitation tends to form fine particles which are slow to settle down by gravity or expensive to remove by centrifugation as illustrative examples zeng et al 27 investigated a novel approach involving mechanochemically activating caco3 through wet ball milling for lead removal pb2 were selectively precipitated by caco3 particles from zn2 pb2 containing wastewater with lead removal of 99 while most zn2 were preserved in soluble form this approach however is inherently energy intensive and is only beneficial when the recovery of a valuable metal ion such as zn2 is a major objective along with pb2 removal matlock et al 28 investigated chemical precipitation by 1 3 benzene diamide ethanethiol dianion bdet2 for lead removal from battery industry wastewater it was found that the bdet2 bound soft heavy metals including pb2 from aqueous stock solutions as highly stable metal ligand compounds more than 99 4 removal of lead from the battery wastewaters with an average initial concentration of 3 61 ppm at ph around 1 5 was accomplished within 15 min using an equimolar dose of the bdetk2 and the precipitates remained stable during 30 day leaching tests this approach resulted in a high residual pb2 concentration of about 0 5 ppm in the supernatant as for membrane separation processes conventional microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf 29 30 membranes cannot remove heavy metal ions since they do not have surface charge and their pore sizes are too large for that purpose nanofiltration nf membranes have surface charges but their pores even though much smaller than that of uf and mf are still much larger than the size of hydrated heavy metal ions and can only partially reject them 31 32 reverse osmosis ro membranes can be used for heavy metal removal however the flux of ro membranes is low and the required operating transmembrane pressures are high leading to high operating cost and energy consumption 33 efforts have been carried out to treat heavy metal contaminated waters using membranes other than ro enabled by different technologies for instance hajdu et al 34 integrated the removal of lead ions from an aqueous solution by capturing lead ions using biodegradable poly gamma glutamic acid cross linked nanoparticles 80 350 nm which were then removed by uf filtration the nanoparticle enabled uf filtration could remove more than 99 8 of the lead ions from water to produce a permeate satisfying the standard of drinking water recommended by the who when the lead concentration in feed was 21 ppm however the use of nanoparticles would increase the cost of treatment and nanoparticles could be an environmental hazard themselves xu et al 35 proposed covalent organic framework cof modified pvdf uf membranes for lead removal which achieved a relatively low lead removal of 92 4 at a feed lead ion concentration of 30 ppm however the permeate lead concentration was 2 28 ppm far above the drinking water standard recommended by who 36 of particular relevance macchi et al 37 studied the carbonate precipitation for lead removal from wastewaters of battery manufacturing typically containing 3 7 ppm pb2 with the precipitates separated by filtration using 0 45 μm mf membrane under the best conditions i e ph 9 5 with a theoretically predicted dissolved inorganic carbon dic of 0 15 mm the residual pb2 concentration in permeate was around 0 2 ppm the authors did not test the effects of dic instead they relied on dissolved co2 in aqueous solutions which varied with solution ph for carbonate precipitation chen et al compared the chemical precipitation of zn2 cu2 and pb2 using lime ca oh 2 soda ash na2co3 and sodium sulfide na2s as precipitants from aqueous solutions of 100 ppm heavy metal ions using a 0 45 μm mf membrane for filtration with the best conditions the removal of 99 99 was achieved with all three precipitants for copper and zinc the best removal of 99 75 was achieved for pb2 with sodium sulfide as the precipitant leaving a permeate lead concentration of 0 25 ppm or above more specifically the maximal lead removals with lime or soda ash precipitation were only 76 14 and 97 78 respectively corresponding to permeate lead concentrations of 23 86 and 2 22 ppm respectively while both these two studies pointed to a promising approach of enabling mf for lead removal by carbonate precipitation the focus was on chemical precipitation and mf filtration was used merely as a means of separating the precipitates from the colloidal suspension since settling of the ultrafine particles proved to be extremely difficult 38 in the current research we systematically investigated the feasibility of using carbonate precipitation to enable mf and uf filtration for lead removal from aqueous solutions experiments were carried out at three different ph levels i e 7 5 8 5 and 10 0 using two different commercial membranes i e mv020 mf of 0 2 μm and uh050 uf of 50 kda cutoff molecular mass and at five different dic concentration i e 0 0 5 1 2 and 4 mm it was demonstrated that carbonate precipitation could enable lead removal using both mf and uf membranes from the aqueous solution containing 5 ppm pb2 to produce water satisfying canadian drinking water standard i e 10 ppb and not surprisingly mf offered the highest fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 material two commercial membranes mv020 mf membrane and uh050 uf membrane purchased from sterlitech corporation wa usa were used in this work lead ii nitrate with the purity of 99 acs was purchased from strem chemical inc ma usa nitric acid of 68 70 acs sodium hydroxide of 98 9 acs and sodium bicarbonate of 99 fcc were purchased from fisher scientific fair lawn nj 2 2 preparation of feed solution a stock lead nitrate solution of 100 000 ppm pb2 was prepared and stored in dark fresh feed solutions were prepared by taking an appropriate volume of the stock solution diluting it to close but higher than 5 ppm using degassed deionized water of 17 mω cm 1 resistivities adding an appropriate amount of nahco3 adjust ph using 0 1 m naoh solution and then adding degassed deionized water to the right total volume the deionized water was degassed by vacuuming at 10 psi for 30 min to eliminate the dissolved carbon dioxide the dic concentration of feed solution was 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 2 or 4 mm and the ph was 7 5 8 5 9 5 10 or 10 5 it should be noted that dic aqueous solution is a ph buffer with pka1 of ph6 4 and pka2 of ph10 3 adjusting feed solution to ph10 5 needed to break the ph buffering capacity of the dic solution in the most demanding case i e to adjust 4 mm dic solution to ph10 5 the addition of approximately 0 5 mmol 20 mg naoh is required for 1 l feed solution 2 3 chemical precipitation enabled membrane filtration chemical precipitation enabled membrane filtration cpemf experiments were carried out with a dead end filtration cell illustrated in fig 1 where v1 v2 v3 g1 g2 and g3 were valves and pressure gauges for controlling the pressure of the feed chamber a membrane with an effective area of 0 0013 m2 was mounted at the bottom of the filtration cell on a filter paper placed at the surface of a sintered metal plate above the membrane there was a feed chamber with a capacity of 325 ml equipped with a magnetic stirrer the pressure was applied to the feed chamber from a nitrogen cylinder via a pressure regulator operating pressure of 43 5 psig was applied for uh050 uf membrane and 15 psig for mv020 mf membrane the permeate weight was automatically recorded by a computer every ten seconds in this filtration system the properties of membranes as specified by manufacturers are list in table 1 table 1 lists the properties of the two membranes used in this study that were specified by the manufacturers the mf and uf membranes were both made of hydrophobic polymers i e polyvinylidenefluoride pvdf and polyethersulfone pesh respectively the membrane was washed by deionized water before being mounted to the filtration cell after assembling the filtration system 300 ml of feed solution was loaded into the feed chamber and the magnetic stir was turned on then the pressure was adjusted to the predetermined value to start filtration the initial 10 g of permeate was discarded and the next 10 g of permeate was collected mixed with 0 2 ml nitric acid 68 70 and then subjected to measurement of lead ion concentration using a flame atomic absorption spectrometer faas thermo fisher scientific another 3 g of permeate was collected to measure ph by a ph meter fisher scientific after collecting the above samples the permeate was collected into a vessel placed on a balance and the permeate weight was recorded automatically by a computer every 10 s until the amount of the collected permeate became 100 g then the used membrane was removed from the filtration cell rinsed with deionized water and its surface was cleaned with a rubber scraper the membrane was rinsed again with deionized water before being stored in deionized water for the next round of tests the average flux of the membranes can be calculated by the following equation 39 1 j w ρ t a where j is the flux m3 h 1 m 2 of the membrane w is the weight kg of permeate collected during filtration time t h ρ is the permeate density kg m 3 and a is the effective area m2 of the membrane which was 0 0013 m2 2 4 chemical precipitation chemical precipitation was simulated by centrifuging feed solution adjusted to pre determined dic concentration and ph values using nahco3 and naoh alkaline solution the feed solution was centrifuged for 30 min at 6000 rpm 3420 g then 10 ml of the supernatant was collected with 0 2 ml nitric acid 68 70 added to stabilize the lead ions before being subjected to the flame ionization analysis 2 5 characterization of particles the zeta potential and particle size distribution of the lead containing particles formed in the feed solution at varied dic concentration

oh 2 which is 1 43 10 15 mol 3 l 3 at 25 c and water which is 1 01 10 14 mol 2 l 2 at 25 c 40 the solubility of pbco3 is described by the following equilibrium where k s p p b c o 3 is the solubility

o 3 c o 3 2 consider the decrease of dic concentration by precipitation in the form of pbco3 per equations 5 and 6 dic at equilibrium is 11 d i c d i c 0 p b 2 0 p b 2 where dic 0 and pb2 0 are the initial concentration of dic and pb2 in the feed respectively solving equations 6 8 9 10 and 11 would allow the calculation of pb2 at given ph and nahco3 concentration which is the dic 0 pb2 was 5 ppm i e 0 0241 mm in all experiments the solubility of pbco3 is much smaller than that of pb oh 2 and pb hco3 2 in the ph range of 7 5 10 5 therefore precipitation in the forms of pb oh 2 and pb hco 2 are deemed to be negligible when dic existed in the feed solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical precipitation of pb2 by naoh and na2co3 cpemf is in essence the combination of chemical precipitation and membrane filtration it is therefore of interest to exam the lead removal by chemical precipitation as the baseline for comparison macchi et al 37 reported that the best conditions for carbonate precipitation of pb2 from battery manufacturing wastewater were ph 9 5 at which the saturation dic was 0 15 mm when the suspension was at equilibrium with air at 25 c on the other hand the optimal condition of carbonate precipitation reported by chen et al 38 was with a dic concentration of 0 724 mm i e pb dic molar ratio 1 0 1 5 at pb2 concentration of 0 4826 mm and a ph of 7 9 the ph range of 7 5 10 5 and dic concentration range of 0 4 mm we choose in this study covered optimal values of ph and dic in both studies table 2 presents both the calculated and experimental pb2 in the supernatant of chemical precipitation using two different chemicals i e naoh or nahco3 at different ph and dic concentrations the calculated values were determined using equations presented in section 2 6 while the experimental values were obtained by determining the pb2 in the supernatant of centrifuging feed solution after adjusting its ph and dic concentration to a pre set value the pb2 of naoh precipitation i e 0 mm dic was calculated using equation 4 and that of dic precipitation was calculated using equations 6 8 9 10 and 11 because the solubility of pbco3 is much lower than that of pb oh 2 or pb hco3 2 under the same conditions i e ph and temperature as well as dic concentration when applicable all three anions i e oh h c o 3 and c o 3 2 were available in chemical precipitation except for 0 mm dic where only oh was available as can been seen from table 2 the calculated pb2 in the supernatant i e the saturation pb2 decreased exponentially with ph when dic concentration was constant however the experimental pb2 in the supernatant was lowest at ph 8 5 at the same dic concentration for all tested dic nahco3 levels furthermore the experimental pb2 in supernatant decreased with the increase of dic concentration when compared at the same ph level comparison between the calculated and experimental data reveals that there are two different scenarios at 0 mm dic the saturation concentration of pb oh 2 at ph 7 0 and ph 8 5 are 2957 04 ppm and 29 57 ppm respectively both higher than the initial concentration of pb2 i e 5 ppm therefore all the pb2 should be soluble and the calculated pb2 concentration should both be 5 ppm theoretically no pb2 removal should have been achieved by centrifuging a solution and this is reflected by the experimental pb2 of the supernatant at ph 7 5 and 0 mm dic which was 4 58 ppm at ph 8 5 however the experimental pb2 was 1 16 0 19 ppm which was significantly lower than the initial pb2 of 5 ppm the partial pb2 removal achieved in this case was hypothetically caused by the local high ph when naoh solution was added to adjust ph which led to the formation of a small amount of pb oh 2 precipitation that was removed by centrifugation this hypothesis is in accordance with the detection of particles in the samples where the solubility of pb oh 2 was higher than 5 ppm table 4 it is worth noting that although the solubility of pb oh 2 at ph 10 5 is 0 003 ppm the experimental pb2 at this ph shows that essentially no lead removal was achieved by centrifugation this phenomenon was hypothetically related to the size and zeta potential of pb oh 2 particles at ph 10 5 which will be discussed more in detail in later sections in all other combinations of ph and dic concentration as listed in table 2 the experimental pb2 in supernatant was higher than the calculated value indicating that the experimental pb2 in supernatant was controlled not by the solubility of pb ho 2 and pbco3 but by the completeness of particles removal via centrifugation which relied heavily on particle morphology e g particle shape size and size distribution particle density and particle zeta potential the data indicate that ph 8 5 is the ph that forms the particles of most favorable features since the lowest pb2 in the supernatant was observed at this ph at all dic levels this point will be revisited in later sections it is worth noting that the lowest experimental pb2 130 ppb which was achieved at ph 8 5 and 4 0 mm dic i e nahco3 was more than 13 times the drinking water standard of who 10 ppb 36 3 2 flux and lead removal of cpemf table 3 summarizes the permeate flux and pb2 of cpemf under different conditions table 2 the permeate flux was with clear trends decreasing with the increase of either ph or dic concentration when other conditions were the same on the other hand as also summarized in table 3 the effects of the membrane ph and dic concentration on pb2 rejection had much more complex patterns first the uf membrane only showed modest advantage over the mf membranes when lead rejection is concerned when other conditions were the same indicating that membrane pore size was not controlling in terms of pb2 rejection under the tested conditions second ph 8 5 was the optimal ph in terms of pb2 removal with rare exceptions when compared at the same membrane and dic concentration third there was optimal dic in terms of lead rejection at each ph which was 1 0 mm dic at ph 8 5 and 2 0 mm at ph 7 5 or ph 10 regardless of the membrane it is of interest to note that the lead concentration in permeate was very close to the drinking water standard of who i e 10 ppb at 1 mm dic and ph 8 5 when either mf 11 3 0 9 or uf 8 6 6 2 ppb was used the flux of mf membrane at ph8 5 and 1 mm dic was 6409 35 kg h 1 m 2 at a transmembrane pressure of 15 psig which was 6 17 times of the flux obtained with the uf membrane at 43 5 psig under the same ph and dic concentration i e 1038 17 kg h 1 m 2 this superb flux of mf in comparison to that of uf is not a surprise due to the much larger pore size of the former than the latter however it represents a huge advantage of mf in process design when lead rejection is satisfactory by both membranes 3 3 particle size as shown in table 4 the average particle size of pb oh 2 particles at 0 mm dic had a tendency of decreasing with the increase of ph as for the average size of pbco3 particles ph 8 5 always had the largest average particle size among the tested ph levels corresponding to the lowest permeate pb2 concentration and therefore highest pb2 removal at ph 8 5 as afore discussed when compared at the same dic concentration it is worth noting that all particles had a size larger than 200 nm which was the pore size of the mf membrane with the only exceptions being at ph 8 5 0 dic and ph 7 5 4 mm dic when 5 7 particles had a size of 60 33 nm and 9 3 particles had a size of 27 1 nm respectively 3 4 zeta potential as shown in fig 2 the zeta potentials of particles in feed solutions were negative for all dic concentrations include 0 mm dic in general the absolute value of the negative zeta potential of particles increased with ph and dic concentration these trends are particularly evident in the ph range of 7 5 9 5 and dic range of 0 0 25 mm when compared at the same ph the zeta potential of the 0 dic sample was remarkably lower than that of 0 25 mm the effect of ph on zeta potential was significant for 0 mm dic samples the zeta potential of pb oh 2 particles decreased from 29 27 mv to 41 20 mv when ph increased from 8 5 to 10 5 in the case of chemical precipitation with 0 25 mm dic the zeta potentials were decreased sharply from the range of 25 to 35 mv at ph 7 5 to between 38 and 43 mv at ph 8 5 depending on the dic concentration and became more negative when ph further increased to ph 9 5 and then 10 5 but at a much smaller pace fluctuating between 40 and 45 mv in the ph range of 9 5 10 5 the general trend of the effect of ph on the zeta potentials of pb oh 2 and pbco3 particles are in line with those documented in the literature on other minerals 43 it is worth noting that 4 0 mm dic offered the smallest zeta potential among the tested dic concentration range when comparing at the same ph levels zeta 43 44 potential is the electrical potential at the slipping plane adjacent to the stagnant liquid layer attached to the surface of the dispersed particles in a colloid its magnitude depends on the net electrical charge at the particle surface the properties of the counter ions or polar molecules in the liquid phase and the viscosity and conductivity of the liquid although zeta potential does not equal to the particle surface potential it is the only means for researchers to characterize surface charges of particles dispersed in a colloid and has recently been employed by researchers for the characterization of the surface charges of particles such as microalgal cells 45 46 and precipitate in chemical precipitation 38 3 5 particle morphology fig 3 shows the morphology of pb oh 2 particles i e the particles with 0 mm dic and pbco3 particles i e particles obtained using na2co3 as the alkali in feed solution at initial ph 8 5 the pbco3 particles were snowflake like particles the particles were so thin that the darkening of the shadow could be observed at the overlap of two particles these particles may form an agglomerate layer with small pores on the surface of the membrane which would be able to reject fine particles this might have facilitated the adsorption of free pb2 cations in solution on to the partially negatively charged particle surfaces on the other hand the pb oh 2 precipitates were denser particles 3 6 parameters affecting chemical precipitation dic concentration and ph affect the efficiency of lead removal by chemical precipitation by determining the extent of precipitation solubility size and morphology of particles and the zeta potential high zeta potential absolute value leads to high electric repulsion force between charged particles which makes the particles difficult to aggregate and sediment by gravity or centrifugation it has been established that a colloid is of good stability when zeta potential is between 40 0 and 60 0 mv and is unstable between 16 mv and 30 mv 43 this explains why the pb oh 2 particles were more difficult to precipitate at ph 10 5 41 20 mv than that at ph 8 5 zeta potential 29 27 mv even though the solubility of pb2 at ph 10 5 0 003 ppm is much smaller than that at ph 8 5 29 57 ppm in the case of carbonate precipitation the zeta potentials of pbco3 particles were between 37 mv and 47 mm when ph changed from 8 5 to 10 5 with the lowest being at ph 8 5 and 4 0 mm dic the fact that the zeta potentials were at levels that provides good stability of colloid explains the difficulties experienced in lead removal by carbonate precipitation in the best case scenario which was achieved at ph 8 5 and 4 0 mm dic the pb2 concentration was 130 ppb table 2 which was 13 times of the canadian drinking water standard 3 7 parameters affecting removal in cpemf lead ion has a radius of 1 22 a and cannot be retained by uf or mf via size rejection based on the experimental data we propose the following mechanisms to explain cpemf as shown in table 2 when ph is 8 5 or higher the solubility of pbco3 at all the tested dic concentrations i e in the range of 0 25 4 0 mm is much lower than the who standard of 10 ppb with the highest being 4 6 ppb at ph 8 5 and 0 25 mm dic therefore the pb2 removal in cpemf in such conditions is governed by the removal of fine pbco3 particles by membrane filtration as shown in table 4 almost all of the particles were larger than the pore size of mf membranes which was 0 2 μm when feed ph was 8 5 or 10 therefore it is logical to expect that most of the particles would be retained by the mf membrane and even more so by the uf membrane which had a molecular cutoff of 50 kda table 1 as shown in fig 4 the absolute value of the negative zeta potentials of pbco3 particles at ph 10 5 was much higher than that at ph 8 5 when compared at the same dic concentration this is likely the reason that the particle size at ph 10 is much smaller than that at ph 8 5 when compared at the same dic concentration table 4 the smaller particle size could be the primary reason that the lead concentration in the permeate of cpemf using both mf and uf were much higher at ph 10 than at ph 8 5 with rare exception table 2 data presented in table 2 also shown a significant effect of dic concentration on lead removal of cpemf and the optimal dic concentration was 1 mm at ph 8 5 and 2 mm at ph 10 however as shown in fig 4 1 0 mm and 2 0 mm dic corresponded to the highest zeta potential in the tested dic concentration range of 0 4 mm at both ph 8 5 and ph 10 0 these results suggest that zeta potential is not the only factor affecting lead removal by cpemf table 4 reports that the size of particles in chemical precipitation were all larger than 200 nm the pore size of the mf with rare exceptions however the fact that a substantial amount of lead existed in the permeate of all the cpemf conditions suggest that there were nano scale particles that were smaller than the cutoff of uf membrane existed in the feed but eluded the detection of the particle analyzer hypothetically the partially charged pbco3 particles as suggested by their zeta potentials with a size large enough to be rejected by the membranes used in cpemf would form a layer alias cake on the membrane surface this charged layer would help reject fine particles carrying the same partial charge fig 4 the layer formed at 1 mm or 2 mm which had the largest charge intensity as reflected by their zeta potential would be the most efficient in rejecting these fine particles and therefore result in the lowest lead concentration in permeate 4 conclusions in this study the removal of lead from an aqueous system using cpemf was investigated it was demonstrated that this is an efficient technology with the potential of using conventional mf or uf membrane to remove lead ions from aqueous solutions to satisfy drinking water standards when conditions are optimized the best conditions that emerged from this study are cpemf at ph 8 5 and 1 mm dic using either mf or uf in terms of lead rejection however mf membranes are more advantageous than uf membranes because of their tremendously superb fluxes and low operational pressure the mechanism of this technology hypothetically involved the formation of partially charged particles that were mostly larger than the pore size of the membrane which would form a cake layer on membrane surface to prevent the passage of fine particles carrying the same charges by electric rejection both ph and dic concentration are important parameter determining the efficiency of lead removal by cpemf hypothetically via their influence of the solubility of pbco3 zeta potential and therefore size of particles and the rejection of partially charged nano scale particles by a fouling layer on membrane surface that is of the same partial charges it should be noted that organic and inorganic contaminants in different forms such as suspended solids cod and bod could intervene with the formation of particles affecting the solubility morphology and charges of particles and therefore strongly affect the effectiveness of lead removal by cpemf therefore although this paper demonstrated that on principle cpemf has the potential to be cost effective approach for treatment of waters contaminated by lead and possibly other heavy metal ions conditions need to be optimized for very wastewater on a case by case basis declaration of competing interest the

13508,perfluorinated compounds pfcs are chemical substances widely used in industry especially in textile coatings often detected in waters all around the world those are persistent bioaccumulative and endocrine disruptors causing damage to human health and the environment thus this work aimed at evaluating the degradation of aqueous perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos one of the most used pfcs at near environmental concentrations initially 100 μg l 1 by heterogeneous photocatalysis tio2 uv at optimized conditions c t i o 2 1 45 g l 1 and p h 4 0 which were determined by the response surface methodology rsm 83 pfos removal was achieved in 8 h at 25 c a pseudo first order kinetic model was adjusted to the experimental data and the initial rate constant k was estimated as 0 64 h 1 with maximum oxidation capacity moc of 86 no significant degradation was observed by direct uv photolysis furthermore the degradation products dps were identified by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry hplc ms acute and chronic ecotoxicities for three classes of organisms fishes daphnids and green algae and lipophilicity log d ph 7 4 of the dps were estimated using the ecosar 1 11 and chemicalize software respectively the main finding was that pfos could be degraded by an advanced oxidation process under mild conditions and reasonable times and that the lipophilicity of the formed dps affects acute and chronic ecotoxicities of the organisms studied keywords pfos photocatalysis tio2 rsm zeta potential moc 1 introduction water quality is a worldwide problem population growth and the expansion of agricultural and industrial activities together with wastewater treatment plants wwtp which were not designed for the efficient removal of organic micropollutants have contributed to several chemical compounds reaching the water bodies causing surface and groundwater contamination 1 among those chemicals perfluorinated compounds are of great concern as they are highly resistant to hydrolysis photolysis and biodegradation 2 4 perfluorinated compounds pfcs are amphiphilic organic compounds consisting of an nonpolar perfluoroalkyl chain of the type cf3 cf2 n r linked to a hydrophilic functional group r oh cooh conh2 so2nh r 2 or so3h they are widely used in leather polymers and textile coatings industries as well as in various consumer products insecticides and herbicides formulations cooking and electronic products lubricants adhesives paper and fire extinguisher foams 5 7 perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos fig 1 is one of the major pfcs it is potentially carcinogenic and has half lives of approximately 4 8 years in humans 114 days in the atmosphere and 41 years in water 25 c 8 10 in 2009 that compound was listed as a persistent organic pollutant pop at the stockholm convention and has since been reduced worldwide however pfos is still used in some applications due to the lack of suitable alternatives for its replacement moreover even today its concentration in water is relatively high due to its intensive use in the past and its chemical stability which prevents its degradation 11 14 in recent years those compounds have drawn the attention of scientists because they can bioaccumulate and biomagnify they are recalcitrant in the environment endocrine disruptors and potentially toxic to humans and animals they are often detected in surface and groundwater at low concentrations pg l 1 to μg l 1 2 15 18 for instance a broad monitoring study of perfluorinated compounds in water was carried out by gonzalez gaya et al 2014 during an expedition along the atlantic pacific and indian oceans the authors identified and quantified nine perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas three sulfonic acids pfsas and two sulfonamides pfasas in concentrations in the order of pg l 1 the concentration range of the pfcs found was 131 10900 pg l 1 in the atlantic ocean 344 2500 pg l 1 in the pacific ocean and 176 1976 pg l 1 in the indian ocean besides that the authors concluded that pfos was the most abundant compound accounting for 33 of the total pfcs globally it is important to emphasize that water quality standards are increasingly stringent and that it is necessary to develop cost effective water and wastewater treatment technologies for removing persistent compounds such as pfos 18 within that scenario advanced oxidation processes aop have an important role to play due to their efficiency in treating refractory and persistent compounds 19 aops are based on the in situ generation of hydroxyl radical a highly oxidizing agent e 2 8 v against the standard hydrogen electrode capable of reacting with a wide variety of organic compounds reducing their recalcitrance and or improving their mineralization and generating inert substances such as inorganic salts 19 20 however no degradation was observed when an aqueous solution containing 10 mg l 1 was treated with three aops o3 uv o3 h2o2 21 and fenton 21 22 processes during 120 min in this study the heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of pfos was assessed heterogeneous photocatalysis an aop is an economical process that has been extensively investigated for the degradation of several types of organic contaminants showing positive and significant results 19 23 26 this technology is based on the oxidation of organic contaminants by the combined action of a semiconductor the photocatalyst and uv or visible light 24 26 the most used semiconductor is tio2 due to its physicochemical properties such as chemical stability durability high hydrophilicity photoactivity low toxicity and low cost 27 to our best knowledge this is the first study with bare tio2 without any modifications whose operational conditions were optimized by experimental design using the surface response methodology srm 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all reagents including perfluorooctanesulfonic acid sigma aldrich 98 ammonium acetate synth 97 methanol panreac hplc grade sulfuric acid panreac 96 sodium hydroxide synth 97 and titanium dioxide evonik p25 were used as received all solutions were prepared in ultra pure water 2 2 zeta potential measurement the zeta potential was measured to determine the surface charge of the tio2 particles in function of the suspension ph the particles were dispersed in water whose ph was varied between 2 and 8 a malvern zetasizer nano zs model acquisition in dts1070 cells with smoluchowski calculation model was used 2 3 photocatalytic experiments the experiments were performed in a 250 ml pyrex glass cylindrical cell containing 100 ml of pfos solution 100 μg l 1 a medium pressure mercury vapor lamp mpml outer bulb removed positioned at 13 cm above the solution was used as the ultraviolet radiation source 250 w philips hpl n air was pumped through the suspension to saturate it with oxygen ventilation fans prevented the lamp overheating and a thermostatic bath julabo fp50 hl maintained the cell temperature at 25 c fig 2 the amount of tio2 and the suspension ph were set according to the experimental design performed the tio2 particles were maintained in suspension by magnetic stirring first the photocatalyst was added to the pfos solution the cell was kept in the dark for 30 min under magnetic stirring and air bubbling to achieve adsorption equilibrium afterwards the solution was irradiated for 90 min and then the photocatalyst was removed from suspension using a vacuum filtration system employing cellulose acetate membranes 47 mm diameter 0 45 μm porosity 2 4 response surface methodology the response surface methodology rsm is a statistical tool based on the fitting of a polynomial equation to the experimental data 28 all degradation experiments were performed using the rsm which is composed of three steps 1st preliminary full 2 n factorial design n factors 2 levels to assess the statistical significance of the factors 95 confidence interval and the experimental error as well as the direction in which degradation increases path of steepest ascent 2nd experiments along the path of steepest ascent to reach the optimal region and 3rd central composite design ccd to obtain the polynomial equation that describes the behavior of the responses and determine the optimal condition to achieve maximum degradation 29 the preliminary design was performed in duplicate totaling 8 experiments the studied factors and respective levels were c t i o 2 0 75 and 1 25 g l 1 and ph 3 6 and 5 6 all experiments were randomly performed to avoid systematic errors the response variable was the pfos degradation calculated by eq 1 in which c p f o s 0 and c p f o s t are the pfos concentrations at time 0 and t respectively 1 p f o s d e g r a d a t i o n c p f o s 0 c p f o s t 100 the experimental error was determined by eq 2 in which ν n and s n 2 are the number of degrees of freedom and the variance of each one of the n replicates respectively 29 2 e x p e r i m e n t a l e r r o r v 1 s 1 2 v 2 s 2 2 v n s n 2 v 1 v 2 v n after checking the statistical significance of the studied factors a linear model was fitted to the resulting data based on the plane surface described by that linear model seven new experiments were performed along the path of steepest ascent c t i o 2 1 0 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 2 0 and 2 2 g l 1 and ph 4 6 4 1 3 6 3 1 2 6 2 1 and 1 6 respectively the conditions showing the greatest degradation were taken as the central point of a ccd c t i o 2 1 1 1 2 1 4 1 6 and 1 7 g l 1 and ph 2 9 3 1 3 6 4 1 and 4 3 that ccd was performed with three replicates of the central point finally a second order model was fitted to the results and the optimal greatest degradation point was determined again the experimental error was estimated eq 1 and model adjustment was checked by an analysis of variance anova in addition direct photolysis and dark adsorption experiments were performed at the optimal point to assess their individual contributions to the pfos degradation 2 5 kinetic model for pfos removal the pfos removal kinetics was determined by using the mathematical model proposed by chan and chu 30 shown in eq 3 in which c is the pfos concentration at time t h c 0 is the initial concentration of pfos at time t 0 and ρ h and σ dimensionless are two constants related to the initial reaction rate and the maximum oxidation capacity respectively 30 31 3 c c 0 1 t ρ σ t the slope of eq 2 can be mathematically solved by taking its derivative in time as shown in eq 4 4 d c c 0 d t ρ ρ σ t 2 when t is zero the slope can be calculated by eq 5 1 ρ h 1 and its physical meaning is the initial removal rate of pfos 5 d c c 0 d t 1 ρ on the other hand when t is long enough approaching infinity 1 σ is the theoretical maximum pfos removal fraction which is equivalent to the maximum oxidation capacity moc of the process eq 6 6 1 σ 1 c t c 0 the characteristic constants ρ and σ were estimated by the solver package excel software using the generalized reduced gradient grg nonlinear solving and least squares methods 2 6 analytical procedures pfos concentrations of the treated water samples were measured by hplc ms ms

no observed effect concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalyst tio2 surface charge analysis by zeta potential in heterogeneous photocatalysis one of the most important parameters is the suspension ph that is because ph may dramatically change the photocatalyst surface properties and consequently the degradation efficiency regarding tio2 the surface group titanol tioh has an amphoteric nature in water and its acid base equilibria are shown in equations 7 8 7 t i o h 2 h 2 o t i o h h 3 o 8 t i o h h 2 o t i o h 3 o according to hoffmann et al 1995 their respective ionization constants are pka1 4 5 and pka2 8 0 for degussa p25 therefore the isoelectric point pi of tioh would be 6 25 as synthetic conditions may greatly change the surface properties of a solid the pi for the tio2 actually used in all experiments evonik p25 was determined fig 3 shows the measured zeta potentials in the range 3 5 ph 8 0 the resulting pi was approximately 5 6 indeed different from that one reported earlier that measurement allowed for choosing carefully the ph range to be studied in the factorial design as the pka of pfos is 3 4 33 its anionic form predominates over the whole ph range 0 14 therefore in order to avoid electrostatic repulsion between pfos and tio2 the ph levels chosen to be investigated were 3 6 and 5 6 3 2 optimization using the response surface methodology rsm table 1 shows the pfos removal results for the preliminary 22 factorial design coded factors in parenthesis the overall experimental error was 2 23 small enough for allowing the determination of whether the studied factors were indeed statistically significant then a linear model without interactions between factors was adjusted to the experimental data with the aid of statistica 12 software eq 9 shows the estimated polynomial the calculated error for each polynomial coefficient was 0 79 what makes them all statistically significant 9 p f o s r e m o v a l 27 31 2 59 x 1 4 14 x 2 the

pollutants in groundwater including pfos 200 400 μg l 1 using a nanostructured tio2 film deposited on a stainless steel mesh and b tio2 degussa p25 as catalysts 50 100 mg l 1 the solution ph 7 85 was irradiated for 60 min using a low pressure hg vapor lamp 254 nm according to the authors pfos degradation was not observed under those conditions sun et al 37 highlighted that the degradation of perfluoroalkyl compounds such as pfos by heterogeneous photocatalysis needed to be confirmed as most of the studies use pfoa as a model pollutant the removal by direct photolysis was quite small approximately 10 in 8 h as reported by many authors pfos degradation by direct photolysis uv light is indeed negligible 38 40 yamamoto et al 41 reported that aqueous pfos 20 mg l 1 was irradiated with a low pressure mercury vapor lamp emission centered at 254 nm 32 w after 1 and 10 days only 8 and 68 of the initial concentration were removed respectively it should be said that one believes that the uv photolytic degradation of pfos is a reductive process driven by hydrated electrons e a q generated when water is ionized by photons of proper energy 42 those e a q are quite reactive and easily scavenged by h3o and o2 43 44 therefore uv photolysis was indeed not expected here due to the conditions in which the degradation was carried out i e ph 4 0 and o2 saturated suspension on the contrary

better than heterogeneous photocatalysis for removing pfos from water however those high removals only happened because the amount of photocatalyst was really greater than the one of pfos on a 1 l

considers the variety of species of a compound in function of the solution ph usually ph 7 4 is used as a reference because it is the physiological ph 45 46 the determination of the log d ph 7 4 is important to estimate the bioaccumulation capacity of organic compounds in living beings the higher the value of log d the greater the likelihood that the compound will dissolve in their lipid layer for this reason the distribution coefficients log d ph 7 4 of pfos and their dps were estimated pfos and all pds formed have log d 0 indicating a risk factor for humans and animals due to the possibility of these compounds dissolve in the lipid layers of the organisms this occurs because log d 0 indicates that the organic compound preferably dissolves in non polar medium whereas log d 0 indicates that the compound preferably dissolves in polar medium 46 in other words it means that compounds with log d 0 may be partially or totally eliminated through urine the lipophilicity log d ph 7 4 of dp1 is approximately 2 35 which is smaller than the one of pfos log d ph 7 4 3 05 due to loss of a cf2 shorter carbon chain compared to its parent compound however dp2 log d ph 7 4 3 95 and dp3 log d ph 7 4 3 71 have greater lipophilicities than pfos due to the loss of the oxygen atom one can observe fig 7 that the ecotoxicities profiles are quite similar except for the magnitude order of concentrations dp1 is less toxic to fishes green algae and daphnids compared to pfos however dp2 and dp3 are more toxic that their parent compound for all the estimated trophic levels those results may indicate that the lipophilicity of those compounds directly influence their ecotoxicity 4 conclusion the main finding was that pfos at near environmental concentrations here 100 μg l 1 could

13508,perfluorinated compounds pfcs are chemical substances widely used in industry especially in textile coatings often detected in waters all around the world those are persistent bioaccumulative and endocrine disruptors causing damage to human health and the environment thus this work aimed at evaluating the degradation of aqueous perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos one of the most used pfcs at near environmental concentrations initially 100 μg l 1 by heterogeneous photocatalysis tio2 uv at optimized conditions c t i o 2 1 45 g l 1 and p h 4 0 which were determined by the response surface methodology rsm 83 pfos removal was achieved in 8 h at 25 c a pseudo first order kinetic model was adjusted to the experimental data and the initial rate constant k was estimated as 0 64 h 1 with maximum oxidation capacity moc of 86 no significant degradation was observed by direct uv photolysis furthermore the degradation products dps were identified by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry hplc ms acute and chronic ecotoxicities for three classes of organisms fishes daphnids and green algae and lipophilicity log d ph 7 4 of the dps were estimated using the ecosar 1 11 and chemicalize software respectively the main finding was that pfos could be degraded by an advanced oxidation process under mild conditions and reasonable times and that the lipophilicity of the formed dps affects acute and chronic ecotoxicities of the organisms studied keywords pfos photocatalysis tio2 rsm zeta potential moc 1 introduction water quality is a worldwide problem population growth and the expansion of agricultural and industrial activities together with wastewater treatment plants wwtp which were not designed for the efficient removal of organic micropollutants have contributed to several chemical compounds reaching the water bodies causing surface and groundwater contamination 1 among those chemicals perfluorinated compounds are of great concern as they are highly resistant to hydrolysis photolysis and biodegradation 2 4 perfluorinated compounds pfcs are amphiphilic organic compounds consisting of an nonpolar perfluoroalkyl chain of the type cf3 cf2 n r linked to a hydrophilic functional group r oh cooh conh2 so2nh r 2 or so3h they are widely used in leather polymers and textile coatings industries as well as in various consumer products insecticides and herbicides formulations cooking and electronic products lubricants adhesives paper and fire extinguisher foams 5 7 perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos fig 1 is one of the major pfcs it is potentially carcinogenic and has half lives of approximately 4 8 years in humans 114 days in the atmosphere and 41 years in water 25 c 8 10 in 2009 that compound was listed as a persistent organic pollutant pop at the stockholm convention and has since been reduced worldwide however pfos is still used in some applications due to the lack of suitable alternatives for its replacement moreover even today its concentration in water is relatively high due to its intensive use in the past and its chemical stability which prevents its degradation 11 14 in recent years those compounds have drawn the attention of scientists because they can bioaccumulate and biomagnify they are recalcitrant in the environment endocrine disruptors and potentially toxic to humans and animals they are often detected in surface and groundwater at low concentrations pg l 1 to μg l 1 2 15 18 for instance a broad monitoring study of perfluorinated compounds in water was carried out by gonzalez gaya et al 2014 during an expedition along the atlantic pacific and indian oceans the authors identified and quantified nine perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas three sulfonic acids pfsas and two sulfonamides pfasas in concentrations in the order of pg l 1 the concentration range of the pfcs found was 131 10900 pg l 1 in the atlantic ocean 344 2500 pg l 1 in the pacific ocean and 176 1976 pg l 1 in the indian ocean besides that the authors concluded that pfos was the most abundant compound accounting for 33 of the total pfcs globally it is important to emphasize that water quality standards are increasingly stringent and that it is necessary to develop cost effective water and wastewater treatment technologies for removing persistent compounds such as pfos 18 within that scenario advanced oxidation processes aop have an important role to play due to their efficiency in treating refractory and persistent compounds 19 aops are based on the in situ generation of hydroxyl radical a highly oxidizing agent e 2 8 v against the standard hydrogen electrode capable of reacting with a wide variety of organic compounds reducing their recalcitrance and or improving their mineralization and generating inert substances such as inorganic salts 19 20 however no degradation was observed when an aqueous solution containing 10 mg l 1 was treated with three aops o3 uv o3 h2o2 21 and fenton 21 22 processes during 120 min in this study the heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of pfos was assessed heterogeneous photocatalysis an aop is an economical process that has been extensively investigated for the degradation of several types of organic contaminants showing positive and significant results 19 23 26 this technology is based on the oxidation of organic contaminants by the combined action of a semiconductor the photocatalyst and uv or visible light 24 26 the most used semiconductor is tio2 due to its physicochemical properties such as chemical stability durability high hydrophilicity photoactivity low toxicity and low cost 27 to our best knowledge this is the first study with bare tio2 without any modifications whose operational conditions were optimized by experimental design using the surface response methodology srm 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all reagents including perfluorooctanesulfonic acid sigma aldrich 98 ammonium acetate synth 97 methanol panreac hplc grade sulfuric acid panreac 96 sodium hydroxide synth 97 and titanium dioxide evonik p25 were used as received all solutions were prepared in ultra pure water 2 2 zeta potential measurement the zeta potential was measured to determine the surface charge of the tio2 particles in function of the suspension ph the particles were dispersed in water whose ph was varied between 2 and 8 a malvern zetasizer nano zs model acquisition in dts1070 cells with smoluchowski calculation model was used 2 3 photocatalytic experiments the experiments were performed in a 250 ml pyrex glass cylindrical cell containing 100 ml of pfos solution 100 μg l 1 a medium pressure mercury vapor lamp mpml outer bulb removed positioned at 13 cm above the solution was used as the ultraviolet radiation source 250 w philips hpl n air was pumped through the suspension to saturate it with oxygen ventilation fans prevented the lamp overheating and a thermostatic bath julabo fp50 hl maintained the cell temperature at 25 c fig 2 the amount of tio2 and the suspension ph were set according to the experimental design performed the tio2 particles were maintained in suspension by magnetic stirring first the photocatalyst was added to the pfos solution the cell was kept in the dark for 30 min under magnetic stirring and air bubbling to achieve adsorption equilibrium afterwards the solution was irradiated for 90 min and then the photocatalyst was removed from suspension using a vacuum filtration system employing cellulose acetate membranes 47 mm diameter 0 45 μm porosity 2 4 response surface methodology the response surface methodology rsm is a statistical tool based on the fitting of a polynomial equation to the experimental data 28 all degradation experiments were performed using the rsm which is composed of three steps 1st preliminary full 2 n factorial design n factors 2 levels to assess the statistical significance of the factors 95 confidence interval and the experimental error as well as the direction in which degradation increases path of steepest ascent 2nd experiments along the path of steepest ascent to reach the optimal region and 3rd central composite design ccd to obtain the polynomial equation that describes the behavior of the responses and determine the optimal condition to achieve maximum degradation 29 the preliminary design was performed in duplicate totaling 8 experiments the studied factors and respective levels were c t i o 2 0 75 and 1 25 g l 1 and ph 3 6 and 5 6 all experiments were randomly performed to avoid systematic errors the response variable was the pfos degradation calculated by eq 1 in which c p f o s 0 and c p f o s t are the pfos concentrations at time 0 and t respectively 1 p f o s d e g r a d a t i o n c p f o s 0 c p f o s t 100 the experimental error was determined by eq 2 in which ν n and s n 2 are the number of degrees of freedom and the variance of each one of the n replicates respectively 29 2 e x p e r i m e n t a l e r r o r v 1 s 1 2 v 2 s 2 2 v n s n 2 v 1 v 2 v n after checking the statistical significance of the studied factors a linear model was fitted to the resulting data based on the plane surface described by that linear model seven new experiments were performed along the path of steepest ascent c t i o 2 1 0 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 2 0 and 2 2 g l 1 and ph 4 6 4 1 3 6 3 1 2 6 2 1 and 1 6 respectively the conditions showing the greatest degradation were taken as the central point of a ccd c t i o 2 1 1 1 2 1 4 1 6 and 1 7 g l 1 and ph 2 9 3 1 3 6 4 1 and 4 3 that ccd was performed with three replicates of the central point finally a second order model was fitted to the results and the optimal greatest degradation point was determined again the experimental error was estimated eq 1 and model adjustment was checked by an analysis of variance anova in addition direct photolysis and dark adsorption experiments were performed at the optimal point to assess their individual contributions to the pfos degradation 2 5 kinetic model for pfos removal the pfos removal kinetics was determined by using the mathematical model proposed by chan and chu 30 shown in eq 3 in which c is the pfos concentration at time t h c 0 is the initial concentration of pfos at time t 0 and ρ h and σ dimensionless are two constants related to the initial reaction rate and the maximum oxidation capacity respectively 30 31 3 c c 0 1 t ρ σ t the slope of eq 2 can be mathematically solved by taking its derivative in time as shown in eq 4 4 d c c 0 d t ρ ρ σ t 2 when t is zero the slope can be calculated by eq 5 1 ρ h 1 and its physical meaning is the initial removal rate of pfos 5 d c c 0 d t 1 ρ on the other hand when t is long enough approaching infinity 1 σ is the theoretical maximum pfos removal fraction which is equivalent to the maximum oxidation capacity moc of the process eq 6 6 1 σ 1 c t c 0 the characteristic constants ρ and σ were estimated by the solver package excel software using the generalized reduced gradient grg nonlinear solving and least squares methods 2 6 analytical procedures pfos concentrations of the treated water samples were measured by hplc ms ms

no observed effect concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalyst tio2 surface charge analysis by zeta potential in heterogeneous photocatalysis one of the most important parameters is the suspension ph that is because ph may dramatically change the photocatalyst surface properties and consequently the degradation efficiency regarding tio2 the surface group titanol tioh has an amphoteric nature in water and its acid base equilibria are shown in equations 7 8 7 t i o h 2 h 2 o t i o h h 3 o 8 t i o h h 2 o t i o h 3 o according to hoffmann et al 1995 their respective ionization constants are pka1 4 5 and pka2 8 0 for degussa p25 therefore the isoelectric point pi of tioh would be 6 25 as synthetic conditions may greatly change the surface properties of a solid the pi for the tio2 actually used in all experiments evonik p25 was determined fig 3 shows the measured zeta potentials in the range 3 5 ph 8 0 the resulting pi was approximately 5 6 indeed different from that one reported earlier that measurement allowed for choosing carefully the ph range to be studied in the factorial design as the pka of pfos is 3 4 33 its anionic form predominates over the whole ph range 0 14 therefore in order to avoid electrostatic repulsion between pfos and tio2 the ph levels chosen to be investigated were 3 6 and 5 6 3 2 optimization using the response surface methodology rsm table 1 shows the pfos removal results for the preliminary 22 factorial design coded factors in parenthesis the overall experimental error was 2 23 small enough for allowing the determination of whether the studied factors were indeed statistically significant then a linear model without interactions between factors was adjusted to the experimental data with the aid of statistica 12 software eq 9 shows the estimated polynomial the calculated error for each polynomial coefficient was 0 79 what makes them all statistically significant 9 p f o s r e m o v a l 27 31 2 59 x 1 4 14 x 2 the pareto s chart of the factors effects fig 4 a and the response surface defined by eq 9 fig 4b were generated on the pareto s chart fig 4a the standardized effects estimates are plotted as bars whose sizes are proportional to those effects absolute values the bars that cross the reference red line p 0 05 are statistically significant 95 confidence interval one can observe in fig 4a that within

was less significant than the ph one because the reaction system was already close to that turning point the conditions for the experiments along the path of steepest ascent were defined by taking the greatest factor coefficient absolute value as a reference which was the one for ph 4 14 therefore for each decrease in p h δ x p h a correspondent increase in the tio2 amount was calculated δ x t i o

indicates that the compound preferably dissolves in polar medium 46 in other words it means that compounds with log d 0 may be partially or totally eliminated through urine the lipophilicity log d ph 7 4 of dp1 is approximately 2 35 which is smaller than the one of pfos log d ph 7 4 3 05 due to loss of a cf2 shorter carbon chain compared to its parent compound however dp2 log d ph 7 4 3 95 and dp3 log d ph 7 4 3 71 have greater lipophilicities than pfos due to the loss of the oxygen atom one can observe fig 7 that the ecotoxicities profiles are quite similar except for the magnitude order of concentrations dp1 is less toxic to fishes green algae and daphnids compared to pfos however dp2 and dp3 are more toxic that their parent compound for all the estimated trophic levels those results may indicate that the lipophilicity of those compounds directly influence their ecotoxicity 4 conclusion the main finding was that pfos at near environmental concentrations here 100 μg l 1 could indeed be degraded by an advanced oxidation process namely tio2 uv optimized conditions ph 4 1 45 g l 1 tio2 with significant removal after 8 h of treatment reaching almost the oxidative capacity of

300130 china school of chemical engineering and technology hebei university of technology tianjin 300130 china graphical abstract a simple one step method was developed for modifying the hydrophobic poly vinylidene fluoride microfiltration membrane to improve its hydrophilicity and antifouling properties pyrogallol and n 3 trimethoxysilyl propyl ethylenediamine kh792 formed an excellent hydrophilic network by michael addition schiff reaction under alkaline environment the physical and chemical characteristics of the membranes were systematically tested the water contact angle kept a lower value and the pure water flux of the modified membrane could reach 7166 l m 2 h 1 the separation efficiency of the four oil in water emulsions were all more than 99 in addition the coating method also has excellent hydrophilicity and pure water flux on polytetrafluoroethylene membrane indicating that it has great potential application in other membranes keywords pyrogallol kh792 hydrophilicity oil in water emulsions separation efficiency 1 introduction with the development of industrialization more and more problems about the water pollution appears which poses a huge hidden danger to human health and the stability of ecological environment 1 4 in the contaminated water oil water separation has become one of the most intractable problems in recent years 5 6 traditional methods of treating oily wastewater including air flotation 7 centrifugal separation 8 physical adsorption 9 have been explored to address this issue their unsatisfactory treatment effect for oil water mixture restricts the application of these methods attributing to their low efficiency and easy to produce secondary pollution in order to separate the oily wastewater more economically and effectively membrane separation is considered to be a promising separation technology 10 poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf 11 polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe 12 and other membranes with excellent thermal stability mechanical properties and chemical stability have been extensively used for oil water separation 13 however some of these membranes with highly hydrophobic are easily contaminated with oil and blocking the membrane pores thus affecting their water flux therefore the hydrophilic modification of hydrophobic membrane is necessary many methods including surface coating 14 19 surface grafting 20 22 and blending 23 24 could improve the hydrophilicity of the hydrophobic membranes among them the surface coating has attracted more attention due to its simplicity and high efficiency while the adhesion and stability of the coating layer need to be further improved in recent years great efforts have been made to develop the adhesion coating with dopamine da yang et al co deposited mussel stimulated da and polyethyleneimine on a polypropylene membrane and its hydrophilicity was greatly improved 17 cao et al took advantage of the michael addition schiff reaction between da and polyethylenepolyamine to modify the surface of different materials and had an excellent removal effect on oil water mixture dyes and metal ions 25 however the da is difficult to industrialize due to its high price need to explore cost effective materials compared with da plant based phenol based coatings have faster adhesion lower cost better usability and structural diversity because of the rich catechol groups of tannic acid it has been widely used for membranes these groups with the help of covalent or non covalent interactions gives tannic acid ta strong adhesion on membranes 26 27 while the slowly deposition rate of plant polyphenols inspires people to find more rapid plant phenols coating materials pyrogallol pg is derived from peels nuts vegetables and medicinal plants 28 it can be oxidized rapidly and generate similar mussel inspired adhesion layer by michael addition schiff reaction under the help of amino terminated substances in alkaline environment 29 the hydrophilic modification of the membrane by surface coating formed by pyrogallol alone is not enough and need to add other substances reacting with pyrogallol to form a good hydrophilicity network with high stability the silane coupling agent sca is a unique chain that can easily induce siloxane hydrolysis and condensation into polysiloxane under alkaline conditions 30 31 therefore pyrogallol and sca with amino groups can be connected by michael addition schiff base reaction in an alkaline environment the introduction of amino and hydroxyl hydrophilic groups and the fabrication of micro nano level roughness can greatly improve the surface hydrophilicity in this study pyrogallol pg and n 3 trimethoxysilyl propyl ethylenediamine kh792 were added to the tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris hcl buffer solution and linked by michael addition schiff reaction and a hydrophilic excellent hybrid network was formed on the hydrophobic membrane the kh792 joined membrane not only increased the surface roughness and introduced the double amino functional groups which will greatly increase the hydrophilicity this coating method has also been coated on the ptfe microfiltration membrane and explores its hydrophilicity and pure water flux 2 experimental section 2 1 materials the pvdf 0 22 μm and ptfe 0 22 μm microfiltration mf membranes were purchased from zhejiang delv china pg and tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris 99 9 were received from tianjin heowns biochemical technology co ltd hydrochloric acid hcl 36 38 and sulfuric acid h2so4 98 were received from beijing chemical plant co ltd kh792 95 tween 80 and oil red o were received from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd sodiumhydroxide naoh 99 dodecane dichloroethane were received from tianjin no 6 chemical reagent factory sodium chloride was purchased from tianjin benchmark chemical reagent co ltd soybean oil was purchased from local market all of the materials were used without purification 2 2 fabrication of the modified membranes the pristine pvdf membrane was immersed in isopropanol more than 25 min for removing impurities and distracting the pores took it out and rinsed it several times with deionized water then soaked it in water for 30 min to remove isopropanol different amounts of kh792 0 25 50 100 200 and 400 mg were put into 100 ml tris hcl buffer solution ph 8 5 50 mm then shaken it 10 min to dissolve it after that 200 mg pg was added to different concentrations of kh792 then the pre treated membrane was put into the mixed solution and shaken in a shaker at 25 c for 7 h finally the modified membrane was taken out and cleaned it several times air dried under room temperature for subsequent performance tests ptfe composite membrane was made in the same way table 1 lists the coating conditions of the membranes the specific possible reaction process is shown in fig 1 briefly two pg monomers were oxidized and polymerized together kh792 hydrolyzed and condensed into a long chain the amino groups of kh792 attacked quinone moieties which from the oxidation of pg and amino groups attacked benzoquinone moieties of michael addition reaction wavy bonds refer to similar structures of the omission of extended hybrid networks 2 3 characterizations the chemical structure of membranes was characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir bruker vertex70 and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi the water contact angle wca and underwater oil contact angle uoca were tested by a goniometer ca powereach jc 2000c each of membranes was measured five times and the final value was obtained by averaging the surface morphology of membrane was observed by scanning electron microscope sem fei nova nano sem 450 the element distribution of the membrane was determined by the supplementary energy dispersive x ray edx mapping instrument the roughness of membrane surface was received by atomic force microscopy afm veeco dimension 3100 with gwyddion software to deal with the data oil concentration was received by total organic carbon test toc hty ct 1000 m the droplet size of emulsions was tested by melvin 2000 laser particle size instrument mastersizer 2000 2 4 the performance of membrane dodecane and soybean oil were taken as examples to prepare surfactant free and surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsions generally 5 ml oil dodecane soybean oil and 500 ml deionized water were sonicated for 1 h to prepare surfactant free dodecane in water sfd and soybean oil in water sfs emulsions for surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsions 10 mg tween 80 5 ml oil dodecane soybean oil and 500 ml deionized water stir for 3 h under 1000 r min to prepare surfactant stabilized dodecane in water emulsion ssd and surfactant stabilized soybean oil in water emulsion sss the pure water and emulsions flux were tested by a vacuum filtration apparatus jinteng china under 0 09 mpa its effective area is 12 56 cm2 each membrane was measured three times respectively the pure water flux j and separation efficiency fs were calculated by equation eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 32 1 j v a t 2 f s 1 c p c f 100 where v is the permeate volume l a and t are the effective membrane area m2 and permeation time h respectively cp and cf are the concentration of oil in the permeate emulsion and feed emulsion the relative ratio of weight gain and the water uptake represent the parameters of relative deposition of modified membrane and the parameters wettability respectively the relative weight gains percentage wg and the weight uptake percentage wu were calculated by eq 4 and eq 5 respectively 4 33 3 w g w 1 w 0 w 0 100 4 w u w wet w dry w dry 100 where w1 and w0 is the modified membrane and pristine membrane weight g wwet is the wet membrane weight without excess water wdry is the dry membranes weight 2 5 stability tests the ssd was used for separation for 90 min the flux and the oil concentration of filtrate were determined every 30 min for testing the stability of the modified membrane properties the flux recovery rate and oil emulsions of sfd sfs ssd and sss was also determined each data was measured for three times and take their average value as final result the change of wca of the modified membrane was determined after 12 h at different ph and 5 m nacl the flux recovery rate frr were calculated with eq 5 5 f rr j f j 0 100 where jf and j0 is the pure water flux before and after the emulsion filtration respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 morphological characteristics of the membranes fig 2 shows the color change and surface variation of mf0 mf1 and mf4 membranes respectively according to the color contrast of the mf0 and mf1 membranes the color of the mf0 membrane is white fig 2a1 and the mf1 membrane shows the color of yellow fig 2b1 the sme images also could be found that some filamentous substances adhering to the membrane fig 2b2 3 which can be preliminarily judged that pg has been coated on pvdf membrane and this also indicates that pg has a certain adhesion on the membrane after being oxidized 34 after introducing kh792 the color of the membrane is slightly yellowish brown and a small amount of flocculent material could be found on the surface fig s1a b with the increase of kh792 the color of the membrane became dark brown and when it increased to 400 mg the color became almost black fig s1d in addition sem images can also observe the changes on the surface morphology of the membrane the original micro morphology of the pvdf membrane is porous its surface looks relatively smooth and the polymer material has sharp edge features fig 2a2 3 as the membrane modified by kh792 and pg some dispersed nanoparticles appearing on its surface which is related to the formation of bionic coatings and the hydrolysis of siloxane fig 2c2 3 35 the pore size of the modified membranes gradually decreasing the coating marks of polymer materials around the membrane pores is obvious and the surface become rough through sem image observation although the aperture of the mf4 membrane decreasing it also maintains a certain porosity in addition the distribution of kh792 and pg on the pvdf membrane was also investigated across the edx observation it could be found that o n and si elements were uniformly distributed on the mf4 membrane by comparing the cross section of mf0 and mf4 membranes the thickness of the modified membrane has increased from 87 69 μm to 92 40 μm fig 2e1 e2 it can be seen that the coating retains a certain thickness on the membrane the membrane roughness was tested by afm surface roughness and chemical composition are the important factors affecting wettability compared the afm images of mf0 and mf4 membranes the surface roughness parameters are 171 3 nm and 192 6 nm fig 2f1 2 respectively the larger roughness and functional groups including amino and hydroxyl are helpful to improve the hydrophilicity and the modified membrane is easier to capture water molecules and generate a barrier layer preventing oil droplets to contact the membrane surface thus improving its antifouling performance 3 2 the surface chemical structure of membranes fig 3 a shows the atr ftir spectroscopy of mf0 mf1 and mf4 membranes respectively two strong peaks appeared in 1178 and 869 cm 1 derived from the stretching vibration of cf and cc bond respectively as for pvdf pg membrane stretching vibration bond occurs between 1600 and 1500 cm 1 due to the benzene skeleton cc bond for pvdf pg kh792 membrane two absorption peaks are found at 1104 and 937 cm 1 that derived from the antisymmetric stretching vibration of siosi and symmetric stretching vibration of si oh nh bending vibrations and cn bonds are found at 1510 and 1608 cm 1 the broad stretching vibrations between 3600 and 3100 cm 1 derived from oh nh 36 to further explain the chemical composition and reaction of the modified membranes surface the membranes surface elements was examined by xps for the pristine membrane mf0 two peaks of c1s and f1s could be found the c1s peak could be split into two peaks corresponding to cc at 284 8 ev and cf at 290 2 ev the peaks of o 1s and n 1s are very weak it may be attributed to the addition of n and o elements preserved in the pristine commercial membrane itself for the modified membrane mf4 the peaks of n 1s and o 1s are significantly enhanced two new peaks appearing namely si 2p and si 2s the c1s peak could be split into csi at 283 9 ev co at 286 1 ev co at 288 0 ev cn at 285 7 ev and cn at 287 5 ev which suggest that michael addition and schiff reaction occur table 2 illustrates the element content percentages of mf0 and mf4 membranes 3 3 hydrophilicity of membranes the wettability of membrane surface importantly affects its permeability and antifouling performance the mf0 membrane shows a wca of 129 1 6 which reveals the intrinsic hydrophobic characteristic of it while pg was coated on mf1 membrane the hydrophilicity increasing and its wca decreases to 78 3 1 when the pristine membrane was decorated by kh792 and pg the wca further decreasing and it could be reduced to a minimum of 16 with the increase of kh792 a water droplet 50 μl was placed on the mf4 membrane the water droplet spread out rapidly on it within 10 s fig 4 f1 the improvement of surface wettability is mainly reflected in the increase of hydrophilic groups and surface roughness of pg and kh792 surface coatings which could improve its hydrophilicity the mf0 membrane pure water flux is 377 61 l m 2 h 1and the mf4 membrane could reach a maximum of 7166 272 l m 2 h 1 the water uptake of the mf4 also reaches to the maximum fig 4b d the obtained pure water flux and water uptake of the membranes follow the rule of increasing first and then decreasing while the relative weight gain of modified membranes keeps increasing with the increase of kh792 fig 4c all these indicating that too much pg and kh792 deposition will lead to the increase of membrane surface and polymer thickness and trigger the reduction of membrane pore size and even blockage therefore the mf4 membrane is taken as the optimal modified membrane in this study compared with other modified pvdf mf membranes with pore sizes of 0 22 μm the pvdf pg kh792 membrane has smaller wca or larger pure water flux table 3 the coating method applies not only to pvdf membrane can also be used for hydrophobic stronger ptfe membrane using the same coating method to modify the ptfe membrane a droplet water 50 μl was dripped on the modified membrane and the water spread out completely within 10 s fig 4f2 the water contact angle is significantly reduced and the pure water flux has also greatly increased fig 4e indicating that the modified membrane has excellent hydrophilicity and pure water flux which further demonstrates that this coating method has the potential of being applied to other membranes the uocas for the three oils dodicane dichloroethane soybean oil were tested all of their uocas are more than 150 fig 5 a indicating that they have a good underwater superhydrophobic performance for testing the underwater oil adhesion of the mf4 membrane dichloroethane was dropped onto the modified membrane in water it showed good resistance to oil adhesion all dichloroethane droplets quickly rolled off the membrane surface without attachment fig 5b and video s1 in contrast drops of dichloroethane were deposited on the pristine membrane and adhered to it although the membrane was raised at an angle fig 5b and video s2 it could be confirmed by the dynamic water oil attachment test fig 5c the oil drops remain round from falling to contact with the modified membrane to rising all these can directly prove that the modified membrane is not easy to be contaminated by oil droplets 3 4 separation of emulsions by the pvdf pg kh792 membrane a vacuum filter was used to conduct the oil water separation experiment under 0 09 mpa fig s2a the original sfd sfs ssd and sss were milky sfd and ssd had a wide droplet size distribution mainly between 0 5 37 μm and 0 6 82 μm respectively fig s4a b the droplet size distribution of sfs and sss emulsions mainly between 0 4 20 μm and 0 5 32 μm respectively fig s4c d after filtration the filtrates became clear and the presence of oil drops cannot be observed by observing the color of filtrate the modified membrane could be preliminarily judged to have higher oil water separation efficiency using inverted biological microscope to observe the distribution quantity of oil droplets before and after filtration it can be found that oil droplets in water before filtration were clearly visible while oil droplets could hardly be seen after filtration figs 6 a and s2b the separation efficiency of sfd sfs ssd and sss were all above 99 however there is a certain gap between the flux recovery rate of the emulsion with surfactant and without surfactant the pure water flux recovery rate of sfd and sfs were more than 90 while ssd and sss were only 89 and 78 respectively fig 6c this may be the emulsified oil droplets are coated with a surfactant and easily form a filter cake to prevent some of water from passing through the membrane 31 the flux of sfd sfs ssd and sss emulsions are 3083 266 2866 372 2238 170 and 1920 146 m 2 h 1 respectively fig 6b we took the sfd and sss emulsions as the examples to test the circulation and antifouling ability of the mf4 membrane after 3 cycle tests each cycle includes a 20 min separation test and a 10 min cleaning process their separation efficiencies were all more than 99 the sfd emulsion flux of the modified membrane decreased slightly fig 6d while the sss emulsion flux decreased a little severely than that of sfd emulsion fig s5 which may be related to the fact that the filter cake on the membrane surface and the high viscosity of the sss emulsion higher circulation separation efficiency and smaller reduction of the emulsion flux indicating that the modified membrane has good circulation and antifouling ability the color and morphology of the modified membrane hardly changed after the circulated membrane was washed in high velocity water for 1 h fig s3 3 5 stability evaluation the excellent hydrophilicity of the membrane is a key factor in oil water separation experiments we measured the wcas of the mf4 membrane at different ph values and high salt content fig 7 the membrane was tested at ph 1 3 5 7 9 and 5 m nacl for 12 h its wcas changes very little but when ph 12 the wca of the membrane increases to 110 2 6 it indicates that the modified membrane is unstable under strong alkaline environment and this maybe because schiff base is easily hydrolyzed under strong acidic and alkaline conditions but with the addition of kh792 the micro nanostructure layer was stable under strong acidic conditions thus preventing the hydrolysis of schiff base the si o bond of the nanostructured layer would be destroyed under strong alkaline conditions which caused the alkaline hydrolysis of schiff base 4 conclusions the modified pvdf mf membrane has excellent hydrophilicity and performance in oil water separation antifouling performance and separation circulation stability as their separation efficiencies were all more than 99 in addition the hydrophilicity was basically unchanged under the strong acidity and high salt conditions this coating method also has great potential value on other membranes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

every 30 min for testing the stability of the modified membrane properties the flux recovery rate and oil emulsions of sfd sfs ssd and sss was also determined each data was measured for three times and take their average value as final result the change of wca of the modified membrane was determined after 12 h at different ph and 5 m nacl the flux recovery rate frr were calculated with eq 5 5 f rr j f j 0 100 where jf and j0 is the pure water flux before and after the emulsion filtration respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 morphological characteristics of the membranes fig 2 shows the color change and surface variation of mf0 mf1 and mf4 membranes respectively according to the color contrast of the mf0 and mf1 membranes the color of the mf0 membrane is white fig 2a1 and the mf1 membrane shows the color of yellow fig 2b1 the sme images also could be found that some filamentous substances adhering to the membrane fig 2b2 3 which can be preliminarily judged that pg has been coated on pvdf membrane and this also indicates that pg has a certain adhesion on the membrane after being oxidized 34 after introducing kh792 the color of the membrane is slightly yellowish brown and a small amount of flocculent material could be found on the surface fig s1a b with the increase of kh792 the color of the membrane became dark brown and when it increased to 400 mg the color became almost black fig s1d in addition sem images can also observe the changes on the surface morphology of the membrane the original micro morphology of the pvdf membrane is porous its surface looks relatively smooth and the polymer material has sharp edge features fig 2a2 3 as the membrane modified by kh792 and pg some dispersed nanoparticles appearing on its surface which is related to the formation of bionic coatings and the hydrolysis of siloxane fig 2c2 3 35 the pore size of the modified membranes gradually decreasing the coating marks of polymer materials around the membrane pores is obvious and the surface become rough through sem image observation although the aperture of the mf4 membrane decreasing it also maintains a certain porosity in addition the distribution of kh792 and pg on the pvdf membrane was also investigated across the edx observation it could be found that o n and si elements were uniformly distributed on the mf4 membrane by comparing the cross section of mf0 and mf4 membranes the thickness of the modified membrane has increased from 87 69 μm to 92 40 μm fig 2e1 e2 it can be seen that the coating retains a certain thickness on the membrane the membrane roughness was tested by afm surface roughness and chemical composition are the important factors affecting wettability compared the afm images of mf0 and mf4 membranes the surface roughness parameters are 171 3 nm and 192 6 nm fig 2f1 2 respectively the larger roughness and functional groups including amino and hydroxyl are helpful to improve the hydrophilicity and the modified membrane is easier to capture water molecules and generate a barrier layer preventing oil droplets to contact the membrane surface thus improving its antifouling performance 3 2 the surface chemical structure of membranes fig 3 a shows the atr ftir spectroscopy of mf0 mf1 and mf4 membranes respectively two strong peaks appeared in 1178 and 869 cm 1 derived from the stretching vibration of cf and cc bond respectively as for pvdf pg membrane stretching vibration bond occurs between 1600 and 1500 cm 1 due to the benzene skeleton cc bond for pvdf pg kh792 membrane two absorption peaks are found at 1104 and 937 cm 1 that derived from the antisymmetric stretching vibration of siosi and symmetric stretching vibration of si oh nh bending vibrations and cn bonds are found at 1510 and 1608 cm 1 the broad stretching vibrations between 3600 and 3100 cm 1 derived from oh nh 36 to further explain the chemical composition and reaction of the modified membranes surface the membranes surface elements was examined by xps for the pristine membrane mf0 two peaks of c1s and f1s could be found the c1s peak could be split into two peaks corresponding to cc at 284 8 ev and cf at 290 2 ev the peaks of o 1s and n 1s are very weak it may be attributed to the addition of n and o elements preserved in the pristine commercial membrane itself for the modified membrane mf4 the peaks of n 1s and o 1s are significantly enhanced two new peaks appearing namely si 2p and si 2s the c1s peak could be split into csi at 283 9 ev co at 286 1 ev co at 288 0 ev cn at 285 7 ev and cn at 287 5 ev which suggest that michael addition and schiff reaction occur table 2 illustrates the element content percentages of mf0 and mf4 membranes 3 3 hydrophilicity of membranes the wettability of membrane surface importantly affects its permeability and antifouling performance the mf0 membrane shows a wca of 129 1 6 which reveals the intrinsic hydrophobic characteristic of it while pg was coated on mf1 membrane the hydrophilicity increasing and its wca decreases to 78 3 1 when the pristine membrane was decorated by kh792 and pg the wca further decreasing and it could be reduced to a minimum of 16 with the increase of kh792 a water droplet 50 μl was placed on the mf4 membrane the water droplet spread out rapidly on it within 10 s fig 4 f1 the improvement of surface wettability is mainly reflected in the increase of hydrophilic groups and surface roughness of pg and kh792 surface coatings which could improve its hydrophilicity the mf0 membrane pure water flux is 377 61 l m 2 h 1and the mf4 membrane could reach a maximum of 7166 272 l m 2 h 1 the water uptake of the mf4 also reaches to the maximum fig 4b d the obtained pure water flux and water uptake of the membranes follow the rule of increasing first and then decreasing while the relative weight gain of modified membranes keeps increasing with the increase of kh792 fig 4c all these indicating that too much pg and kh792 deposition will lead to the increase of membrane surface and polymer thickness and trigger the reduction of membrane pore size and even blockage therefore the mf4 membrane is taken as the optimal modified membrane in this study compared with other modified pvdf mf membranes with pore sizes of 0 22 μm the pvdf pg kh792 membrane has smaller wca or larger pure water flux table 3 the coating method applies not only to pvdf membrane can also be used for hydrophobic stronger ptfe membrane using the same coating method to modify the ptfe membrane a droplet water 50 μl was dripped on the modified membrane and the water spread out completely within 10 s fig 4f2 the water contact angle is significantly reduced and the pure water flux has also greatly increased fig 4e indicating that the modified membrane has excellent hydrophilicity and pure water flux which further demonstrates that this coating method has the potential of being applied to other membranes the uocas for the three oils dodicane dichloroethane soybean oil were tested all of their uocas are more than 150 fig 5 a indicating that they have a good underwater superhydrophobic performance for testing the underwater oil adhesion of the mf4 membrane dichloroethane was dropped onto the modified membrane in water it showed good resistance to oil adhesion all dichloroethane droplets quickly rolled off the membrane surface without attachment fig 5b and video s1 in contrast drops of dichloroethane were deposited on the pristine membrane and adhered to it although the membrane was raised at an angle fig 5b and video s2 it could be confirmed by the dynamic water oil attachment test fig 5c the oil drops remain round from falling to contact with the modified membrane to rising all these can directly prove that the modified membrane is not easy to be contaminated by oil droplets 3 4 separation of emulsions by the pvdf pg kh792 membrane a vacuum filter was used to conduct the oil water separation experiment under 0 09 mpa fig s2a the original sfd sfs ssd and sss were milky sfd and ssd had a wide droplet size distribution mainly between 0 5 37 μm and 0 6 82 μm respectively fig s4a b the droplet size distribution of sfs and sss emulsions mainly between 0 4 20 μm and 0 5 32 μm respectively fig s4c d after filtration the filtrates became clear and the presence of oil drops cannot be observed by observing the color of filtrate the modified membrane could be preliminarily judged to have higher oil water separation efficiency using inverted biological microscope to observe the distribution quantity of oil droplets before and after filtration it can be found that oil droplets in water before filtration were clearly visible while oil droplets could hardly be seen after filtration figs 6 a and s2b the separation efficiency of sfd sfs ssd and sss were all above 99 however there is a certain gap between the flux recovery rate of the emulsion with surfactant and without surfactant the pure water flux recovery rate of sfd and sfs were more than 90 while ssd and sss were only 89 and 78 respectively fig 6c this may be the emulsified oil droplets are coated with a surfactant and easily form a filter cake to prevent some of water from passing through the membrane 31 the flux of sfd sfs ssd and sss emulsions are 3083 266 2866 372 2238 170 and 1920 146 m 2 h 1 respectively fig 6b we took the sfd and sss emulsions as the examples to test the circulation and antifouling ability of the mf4 membrane after 3 cycle tests each cycle includes a 20 min separation test and a 10 min cleaning process their separation efficiencies were all more than 99 the sfd emulsion flux of the modified membrane decreased slightly fig 6d while the sss emulsion flux decreased a little severely than that of sfd emulsion fig s5 which may be related to the fact that the filter cake on the membrane surface and the high viscosity of the sss emulsion higher circulation separation efficiency and smaller reduction of the emulsion flux indicating that the modified membrane has good circulation and antifouling ability the color and morphology of the modified membrane hardly changed after the circulated membrane was washed in high velocity water for 1 h fig s3 3 5 stability evaluation the excellent hydrophilicity of the membrane is a key factor in oil water separation experiments we measured the wcas of the mf4 membrane at different ph values and high salt content fig 7 the membrane was tested at ph 1 3 5 7 9 and 5 m nacl for 12 h its wcas changes very little but when ph 12 the wca of the membrane increases to 110 2 6 it indicates that the modified membrane is unstable under strong alkaline environment and this maybe because schiff base is easily hydrolyzed under strong acidic and alkaline conditions but with the addition of kh792 the micro nanostructure layer was stable under strong acidic conditions thus preventing the hydrolysis of schiff base the si o bond of the nanostructured layer would be destroyed under strong alkaline conditions which caused the alkaline hydrolysis of schiff base 4 conclusions the modified pvdf mf membrane has excellent hydrophilicity and performance in oil water separation antifouling performance and separation circulation stability as their separation efficiencies were all more than 99 in addition the hydrophilicity was basically unchanged under the strong acidity and high salt conditions this coating method also has great potential value on other membranes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
