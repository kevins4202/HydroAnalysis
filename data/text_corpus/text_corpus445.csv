2225,urban flooding is a serious challenge in cities owing to global warming and rapid urbanization thus urban flood forecasting is required to reduce losses nevertheless owing to the randomness and uncertainty of rainfall and ponding processes providing accurate and stable ponding predictions using the existing prediction methods is difficult to address these issues this study proposes a time varying criterion to improve the bayesian model averaging bma method and uses the time varying bma tv bma approach to develop an integrated model for predicting urban floods and providing early warning by dynamically coupling the results of the bma and three machine learning models this integrated model was based on numerous measured data on rainfall and ponding processes aiming to accurately predict real time changes in ponding depth the results show that the prediction accuracy of the tv bma model was 11 4 50 4 higher than that of the bma and individual models and within the 95 confidence interval moreover the bandwidth of the tv bma model 0 038 m was 19 1 53 1 lower than that of the bma 0 047 m and individual models 0 063 0 081 m this demonstrates that the tv bma model has significant advantages in correcting deviation and reducing uncertainty in the prediction results furthermore the tv bma model has high accuracy in the early warning results for up to a 100 min forecast period f score 0 8 the proposed tv bma model can predict urban floods with improved accuracy and stability it may provide guidance for improving the existing urban flood prediction methods keywords urban flood flood prediction bayesian model averaging ponding data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in recent years urban flood disasters have occurred frequently worldwide such as the houston floods in the united states in 2017 rio floods in brazil in 2019 and zhengzhou floods in china in 2021 these flooding events have caused substantial property losses and casualties and have become one of the major challenges faced by metropolises globally nguyen and bae 2020 recent studies have demonstrated that cities face increasingly severe flood disaster risks in the future owing to global warming and urbanization li et al 2022 winsemius et al 2016 therefore an accurate and stable prediction method must be developed to support water resource management in minimizing life and property losses many methods have been developed to simulate and predict urban floods for example numerical models based on physical mechanisms are widely used in urban flood simulation mignot and dewals 2022 urban drainage facility optimization wang et al 2022 and urban flood risk assessment rafiei sardooi et al 2021 however owing to the complexity of the system an accurate simulation of the physical process is challenging yin et al 2021 additionally these numerical models based on physical mechanisms often have high computational costs therefore machine learning approaches based on data driven methods have been applied machine learning methods can capture the nonlinear relationship between the driving variables and ponding process at a low computational cost researchers have used various machine learning methods in urban flood modeling including support vector machines díaz vico et al 2020 gradient boosting decision trees gbdt wu et al 2020a and neural networks chang et al 2014 although machine learning methods are widely used for urban floods they are not universally superior in particular one model may serve well for one flood event and perform poorly for other flood events therefore this uncertainty may cause a significant deviation in ponding prediction based on a single model liu and merwade 2018 to overcome this problem this study proposes a robust integrated ponding prediction model based on machine learning to quantify the model uncertainty in predicting the ponding process and improve the accuracy and reliability of the model a common approach for dealing with model uncertainty and improving prediction accuracy is model averaging which extracts information from all benchmark models candidate models for the integrated model to provide more robust predictions sun et al 2021 the current model averaging methods include simple model averaging sma weighted model averaging wma multi model super ensemble mmse and bayesian model averaging bma ajami et al 2006 liu and merwade 2018 najafi and moradkhani 2015 bma is one of the most common and widely used methods to generate reliable predictions by synthesizing several models li et al 2017 liu and merwade 2019 madadgar and moradkhani 2014 which have been widely used in meteorology kazeem bello and lanre ibrahim 2022 environmental study zhou et al 2020 and hydrology liu and merwade 2018 the bma method is advantageous because it provides a weighted average prediction of the variable and obtains a prediction distribution reflecting the uncertainty of the model liu and merwade 2019 thus the integrated prediction of urban floods using bma has received extensive attention from scholars bermúdez et al 2018 liu and merwade 2018 notaro et al 2016 however many scholars acknowledge that because the coefficients of the explanatory variables of the bma are fixed at each time node the method may have a large loss of accuracy during local real time prediction sun et al 2021 for example the optimal explanatory variables may exhibit significant differences at different time nodes in predicting the ponding process therefore although the fixed explanatory variable coefficient improves the overall prediction performance of the model to a certain extent the optimal predictive variables may change during the local real time prediction this change causes a significant loss in the local prediction accuracy additionally if the prediction results of the benchmark models are distributed across the same region as the measured values at some time nodes the bma model may reduce the prediction accuracy of the benchmark models thus using the bma model to predict the urban ponding process accurately is challenging therefore based on a machine learning approach this study aims to dynamically adjust the explanatory variable coefficients of the bma model at each time node during the ponding process to minimize the statistical deviation of the final model it can provide a more robust and accurate ponding prediction which is a contribution of this study additionally based on the measured data on the rainfall and ponding processes this study constructed an urban flood prediction model with water depth as the benchmark this has been rarely reported in data driven urban flood prediction research the main objective of this study is to propose a dynamic integrated prediction model coupled with machine learning using an improved bma to solve the local accuracy loss caused by the fixed explanatory variable coefficients of the bma a time varying criterion of coupling model selection and model average was proposed in particular by considering the absolute error in the prediction results of the benchmark models at each time node as the basis for the weighted average distribution this method accounts for the lacking time varying coefficients from bma by iteratively solves the weighted average of the benchmark models at each time node another challenge in ponding prediction is that the difference in rainfall patterns may cause uncertainties in model prediction for example although the time varying criterion provides time varying coefficients the model weighted average remains unchanged for different types of rainfall events which may introduce some uncertainty to the prediction results to reduce the impact of different rainfall patterns on the integrated prediction model this study proposed a ponding prediction modeling framework for different rainfall types the framework identifies the main categories of rainfall patterns through cluster analysis and constructs a time varying bma tv bma model based on time varying coefficients for different rainfall patterns this model can achieve a robust prediction for different rainfall types 2 method 2 1 research framework owing to the complexity of urban systems and uncertainty of rainfall and ponding processes achieving accurate and stable inundation process prediction and early warning using a single model is challenging additionally when using the multi model method to predict urban flooding few studies have considered the impact of rainfall patterns on the model performance therefore this study proposes an integrated urban flood prediction model that uses an improved bma algorithm with a time varying criterion first cluster analysis and the mann kendall test were used to determine the rainfall patterns in the study area second several machine learning and bma methods were used to construct the urban flooding prediction model which was used as the benchmark models for the tv bma model accordingly an improved bma model using a time varying criterion was proposed the tv bma model must derive the weighted average of the benchmark models at each time node the prediction results of the tv bma model can then be obtained using the weighted average a flowchart of the research framework is shown in fig 1 2 2 rainfall pattern classification and identification method the classification of rainfall patterns is a time series classification problem compared with the euclidean distance the distance of dynamic time warping dtw can better capture the similarity of rainfall patterns of different time series giorgino 2009 therefore dtw distance was selected to determine the similarity between the two time series for the classification of rainfall patterns for the considered time series q q 1 q 2 q x rainfall dataset m is first determined as the initial clustering number and then m is randomly selected as the initial cluster center accordingly the dtw distance from each rainfall sequence to the cluster center was calculated and the samples were divided into categories closer to this cluster center 1 z 0 z 1 0 z 2 0 z m 0 2 p arg min t 1 t d q i c j 2 n t 2 n 1 where z 0 refers to the randomly selected m initial cluster centers z m 0 refers to the initially determined mth cluster center p is the dtw distance and d q i c j is the euclidean distance of the ith sample in time series q and the jth sample in time series c second the new cluster center was determined according to the average value of the dtw distance in each category and the difference in dtw distance between the old and new cluster centers was calculated if the value is less than the threshold value of the cluster center it must be adjusted the threshold refers to the allowable difference between the dtw distance of the old and new cluster centers and it was set to 0 001 in this study this indicates that the adjusted cluster center did not significantly reduce the dtw distance and end the iteration otherwise the aforementioned process was repeated finally the cluster centers corresponding to different m values were determined by repeating the clustering process by continuously changing the number of cluster centers m the mann kendall test a common mutation point test method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the sequential test statistics data in terms of u b m and u f m values the mann kendall test can analyze the presence of a mutation point and the occurrence time of the mutation point at the significance level of where u b m u f m the calculation equation for u f m is as follows 3 u f m s m e s m var s m m 1 2 m 4 s m i 1 m r i r i 1 s s e i s s e j 0 e l s e j 1 2 i 5 sse j 1 m i 1 n d x i z j x i c j where sse i refers to the sum of the squared errors when the number of clusters is i sse j refers to the sum of squared errors when the number of clusters is j e s m and var s m are the mean and variance of s m respectively z j refers to the jth cluster center x i refers to the ith sample in the jth category n refers to the number of samples in the jth category and c j represents the jth category based on the results of cluster analysis and the mann kendall test the patterns of actual rainfall events can be identified by calculating the degree of approximation em between the actual rainfall and these m rainfall patterns 6 e m 1 1 n i 1 n u ki x i 2 n 5 where u ki refers to the process of k rainfall patterns obtained by cluster analysis and the mann kendall test and x i refers to the actual rainfall process the smaller the e m the higher is the approximation of the actual rainfall to the rainfall pattern 2 3 applied machine learning method machine learning can deal with complex systems with large amounts of data and can be used for prediction and classification mosavi et al 2018 nevertheless appropriate methods must be selected to solve special problems and not all types of machine learning methods are suitable for predicting local urban flooding for example convolutional neural networks cnn and gated recurrent units gru are commonly applied deep learning methods however cnn are primarily used to identify spatial data he et al 2015 and gru are primarily used to obtain time series gao et al 2020 therefore the non stationary nonlinear and aperiodic characteristics of the data on the rainfall and inundation processes is evident moreover according to the characteristics and applicable conditions of various methods three commonly used types of machine learning methods support vector regression svr back propagation neural network bpnn and gbdt were selected as the basic learning algorithms for local urban flooding prediction as a supervised machine learning method svr has the outstanding advantages of strong learning and anti interference abilities under limited sample information shivaswamy et al 2007 because rainfall and ponding data are often limited the svr model is suitable for urban flood prediction modeling a bpnn is a variant of artificial neural network guha et al 2022 compared with other machine learning methods neural networks are remarkably advanced as that they can deal with complex relationships learn and make intelligent decisions through multiple layers lecun et al 2015 therefore the bpnn can explore the potential relationship between the rainfall and ponding processes and its application in flood forecasting shows excellent results elsafi 2014 guha et al 2022 gbdt is an integrated learning method that generates an integrated decision tree and has a gradient boosting algorithm jerome 2001 its advantages include relatively small model parameters strong robustness to outliers and reliable prediction results for small samples gu et al 2021 thus the gbdt model can effectively deal with non stationary rainfall and inundation process data recent research has shown that the gbdt has a favorable effect on urban flood prediction wu et al 2020b the aforementioned machine learning methods svr bpnn and gbdt have different individual data processing ability model stability and data mining characteristics and have shown remarkable results in previous studies on flood forecasting therefore these three were determined as benchmark models in the tv bma modeling framework the construction process of the local urban flooding prediction model using these specific machine learning methods have been described in detail in rafiei sardooi et al 2021 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b 2 3 1 svr svr is a supervised machine learning algorithm the key purpose of svr is to determine the optimal hyperplane using a kernel function to map the data to a feature space from high to infinite dimensions this aims to minimize the total deviation between all training samples and this hyperplane surface díaz vico et al 2020 svr allows for some deviation ε between the model output f x and actual value y when the deviation between f x and y was greater than ε the loss was calculated fig 2 the regression model corresponding to the optimal hyperplane of svr is f x w t x b where w and b are the model parameters to be determined when solving the svr model the data are mapped to a new feature space and the lagrange function is introduced to estimate the model parameters w and b the modeling process of the svr model has been described by haoyuan et al 2022 2 3 2 bpnn the bpnn is a multilayer feedforward neural network trained according to the back propagation algorithm of the error the algorithm is composed of input output and hidden layers fig 3 and has been widely applied in prediction methods in various scientific fields chen et al 2022 jianjin et al 2017 the bpnn contains the forward propagation of the input signal rainfall data and back propagation of the error mean square error mse between the output and actual values in the forward propagation stage by providing examples to the neurons of the input layer the signal is transmitted forward layerwise until the result of the output layer is generated then the mse between the output value of the neuron and the actual value is calculated if the error cannot satisfy the set accuracy requirements reverse processing is required in the back propagation stage according to the mse of the output layer the gradient descent algorithm was used to calculate the negative gradient between the error of the output layer and the connection weighted average and threshold values to update these values between the connection layers wang et al 2017 2 3 3 gbdt regression the gbdt is an integrated learning algorithm that is composed of multiple decision trees jerome 2001 it can be used for regression and classification purposes the gbdt uses regression trees for regression tasks and can learn iteratively based on the residuals of the previous regression tree the final output model was obtained by superimposing the regression tree for each iteration fig 4 it integrates the advantages of the decision tree and gradient boosting algorithm which has proven to be an efficient high precision and low deviation model in many practical applications gu et al 2021 2 4 construction of the bma model the bma is a statistical processing method for probabilistic prediction using multiple models that can combine the estimates of individual models to produce reliable predictions bma is not limited to selecting the best model but considers the prediction ability of all selected models during training to the weighted average prediction assuming that y is the prediction variable water depth the bma derives the posterior distribution of the prediction variable from the measured ponding data and the results of the three basic learning algorithms the main calculation process of predicting local urban flooding using the bma is as follows 7 p y d k 1 k p f k d p k y f k d k 3 8 e y d k 1 k p f k d e p k y f k d k 1 k ω k f k 9 var y d k 1 k f k k 1 k ω i f i 2 k 1 k ω k f k where p y d is the probability density function of the prediction variables d is the measurement of local urban flooding data f k is the simulation results of the kth benchmark model e y d and var y d refer to the expectation and variance of the bma model respectively and ω k and σ k 2 refer to the weighted average and variance of the kth benchmark model k 1 k ω k 1 respectively ω k and σ k 2 are the parameters to be solved in the bma model to estimate the weighted average and variance the log likelihood function can be expressed as 10 l ω 1 ω 2 ω k σ 2 log k 1 k ω k p k y f k d to analytically solve this likelihood function the expectation maximization em algorithm is used to determine the maximum likelihood through repeated iterations via two steps expectation and maximization raftery et al 2005 a complete mathematical description of the execution of the em algorithm can be found in liu and merwade 2018 yang et al 2021 thus the prediction results of the bma model can be easily obtained based on the weighted average values obtained by the em algorithm and prediction results of the svr bpnn and gbdt models although bma can integrate multiple models to provide robust prediction because the weighted average it derives for an individual model remains unchanged it may produce large deviations and uncertainties in local or few period predictions additionally if the prediction results of all the models are overestimated or underestimated in the local prediction the model selection method can be more effective than the model averaging method therefore the tv bma method was used to address these issues 2 5 construction of the tv bma model based on the results of the three common machine learning models and the bma model the time varying criterion was used to construct the tv bma model this method aimed to achieve the integrated prediction of the inundation process at each time node the proposed time varying criterion includes two key steps the first step is to distinguish the integrated prediction approach at each time node if the value of the discrimination function equation 11 at time t 0 the model selection approach was used to predict the inundation process in contrast the model average approach was used to predict the inundation process second according to the comprehensive prediction approach determined at each time node the integrated prediction results at each time node were derived to minimize the local error 11 f t model a v e r a g e x t m y t x t n y t 0 m n n m o d e l s e l e c t i o n e l s e where f t is the discriminant function at time t x t m is the prediction result at time t for the mth event y t is the measured value at time t and x t n is the prediction result at time t for the nth event n refers to the number of rainfall events used for the integrated prediction the purpose of using the model selection approach for predicting the inundation process is to select the model with the best performance based on the performance of each model at time t when using the model selection approach for inundation process prediction the sum of the squared errors sse was selected as the objective function and the result with the lowest sse was considered as the result of the integrated prediction at time t 12 r t k x t k y t 2 k 1 2 3 4 13 k t f min r t 1 r t 2 r t k 14 x t x t k k k t where x t k is the predicted value of the kth model at time t y t is the measured value at time t r t k is the error square of the kth model at time t k t is the model with the lowest error square at time t and x t is the integrated prediction result at time t the objective of using the model average approach for predicting the inundation process is to provide the best weighted average according to the prediction characteristics of each model and reduce the deviation of the integrated prediction results first assuming that the prediction results of each benchmark model follow the gaussian distribution equation 15 the initial weighted average and estimated values were determined by using the sse of each model during the iteration process the weighted average of each model was repeatedly adjusted using the deviation between the estimated and real values until the deviation met the requirements finally the weighted average of the final iteration was used to calculate the integrated prediction results the algorithm is specified as follows 1 the assumption made was 15 x t k n x t k σ t k where x t k and σ t k are the mean and variance of the predicted value of the kth model at time t respectively 2 the initial weighted average ω t k 0 of each model at time t was evaluated as 16 ω t k 0 ss e t k 1 k 1 k ss e t k 1 3 the initial estimate x t 0 and deviation ε 0 were calculated 17 x t 0 k 1 k ω t k 0 x t k 18 ε 0 x t 0 y t 4 the weighted average of each model was adjusted 19 ω t k 1 min ω t k 0 ε 0 2 k 1 k ss e t k x t k 0 y t 0 max ω t k 0 ε 0 2 k 1 k ss e t k x t k 0 y t 0 5 steps 2 and 3 were repeated and the iteration was stopped when ε n ε n 1 0 subsequently the weighted average of the last iteration was returned and the integrated prediction result x t at time t was calculated 20 ω t k n ω t 1 n ω t 2 n ω t k n k 4 21 x t k 1 k ω t k n x t k the aforementioned steps were repeated to obtain the integrated prediction values of the coupling model selection and the model average at all times similarly for all rainfall patterns these steps were repeated to obtain the weighted average and integrated prediction results for different types of rainfall events 2 6 analysis of model performance the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model the smaller the mae and rmse values the higher is the model accuracy the closer the nse is to 1 the better is the model performance 22 mae i 1 n x i y i n 23 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n 24 nse 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i is the predicted value y i is the measured value y is the mean value of the measured value and n is the number of samples used to calculate model performance the uncertainty of the prediction results is a crucial factor in evaluating the performance of the model to analyze the stability of the prediction results of each model the monte carlo random sampling method was used to determine the uncertainty interval of each model at α 0 05 the monte carlo method was also used to calculate the uncertainty interval of the bma model at any time t first according to the weight ω 1 ω 2 ω k of each benchmark model an integer was randomly generated between 1 2 k to select the model then the probability distribution of the kth model at any time t was used to randomly generate a ponding depth value the aforementioned steps were repeated m times where m refers to the sampling times and the m samples were sorted according to their size the 95 confidence interval was part of the quantile between 2 5 and 97 5 the monte carlo method performs mass sampling and obtains a gradual approximation when the sampling times of this method were sufficiently large the results gradually approached the actual value therefore the sampling time for each time node was determined as 10 000 to derive the 95 confidence interval of the bma model the uncertainty of the other model was also calculated using the monte carlo method and the sampling times were set to 10000 bandwidth b and coverage rate cr were used to evaluate the uncertainty of the model the narrower the value of b the higher is the cr indicating a smaller uncertainty of the model additionally precision recall and f score were used to evaluate the performance of the model to provide early warning precision is the proportion of true positive samples in the prediction samples and recall refers to the proportion of true positive samples among all positive samples faceli et al 2011 the f score combines precision and recall and can comprehensively reflect the performance of early warning results the closer the f score is to 1 the higher is the accuracy of the results 25 pr e c i s i o n tp tp f p 26 re c a l l tp tp f n 27 f s core 2 pr e c i s o n re c a l l pr e c i s o n re c a l l where tp and fp indicate the true positive and false positive samples in the prediction samples respectively and fn indicates the false negative samples 3 case study 3 1 study area a 1008 km2 urban area 34 16 34 58 n 112 42 114 14 e in zhengzhou city china was selected for this study fig 5 historical records indicate that the average annual precipitation is 639 5 mm in this area however the annual precipitation distribution is extremely uneven precipitation during the flood season from june to september accounts for approximately 60 of the annual precipitation additionally historical records indicate that serious flood disasters have occurred in this area in 2018 2019 and 2021 especially the extreme rainfall event on july 20 2021 which led to 380 deaths and economic losses of 6 32 billion dollars therefore urban flood disasters have become a major problem affecting the sustainable development of zhengzhou city 3 2 data the urban flood prediction model proposed in this study primarily adopts measured rainfall flooding and rainfall forecasting data the rainfall data of 66 rainfall events from 2008 to 2021 were used for cluster analysis of the rainfall pattern the rainfall data of 21 rainfall events from 2016 to 2019 were selected as the sample data for the tv bma model of which four rainfall events with different rainfall patterns were used as the validation data and the remaining 17 rainfall data were used as the training data additionally the rainfall event on august 7 2020 was used to verify the early warning performance of the model the data applied are described as follows 1 rainfall data rainfall data from 2008 to 2021 were obtained from the meteorological department in zhengzhou city rainfall data were recorded at 16 automatic rainfall monitoring stations which had a temporal resolution of 10 min in the cluster analysis of rainfall patterns rainfall data from 16 rainfall stations were selected as sample data to consider the impact of rainfall spatial distribution therefore although the number of rainfall events used for this cluster analysis was 66 the actual number of sample data points used was 1056 during the construction of flood prediction model the kriging method of spatial interpolation was adopted to interpolate the rainfall data of 16 rainfall stations and obtain the rainfall data at each ponding point 2 flooding data the flooding data at 27 ponding points obtained using ponding monitoring equipment were provided by the urban management department of zhengzhou city the 27 ponding points included areas that were prone to ponding in previous urban flood events according to the statistics of the zhengzhou urban management department the ponding data had a temporal resolution of 1 min the temporal resolution of the ponding data was adjusted to 10 min to match that of the measured rainfall data 3 rainfall forecasting data the rolling rainfall forecasting data for august 7 2020 were obtained from beijing caiche quming technology co ltd a meteorological technology company that can provide abundant meteorological data including real time rainfall forecasting data it has a temporal resolution of 1 min spatial resolution of 1 km and lead forecast time of 120 min similarly the temporal resolution of the rainfall forecasting data was adjusted to 10 min to match the temporal resolution of the historical rainfall and ponding data 4 results 4 1 rainfall pattern clustering results historical records indicate that the rainfall events in zhengzhou are mostly short term rainfall events of 1 5 h therefore rainfall events with a duration of 5 h were selected as cluster sample events for rainfall events with a duration of 5 h the sliding pane method with a 5 h pane length was used to select the data with the largest rainfall as the sample data on this basis 1056 samples of 66 rainfall events from 2008 to 2021 were selected for cluster analysis according to the similarity of rainfall patterns the dtw and k means algorithms were used to cluster the rainfall patterns and the optimal clustering results were obtained using the mann kendall test as shown in fig 6 at α 0 05 and have intersection points near k 4 indicating a significant change when the number of clusters is four therefore the rainfall patterns in zhengzhou city were classified into four categories fig 7 and table 1 show the characteristics of the four rainfall patterns in zhengzhou city the fourth type of rainfall is clearly the rainfall pattern with the highest frequency the characteristics of this type of rainfall were that the time distribution was relatively uniform total precipitation was small and the risk of ponding was low however low risk does not imply no risk the frequency of ponding in the fourth rainfall pattern was 0 08 indicating that equally distributed rainfall events with high precipitation may also have formed ponding in contrast the characteristics of the first and second types of rainfall were that the time distribution was uneven the total precipitation was high and a large amount of rainfall occurred which rapidly transformed to surface runoff therefore although the frequency of these two types of rainfall was low the risk of ponding was high urban flood control should focus on this type of rainfall event 4 2 results of the tv bma model the key step in the tv bma model is to derive the weighted average of the benchmark models svr bpnn gbdt and bma therefore eight rainfall events with different rainfall patterns were selected to determine the weighted average of the benchmark models to construct an integrated prediction model with time varying weighted average values first the four rainfall events were input into three commonly used machine learning models svr bpnn and gbdt to obtain the prediction results and then the bma algorithm was used to couple the three models to obtain the prediction results of the bma model by combining these four models with time varying criteria the integrated prediction results of the tv bma model were obtained as shown in fig 8 the weighted average distribution of the benchmark models showed significant differences for different types of rainfall events for example the weighted average of the bma model was higher than that of the other benchmark models for the first rainfall pattern however for the third rainfall pattern the weighted average of the gbdt model was higher than that of the other benchmark models during the early and middle stages of the inundation process this difference indicates the necessity of constructing an integrated prediction model for different rainfall patterns additionally the weighted average of the benchmark models showed considerable uncertainty at different stages of the inundation process for example for the first rainfall pattern the gbdt model exhibited the highest weighted average during the early stage of the inundation process and the bma model exhibited the highest weighted average during the middle stage however during the end stage of the inundation process the three individual models showed the same weighted average which was higher than that of the bma model owing to this uncertainty the bma model may exhibit large deviations in some moment predictions even though it integrates the results of different models this uncertainty demonstrates that a time varying criterion must be used to determine the dynamic weighted average of the bma table 2 lists the computational efficiency and model accuracy of the benchmark and tv bma models the running time of an individual model svr bpnn and gbdt was shorter showing a higher computational efficiency and the svr model had the highest computational efficiency in contrast the running times of the bma and tv bma models were longer the reason for this result is that bma and tv bma must combine the individual models to construct the integrated model which increases the complexity of the integrated model in terms of model calibration accuracy the nse of the svr bpnn and gbdt models were above 0 97 indicating that these three benchmark models better captured the potential relationship between the rainfall and ponding processes in terms of validating modeling accuracy the nse of each model was between 0 94 and 0 99 the relative error re of the maximum ponding depth of each model was between 6 5 and 8 5 and the mae was not 0 035 m this indicates that each model had a favorable effect on ponding prediction one reason for the high prediction performance of each model was that reliable data on the rainfall and ponding processes were obtained before modeling including ponding process data recorded by ponding monitoring equipment and historical rainfall data recorded by automatic rainfall monitoring stations these reliable data form an important basis for the model to obtain better results another reason may be that the urban flood prediction models were constructed for each rainfall pattern which decreased the influence of uncertainties in rainfall information on the model performance additionally the prediction accuracy of the tv bma model was 11 4 50 4 higher than that of the four benchmark models which was unexpected therefore although the computational efficiency of the tv bma model is lower than that of the benchmark models the improvement in the model accuracy is significant thus the running time of the tv bma model 5 21 s hardly affects the timeliness of prediction for preventing urban flood providing early warning and implementing relevant rescue measures whereas the improvement in accuracy is significant for effective urban flood prevention and control 4 3 prediction characteristics of the tv bma and four benchmark models to analyze the prediction performance of the tv bma and each benchmark model the prediction characteristics of these models were determined for different water depths and different stages of the inundation process based on the validation results fig 9 shows the prediction characteristics of the tv bma and each benchmark model in terms of water depth the prediction accuracy of the tv bma and each benchmark model gradually increased with increasing water depth among these the tv bma model showed the highest prediction accuracy only a few prediction results in the tv bma model were outside the 20 error band and when the water depth exceeded 0 2 m all the prediction results were within the 20 error band in contrast approximately 30 of the prediction results in the svr model appeared outside the 20 error band indicating the lowest accuracy of the svr model however the four benchmark models overestimated the prediction results among which the overestimation by the bpnn and gbdt models are evident because most of the prediction results of these two models are distributed above the 45 straight line this overestimation may be due to two reasons first the training data may not be sufficient which leads to deviations in the model when capturing the potential relationship between the input and output variables second the control of ponding points changed the hydrological process of some these points if the model training samples do not include the ponding events after control the ponding degree during the validation process may be overestimated in the future through continuous accumulation of data and addition of the latest flood events sufficient training samples may be generated which may solve the problem of model overestimation however the prediction results of tv bma model are evenly distributed on both sides of the 45 straight line which demonstrates that the tv bma model reduces the overestimation error of the benchmark models to a certain extent therefore compared with the benchmark models the tv bma model not only shows the highest prediction effect but also corrects the deviation of the predicted results of the benchmark models fig 10 shows the prediction characteristics of the benchmark and tv bma models at different stages of the inundation process the range of absolute error ae values of the benchmark and tv bma models in t1 and t5 the first and last 10 periods of the inundation process respectively are larger than those in the other stages and that in t3 the stage when the water depth reaches peak value is lower this finding demonstrates that these models have more stable prediction performance for severe ponding additionally compared with the individual models the bma and tv bma models have relatively small ranges of ae values this indicates that the bma and tv bma models significantly reduce the uncertainty of the prediction results notably the tv bma model not only shows lower mae than the four benchmark models but also decreases the range of ae values to a certain extent the main reason is that the tv bma model provides dynamic weighted average values at each time node through time varying criteria which effectively reduces the deviation of the model in local prediction therefore the tv bma model can provide more stable prediction than the benchmark models 4 4 uncertainty of modeling results the uncertainty of the modeling results is an important aspect in evaluating the prediction performance of the model which reflects its stability as shown in table 3 and fig 11 the bma and tv bma models have higher cr and b values indicating that these models have lower uncertainty values owing to the integration of the prediction results of the individual models although the cr of the bma and tv bma models are close the tv bma model has a lower interval width indicating that it further reduces the uncertainty of prediction results additionally the tv bma model has a higher cr and lower b in the prediction of rainfall types 1 and 2 and the results in section 3 1 demonstrate that these two rainfall types represent the rainfall pattern of heavy rainfall events therefore the tv bma model performed better in the prediction of heavy rainfall events 4 5 prediction of flood and early warning based on the tv bma model using the tv bma model to provide early warnings of urban flooding is a complex process the early warning mechanism primarily involved three key processes the first step was the acquisition and processing of rainfall forecasting data and the identification of rainfall pattern in this study the rainfall forecasting data for august 7 2020 were used as the sample data for early warning it has a time resolution of 10 min and lead forecast time relative to the measured rainfall data of 120 min for missing and discontinuous data the rainfall forecasting data were filtered by artificial elimination and piecewise linear interpolation through rainfall pattern recognition the rainfall event was categorized as the second rainfall type the second step was the ponding prediction process to determine the rainfall pattern prediction results were obtained by inputting rainfall forecasting data into the tv bma model the third step involved providing an early warning the maximum depth of the inundation process was used as the classification standard for early warning and was divided into four classes 0 3 cm 3 10 cm 10 25 cm and 25 cm wu et al 2020 the early warning results were determined using classification standards and gis notably urban flood warning is a process of dynamic adjustment with rainfall forecasting data because new rainfall forecasting data are generated continuously the early warning process must be repeated at every moment and the early warning results should be dynamically adjusted additionally for each updated early warning process if the measured rainfall occurred before the first step of the warning the measured and forecasted rainfall data should be input into the tv bma model during the second step of the warning if only the rainfall forecasting data are input into the model the results lack the impact of early rainfall on ponding which leads to a large deviation in the ponding prediction in this study the first 120 min before ponding was considered as the scope of the urban flood forecast period to analyze the early warning accuracy of the tv bma model under different forecast periods 10 min 20 min and 120 min as shown in fig 12 the ponding degree in the eastern and northern regions of zhengzhou city was smaller than that in the other areas the main reason for this is that the northern region of zhengzhou city is close to the yellow river wetlands and grasslands accounted for a large proportion of this region rainfall intercepts after reaching the surface making it difficult to form serious ponding as the eastern region of zhengzhou city is a newly built urban area the design drainage capacity of the urban pipe network is high and can resist large rainfall events therefore the ponding degree in the eastern region of zhengzhou city was also smaller in contrast the ponding points with serious ponding were primarily distributed in the middle region of zhengzhou city it is the most densely populated area with early urban construction a low design drainage capacity of the pipe network and a substantial proportion of impervious areas therefore serious ponding can form more easily in this region compared to the other regions fig 13 presents the accuracy of early warning results of the tv bma model under different forecast periods owing to the extension of the forecast period the early warning accuracy of the tv bma model gradually decreased however the forecast period and accuracy were a contradictory problem during urban flood early warning high early warning accuracy is necessary to ensure its effectiveness and a long forecast period is required for flood control and response from rescue personnel if the f score exceeding 0 8 was considered to meet the requirements of early warning accuracy the longest forecast period for the tv bma model meeting the early warning accuracy was 100 min however for the forecast period of 110 min and 120 min the f score of tv bma model was reduced to 0 767 and 0 71 respectively which could not meet the accuracy requirements of the early warning for urban floods 5 discussion 5 1 comparative analysis of tv bma and four benchmark models in terms of model accuracy the results in section 4 2 demonstrate that the accuracy of tv bma is improved by 43 6 50 4 compared with an individual benchmark model but only by 11 4 compared with the bma model this is because the bma obtained more accurate prediction results by integrating three individual models reducing the scope for further accuracy improvement fig 9 indicates that the tv bma model shows significant potential for correcting the prediction deviation of the benchmark models which is a significant advantage of the tv bma model in terms of computational efficiency the tv bma model showed a longer running time 5 21 s than the benchmark models the tv bma model must use the time varying criterion to derive the weighted average of the benchmark models at each time node nevertheless the running time of 5 21 s is negligible for urban flood prediction and early warning in terms of model stability the results in section 4 4 demonstrate that the tv bma model significantly reduces the uncertainty of the prediction results of the benchmark models this is another significant advantage over the benchmark models therefore although the accuracy of the tv bma model was only 11 4 higher than that of the bma model the tv bma model showed outstanding advantages in correcting the prediction deviation of the benchmark models and in reducing the uncertainty of the prediction results 5 2 effect of rainfall type on tv bma model to analyze the influence of rainfall pattern clustering on the prediction performance of the tv bma model the difference in accuracy between the non clustered and clustered models was quantitatively analyzed through a controlled experiment as shown in fig 14 the ae of the clustered tv bma model was lower than that of the non clustered tv bma model at different stages of the inundation process the main reason is that the non clustered tv bma model did not consider the influence of the rainfall pattern on the weighted average of the model and always derived the same weighted average for different types of rainfall events however the prediction accuracy of the model may show significant differences among different types of prediction tasks this difference affected the prediction accuracy of the non clustered tv bma model therefore the prediction accuracy of the non clustered tv bma model was lower than that of the clustered tv bma model proposed in this study this also demonstrates that rainfall pattern clustering can improve the prediction accuracy of the tv bma model at different stages of the inundation process for both the non clustered and clustered models the ae showed the same trend of first increasing and then decreasing fig 14 this result indicates that the model has a high prediction performance for a lower ponding depth however the opposite conclusion is drawn from fig 12 e it shows that some prediction results appeared outside the 20 error band when the water depth was less than 0 25 m whereas when the ponding depth was 0 25 m all prediction results were within the 20 error band this indicates that the model has a higher prediction performance for a higher ponding depth the main reason for this contradiction is the different accuracy evaluation indices the ponding depth was low during the beginning and end stages of the inundation process but the re was more sensitive to smaller values therefore although the ae of the prediction results was not large some prediction results appeared outside the 20 error band in the beginning and end stages in contrast during the middle period of the inundation process the model shows a lower re under a larger ae because the sensitivity of the re decreases with an increase in ponding depth 5 3 sources of uncertainty in early warning results the uncertainty sources of the early warning results include the errors of the model and input data rainfall forecasting data although the tv bma model improves the prediction accuracy by integrating the results of multiple models and significantly reduces the uncertainty of the model it has some error and uncertainty as shown in fig 15 when the measured rainfall data for august 7 2020 was input into the tv bma model the early warning result had an error of 6 3 this may be attributed to the model failing to accurately represent the nonlinear relationship between the driving factors and target variables under limited samples in the future with the increase in the sample data the error and uncertainty of the model can be further reduced however the accuracy of rainfall forecasting data decreases significantly with the increase in the forecast period which affects the early warning performance of the model therefore the error in rainfall forecasting data is an important source of uncertainty in early warning systems when the rainfall forecasting data were used as the input data fig 15 the accuracy of the early warning results of the tv bma model decreased from 92 8 to 71 8 with the extension of the forecast period although the forecast period of the tv bma model can reach 100 min to ensure 80 precision the influence of rainfall forecasting data on early warning accuracy increased significantly when the forecast period exceeded 50 min consequently the accuracy of the model was only 78 1 in early warning results with a forecast period of 110 min therefore future research should focus on methods to improve the accuracy of rainfall forecasting data this is a challenging and significant research area and a solution to this problem can lead to a breakthrough change in predicting urban flooding and providing early warning 6 conclusion in this study an integrated urban flood prediction model was proposed based on an improved bma algorithm using a time varying criterion by considering the influence of rainfall patterns on the model performance the aim of the study was to improve the accuracy and stability of urban flood prediction and provide early warning first the rainfall patterns in the study area were determined using clustering and the mann kendall test subsequently a model selection based on coupling time varying criterion and model averaging was proposed to improve the prediction performance of the bma model finally the improved bma model tv bma was applied for providing the early warning of urban floods based on the rainfall forecasting data and the tv bma model a rolling early warning of urban floods at ponding points can be obtained zhengzhou city was considered as an example case the results indicate that the tv bma model effectively improved the accuracy and stability of the predictive results obtained by the benchmark models the prediction accuracy of the tv bma model was 11 4 50 4 higher than that of the four benchmark models and the uncertainty bandwidth of the tv bma model was 19 1 53 1 lower than that of the benchmark models although the results show that the performance of each benchmark model is excellent tables 2 and 3 a few cases of large prediction deviations were observed in each benchmark model fig 9 however all the prediction results of the tv bma model were within the 20 error band when water depth exceeded 0 2 m this suggests that the tv bma model has outstanding advantages in correcting these prediction deviations the accurate and stable ponding prediction results obtained using this model can provide an important reference for urban flood control including the reasonable allocation of urban flood control resources effective organization of flood response and emergency rescue the early warning results revealed that the tv bma model has high accuracy in the early warning results of no more than a 100 min forecast period f score 0 8 the comprehensive urban flood prediction model proposed herein based on time varying criteria can provide a more accurate and stable prediction of urban floods and may provide guidance for improving the existing urban flood prediction methods the proposed model exhibited a high computational efficiency and stable performance it effectively integrates the advantages of the benchmark and bma models by calculating the weighted average of each model for different rainfall patterns at each time node however the proposed model highly relies on historical observations the model may have some errors and uncertainties when the sample data is limited in contrast urban flood models with physical mechanisms rely less on historical observations and mainly depend on the modelers understanding of urban flood mechanisms therefore future research can attempt to add physical models with urban flood mechanism to the integrated learning framework additionally with the future development of artificial intelligence and computer technology the addition of new models suitable for the prediction of urban floods may achieve higher results future research can explore the impact of different combinations and numbers of models on the performance of integrated prediction models credit authorship contribution statement yihong zhou methodology validation writing review editing

2225,urban flooding is a serious challenge in cities owing to global warming and rapid urbanization thus urban flood forecasting is required to reduce losses nevertheless owing to the randomness and uncertainty of rainfall and ponding processes providing accurate and stable ponding predictions using the existing prediction methods is difficult to address these issues this study proposes a time varying criterion to improve the bayesian model averaging bma method and uses the time varying bma tv bma approach to develop an integrated model for predicting urban floods and providing early warning by dynamically coupling the results of the bma and three machine learning models this integrated model was based on numerous measured data on rainfall and ponding processes aiming to accurately predict real time changes in ponding depth the results show that the prediction accuracy of the tv bma model was 11 4 50 4 higher than that of the bma and individual models and within the 95 confidence interval moreover the bandwidth of the tv bma model 0 038 m was 19 1 53 1 lower than that of the bma 0 047 m and individual models 0 063 0 081 m this demonstrates that the tv bma model has significant advantages in correcting deviation and reducing uncertainty in the prediction results furthermore the tv bma model has high accuracy in the early warning results for up to a 100 min forecast period f score 0 8 the proposed tv bma model can predict urban floods with improved accuracy and stability it may provide guidance for improving the existing urban flood prediction methods keywords urban flood flood prediction bayesian model averaging ponding data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in recent years urban flood disasters have occurred frequently worldwide such as the houston floods in the united states in 2017 rio floods in brazil in 2019 and zhengzhou floods in china in 2021 these flooding events have caused substantial property losses and casualties and have become one of the major challenges faced by metropolises globally nguyen and bae 2020 recent studies have demonstrated that cities face increasingly severe flood disaster risks in the future owing to global warming and urbanization li et al 2022 winsemius et al 2016 therefore an accurate and stable prediction method must be developed to support water resource management in minimizing life and property losses many methods have been developed to simulate and predict urban floods for example numerical models based on physical mechanisms are widely used in urban flood simulation mignot and dewals 2022 urban drainage facility optimization wang et al 2022 and urban flood risk assessment rafiei sardooi et al 2021 however owing to the complexity of the system an accurate simulation of the physical process is challenging yin et al 2021 additionally these numerical models based on physical mechanisms often have high computational costs therefore machine learning approaches based on data driven methods have been applied machine learning methods can capture the nonlinear relationship between the driving variables and ponding process at a low computational cost researchers have used various machine learning methods in urban flood modeling including support vector machines díaz vico et al 2020 gradient boosting decision trees gbdt wu et al 2020a and neural networks chang et al 2014 although machine learning methods are widely used for urban floods they are not universally superior in particular one model may serve well for one flood event and perform poorly for other flood events therefore this uncertainty may cause a significant deviation in ponding prediction based on a single model liu and merwade 2018 to overcome this problem this study proposes a robust integrated ponding prediction model based on machine learning to quantify the model uncertainty in predicting the ponding process and improve the accuracy and reliability of the model a common approach for dealing with model uncertainty and improving prediction accuracy is model averaging which extracts information from all benchmark models candidate models for the integrated model to provide more robust predictions sun et al 2021 the current model averaging methods include simple model averaging sma weighted model averaging wma multi model super ensemble mmse and bayesian model averaging bma ajami et al 2006 liu and merwade 2018 najafi and moradkhani 2015 bma is one of the most common and widely used methods to generate reliable predictions by synthesizing several models li et al 2017 liu and merwade 2019 madadgar and moradkhani 2014 which have been widely used in meteorology kazeem bello and lanre ibrahim 2022 environmental study zhou et al 2020 and hydrology liu and merwade 2018 the bma method is advantageous because it provides a weighted average prediction of the variable and obtains a prediction distribution reflecting the uncertainty of the model liu and merwade 2019 thus the integrated prediction of urban floods using bma has received extensive attention from scholars bermúdez et al 2018 liu and merwade 2018 notaro et al 2016 however many scholars acknowledge that because the coefficients of the explanatory variables of the bma are fixed at each time node the method may have a large loss of accuracy during local real time prediction sun et al 2021 for example the optimal explanatory variables may exhibit significant differences at different time nodes in predicting the ponding process therefore although the fixed explanatory variable coefficient improves the overall prediction performance of the model to a certain extent the optimal predictive variables may change during the local real time prediction this change causes a significant loss in the local prediction accuracy additionally if the prediction results of the benchmark models are distributed across the same region as the measured values at some time nodes the bma model may reduce the prediction accuracy of the benchmark models thus using the bma model to predict the urban ponding process accurately is challenging therefore based on a machine learning approach this study aims to dynamically adjust the explanatory variable coefficients of the bma model at each time node during the ponding process to minimize the statistical deviation of the final model it can provide a more robust and accurate ponding prediction which is a contribution of this study additionally based on the measured data on the rainfall and ponding processes this study constructed an urban flood prediction model with water depth as the benchmark this has been rarely reported in data driven urban flood prediction research the main objective of this study is to propose a dynamic integrated prediction model coupled with machine learning using an improved bma to solve the local accuracy loss caused by the fixed explanatory variable coefficients of the bma a time varying criterion of coupling model selection and model average was proposed in particular by considering the absolute error in the prediction results of the benchmark models at each time node as the basis for the weighted average distribution this method accounts for the lacking time varying coefficients from bma by iteratively solves the weighted average of the benchmark models at each time node another challenge in ponding prediction is that the difference in rainfall patterns may cause uncertainties in model prediction for example although the time varying criterion provides time varying coefficients the model weighted average remains unchanged for different types of rainfall events which may introduce some uncertainty to the prediction results to reduce the impact of different rainfall patterns on the integrated prediction model this study proposed a ponding prediction modeling framework for different rainfall types the framework identifies the main categories of rainfall patterns through cluster analysis and constructs a time varying bma tv bma model based on time varying coefficients for different rainfall patterns this model can achieve a robust prediction for different rainfall types 2 method 2 1 research framework owing to the complexity of urban systems and uncertainty of rainfall and ponding processes achieving accurate and stable inundation process prediction and early warning using a single model is challenging additionally when using the multi model method to predict urban flooding few studies have considered the impact of rainfall patterns on the model performance therefore this study proposes an integrated urban flood prediction model that uses an improved bma algorithm with a time varying criterion first cluster analysis and the mann kendall test were used to determine the rainfall patterns in the study area second several machine learning and bma methods were used to construct the urban flooding prediction model which was used as the benchmark models for the tv bma model accordingly an improved bma model using a time varying criterion was proposed the tv bma model must derive the weighted average of the benchmark models at each time node the prediction results of the tv bma model can then be obtained using the weighted average a flowchart of the research framework is shown in fig 1 2 2 rainfall pattern classification and identification method the classification of rainfall patterns is a time series classification problem compared with the euclidean distance the distance of dynamic time warping dtw can better capture the similarity of rainfall patterns of different time series giorgino 2009 therefore dtw distance was selected to determine the similarity between the two time series for the classification of rainfall patterns for the considered time series q q 1 q 2 q x rainfall dataset m is first determined as the initial clustering number and then m is randomly selected as the initial cluster center accordingly the dtw distance from each rainfall sequence to the cluster center was calculated and the samples were divided into categories closer to this cluster center 1 z 0 z 1 0 z 2 0 z m 0 2 p arg min t 1 t d q i c j 2 n t 2 n 1 where z 0 refers to the randomly selected m initial cluster centers z m 0 refers to the initially determined mth cluster center p is the dtw distance and d q i c j is the euclidean distance of the ith sample in time series q and the jth sample in time series c second the new cluster center was determined according to the average value of the dtw distance in each category and the difference in dtw distance between the old and new cluster centers was calculated if the value is less than the threshold value of the cluster center it must be adjusted the threshold refers to the allowable difference between the dtw distance of the old and new cluster centers and it was set to 0 001 in this study this indicates that the adjusted cluster center did not significantly reduce the dtw distance and end the iteration otherwise the aforementioned process was repeated finally the cluster centers corresponding to different m values were determined by repeating the clustering process by continuously changing the number of cluster centers m the mann kendall test a common mutation point test method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the sequential test statistics data in terms of u b m and u f m values the mann kendall test can analyze the presence of a mutation point and the occurrence time of the mutation point at the significance level of where u b m u f m the calculation equation for u f m is as follows 3 u f m s m e s m var s m m 1 2 m 4 s m i 1 m r i r i 1 s s e i s s e j 0 e l s e j 1 2 i 5 sse j 1 m i 1 n d x i z j x i c j where sse i refers to the sum of the squared errors when the number of clusters is i sse j refers to the sum of squared errors when the number of clusters is j e s m and var s m are the mean and variance of s m respectively z j refers to the jth cluster center x i refers to the ith sample in the jth category n refers to the number of samples in the jth category and c j represents the jth category based on the results of cluster analysis and the mann kendall test the patterns of actual rainfall events can be identified by calculating the degree of approximation em between the actual rainfall and these m rainfall patterns 6 e m 1 1 n i 1 n u ki x i 2 n 5 where u ki refers to the process of k rainfall patterns obtained by cluster analysis and the mann kendall test and x i refers to the actual rainfall process the smaller the e m the higher is the approximation of the actual rainfall to the rainfall pattern 2 3 applied machine learning method machine learning can deal with complex systems with large amounts of data and can be used for prediction and classification mosavi et al 2018 nevertheless appropriate methods must be selected to solve special problems and not all types of machine learning methods are suitable for predicting local urban flooding for example convolutional neural networks cnn and gated recurrent units gru are commonly applied deep learning methods however cnn are primarily used to identify spatial data he et al 2015 and gru are primarily used to obtain time series gao et al 2020 therefore the non stationary nonlinear and aperiodic characteristics of the data on the rainfall and inundation processes is evident moreover according to the characteristics and applicable conditions of various methods three commonly used types of machine learning methods support vector regression svr back propagation neural network bpnn and gbdt were selected as the basic learning algorithms for local urban flooding prediction as a supervised machine learning method svr has the outstanding advantages of strong learning and anti interference abilities under limited sample information shivaswamy et al 2007 because rainfall and ponding data are often limited the svr model is suitable for urban flood prediction modeling a bpnn is a variant of artificial neural network guha et al 2022 compared with other machine learning methods neural networks are remarkably advanced as that they can deal with complex relationships learn and make intelligent decisions through multiple layers lecun et al 2015 therefore the bpnn can explore the potential relationship between the rainfall and ponding processes and its application in flood forecasting shows excellent results elsafi 2014 guha et al 2022 gbdt is an integrated learning method that generates an integrated decision tree and has a gradient boosting algorithm jerome 2001 its advantages include relatively small model parameters strong robustness to outliers and reliable prediction results for small samples gu et al 2021 thus the gbdt model can effectively deal with non stationary rainfall and inundation process data recent research has shown that the gbdt has a favorable effect on urban flood prediction wu et al 2020b the aforementioned machine learning methods svr bpnn and gbdt have different individual data processing ability model stability and data mining characteristics and have shown remarkable results in previous studies on flood forecasting therefore these three were determined as benchmark models in the tv bma modeling framework the construction process of the local urban flooding prediction model using these specific machine learning methods have been described in detail in rafiei sardooi et al 2021 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b 2 3 1 svr svr is a supervised machine learning algorithm the key purpose of svr is to determine the optimal hyperplane using a kernel function to map the data to a feature space from high to infinite dimensions this aims to minimize the total deviation between all training samples and this hyperplane surface díaz vico et al 2020 svr allows for some deviation ε between the model output f x and actual value y when the deviation between f x and y was greater than ε the loss was calculated fig 2 the regression model corresponding to the optimal hyperplane of svr is f x w t x b where w and b are the model parameters to be determined when solving the svr model the data are mapped to a new feature space and the lagrange function is introduced to estimate the model parameters w and b the modeling process of the svr model has been described by haoyuan et al 2022 2 3 2 bpnn the bpnn is a multilayer feedforward neural network trained according to the back propagation algorithm of the error the algorithm is composed of input output and hidden layers fig 3 and has been widely applied in prediction methods in various scientific fields chen et al 2022 jianjin et al 2017 the bpnn contains the forward propagation of the input signal rainfall data and back propagation of the error mean square error mse between the output and actual values in the forward propagation stage by providing examples to the neurons of the input layer the signal is transmitted forward layerwise until the result of the output layer is generated then the mse between the output value of the neuron and the actual value is calculated if the error cannot satisfy the set accuracy requirements reverse processing is required in the back propagation stage according to the mse of the output layer the gradient descent algorithm was used to calculate the negative gradient between the error of the output layer and the connection weighted average and threshold values to update these values between the connection layers wang et al 2017 2 3 3 gbdt regression the gbdt is an integrated learning algorithm that is composed of multiple decision trees jerome 2001 it can be used for regression and classification purposes the gbdt uses regression trees for regression tasks and can learn iteratively based on the residuals of the previous regression tree the final output model was obtained by superimposing the regression tree for each iteration fig 4 it integrates the advantages of the decision tree and gradient boosting algorithm which has proven to be an efficient high precision and low deviation model in many practical applications gu et al 2021 2 4 construction of the bma model the bma is a statistical processing method for probabilistic prediction using multiple models that can combine the estimates of individual models to produce reliable predictions bma is not limited to selecting the best model but considers the prediction ability of all selected models during training to the weighted average prediction assuming that y is the prediction variable water depth the bma derives the posterior distribution of the prediction variable from the measured ponding data and the results of the three basic learning algorithms the main calculation process of predicting local urban flooding using the bma is as follows 7 p y d k 1 k p f k d p k y f k d k 3 8 e y d k 1 k p f k d e p k y f k d k 1 k ω k f k 9 var y d k 1 k f k k 1 k ω i f i 2 k 1 k ω k f k where p y d is the probability density function of the prediction variables d is the measurement of local urban flooding data f k is the simulation results of the kth benchmark model e y d and var y d refer to the expectation and variance of the bma model respectively and ω k and σ k 2 refer to the weighted average and variance of the kth benchmark model k 1 k ω k 1 respectively ω k and σ k 2 are the parameters to be solved in the bma model to estimate the weighted average and variance the log likelihood function can be expressed as 10 l ω 1 ω 2 ω k σ 2 log k 1 k ω k p k y f k d to analytically solve this likelihood function the expectation maximization em algorithm is used to determine the maximum likelihood through repeated iterations via two steps expectation and maximization raftery et al 2005 a complete mathematical description of the execution of the em algorithm can be found in liu and merwade 2018 yang et al 2021 thus the prediction results of the bma model can be easily obtained based on the weighted average values obtained by the em algorithm and prediction results of the svr bpnn and gbdt models although bma can integrate multiple models to provide robust prediction because the weighted average it derives for an individual model remains unchanged it may produce large deviations and uncertainties in local or few period predictions additionally if the prediction results of all the models are overestimated or underestimated in the local prediction the model selection method can be more effective than the model averaging method therefore the tv bma method was used to address these issues 2 5 construction of the tv bma model based on the results of the three common machine learning models and the bma model the time varying criterion was used to construct the tv bma model this method aimed to achieve the integrated prediction of the inundation process at each time node the proposed time varying criterion includes two key steps the first step is to distinguish the integrated prediction approach at each time node if the value of the discrimination function equation 11 at time t 0 the model selection approach was used to predict the inundation process in contrast the model average approach was used to predict the inundation process second according to the comprehensive prediction approach determined at each time node the integrated prediction results at each time node were derived to minimize the local error 11 f t model a v e r a g e x t m y t x t n y t 0 m n n m o d e l s e l e c t i o n e l s e where f t is the discriminant function at time t x t m is the prediction result at time t for the mth event y t is the measured value at time t and x t n is the prediction result at time t for the nth event n refers to the number of rainfall events used for the integrated prediction the purpose of using the model selection approach for predicting the inundation process is to select the model with the best performance based on the performance of each model at time t when using the model selection approach for inundation process prediction the sum of the squared errors sse was selected as the objective function and the result with the lowest sse was considered as the result of the integrated prediction at time t 12 r t k x t k y t 2 k 1 2 3 4 13 k t f min r t 1 r t 2 r t k 14 x t x t k k k t where x t k is the predicted value of the kth model at time t y t is the measured value at time t r t k is the error square of the kth model at time t k t is the model with the lowest error square at time t and x t is the integrated prediction result at time t the objective of using the model average approach for predicting the inundation process is to provide the best weighted average according to the prediction characteristics of each model and reduce the deviation of the integrated prediction results first assuming that the prediction results of each benchmark model follow the gaussian distribution equation 15 the initial weighted average and estimated values were determined by using the sse of each model during the iteration process the weighted average of each model was repeatedly adjusted using the deviation between the estimated and real values until the deviation met the requirements finally the weighted average of the final iteration was used to calculate the integrated prediction results the algorithm is specified as follows 1 the assumption made was 15 x t k n x t k σ t k where x t k and σ t k are the mean and variance of the predicted value of the kth model at time t respectively 2 the initial weighted average ω t k 0 of each model at time t was evaluated as 16 ω t k 0 ss e t k 1 k 1 k ss e t k 1 3 the initial estimate x t 0 and deviation ε 0 were calculated 17 x t 0 k 1 k ω t k 0 x t k 18 ε 0 x t 0 y t 4 the weighted average of each model was adjusted 19 ω t k 1 min ω t k 0 ε 0 2 k 1 k ss e t k x t k 0 y t 0 max ω t k 0 ε 0 2 k 1 k ss e t k x t k 0 y t 0 5 steps 2 and 3 were repeated and the iteration was stopped when ε n ε n 1 0 subsequently the weighted average of the last iteration was returned and the integrated prediction result x t at time t was calculated 20 ω t k n ω t 1 n ω t 2 n ω t k n k 4 21 x t k 1 k ω t k n x t k the aforementioned steps were repeated to obtain the integrated prediction values of the coupling model selection and the model average at all times similarly for all rainfall patterns these steps were repeated to obtain the weighted average and integrated prediction results for different types of rainfall events 2 6 analysis of model performance the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model the smaller the mae and rmse values the higher is the model accuracy the closer the nse is to 1 the better is the model performance 22 mae i 1 n x i y i n 23 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n 24 nse 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i is the predicted value y i is the measured value y is the mean value of the measured value and n is the number of samples used to calculate model performance the uncertainty of the prediction results is a crucial factor in evaluating the performance of the model to analyze the stability of the prediction results of each model the monte carlo random sampling method was used to determine the uncertainty interval of each model at α 0 05 the monte carlo method was also used to calculate the uncertainty interval of the bma model at any time t first according to the weight ω 1 ω 2 ω k of each benchmark model an integer was randomly generated between 1 2 k to select the model then the probability distribution of the kth model at any time t was used to randomly generate a ponding depth value the aforementioned steps were repeated m times where m refers to the sampling times and the m samples were sorted according to their size the 95 confidence interval was part of the quantile between 2 5 and 97 5 the monte carlo method performs mass sampling and obtains a gradual approximation when the sampling times of this method were sufficiently large the results gradually approached the actual value therefore the sampling time for each time node was determined as 10 000 to derive the 95 confidence interval of the bma model the uncertainty of the other model was also calculated using the monte carlo method and the sampling times were set to 10000 bandwidth b and coverage rate cr were used to evaluate the uncertainty of the model the narrower the value of b the higher is the cr indicating a smaller uncertainty of the model additionally precision recall and f score were used to evaluate the performance of the model to provide early warning precision is the proportion of true positive samples in the prediction samples and recall refers to the proportion of true positive samples among all positive samples faceli et al 2011 the f score combines precision and recall and can comprehensively reflect the performance of early warning results the closer the f score is to 1 the higher is the accuracy of the results 25 pr e c i s i o n tp tp f p 26 re c a l l tp tp f n 27 f s core 2 pr e c i s o n re c a l l pr e c i s o n re c a l l where tp and fp indicate the true positive and false positive samples in the prediction samples respectively and fn indicates the false negative samples 3 case study 3 1 study area a 1008 km2 urban area 34 16 34 58 n 112 42 114 14 e in zhengzhou city china was selected for this study fig 5 historical records indicate that the average annual precipitation is 639 5 mm in this area however the annual precipitation distribution is extremely uneven precipitation during the flood season from june to september accounts for approximately 60 of the annual precipitation additionally historical records indicate that serious flood disasters have occurred in this area in 2018 2019 and 2021 especially the extreme rainfall event on july 20 2021 which led to 380 deaths and economic losses of 6 32 billion dollars therefore urban flood disasters have become a major problem affecting the sustainable development of zhengzhou city 3 2 data the urban flood prediction model proposed in this study primarily adopts measured rainfall flooding and rainfall forecasting data the rainfall data of 66 rainfall events from 2008 to 2021 were used for cluster analysis of the rainfall pattern the rainfall data of 21 rainfall events from 2016 to 2019 were selected as the sample data for the tv bma model of which four rainfall events with different rainfall patterns were used as the validation data and the remaining 17 rainfall data were used as the training data additionally the rainfall event on august 7 2020 was used to verify the early warning performance of the model the data applied are described as follows 1 rainfall data rainfall data from 2008 to 2021 were obtained from the meteorological department in zhengzhou city rainfall data were recorded at 16 automatic rainfall monitoring stations which had a temporal resolution of 10 min in the cluster analysis of rainfall patterns rainfall data from 16 rainfall stations were selected as sample data to consider the impact of rainfall spatial distribution therefore although the number of rainfall events used for this cluster analysis was 66 the actual number of sample data points used was 1056 during the construction of flood prediction model the kriging method of spatial interpolation was adopted to interpolate the rainfall data of 16 rainfall stations and obtain the rainfall data at each ponding point 2 flooding data the flooding data at 27 ponding points obtained using ponding monitoring equipment were provided by the urban management department of zhengzhou city the 27 ponding points included areas that were prone to ponding in previous urban flood events according to the statistics of the zhengzhou urban management department the ponding data had a temporal resolution of 1 min the temporal resolution of the ponding data was adjusted to 10 min to match that of the measured rainfall data 3 rainfall forecasting data the rolling rainfall forecasting data for august 7 2020 were obtained from beijing caiche quming technology co ltd a meteorological technology company that can provide abundant meteorological data including real time rainfall forecasting data it has a temporal resolution of 1 min spatial resolution of 1 km and lead forecast time of 120 min similarly the temporal resolution of the rainfall forecasting data was adjusted to 10 min to match the temporal resolution of the historical rainfall and ponding data 4 results 4 1 rainfall pattern clustering results historical records indicate that the rainfall events in zhengzhou are mostly short term rainfall events of 1 5 h therefore rainfall events with a duration of 5 h were selected as cluster sample events for rainfall events with a duration of 5 h the sliding pane method with a 5 h pane length was used to select the data with the largest rainfall as the sample data on this basis 1056 samples of 66 rainfall events from 2008 to 2021 were selected for cluster analysis according to the similarity of rainfall patterns the dtw and k means algorithms were used to cluster the rainfall patterns and the optimal clustering results were obtained using the mann kendall test as shown in fig 6 at α 0 05 and have intersection points near k 4 indicating a significant change when the number of clusters is four therefore the rainfall patterns in zhengzhou city were classified into four categories fig 7 and table 1 show the characteristics of the four rainfall patterns in zhengzhou city the fourth type of rainfall is clearly the rainfall pattern with the highest frequency the characteristics of this type of rainfall were that the time distribution was relatively uniform total precipitation was small and the risk of ponding was low however low risk does not imply no risk the frequency of ponding in the fourth rainfall pattern was 0 08 indicating that equally distributed rainfall events with high precipitation may also have formed ponding in contrast the characteristics of the first and second types of rainfall were that the time distribution was uneven the total precipitation was high and a large amount of rainfall occurred which rapidly transformed to surface runoff therefore although the frequency of these two types of rainfall was low the risk of ponding was high urban flood control should focus on this type of rainfall event 4 2 results of the tv bma model the key step in the tv bma model is to derive the weighted average of the benchmark models svr bpnn gbdt and bma therefore eight rainfall events with different rainfall patterns were selected to determine the weighted average of the benchmark models to construct an integrated prediction model with time varying weighted average values first the four rainfall events were input into three commonly used machine learning models svr bpnn and gbdt to obtain the prediction results and then the bma algorithm was used to couple the three models to obtain the prediction results of the bma model by combining these four models with time varying criteria the integrated prediction results of the tv bma model were obtained as shown in fig 8 the weighted average distribution of the benchmark models showed significant differences for different types of rainfall events for example the weighted average of the bma model was higher than that of the other benchmark models for the first rainfall pattern however for the third rainfall pattern the weighted average of the gbdt model was higher than that of the other benchmark models during the early and middle stages of the inundation process this difference indicates the necessity of constructing an integrated prediction model for different rainfall patterns additionally the weighted average of the benchmark models showed considerable uncertainty at different stages of the inundation process for example for the first rainfall pattern the gbdt model exhibited the highest weighted average during the early stage of the inundation process and the bma model exhibited the highest weighted average during the middle stage however during the end stage of the inundation process the three individual models showed the same weighted average which was higher than that of the bma model owing to this uncertainty the bma model may exhibit large deviations in some moment predictions even though it integrates the results of different models this uncertainty demonstrates that a time varying criterion must be used to determine the dynamic weighted average of the bma table 2 lists the computational efficiency and model accuracy of the benchmark and tv bma models the running time of an individual model svr bpnn and gbdt was shorter showing a higher computational efficiency and the svr model had the highest computational efficiency in contrast the running times of the bma and tv bma models were longer the reason for this result is that bma and tv bma must combine the individual models to construct the integrated model which increases the complexity of the integrated model in terms of model calibration accuracy the nse of the svr bpnn and gbdt models were above 0 97 indicating that these three benchmark models better captured the potential relationship between the rainfall and ponding processes in terms of validating modeling accuracy the nse of each model was between 0 94 and 0 99 the relative error re of the maximum ponding depth of each model was between 6 5 and 8 5 and the mae was not 0 035 m this indicates that each model had a favorable effect on ponding prediction one reason for the high prediction performance of each model was that reliable data on the rainfall and ponding processes were obtained before modeling including ponding process data recorded by ponding monitoring equipment and historical rainfall data recorded by automatic rainfall monitoring stations these reliable data form an important basis for the model to obtain better results another reason may be that the urban flood prediction models were constructed for each rainfall pattern which decreased the influence of uncertainties in rainfall information on the model performance additionally the prediction accuracy of the tv bma model was 11 4 50 4 higher than that of the four benchmark models which was unexpected therefore although the computational efficiency of the tv bma model is lower than that of the benchmark models the improvement in the model accuracy is significant thus the running time of the tv bma model 5 21 s hardly affects the timeliness of prediction for preventing urban flood providing early warning and implementing relevant rescue measures whereas the improvement in accuracy is significant for effective urban flood prevention and control 4 3 prediction characteristics of the tv bma and four benchmark models to analyze the prediction performance of the tv bma and each benchmark model the prediction characteristics of these models were determined for different water depths and different stages of the inundation process based on the validation results fig 9 shows the prediction characteristics of the tv bma and each benchmark model in terms of water depth the prediction accuracy of the tv bma and each benchmark model gradually increased with increasing water depth among these the tv bma model showed the highest prediction accuracy only a few prediction results in the tv bma model were outside the 20 error band and when the water depth exceeded 0 2 m all the prediction results were within the 20 error band in contrast approximately 30 of the prediction results in the svr model appeared outside the 20 error band indicating the lowest accuracy of the svr model however the four benchmark models overestimated the prediction results among which the overestimation by the bpnn and gbdt models are evident because most of the prediction results of these two models are distributed above the 45 straight line this overestimation may be due to two reasons first the training data may not be sufficient which leads to deviations in the model when capturing the potential relationship between the input and output variables second the control of ponding points changed the hydrological process of some these points if the model training samples do not include the ponding events after control the ponding degree during the validation process may be overestimated in the future through continuous accumulation of data and addition of the latest flood events sufficient training samples may be generated which may solve the problem of model overestimation however the prediction results of tv bma model are evenly distributed on both sides of the 45 straight line which demonstrates that the tv bma model reduces the overestimation error of the benchmark models to a certain extent therefore compared with the benchmark models the tv bma model not only shows the highest prediction effect but also corrects the deviation of the predicted results of the benchmark models fig 10 shows the prediction characteristics of the benchmark and tv bma models at different stages of the inundation process the range of absolute error ae values of the benchmark and tv bma models in t1 and t5 the first and last 10 periods of the inundation process respectively are larger than those in the other stages and that in t3 the stage when the water depth reaches peak value is lower this finding demonstrates that these models have more stable prediction performance for severe ponding additionally compared with the individual models the bma and tv bma models have relatively small ranges of ae values this indicates that the bma and tv bma models significantly reduce the uncertainty of the prediction results notably the tv bma model not only shows lower mae than the four benchmark models but also decreases the range of ae values to a certain extent the main reason is that the tv bma model provides dynamic weighted average values at each time node through time varying criteria which effectively reduces the deviation of the model in local prediction therefore the tv bma model can provide more stable prediction than the benchmark models 4 4 uncertainty of modeling results the uncertainty of the modeling results is an important aspect in evaluating the prediction performance of the model which reflects its stability as shown in table 3 and fig 11 the bma and tv bma models have higher cr and b values indicating that these models have lower uncertainty values owing to the integration of the prediction results of the individual models although the cr of the bma and tv bma models are close the tv bma model has a lower interval width indicating that it further reduces the uncertainty of prediction results additionally the tv bma model has a higher cr and lower b in the prediction of rainfall types 1 and 2 and the results in section 3 1 demonstrate that these two rainfall types represent the rainfall pattern of heavy rainfall events therefore the tv bma model performed better in the prediction of heavy rainfall events 4 5 prediction of flood and early warning based on the tv bma model using the tv bma model to provide early warnings of urban flooding is a complex process the early warning mechanism primarily involved three key processes the first step was the acquisition and processing of rainfall forecasting data and the identification of rainfall pattern in this study the rainfall forecasting data for august 7 2020 were used as the sample data for early warning it has a time resolution of 10 min and lead forecast time relative to the measured rainfall data of 120 min for missing and discontinuous data the rainfall forecasting data were filtered by artificial elimination and piecewise linear interpolation through rainfall pattern recognition the rainfall event was categorized as the second rainfall type the second step was the ponding prediction process to determine the rainfall pattern prediction results were obtained by inputting rainfall forecasting data into the tv bma model the third step involved providing an early warning the maximum depth of the inundation process was used as the classification standard for early warning and was divided into four classes 0 3 cm 3 10 cm 10 25 cm and 25 cm wu et al 2020 the early warning results were determined using classification standards and gis notably urban flood warning is a process of dynamic adjustment with rainfall forecasting data because new rainfall forecasting data are generated continuously the early warning process must be repeated at every moment and the early warning results should be dynamically adjusted additionally for each updated early warning process if the measured rainfall occurred before the first step of the warning the measured and forecasted rainfall data should be input into the tv bma model during the second step of the warning if only the rainfall forecasting data are input into the model the results lack the impact of early rainfall on ponding which leads to a large deviation in the ponding prediction in this study the first 120 min before ponding was considered as the scope of the urban flood forecast period to analyze the early warning accuracy of the tv bma model under different forecast periods 10 min 20 min and 120 min as shown in fig 12 the ponding degree in the eastern and northern regions of zhengzhou city was smaller than that in the other areas the main reason for this is that the northern region of zhengzhou city is close to the yellow river wetlands and grasslands accounted for a large proportion of this region rainfall intercepts after reaching the surface making it difficult to form serious ponding as the eastern region of zhengzhou city is a newly built urban area the design drainage capacity of the urban pipe network is high and can resist large rainfall events therefore the ponding degree in the eastern region of zhengzhou city was also smaller in contrast the ponding points with serious ponding were primarily distributed in the middle region of zhengzhou city it is the most densely populated area with early urban construction a low design drainage capacity of the pipe network and a substantial proportion of impervious areas therefore serious ponding can form more easily in this region compared to the other regions fig 13 presents the accuracy of early warning results of the tv bma model under different forecast periods owing to the extension of the forecast period the early warning accuracy of the tv bma model gradually decreased however the forecast period and accuracy were a contradictory problem during urban flood early warning high early warning accuracy is necessary to ensure its effectiveness and a long forecast period is required for flood control and response from rescue personnel if the f score exceeding 0 8 was considered to meet the requirements of early warning accuracy the longest forecast period for the tv bma model meeting the early warning accuracy was 100 min however for the forecast period of 110 min and 120 min the f score of tv bma model was reduced to 0 767 and 0 71 respectively which could not meet the accuracy requirements of the early warning for urban floods 5 discussion 5 1 comparative analysis of tv bma and four benchmark models in terms of model accuracy the results in section 4 2 demonstrate that the accuracy of tv bma is improved by 43 6 50 4 compared with an individual benchmark model but only by 11 4 compared with the bma model this is because the bma obtained more accurate prediction results by integrating three individual models reducing the scope for further accuracy improvement fig 9 indicates that the tv bma model shows significant potential for correcting the prediction deviation of the benchmark models which is a significant advantage of the tv bma model in terms of computational efficiency the tv bma model showed a longer running time 5 21 s than the benchmark models the tv bma model must use the time varying criterion to derive the weighted average of the benchmark models at each time node nevertheless the running time of 5 21 s is negligible for urban flood prediction and early warning in terms of model stability the results in section 4 4 demonstrate that the tv bma model significantly reduces the uncertainty of the prediction results of the benchmark models this is another significant advantage over the benchmark models therefore although the accuracy of the tv bma model was only 11 4 higher than that of the bma model the tv bma model showed outstanding advantages in correcting the prediction deviation of the benchmark models and in reducing the uncertainty of the prediction results 5 2 effect of rainfall type on tv bma model to analyze the influence of rainfall pattern clustering on the prediction performance of the tv bma model the difference in accuracy between the non clustered and clustered models was quantitatively analyzed through a controlled experiment as shown in fig 14 the ae of the clustered tv bma model was lower than that of the non clustered tv bma model at different stages of the inundation process the main reason is that the non clustered tv bma model did not consider the influence of the rainfall pattern on the weighted average of the model and always derived the same weighted average for different types of rainfall events however the prediction accuracy of the model may show significant differences among different types of prediction tasks this difference affected the prediction accuracy of the non clustered tv bma model therefore the prediction accuracy of the non clustered tv bma model was lower than that of the clustered tv bma model proposed in this study this also demonstrates that rainfall pattern clustering can improve the prediction accuracy of the tv bma model at different stages of the inundation process for both the non clustered and clustered models the ae showed the same trend of first increasing and then decreasing fig 14 this result indicates that the model has a high prediction performance for a lower ponding depth however the opposite conclusion is drawn from fig 12 e it shows that some prediction results appeared outside the 20 error band when the water depth was less than 0 25 m whereas when the ponding depth was 0 25 m all prediction results were within the 20 error band this indicates that the model has a higher prediction performance for a higher ponding depth the main reason for this contradiction is the different accuracy evaluation indices the ponding depth was low during the beginning and end stages of the inundation process but the re was more sensitive to smaller values therefore although the ae of the prediction results was not large some prediction results appeared outside the 20 error band in the beginning and end stages in contrast during the middle period of the inundation process the model shows a lower re under a larger ae because the sensitivity of the re decreases with an increase in ponding depth 5 3 sources of uncertainty in early warning results the uncertainty sources of the early warning results include the errors of the model and input data rainfall forecasting data although the tv bma model improves the prediction accuracy by integrating the results of multiple models and significantly reduces the uncertainty of the model it has some error and uncertainty as shown in fig 15 when the measured rainfall data for august 7 2020 was input into the tv bma model the early warning result had an error of 6 3 this may be attributed to the model failing to accurately represent the nonlinear relationship between the driving factors and target variables under limited samples in the future with the increase in the sample data the error and uncertainty of the model can be further reduced however the accuracy of rainfall forecasting data decreases significantly with the increase in the forecast period which affects the early warning performance of the model therefore the error in rainfall forecasting data is an important source of uncertainty in early warning systems when the rainfall forecasting data were used as the input data fig 15 the accuracy of the early warning results of the tv bma model decreased from 92 8 to 71 8 with the extension of the forecast period although the forecast period of the tv bma model can reach 100 min to ensure 80 precision the influence of rainfall forecasting data on early warning accuracy increased significantly when the forecast period exceeded 50 min consequently the accuracy of the model was only 78 1 in early warning results with a forecast period of 110 min therefore future research should focus on methods to improve the accuracy of rainfall forecasting data this is a challenging and significant research area and a solution to this problem can lead to a breakthrough change in predicting urban flooding and providing early warning 6 conclusion in this study an integrated urban flood prediction model was proposed based on an improved bma algorithm using a time varying criterion by considering the influence of rainfall patterns on the model performance the aim of the study was to improve the accuracy and stability of urban flood prediction and provide early warning first the rainfall patterns in the study area were determined using clustering and the mann kendall test subsequently a model selection based on coupling time varying criterion and model averaging was proposed to improve the prediction performance of the bma model finally the improved bma model tv bma was applied for providing the early warning of urban floods based on the rainfall forecasting data and the tv bma model a rolling early warning of urban floods at ponding points can be obtained zhengzhou city was considered as an example case the results indicate that the tv bma model effectively improved the accuracy and stability of the predictive results obtained by the benchmark models the prediction accuracy of the tv bma model was 11 4 50 4 higher than that of the four benchmark models and the uncertainty bandwidth of the tv bma model was 19 1 53 1 lower than that of the benchmark models although the results show that the performance of each benchmark model is excellent tables 2 and 3 a few cases of large prediction deviations were observed in each benchmark model fig 9 however all the prediction results of the tv bma model were within the 20 error band when water depth exceeded 0 2 m this suggests that the tv bma model has outstanding advantages in correcting these prediction deviations the accurate and stable ponding prediction results obtained using this model can provide an important reference for urban flood control including the reasonable allocation of urban flood control resources effective organization of flood response and emergency rescue the early warning results revealed that the tv bma model has high accuracy in the early warning results of no more than a 100 min forecast period f score 0 8 the comprehensive urban flood prediction model proposed herein based on time varying criteria can provide a more accurate and stable prediction of urban floods and may provide guidance for improving the existing urban flood prediction methods the proposed model exhibited a high computational efficiency and stable performance it effectively integrates the advantages of the benchmark and bma models by calculating the weighted average of each model for different rainfall patterns at each time node however the proposed model highly relies on historical observations the model may have some errors and uncertainties when the sample data is limited in contrast urban flood models with physical mechanisms rely less on historical observations and mainly depend on the modelers understanding of urban flood mechanisms therefore future research can attempt to add physical models with urban flood mechanism to the integrated learning framework additionally with the future development of artificial intelligence and computer technology the addition of new models suitable for the prediction of urban floods may achieve higher results future research can explore the impact of different combinations and numbers of models on the performance of integrated prediction models credit authorship contribution statement yihong zhou methodology validation writing review editing

2226,satellite radar altimetry is an important tool for monitoring water levels of inland water bodies particularly in poorly gauged or ungauged areas this study reveals for the first time the performance of water levels derived from sentinel 3a altimetry in the songhua river basin in northeast china this study compares water levels derived via different retrackers samosa ocog ocean mwapp and nppr from altimetry in virtual stations vss to water levels measured by gauges to improve the influence of sandbars or islands and surrounding land cover a modified retracker called ampd pf automatic multiscale based peak detection retracker using physically based model fitting is implemented here by combing the physical modeling of sar altimeter waveform with a shortest path algorithm to find the best possible sub waveform representing the signal of water bodies the accuracy assessment is based on comparing water level anomalies from 26 vss and those from the nearest adjacent gauges with an average distance of 8 98 km in the songhua river basin from 2016 to 2019 the median of the root mean square error rmse differences at the virtual stations ranges from 0 46 to 0 82 m and the median of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse among different retracker varies from 0 49 to 0 85 among different retracker the performance of sentinel 3a altimetry in the songhua river basin is not poor results also show a highest accuracy of water levels from ampd pf especially for the non flood season january to june and october to december in addition we find that especially for the virtual stations unaffected by the sand bars and islands ampd pf give the best performance with a median rmse value of 0 33 m and a median nse value of 0 86 factor analysis indicates that the variations of these metrics can not be directly related to the river width but might be related to the cultivated land types and the presence of sand bars and islands in the vicinity of rivers over the songhua river basin moreover it is confirmed that a near parallel orientation of the river with respect to the satellite ground track often leads to poorer performance at virtual stations this suggests that if one is aiming at calibrating a hydrodynamic or hydrological model by combining altimetry the vss with the near parallel orientation are not necessary to be considered when the percentage of the non parallel crossings of all crossings is big enough keywords radar altimetry retracking rivers sentinel 3a songhua river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rivers play an important role in regulating and distributing water resources in the water cycle which are also good proxy indicators of the sustainable development of regional economies and climate change birkett 1998 river water level is a fundamental quantity of river hydrology hydraulics monitoring river water levels is critical for water resource management and flood management bjerklie et al 2003 berry et al 2005 the rapid development of remote sensing technology makes it possible to monitor river water levels but satellite radar altimetry over small rivers remains with limited accuracy feng et al 2019 bjerklie et al 2003 in some regions or countries the density of hydrological gauge stations is very limited e g africa or in situ data cannot be used publicly e g china vörösmarty et al 2001 leading to the development of approaches such as satellite remote sensing for deriving river discharge and quantifying spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water gleick 2003 since the 1990s satellite radar altimeters have been widely used as another tool for monitoring large lakes and rivers birkett 1998 berry et al 2005 seyler et al 2013 coss et al 2020 with jason and sentinel series satellite altimetry has matured from research oriented satellite missions to service oriented monitoring missions with a guarantee of long term availability and high spatial coverage getirana 2010 jiang et al 2020 chen and liao 2020 the application of synthetic aperture radar sar technology and open loop tracking mode make it possible to monitor water levels over small and medium sized rivers maillard et al 2015 bogning et al 2018 huang et al 2018 normandin et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 kittel et al 2021 however for small and medium sized rivers width less than 300 m with large hydrological variability not enough information is available on the performance of monitoring water levels by using altimeters in addition due to the delayed doppler technique the sar altimeter waveform has a steeper leading edge and a faster decaying trailing edge raney 1998 and the echo waveform shows more complex multi peak patterns when affected by land signals many retracking algorithms have been developed to mitigate the influence of land signals such as multiple waveform persistent peak retracker mwapp villadsen et al 2016 narrow primary peak retracker nppr jain et al 2015 and automatic multiscale based peak detection retracker ampdr chen et al 2021 dinardo et al 2018 proposed a processing chain to redefine l1b products for rivers by considering hamming weighting zero padding and a higher posting rate which can offer products with more observations although a high posting rate product can provide more observations the waveform will become more complex in small and medium sized rivers especially for high mountains and braided rivers in this respect how to make full use of all the effective observations and improve accuracy is an issue that needs to be addressed when monitoring small and medium sized rivers the impact of surrounding environments on the altimeter is stronger maillard et al 2015 pointed out that land cover types along the satellite track before and after crossing the river river morphology at the satellite crossing and the topography of the land surrounding the river may affect the measurements although they did not explore how land cover types will affect the measurements an interpretation key was built to help understand how the factors control the precision of the water level derived by altimetry actually the impact of land cover on altimeter measurements is complicated and different studies have different conclusions maillard et al 2015 halicki and niedzielski 2022 in addition many studies suggested that river width may not be a factor limiting the performance of altimetry santos da silva et al 2010 maillard et al 2015 jiang et al 2020 apart from the land covers and river morphology the performance of altimetric data may also be limited by other bright targets in the vicinity of the river sand bars islands or small water bodies jiang et al 2020 what is the influence of these environmental factors on the altimetry data and in which situations are the impact relatively light this is of great significance for combining altimetry data and hydrological models the overall objective of the study is to reveal the accuracy of water levels from the sentinel 3a over the songhua river basin with a challenging morphology varied sand bars islands and land cover types by using different retrackers then the influence of several factors sand bars and islands river morphology and the land cover types in its vicinity on the altimetric measurements is discussed in detail this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the study area the data used and the detailed methodology employed section 3 validates retrieved water levels reveals the accuracy of songhua river basin srb water levels and explores the influence of several factors section 4 and section 5 present the discussion and conclusion of this study respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the songhua river basin srb is located in northeast china it is the third largest river in china with a width ranging from 40 m to 2000 m songliao river conservancy commission 2015 and the largest tributary of the amur river covering a total land area of 556 800 km2 two major tributaries drain the srb the nenjiang river and the second songhua river which originated from the greater khingan range paektu mountain and the south changbai mountain respectively srb is characterized by upper subpolar westerlies and a monsoon climate of medium latitudes winter is cold and long summer is rainy and some areas are sub frigid zone chen and liao 2020 affected by the extreme flatness of the downstream intensive rainfall in summer many severe floods occurred in the last decade it is crucial to monitor its hydrological characteristics such as water level and discharge in this study 26 virtual stations vs are selected based on their distance to gauge stations the nearest gauge stations with a distance smaller than 35 km as shown in fig 1 some vss are located in different tribute rivers which allows us to evaluate the performance of sentinel 3a for diverse river azimuths and widths in srb 2 2 data 2 2 1 altimeter data sentinel 3 level 2 data during 2016 2019 are collected from two datasets 1 the copernicus open access hub service scihub available at 2 the esa earthconsole altimetry virtual lab avl sarvatore sar versatile altimetric toolkit for ocean research exploitation service available at https earthconsole eu the copernicus scihub service provides standard sentinel 3 data with a canonic posting rate at 20hz retrackers are the empirical ocog offset center of gravity retracker wingham et al 1986 and samosa ocean retracker raney 1998 the earthconsole sarvatore service provides a specific processing at l1b l2 adjustable to specific requirements in this study the processing configuration tailored for inland water was used which consists of posting rate at 80hz and level 1 processing as defined in dinardo et al 2018 in details first a hamming weighting window is applied to the burst data second an approximate beam steering is applied to make the doppler footprints relocated and third a zero padding prior to the range fft is applied to improve the sampling efficiency of peaky echoes from bright targets finally a double extension of the receiving window is applied to mitigate the influence on rough topography in the level 2 dataset from sarvatore the samosa retracker is used dinardo et al 2018 2 2 2 gauge station data in this study water levels from 21 hydrological gauge stations on the songhua river and some tributary rivers are collected from the chinese hydrological yearbook issued by the ministry of water resources of china mwr 2011 seen in table 1 this dataset is the only available source for daily gauged water levels and discharges with data editing and quality control which has been extensively used in the published literature huang et al 2018 miao et al 2022 2 2 3 ancillary data to select the footprint available on the river a river mask is needed we have adopted the vector river mask produced by jrc global surface water pekel et al 2016 with a 50 probability digital elevation data from the ace 2 https sedac ciesin columbia edu data set dedc ace v2 berry et al 2010 was also acquired to remove the water level with a bias larger than 30 m compared to the dem land cover at a 30 meter resolution from globeland30 jun et al 2014 was acquired to analyze the influence of land cover on sentinel 3a 2 3 methods 2 3 1 water level extraction for extracting water levels it is necessary to select ground tracks and valid footprints falling on the rivers using a river mask in this study a 150 m buffer zone is created for for river mask to select available observations which were regarded as unreliable in most previous research huang et al 2018 these increased observations could contain helpful information for monitoring inland water bodies the range between the altimeter and the reflecting surface is obtained from the time duration during the two way travel then the surface height is derived from the difference between the altitude of the altimeter and the range 1 h a l t r range δ r corr δ r retrack n geoid where alt is the satellite altitude r range is the distance between the altimeter and water surface δ r corr is the correction of the atmosphere ionospheric dry tropospheric and wet tropospheric and geophysical corrections solid earth tide pole tide and ocean tide δ r retrack is the retracking correction n geoid is the geoid height with respect to the ellipsoid the 2008 earth gravitational model egm2008 pavlis et al 2012 was used in this study 2 3 2 waveform retracking the waveforms for inland water bodies are easily contaminated by land signals or are dominated by other bright target signals waveform retracking plays an essential role in improving the contamination of land signals in this study we use the samosa retracker dinardo et al 2018 from the sarvatore dataset to compare samosa with other widely used retrackers we also consider ocog and samosa ocean from the copernicus dataset and implement mwapp villadsen et al 2016 and nppr jain et al 2015 on the waveforms of the copernicus dataset in addition we develop an update for rivers of the ampd pf retracker automatic multiscale based peak detection retracker using physically based model fitting chen et al 2021 the retracker is used to retrack the waveforms processed with the sarvatore dataset the waveform model used in ampd pf is the samosa2 5 waveform model stm esls 2019 the return power p is 2 p k l p u k 0 s w h m s s p u b k l m s s g l s w h f 0 g l s w h k k 0 t k l m s s g l s w h σ z 2 l z 2 f 1 g l s w h k k 0 where k refers to the range index vector within the received waveform window l is the doppler index or beam pointed to the specific surface pu is the amplitude k 0 is the range index vector of epoch related to the surface height swh is the significant wave height set as a value close to zero in the inland river such as 1e 5 and mss is the mean square slope related to the surface roughness l z is vertical resolution σ z s w h 4 the terms b k l and t k l encompass the information related to the antenna pattern antenna mis pointing and surface radiation patterns g l refers to the doppler dependent l dilation term the function f 0 f 1 are defined in eq 40 in ray et al 2015 p u k 0 mss is the only three parameters that need to fit using actual waveforms ampd pf inherits the core function from ampd retracker developed for lakes which is to transform the problem of finding the optimal retracking water level into a shortest path optimization problem with certain constraints a flow diagram of the main steps followed by ampd pf to retrack each waveform is shown in fig 2 the steps followed by ampd pf are the following 1 choice of retracking with sub waveform or not 2 multiscale based adaptive sub waveform extraction 3 multiscale based adaptive sub waveform retracking calculation 4 determine the height threshold level heightthreshold 5 final determination of the retracking level by applying a shortest path algorithm step 1 is to judge whether the observations of the track available on the river are suitable for sub waveform retracking or not by using the pulse peakiness pp of the average waveform wfavg wfavg is calculated by aligning the current and the ten nearest waveforms then average point wise by the geometric mean method as shown in fig 3 b and fig 3 c if more than half of the observations in a specific track have a pulse peakiness of wfavg less than 0 01 then this track will not be retracked by the sub waveform strategy 3 pp p max i 5 n 5 p i step 2 is to extract multiscale based adaptive sub waveform using the local maximum scalogram method which is unchanged compared to ampd more details can be seen in chen et al 2021 step 3 is analogous to the ampd retracker but the multi scale sub waveform is fitted with the samosa2 5 model by setting the corresponding epoch of the maximum power in the sub waveform as the first guess epoch then calculating the multi scale sub waveform retracking water level step 4 is to determine a parameter heightthreshold used in step 5 first the corresponding height h wfavg of the 0 8 maximum of the primary peak from the average wfavg from step 1 are obtained for each observation then the cumulative distribution function cdf of all the h wfavg as shown in fig 3d is constructed finally the minimum second order difference quotient of the cdf is considered as heightthreshold details about the construction of cdf can be seen in chen et al 2021 in step 5 we apply a shortest path algorithm dijkstra 1959 to find the optimal retracking water level this method was first suggested in altimetry in roscher et al 2017 and later implemented in the ampd retracker chen et al 2021 in the present implementation step 5 is similar to ampd except for the edge weights of the distance graph here the weights account for the influence of heightthreshold as follows 4 w e i g h t node i node i 1 p a b s h node i 1 h node i 1 p a b s h e i g h t t h r e s h o l d h node i 1 where h node i is the height of the i th node of the distance graph 2 3 3 construction of water level time series any point level in each track yielding a difference larger than three times the standard deviation is removed after obtaining all the retracking river levels then we cluster the observations which defines a virtual point and a polygon for each gauge station fenoglio et al 2021 the altimeter measurements falling inside the polygon within a chosen distance is selected the river water level time series for the virtual stations are estimated using the method tshydro implemented in nielsen et al 2015 2 3 4 performance metrics and evaluation the validation is carried out using different retrackers and scales in this study the metrics will be evaluated in terms of relative heights to avoid influences of the difference in datum often unknown for the gauge measurements or the distance between the virtual station and the gauged station three performance metrics rmse nse and np are produced to quantify the agreement between in situ and altimeter water levels 4 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n 5 nse 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i is the water level anomaly y i is in situ water level anomaly rmse is the root mean square error nse is the nash sutcliffe efficiency and nse close to 1 indicates a good consistency of altimetry and in situ water levels in amplitude and phase np is the number of observations to be validated after removing the observations whose difference between water levels measured by gauges and water levels derived via sentinel 3 is larger than 5 m 3 results 3 1 validation and accuracy of water levels from sentinel 3a table a1 and fig 4 compare at 26 vss the water levels derived via different retrackers from altimetry to water levels measured by gauges ampd pf algorithm tends to have a little smaller rmse with a mean value of 0 52 m and a median value of 0 46 m and a larger nse with a mean value of 0 72 and a median value of 0 85 among all of the retrackers followed by ocog algorithm with a median rmse of 0 47 m and a median nse of 0 80 although samosa and ampd pf are not always good they are more stable when compared with ocean and ocog and with a smaller variation range moreover for those virtual stations with good performance there is no significant difference in terms of the accuracy among samosa ocog and ampd pf retrackers in addition at 15 out of the 26 vss nse from ampd pf is larger than 0 80 and the median value is the only one larger than 0 85 confirming the good quality and stability of the results compared to the nearest adjacent gauge heights the water level time series at vs 14 and 26 reveal nses smaller than 0 20 for nearly all the retrackers these stations are located in the complexity of river shapes which might be the reason for the small value of nse we also compared different retrackers using data for flood and non flood seasons separately table 2 and fig 5 show that the performance is different for the flood and non flood seasons for all the retrackers most of the results in the flood season are better than those in the whole period because there is less noise in the flood season with high flows in addition during the flood season the performance of samosa ocean ocog and ampd pf is similar with a median rmse of about 0 38 m in the non flood season the ampd pf retracker performs much better than the other retrackers with the lowest rmse with a median value of 0 46 m and highest nse with a median value of 0 67 mwapp and nppr retrackers show low nse and much higher rmse in non flood season this probably arises from multi peak waveforms from some other bright targets fig a2 a and fig a2 b which contradict the assumption of these two retrackers that the echo signals from the water body dominates the waveforms this is however not the case when other small water bodies or sand bars are around the river interestingly at vs 21 ampd pf performed similarly as ocog additionally ocog 0 13 m for rmse performs much better than other retrackers at vs 21 over flood seasons while ampd pf 0 12 m for rmse performs much better than other retrackers at vs 21 over non flood seasons a possible explanation is that vs 21 over flood season is affected less by land signals with a good quality waveform ocog considering the entire waveform performs better while vs 21 over non flood seasons can easily be affected by other signals with polluted waveform ampd pf considering sub waveform analysis performs better in summary samosa and ampd pf are found to be the most stable and robust between the retrackers analysed next we study the differences among retracking methods analyzing six vss located on the mainstream of songhua river and second songhua river fig 6 the river level time series derived by the samosa and ampd pf algorithm agrees well with gauge station data in most situations however some problems still exist when dealing with some special situations for example when two sub waveforms are very close fig a2 c and fig a2 d nearly all the retrackers perform poorly in fig 6 f vs 20 is the virtual station with two tracks on the river and a small lake nearby which may affect the signals returned from the river according to the analysis above the median rmse among different retrackers is larger than 0 45 m and the median nse among different retrackers is smaller than 0 90 indicating that sentinel 3a performs moderately in srb as compared to the zambezi basin kittel et al 2021 and the ogooué river bogning et al 2018 3 2 factors controlling altimetric measurements monitoring river levels using altimetry can be affected by surrounding bright targets such as small water bodies sand bars and islands and by river morphology factors such as river width and river azimuth maillard et al 2015 halicki and niedzielski 2022 additionally the land cover surrounding the river indirectly influences the radar echo signals in this section these factors will be analyzed in detail table 3 lists the information of different factors in 26 vss 3 2 1 sand bars and islands sand bars and islands widely exist in the songhua river basin which affects the data quality of altimetry based on retracking a modeled waveform with fitting a single peak waveform ocean and samosa retrackers are sensitive to other bright targets therefore except for ampd pf we also consider the results of the two retrackers to evaluate how sand bars and islands affected the performance of sentinel 3a in srb as shown in fig 7 the performance of the retracking algorithm is significantly worse when the measurement is affected by the sand bars and islands additionally when affected by sand bars and islands the ampd pf performs better in flood seasons than in non flood seasons as compared with samosa and ocean in contrast when not affected the performance of the retrackers is similar in flood and non flood seasons this indicated that high levels in flood season are more accurate and may be less contaminated by sand bars and islands this also demonstrated that the ampd pf accuracy could improve significantly when more effective observations are introduced along the track moreover the three retrackers perform similarly for the whole year when affected by sand bars and islands it seems challenging to eliminate the influence of sand bars and islands by only improving retracking methods it may be necessary to combine other prior knowledge with river morphology by neglecting the vss affected by sand bars and islands a median rmse of 0 33 m is obtained with ampd pf which is remarkably smaller than 0 46 m for samosa and 0 45 m for ocean 3 2 2 land cover the characteristic behavior of radar reflection from different land cover is significantly different maillard et al 2015 to analyze which land cover affects the performance of sentinel 3a the land cover structure in the 1 km buffer of each vs was obtained and compared with the rmse of ampd pf as shown in fig 8 we found that except for forests there is no significant correlation between the percentage of different land cover and nse of ampd pf however the average portions of the forest are only 4 85 which could not be the main impact factor two land cover types water bodies and riverine wetlands will not be considered as the impact factor because they are already included in the river extent to quantify comparison the average percentage of land cover for 26 vss with higher and lower nse and rmse values is summarized in table 4 cultivated land types such as rice paddy and corn and grass land types show different portions in the higher and lower metrics indicating that these two land cover types may influence the sentinel 3a in srb however multi impact factors affect radar altimetry signals at the same time therefore to analyze the degrees of influence of the land covers we separate the different factors in the next section 3 2 3 river morphology factors although it is generally acknowledged that altimetry performs better over large water bodies the results in this study do not show a significant correlation between the performance of sentinel 3a and river width as shown in table 2 the three vss vs 1 vs 4 and vs 5 with large widths of more than 1000 m show a poor rmse comparatively vs 24 with only 84 m river width performs well with an rmse of 0 32 m to avoid the uncertainty of results in only one study area results from the previous study bogning et al 2018 normandin et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 kittel et al 2021 halicki and niedzielski 2022 are collected and combined with our results in fig 9 to show the relationship between river width and performance of sentinel 3a we observe that rmse is mainly smaller than 1 m therefore we only consider the case smaller than 1 m in the following analysis although different methods to evaluate the performance are used we assumed that the statistics of these results would deliver a negative correlation if the relationship between the river width and the performance of sentinel 3a exists fig 9 bottom shows that river width is positively correlated to the rmse which suggests a contrary to the assumption therefore the relationship is not significant or even nonexistent sentinel 3a can provide measurements for small to medium rivers as good as large ones this indicated that the river width may only constrain the number of observations and whether the river can be monitored by altimetry or not and the river width does not necessarily affect the accuracy for rivers larger than 50 m width some previous studies suggest that river azimuths can affect the result in various ways maillard et al 2015 jiang et al 2020 halicki and niedzielski 2022 in this study we explore how river azimuths influence the performance of sentinel 3a in the srb by separating different impact factors sand bars and islands land covers and river azimuths to quantify the influence of river azimuths the orientation with respect to the satellite ground track was obtained from google earth in fig 10 the 26 vss selected for this study are subdivided into four categories according to orientation accuracy affected by sand bars or not and two land cover type for orientation subdivision is made into near parallel x 30 slanting 30 x 60 and near perpendicular 60 x 90 orientation for rmse subdivision is made into good performance x 0 3 moderate performance 0 3 x 0 6 and poor performance x greater than 0 6 it can be seen clearly in fig 10 a and fig 10 d that sand bars affect the performance of sentinel 3a after separating the influence of sand bars we find that the vss with poor performance are mainly distributed throughout near parallel orientation while the vss with moderate and good performance were distributed throughout slanting and near perpendicular orientation although two vss in slanting orientation show poor performance they may be affected by more than 50 cultivated land type however vss with less influence from cultivated land type still show poor performance in near parallel orientation which indicates that the degree of influence of orientation may be stronger than that of cultivated land as shown in fig 10 b e no matter ampd pf or samosa show poor rmse in near parallel orientation 23 of all crossing with a median value of 0 73 m and 0 71 m respectively in contrast the results in slanting and near perpendicular orientation are similar from fig 10 c f nse also shows a similar conclusion in near parallel orientation with a median value of 0 56 and 0 53 respectively both in slanting and near perpendicular orientation the median of nse of ampd pf is larger than 0 85 showing similar performance in general the near parallel orientation influences the performance at most while the accuracy is higher in slanting and near perpendicular orientation this could be explained as the satellite track moving or shifting at different cycles some tracks will be near the river bank therefore when the river is near parallel to the track some tracks will be strongly influenced by land signals resulting in poor performance for those near parallel tracks herein we suggest that if one is aiming at calibrating a hydrodynamic or hydrological model by combining altimetry the vss with near parallel orientation are not necessary to be considered when the percentage of the non parallel crossings such as 77 investigated here of all crossings is big enough the observation with near parallel orientation may result in overestimating high flows and underestimating low flows 4 discussion for small and medium sized braided rivers the performance of altimetry is not very good due to the complexity of the river shape in addition sand bars and other bright targets contaminate the signals from water bodies posing an even more severe challenge to water level retrieval we implemented a modified retracker ampd pf to improve this situation by combing the physical modeling of sar altimeter waveform with the shortest path algorithm the ampd pf mainly focuses on improving the accuracy over non flood seasons with a median rmse of 0 44 m and a median nse of 0 67 however in the flood season the accuracy of water level from ampd pf is not improved with a similar median rmse value 0 38 m compared to ocean ocog and samosa in this study the number of observations is increased as it considers other available observations within the buffer zone of river mask it should be noted that a 150 m buffer zone around river masks is significant for monitoring river levels with a width smaller than 100 m for instance vs 24 located on the nemo er tributary river with only 84 m river width cannot be effectively monitored by considering the footprint available on the river mask but can be monitored with reasonable accuracy 0 32 m for ampd pf and 0 35 m for samosa by considering observations in the vicinity of the river indeed the 150 m buffer zone also introduces an additional uncertainty for the observation even though after removing large biases by comparing with dem this is still a problem to be solved in the future in general the accuracy of the sentinel 3a water levels over the songhua river basin is moderate as compared to the zambezi basin and ogooué river the median rmse of different retrackers is larger than 0 45 m and the median nse of different retrackers is smaller than 0 90 the obtained rmse values 0 11 2 76 m from different retracker agree well with the results of other studies evaluating the accuracy of sentinel 3a in different regions huang et al 2018 bogning et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 kittel et al 2021 nevertheless a comparison of four virtual stations shows in our study a smaller rmse than the rmse given by jiang et al 2020 as shown in table 5 the different results probably arise from a different posting rate in the l1b processing and a different gauge data jiang et al 2020 used a lower resolution 20hz while a higher resolution 80hz is used in this study actually the high posting rate increases the number of effective observations which is beneficial for monitoring small and medium sized rivers but also lowers the signal to noise ratio bringing new problems to the retracking algorithm donlon et al 2021 egido et al 2021 this is another reason for using ampd pf in this study to mitigate the problem of the signal to noise ratio of the high posting rate data many studies found that environmental factors and land cover may have a negative effect on the accuracy of altimetry huang et al 2018 argued that the altimeter might remain locked on the top of mountains degrading the accuracy of satellite altimetry when monitoring the river level in high mountains normandin et al 2018 and jiang et al 2020 suggested that the small water bodies close to the river may result in the wrong retracked range due to the strong reflectance from lakes this study analyses the degrees of influence of sand bars and islands land cover and river morphology factors we found no significant correlation between the river width and the performance of sentinel 3 which is similar to the conclusions from maillard et al 2015 and jiang et al 2020 by subdividing different impact factors we found that sand bars and islands significantly affect the performance of vss over the non flood season to some extent the proposed retracking can only improve the situation affected by other bright targets we believe that it is difficult to eliminate the influence only by retracking combining with other prior knowledge about river morphology may help to solve this problem the cultivated land type will significantly influence the data quality throughout the track with slanting orientations of the river with respect to satellite ground tracks which is opposite to the land cover related findings of halicki and niedzielski 2022 who argued that land cover is not an essential factor influencing the data quality this may be because of the relatively concentrated cultivated land such as rice paddy and corn in the vicinity of the vss in srb which is more likely to corrupt the altimetric waveforms by strong reflections therefore land covers types might have different influences on different rivers depending on the local environment after separating different influence factors the degree of influence of orientation is stronger than that of cultivated land when the river is near parallel to the track orientation is smaller than 30 to be specific near parallel orientation of the river with respect to the satellite ground track often leads to poorer performance at virtual stations 5 conclusions this study compared the water level anomalies between the 26 virtual stations and the nearest adjacent gauges in the songhua river basin we implemented different retracking methods to retrieve water level time series a comparison between water levels from sentinel 3a altimetry and those from gauges shows that due to the complexity of river shapes sentinel 3a performs moderately in songhua river basin as compared to zambezi basin and ogooué river with a median rmse larger than 0 45 m and a median nes smaller than 0 90 among the retrackers investigated here specifically the performance of samosa ocean ocog and ampd pf is similar with a median rmse of about 0 38 m during the flood season however ampd pf outperformed the other retrackers ocog ocean samosa mwapp and nppr during the non flood season with a median rmse of about 0 44 m although ocog ranks second in our assessment the performance is not stable compared to samosa and ampd pf mwapp and nppr perform poorly for some of the vss analysis of the waveforms reveals that the main reason is due to multi peak waveforms from the bright target in addition three environmental factors controlling altimetric measurements have been analyzed in detail 1 sand bars and islands 2 land cover and 3 river morphology the altimetric waveforms are often corrupted by strong reflections from sand bars and islands which results in complex multi waveforms especially over the non flood season we suggest that while several different land cover types are present in the songhua river basin only cultivated land such as rice paddy and corn significantly influences the performance we found that for rivers larger than 50 m width there is no evidence that river width adversely affects the accuracy in contrast we find that sentinel 3 water level retrievals deteriorate if the ground track orientation with respect to the river is below about 30 and that the degree of influence of the orientation may be stronger than that of cultivated land types credit authorship contribution statement jiaming chen

2226,satellite radar altimetry is an important tool for monitoring water levels of inland water bodies particularly in poorly gauged or ungauged areas this study reveals for the first time the performance of water levels derived from sentinel 3a altimetry in the songhua river basin in northeast china this study compares water levels derived via different retrackers samosa ocog ocean mwapp and nppr from altimetry in virtual stations vss to water levels measured by gauges to improve the influence of sandbars or islands and surrounding land cover a modified retracker called ampd pf automatic multiscale based peak detection retracker using physically based model fitting is implemented here by combing the physical modeling of sar altimeter waveform with a shortest path algorithm to find the best possible sub waveform representing the signal of water bodies the accuracy assessment is based on comparing water level anomalies from 26 vss and those from the nearest adjacent gauges with an average distance of 8 98 km in the songhua river basin from 2016 to 2019 the median of the root mean square error rmse differences at the virtual stations ranges from 0 46 to 0 82 m and the median of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse among different retracker varies from 0 49 to 0 85 among different retracker the performance of sentinel 3a altimetry in the songhua river basin is not poor results also show a highest accuracy of water levels from ampd pf especially for the non flood season january to june and october to december in addition we find that especially for the virtual stations unaffected by the sand bars and islands ampd pf give the best performance with a median rmse value of 0 33 m and a median nse value of 0 86 factor analysis indicates that the variations of these metrics can not be directly related to the river width but might be related to the cultivated land types and the presence of sand bars and islands in the vicinity of rivers over the songhua river basin moreover it is confirmed that a near parallel orientation of the river with respect to the satellite ground track often leads to poorer performance at virtual stations this suggests that if one is aiming at calibrating a hydrodynamic or hydrological model by combining altimetry the vss with the near parallel orientation are not necessary to be considered when the percentage of the non parallel crossings of all crossings is big enough keywords radar altimetry retracking rivers sentinel 3a songhua river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction

hydrological variability not enough information is available on the performance of monitoring water levels by using altimeters in addition due to the delayed doppler technique the sar altimeter

have been developed to mitigate the influence of land signals such as multiple waveform persistent peak retracker mwapp villadsen et al 2016 narrow primary peak retracker nppr jain et al 2015 and automatic multiscale based peak detection retracker ampdr chen et al 2021 dinardo et al 2018 proposed a processing chain to redefine l1b products for rivers by considering hamming weighting zero padding and a higher posting rate which can offer products with more observations although a high posting rate product can provide more observations the waveform will become more complex in small and medium sized rivers especially for high mountains and braided rivers in this respect how to make full use of all the effective observations and improve accuracy is an issue that needs to be addressed when monitoring small and medium sized rivers the impact of surrounding environments on the altimeter is stronger maillard et al 2015 pointed out that land cover types along the satellite track before and after crossing the river river morphology at the satellite crossing and the topography of the land surrounding the river may affect the measurements although they did not explore how land cover types will affect the measurements an interpretation key was built to help understand how the factors control the precision of the water level derived by altimetry actually the impact of land cover on altimeter measurements is complicated and different studies have different conclusions maillard et al 2015 halicki and niedzielski 2022 in addition many studies suggested that river width may not be a factor limiting the performance of altimetry santos da silva et al 2010 maillard et al 2015 jiang et al 2020 apart from the land covers and river morphology the performance of altimetric data may also be limited by other bright targets in the vicinity of the river sand bars islands or small water bodies jiang et al 2020 what is the influence of these environmental factors on the altimetry data and in which situations are the impact relatively light this is of great significance for combining altimetry data and hydrological models the overall objective of the study is to reveal the accuracy of water levels from the sentinel 3a over the songhua river basin with a challenging morphology varied sand bars islands and land cover types by using different retrackers then the influence of several factors sand bars and islands river morphology and the land cover types in its vicinity on the altimetric measurements is discussed in detail this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the study area the data used and the detailed methodology employed section 3 validates retrieved water levels reveals the accuracy of songhua river basin srb water levels and explores the influence of several factors section 4 and section 5 present the discussion and conclusion of this study respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the songhua river basin srb is located in northeast china it is the third largest river in china with a width ranging from 40 m to 2000 m songliao river conservancy commission 2015 and the largest tributary of the amur river covering a total land area of 556 800 km2 two major tributaries drain the srb the nenjiang river and the second songhua river which originated from the greater khingan range paektu mountain and the south changbai mountain respectively srb is characterized by upper subpolar westerlies and a monsoon climate of medium latitudes winter is cold and long summer is rainy and some areas are sub frigid zone chen and liao 2020 affected by the extreme flatness of the downstream intensive rainfall in summer many severe floods occurred in the last decade it is crucial to monitor its hydrological characteristics such as water level and discharge in this study 26 virtual stations vs are selected based on their distance to gauge stations the nearest gauge stations with a distance smaller than 35 km as shown in fig 1 some vss are located in different tribute rivers which allows us to evaluate the performance of sentinel 3a for diverse river azimuths and widths in srb 2 2 data 2 2 1 altimeter data sentinel 3 level 2 data during 2016 2019 are collected from two datasets 1 the copernicus open access hub service scihub available at 2 the esa earthconsole altimetry virtual lab avl sarvatore sar versatile altimetric toolkit for ocean research exploitation service available at https earthconsole eu the copernicus scihub service provides standard sentinel 3 data with a canonic posting rate at 20hz retrackers are the empirical ocog offset center of gravity retracker wingham et al 1986 and samosa ocean retracker raney 1998 the earthconsole sarvatore service provides a specific processing at l1b l2 adjustable to specific requirements in this study the processing configuration tailored for inland water was used which consists of posting rate at 80hz and level 1 processing as defined in dinardo et al 2018 in details first a hamming weighting window is applied to the burst data second an approximate beam steering is applied to make the doppler footprints relocated and third a zero padding prior to the range fft is applied to improve the sampling efficiency of peaky echoes from bright targets finally a double extension of the receiving window is applied to mitigate the influence on rough topography in the level 2 dataset from sarvatore the samosa retracker is used dinardo et al 2018 2 2 2 gauge station data in this study water levels from 21 hydrological gauge stations on the songhua river and some tributary rivers are collected from the chinese hydrological yearbook issued by the ministry of water resources of china mwr 2011 seen in table 1 this dataset is the only available source for daily gauged water levels and discharges with data editing and quality control which has been extensively used in the published literature huang et al 2018 miao et al 2022 2 2 3 ancillary data to select the footprint available on the river a river mask is needed we have adopted the vector river mask produced by jrc global surface water pekel et al 2016 with a 50 probability digital elevation data from the ace 2 https sedac ciesin columbia edu data set dedc ace v2 berry et al 2010 was also acquired to remove the water level with a bias larger than 30 m compared to the dem land cover at a 30 meter resolution from globeland30 jun et al 2014 was acquired to analyze the influence of land cover on sentinel 3a 2 3 methods 2 3 1 water level extraction for extracting water levels it is necessary to select ground tracks and valid footprints falling on the rivers using a river mask in this study a 150 m buffer zone is created for for river mask to select available observations which were regarded as unreliable in most previous research huang et al 2018 these increased observations could contain helpful information for monitoring inland water bodies the range between the altimeter and the reflecting surface is obtained from the time duration during the two way travel then the surface height is derived from the difference between the altitude of the altimeter and the range 1 h a l t r range δ r corr δ r retrack n geoid where alt is the satellite altitude r range is the distance between the altimeter and water surface δ r corr is the correction of the atmosphere ionospheric dry tropospheric and wet tropospheric and geophysical corrections solid earth tide pole tide and ocean tide δ r retrack is the retracking correction n geoid is the geoid height with respect to the ellipsoid the 2008 earth gravitational model egm2008 pavlis et al 2012 was used in this study 2 3 2 waveform retracking the waveforms for inland water bodies are easily contaminated by land signals or are dominated by other bright target signals waveform retracking plays an essential role in improving the contamination of land signals in this study we use the samosa retracker dinardo et al 2018 from the sarvatore dataset to compare samosa with other widely used retrackers we also consider ocog and samosa ocean from the copernicus dataset and implement mwapp villadsen et al 2016 and nppr jain et al 2015 on the waveforms of the copernicus dataset in addition we develop an update for rivers of the ampd pf retracker automatic multiscale based peak detection retracker using physically based model fitting chen et al 2021 the retracker is used to retrack the waveforms processed with the sarvatore dataset the waveform model used in ampd pf is the samosa2 5 waveform model stm esls 2019 the return power p is 2 p k l p u k 0 s w h m s s p u b k l m s s g l s w h f 0 g l s w h k k 0 t k l m s s g l s w h σ z 2 l z 2 f 1 g l s w h k k 0 where k refers to the range index vector within the

wave height set as a value close to zero in the inland river such as 1e 5 and mss is the mean square slope related to the surface roughness l z is vertical resolution σ z s w h 4 the terms b k l and t k l encompass the information related to the antenna pattern antenna mis pointing and surface radiation patterns g l refers to the doppler dependent l dilation term the function f 0 f 1 are defined in eq 40 in ray et al 2015 p u k 0 mss is the only three parameters that need to fit using actual waveforms ampd pf inherits the core function from ampd retracker developed for lakes which is to transform the problem of finding the optimal retracking water level into a shortest path optimization problem with certain constraints a flow diagram of the main steps followed by ampd pf to retrack each waveform is shown in fig 2 the steps followed by ampd pf are the following 1 choice of retracking with sub waveform or not 2 multiscale based adaptive sub waveform extraction 3 multiscale based adaptive sub waveform retracking calculation 4 determine the height threshold level heightthreshold 5 final determination of the retracking level by applying a shortest path algorithm step 1 is to judge whether the observations of the track available on the river are suitable for sub waveform retracking or not by using the pulse peakiness pp of the average waveform wfavg wfavg is calculated by aligning the current and the ten nearest waveforms then average point wise by the geometric mean method as shown in fig 3 b and fig 3 c if more than half of the observations in a specific track have a pulse peakiness of wfavg less than 0 01 then this track will not be retracked by the sub waveform strategy 3 pp p max i 5 n 5 p i step 2 is to extract multiscale based adaptive sub waveform using the local maximum scalogram method which is unchanged compared to ampd more details can be seen in chen et al 2021 step 3 is analogous to the ampd retracker but the multi scale sub waveform is fitted with the samosa2 5 model by setting the corresponding epoch of the maximum power in the sub waveform as the first guess epoch then calculating the multi scale sub waveform retracking water level step 4 is to determine a parameter heightthreshold used in step 5 first the corresponding height h wfavg of the 0 8 maximum of the primary peak from the average wfavg from step 1 are obtained for each observation then the cumulative distribution function cdf of all the h wfavg as shown in fig 3d is constructed finally the minimum second order difference quotient of the cdf is considered as heightthreshold details about the construction of cdf can be seen in chen et al 2021 in step 5 we apply a shortest path algorithm dijkstra 1959 to find the optimal retracking water level this method was first suggested in altimetry in roscher et al 2017 and later implemented in the ampd retracker chen et al 2021 in the present implementation step 5 is similar to ampd except for the edge weights of the distance graph here the weights account for the influence of heightthreshold as follows 4 w e i g h t node i node i 1 p a b s h node i 1 h node i 1 p a b s h e i g h t t h r e s h o l d h node i 1 where h node i is the height of the i th node of the distance graph 2 3 3 construction of water level time series any point level in each track yielding a difference larger than three times the standard deviation is removed after obtaining all the retracking river levels then we cluster the observations which defines a virtual point and a polygon for each gauge station fenoglio et al 2021 the altimeter measurements falling inside the polygon within a chosen distance is selected the river water level time series for the virtual stations are estimated using the method tshydro implemented in nielsen et al 2015 2 3 4 performance metrics and evaluation the validation is carried out using different retrackers and scales in this study the metrics will be evaluated in terms of relative heights to avoid influences of the difference in datum often unknown for the gauge measurements or the distance between the virtual station and the gauged station three performance metrics rmse nse and np are produced to quantify the agreement between in situ and altimeter water levels 4 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n 5 nse 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i is the water level anomaly y i is in situ water level anomaly rmse is the root mean square error nse is the nash sutcliffe efficiency and nse close to 1 indicates a good consistency of altimetry and in situ water levels in amplitude and phase np is the number of observations to be validated after removing the observations whose difference between water levels measured by gauges and water levels derived via sentinel 3 is larger than 5 m 3 results 3 1 validation and accuracy of water levels from sentinel 3a table a1 and fig 4 compare at 26 vss the water levels derived via different retrackers from altimetry to water levels measured by gauges ampd pf algorithm tends to have a little smaller rmse with a mean value of 0 52 m and a median value of 0 46 m and a larger nse with a mean value of 0 72 and a median value of 0 85 among all of the retrackers followed by ocog algorithm with a median rmse of 0 47 m and a median nse of 0 80 although samosa and ampd pf are not always good they are more stable when compared with ocean and ocog and with a smaller variation range moreover for those virtual stations with good performance there is no significant difference in terms of the accuracy among samosa ocog and ampd pf retrackers in addition at 15 out of the 26 vss nse from ampd pf is larger than 0 80 and the median value is the only one larger than 0 85 confirming the good quality and stability of the results compared to the nearest adjacent gauge heights the water level time series at vs 14 and 26 reveal nses smaller than 0 20 for nearly all the retrackers these stations are located in the complexity of river shapes which might be the reason for the small value of nse we also compared different retrackers using data for flood and non flood seasons separately table 2 and fig 5 show that the performance is different for the flood and non flood seasons for all the retrackers most of the results in the flood season are better than those in the whole period because there is less noise in the flood season with high flows in addition during the flood season the performance of samosa ocean ocog and ampd pf is similar with a median rmse of about 0 38 m in the non flood season the ampd pf retracker performs much better than the other retrackers with the lowest rmse with a median value of 0 46 m and highest nse with a median value of 0 67 mwapp and nppr retrackers show low nse and much higher rmse in non flood season this probably arises from multi peak waveforms from some other bright targets fig a2 a and fig a2 b which contradict the assumption of these two retrackers that the echo signals from the water body dominates the waveforms this is however not the case when other small water bodies or sand bars are around the river interestingly at vs 21 ampd pf performed similarly as ocog additionally ocog 0 13 m for rmse performs much better than other retrackers at vs 21 over flood seasons while ampd pf 0 12 m for rmse performs much better than other retrackers at vs 21 over non flood seasons a possible explanation is that vs 21 over flood season is affected less by land signals with a good quality waveform ocog considering the entire waveform performs better while vs 21 over non flood seasons can easily be affected by other signals with polluted waveform ampd pf considering sub waveform analysis performs better in summary samosa and ampd pf are found to be the most stable and robust between the retrackers analysed next we study the differences among retracking methods analyzing six vss located on the mainstream of songhua river and second songhua river fig 6 the river level time series derived by the samosa and ampd pf algorithm agrees well with gauge station data in most situations however some problems still exist when dealing with some special situations for example when two sub waveforms are very close fig a2 c and fig a2 d nearly all the retrackers perform poorly in fig 6 f vs 20 is the virtual station with two tracks on the river and a small lake nearby which may affect the signals returned from the river according to the analysis above the median rmse among different retrackers is larger than 0 45 m and the median nse among different retrackers is smaller than 0 90 indicating that sentinel 3a performs moderately in srb as compared to the zambezi basin kittel et al 2021 and the ogooué river bogning et al 2018 3 2 factors controlling altimetric measurements monitoring river levels using altimetry can be affected by surrounding bright targets such as small water bodies sand bars and islands and by river morphology factors such as river width and river azimuth maillard et al 2015 halicki and niedzielski 2022 additionally the land cover surrounding the river indirectly influences the radar echo signals in this section these factors will be analyzed in detail table 3 lists the information of different factors in 26 vss 3 2 1 sand bars and islands sand bars and islands widely exist in the songhua river basin which affects the data quality of altimetry based on retracking a modeled waveform with fitting a single peak waveform ocean and samosa retrackers are sensitive to other bright targets therefore except for ampd pf we also consider the results of the two retrackers to evaluate how sand bars and islands affected the performance of sentinel 3a in srb as shown in fig 7 the performance of the retracking algorithm is significantly worse when the measurement is affected by the sand bars and islands additionally when affected by sand bars and islands the ampd pf performs better in flood seasons than in non flood seasons as compared with samosa and ocean in contrast when not affected the performance of the retrackers is similar in flood and non flood seasons this indicated that high levels in flood season are more accurate and may be less contaminated by sand bars and islands this also demonstrated that the ampd pf accuracy could improve significantly when more effective observations are introduced along the track moreover the three retrackers perform similarly for the whole year when affected by sand bars and islands it seems challenging to eliminate the influence of sand bars and islands by only improving retracking methods it may be necessary to combine other prior knowledge with river morphology by neglecting the vss affected by sand bars and islands a median rmse of 0 33 m is obtained with ampd pf which is remarkably smaller than 0 46 m for samosa and 0 45 m for ocean 3 2 2 land cover the characteristic behavior of radar reflection from different land cover is significantly different maillard et al 2015 to analyze which land cover affects the performance of sentinel 3a the land cover structure in the 1 km buffer of each vs was obtained and compared with the rmse of ampd pf as shown in fig 8 we found that except for forests there is no significant correlation between the percentage of different land cover and nse of ampd pf however the average portions of the forest are only 4 85 which could not be the main impact factor two land cover types water bodies and riverine wetlands will not be considered as the impact factor because they are already included in the river extent to quantify comparison the average percentage of land cover for 26 vss with higher and lower nse and rmse values is summarized in table 4 cultivated land types such as rice paddy and corn and grass land types show different portions in the higher and lower metrics indicating that these two land cover types may influence the sentinel 3a in srb however multi impact factors affect radar altimetry signals at the same time therefore to analyze the degrees of influence of the land covers we separate the different factors in the next section 3 2 3 river morphology factors although it is generally acknowledged that altimetry performs better over large water bodies the results in this study do not show a significant correlation between the performance of sentinel 3a and river width as shown in table 2 the three vss vs 1 vs 4 and vs 5 with large widths of more than 1000 m show a poor rmse comparatively vs 24 with only 84 m river width performs well with an rmse of 0 32 m to avoid the uncertainty of results in only one study area results from the previous study bogning et al 2018 normandin et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 kittel et al 2021 halicki and niedzielski 2022 are collected and combined with our results in fig 9 to show the relationship between river width and performance of sentinel 3a we observe that rmse is mainly smaller than 1 m therefore we only consider the case smaller than 1 m in the following analysis although different methods to evaluate the performance are used we assumed that the statistics of these results would deliver a negative correlation if the relationship between the river width and the performance of sentinel 3a exists fig 9 bottom shows that river width is positively correlated to the rmse which suggests a contrary to the assumption therefore the relationship is not significant or even nonexistent sentinel 3a can provide measurements for small to medium rivers as good as large ones this indicated that the river width may only constrain the number of observations and whether the river can be monitored by altimetry or not and the river width does not necessarily affect the accuracy for rivers larger than 50 m width some previous studies suggest that river azimuths can affect the result in various ways maillard et al 2015 jiang et al 2020 halicki and niedzielski 2022 in this study we explore how river azimuths influence the performance of sentinel 3a in the srb by separating different impact factors sand bars and islands land covers and river azimuths to quantify the influence of river azimuths the orientation with respect to the satellite ground track was obtained from google earth in fig 10 the 26 vss selected for this study are subdivided into four categories according to orientation accuracy affected by sand bars or not and two land cover type for orientation subdivision is made into near parallel x 30 slanting 30 x 60 and near perpendicular 60 x 90 orientation for rmse subdivision is made into good performance x 0 3 moderate performance 0 3 x 0 6 and poor performance x greater than 0 6 it can be seen clearly in fig 10 a and fig 10 d that sand bars affect the performance of sentinel 3a after separating the influence of sand bars we find that the vss with poor performance are mainly distributed throughout near parallel orientation while the vss with moderate and good performance were distributed throughout slanting and near perpendicular orientation although two vss in slanting orientation show poor performance they may be affected by more than 50 cultivated land type however vss with less influence from cultivated land type still show poor performance in near parallel orientation which indicates that the degree of influence of orientation may be stronger than that of cultivated land as shown in fig 10 b e no matter ampd pf or samosa show poor rmse in near parallel orientation 23 of all crossing with a median value of 0 73 m and 0 71 m respectively in contrast the results in slanting and near perpendicular orientation are similar from fig 10 c f nse also shows a similar conclusion in near parallel orientation with a median value of 0 56 and 0 53 respectively both in slanting and near perpendicular orientation the median of nse of ampd pf is larger than 0 85 showing similar performance in general the near parallel orientation influences the performance at most while the accuracy is higher in slanting and near perpendicular orientation this could be explained as the satellite track moving or shifting at different cycles some tracks will be near the river bank therefore when the river is near parallel to the track some tracks will be strongly influenced by land signals resulting in poor performance for those near parallel tracks herein we suggest that if one is aiming at calibrating a hydrodynamic or hydrological model by combining altimetry the vss with near parallel orientation are not necessary to be considered when the percentage of the non parallel crossings such as 77 investigated here of all crossings is big enough the observation with near parallel orientation may result in overestimating high flows and underestimating low flows 4 discussion for small and medium sized braided rivers the performance of altimetry is not very good due to the complexity of the river shape in addition sand bars and other bright targets contaminate the signals from water bodies posing an even more severe challenge to water level retrieval we implemented a modified retracker ampd pf to improve this situation by combing the physical modeling of sar altimeter waveform with the shortest path algorithm the ampd pf mainly focuses on improving the accuracy over non flood seasons with a median rmse of 0 44 m and a median nse of 0 67 however in the flood season the accuracy of water level from ampd pf is not improved with a similar median rmse value 0 38 m compared to ocean ocog and samosa in this study the number of observations is increased as it considers other available observations within the buffer zone of river mask it should be noted that a 150 m buffer zone around river masks is significant for monitoring river levels with a width smaller than 100 m for instance vs 24 located on the nemo er tributary river with only 84 m river width cannot be effectively monitored by considering the footprint available on the river mask but can be monitored with reasonable accuracy 0 32 m for ampd pf and 0 35 m for samosa by considering observations in the vicinity of the river indeed the 150 m buffer zone also introduces an additional uncertainty for the observation even though after removing large biases by comparing with dem this is still a problem to be solved in the future in general the accuracy of the sentinel 3a water levels over the songhua river basin is moderate as compared to the zambezi basin and ogooué river the median rmse of different retrackers is larger than 0 45 m and the median nse of different retrackers is smaller than 0 90 the obtained rmse values 0 11 2 76 m from different retracker agree well with the results of other studies evaluating the accuracy of sentinel 3a in different regions huang et al 2018 bogning et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 kittel et al 2021 nevertheless a comparison of four virtual stations shows in our study a smaller rmse than the rmse given by jiang et al 2020 as shown in table 5 the different results probably arise from a different posting rate in the l1b processing and a different gauge data jiang et al 2020 used a lower resolution 20hz while a higher resolution 80hz is used in this study actually the high posting rate increases the number of effective observations which is beneficial for monitoring small and medium sized rivers but also lowers the signal to noise ratio bringing new problems to the retracking algorithm donlon et al 2021 egido et al 2021 this is another reason for using ampd pf in this study to mitigate the problem of the signal to noise ratio of the high posting rate data many studies found that environmental factors and land cover may have a negative effect on the accuracy of altimetry huang et al 2018 argued that the altimeter might remain locked on the top of mountains degrading the accuracy of satellite altimetry when monitoring the river level in high mountains normandin et al 2018 and jiang et al 2020 suggested that the small water bodies close to the river may result in the wrong retracked range due to the strong reflectance from lakes this study analyses the degrees of influence of sand bars and islands land cover and river morphology factors we found no significant correlation between the river width and the performance of sentinel 3 which is similar to the conclusions from maillard et al 2015 and jiang et al 2020 by subdividing different impact factors we found that sand bars and islands significantly affect the performance of vss over the non flood season to some extent the proposed retracking can only improve the situation affected by other bright targets we believe that it is difficult to eliminate the influence only by retracking combining with other prior knowledge about river morphology may help to solve this problem the cultivated land type will significantly influence the data quality throughout the track with slanting orientations of the river with respect to satellite ground tracks which is opposite to the land cover related findings of halicki and niedzielski 2022 who argued that land cover is not an essential factor influencing the data quality this may be because of the relatively concentrated cultivated land such as rice paddy and corn in the vicinity of the vss in srb which is more likely to corrupt the altimetric waveforms by strong reflections therefore land covers types might have different influences on different rivers depending on the local environment after separating different influence factors the degree of influence of orientation is stronger than that of cultivated land when the river is near parallel to the track orientation is smaller than 30 to be specific near parallel orientation of the river with respect to the satellite ground track often leads to poorer performance at virtual stations 5 conclusions this study compared the water level anomalies between the 26 virtual stations and the nearest adjacent gauges in the songhua river basin we implemented different retracking methods to retrieve water level time series a comparison between water levels from sentinel 3a altimetry and those from gauges shows that due to the complexity of river shapes sentinel 3a performs moderately in songhua river basin as compared to zambezi basin and ogooué river with a median rmse larger than 0 45 m and a median nes smaller than 0 90 among the retrackers investigated here specifically the performance of samosa ocean ocog and ampd pf is similar with a median rmse of about 0 38 m during the flood season however ampd pf outperformed the other retrackers ocog ocean samosa mwapp and nppr during the non flood season with a median rmse of about 0 44 m although ocog ranks second in our assessment the performance is not stable compared to samosa and ampd pf mwapp and nppr perform poorly for some of the vss analysis of the waveforms reveals that the main reason is due to multi peak waveforms from the bright target in addition three environmental factors controlling altimetric measurements have been analyzed in detail 1 sand bars and islands 2 land cover and 3 river morphology the altimetric waveforms are often corrupted by strong reflections from sand bars and islands which results in complex multi waveforms especially over the non flood season we suggest that while several different land cover types are present in the songhua river basin only cultivated land such as rice paddy and corn significantly influences the performance we found that for rivers larger than 50 m width there is no evidence that river width adversely affects the accuracy in contrast we find that sentinel 3 water level retrievals deteriorate if the ground track orientation with respect to the river is below about 30 and that the degree of influence of the orientation may be stronger than that of cultivated land types credit authorship contribution statement jiaming chen

2227,knowledge concerning the redox potential eh conditions in the vadose zone of a soil aquifer treatment sat system constitutes valuable information for assessing water quality and operational efficiency the complex nature of eh conditions in sat limits the ability to predict and quantify them using detailed models alternatively data driven models can be used for predictions and relationship analysis hourly measurements of eh volumetric water content θ soil temperature t and gaseous oxygen o2 were obtained at multiple depths of a sat vadose zone a correlation analysis showed that o2 correlated with eh for most temporal components only the monthly component of t and the daily component of θ were correlated with eh a detailed multiple linear regression mlr analysis illustrated that the gaseous o2 at shallow depths can explain the majority above 80 of the eh variability the mlr curve demonstrated breakpoints in the eh response to o2 at shallow depths which were identified using a piecewise regression these breakpoints explain in part the different stages of microbial activity throughout the sat wetting and drying cycles combining an oxygen transport analytical model with the piecewise regression enabled the eh prediction through easy to acquire t and θ measurements at deeper depths the eh o2 relationship demonstrates a step function characteristic which indicates that the changes in eh occur due to the arrival of a low eh solution thus the eh dynamic in the sat vadose zone is mostly controlled by aerobic conditions data

conditions in the sat vadose zone the effect of the wetting and drying cycles duration and management on the quality of the infiltrated water is critical for sat efficiency sharma and kennedy 2017 ben moshe et al 2020 to improve sat management frequent sampling of the soil pore water for chemical analysis is necessary however intensive collection of pore water samples is time consuming and expensive alternatively it has been shown that in situ monitoring at a high temporal resolution of redox potential eh together with additional variables such as gaseous o2 soil temperature t and soil water content θ can be used to improve sat and mar management turkeltaub et al 2022 ganot and dahlke 2021 nevertheless eh measurements are mainly used in qualitative terms which weakens the ability to determine the dominant redox reactions and their rates christensen et al 2000 rodríguez escales et al 2020 presented a fully coupled model of flow heat transport solute transport and a geochemical reaction network to reproduce the spatio temporal changes in redox potential in the upper one meter of a mar vadose zone this type of model is heavily parameterized and requires high user expertise and a large amount of data alternatively data driven models ddm or surrogate models can provide accurate predictions of the parameter of interest by using easily measurable data adamowski 2008 adamowski et al 2012 elshorbagy et al 2010a 2010b zhang et al 2018 ghaseminejad and uddameri 2020 nema et al 2004 an additional benefit of data driven models is the ability to reveal a complex model s insensitive inputs and irrelevant parameters elshorbagy et al 2010a b zhang et al 2018 it has been shown that the choice of the ddm is strongly related to the expected linear or nonlinear relationship between the input variables and the output variable elshorbagy et al 2010a furthermore there are cases in which the improvement of model accuracy is obtained by integrating the ddm with a mechanistic model thus exploiting the strengths of each modeling approach humphrey et al 2016 turkeltaub et al 2022 have presented a high resolution time series of measured volumetric water content θ soil temperature t gaseous oxygen o2 and eh in the vadose zone of sat facilities part of the data has recently become available at the following link https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 19314032 they illustrated the potential of using these datasets for improving sat management efficiency by defining the optimal durations of the drying and wetting cycles previous studies reported on the complex and non linear behavior of the o2 eh relationship in soils armstrong 1967 mukhtar et al 1996 ganot and dahlke 2021 blackwell 1983 other studies indicated similar non linear patterns in the relationship between eh and soil air content dorau et al 2018 however in most cases no quantifying tools were applied to elaborate these relationships understanding of o2 θ t and eh relationships might illustrate the threshold state where the shift from oxidizing to reducing conditions occurs thus the current study explores the capability of implementing the o2 θ and t time series to predict eh by using a multi linear regression and a piecewise regression a correlation analysis was conducted before using the regression methods to examine the relationship between the variables to further elaborate on the correlation analysis the original time series were decomposed into three components seasonal daily and hourly using a moving average method the physical interpretation of the relationship established by the mlr and the piecewise regression between eh and gaseous o2 is discussed ultimately the eh is predicted using easy to acquire t and θ measurements by combining an analytical model that describes the soil gaseous o2 supply and microbial respiration with the piecewise regression 2 methods 2 1 study site the dan region reclamation project shafdan reclaims about 125 million m3 of effluent annually from the tel aviv metropolitan area in israel before the sat treatment the effluents undergo mechanical biological secondary treatment which is based on activated sludge to enable the infiltration of such large effluent quantities there are six infiltration pond clusters basins that cover an area of 1 053 km2 the infiltration ponds overlie israel s coastal aquifer where the water table is located between 30 and 40 m below surface furthermore the vadose zone is mostly composed of sand sandy loam soil and calcareous sandstone layers typically the ponds are flooded for one to two days max hydraulic head of about 50 cm followed by two to six days of drainage and soil surface drying the basin surface is ploughed on a regular basis to break up the developed biocrust and prevent clogging negev et al 2020 two in situ monitoring stations were established in an infiltration pond in 2018 pond 4103 in the yavne 1 cluster fig 1 the stations were equipped with time domain transmittance tdt probes acclima inc idaho usa for monitoring volumetric water content redox conditions were monitored using oxidation reduction potential orp electrodes elh016 van london co houston tx usa and o2 percentage probes ict02 sensor ict int australia were used to measure the content of oxygen in the soil data have been collected at 20 min intervals and logged on a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan ut usa since each station is operated separately there are differences between data acquisition periods due to technical issues in station 1 fig 1 θ t gaseous oxygen o2 and eh measurements were collected between 08 05 2019 and 23 10 2019 these data contain 9797 4 measurement points in time and space i e 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 5 m depths the data in station 2 were collected between 17 05 2019 and 30 11 2019 these datasets contain 9157 4 measurement points in time and space there are two breaks in data collection 22 05 2019 23 05 2019 and 03 09 2019 02 10 2019 for further description of the site the reader is referred to turkeltaub et al 2022 examples of the measured θ t gaseous oxygen o2 and eh time series are presented in the supporting information and in fig 2 2 2 exploratory statistical analysis 2 2 1 data decomposition we assumed that the variations in the observed hourly time series of eh t θ and o2 are composed of two basic components 1 a monthly component and 2 a daily component the monthly component is mainly related to differences between summer and winter including significant differences in air temperature hours of daylight infiltration rates water chemistry diffusion and degradation rates etc the daily component is related to the day and night cycles and to the wetting and drying cycles that are commonly imposed in sat systems note that the variability in the measured hourly time series is also related to differences in water chemistry and soil heterogeneity the movmean function in matlab was used to establish the temporal components a simple moving average of the past 24 h or 740 h were conducted to represent daily and monthly time lengths for the edge periods i e the first 24 h and 740 h the average included only the existing elements the decomposed sub series are represented by different notations as follows 1 z hourly original measured time series 2 z day the smoothed time series over 24 h 3 δz day the difference between the original time series and the smoothed time series over 24 h z hourly z day 4 z month the smoothed time series over 740 h and 5 δz month the difference between the smoothed time series over 24 h and the smoothed time series over 740 h z month z day for further illustration of the decomposing process the reader is referred to fig 1s in the supporting information 2 2 2 multiple linear regression to elucidate and quantify the relationship between eh and the other measured variables t θ and o2 a multiple linear regression mlr method together with a polynomial regression was implemented 1 y β 0 j 1 m i 1 n β i j x j i e where xj t θ o2 β0 is the intercept βi j is the coefficient of the i th power of variable j and e is the error an important step in mlr development is the selection of influential explanatory variables generally the input variables are not equally informative since variables may be correlated noisy or have no significant relationship with the dependent variable thus the linear coefficients are estimated in an iterative manner where in each iteration a different combination of predictors is tested the predictors can be the original measured time series z hourly or one of its temporal components z day δz day z month and δz month this approach ensures that the additive effect of each predictor is confirmed note that the above analysis is different from a stepwise regression analysis whose use is debatable whittingham et al 2006 here the selection of different combinations of the predictors variables were conducted manually no algorithm was applied following this step a regular mlr not stepwise is conducted and all the issues with stepwise mlr are not relevant the final model suggested is not the outcome of a stepwise mlr the mlr was calculated using the regress function in matlab 2 2 3 piecewise regression the mlr method is not always effective in describing nonlinear data due to the assumption of linear relationships among the variables to equip the mlr with nonlinear modeling capabilities the piecewise regression method has been suggested hoang 2019 mcgee and carleton 1970 this method enables including breakpoints in the linear regression in which the locations and the standard errors of the thresholds are calculated simultaneously the general form of a piecewise regression model joins straight lines at the breakpoints as follows holder 1985 2 y x j δ 1 γ 1 x j α 1 f o r α 1 x j α 2 δ 2 γ 2 x j α 2 f o r α 2 x j α 3 δ n γ n x j α n 1 f o r α n 1 x j α n where αn is the breakpoint the threshold γn is the estimated slope δn is the estimated intercept of the linear regression xj is the value for the independent variable and y xj is the estimated value of the dependent variable the segmented package in r muggeo 2014 was used to fit the piecewise regression functions 2 3 soil oxygen supply and microbial respiration model process based hydrologic models have been implemented for their capability to capture the dominant processes and provide predictions outside the range of the observations however when there is an insufficient scientific understanding or process representation alternative approaches such as ddm are applied the ddm disadvantage is related to the longer training data sets that are required to accurately capture the dynamics of complex processes especially to improve predictions outside of the range of data used for training recent studies illustrated that integrating between process based hydrologic models and data driven models can combine the strengths of both modeling approaches and improve predictions konapala et al 2020 the evaluation of the gaseous o2 supply to the aerobic microbial population deep in the soil profile is determined by the soil diffusion coefficient which mainly depends on the medium s physical properties and the oxygen consumption rates cook and knight 2003 cook 1995 these processes challenge the implementation of analytical solutions to calculate the gaseous oxygen diffusion in soils nevertheless previous studies showed that steady state o2 concentration profiles in soils develop rather quickly min to h radford and greenwood 1970 bronswijk et al 1993 thus a full solution for the one dimensional steady state soil oxygen diffusion model was solved according to cook 1995 which assumes that the soil respiration function decreases exponentially with depth and under the following boundary conditions 3a z 0 c c atm 3b z l d dc dz 0 c c 3c c z c atm z a 2 r e s 0 d 1 z z a e x p l z a e x p z z a where c z is the concentration of oxygen in the gas phase of the soil m l 3 z is the depth l za is length scale l for the exponential decrease in microbial respiration with depth l is the bottom of the simulated profile at 25 cm depth and res0 is the volumetric microbial respiration of the soil at z 0 m l 3 t 1 d is the diffusivity of the soil l2 t which can be described as follows millington and quirk 1961 4 d d 0 θ 10 3 0 8 where ø is the soil porosity and d0 is the diffusion coefficient of gaseous o2 in air l2 t the boundary condition 3b includes two possibilities for the oxygen concentration profile first as for z c is constant and non zero value the second possibility is where at depth z l the oxygen concentration goes to zero i e c z l c 0 the catm is the oxygen

mol p is the atmospheric pressure m l t 2 r is the universal gas constant m l2 t 2 k 1 mol 1 and tair is the air temperature k the variation of res0 with temperature and soil water content was calculated as follows cook and knight 2003 cook et al 2013 6 re s 0 re s 0 ref e 0 t t 0 θ θ ref b where e0 is the activation energy at 10 c t0 is the base standard temperature in this study 10 c θref is the soil water content at reference conditions and b is a constant the parameters and their prescribed values are summarized in table 1 2 4 performance evaluation to evaluate the mlr and the piecewise regression model s predictive performances the following statistical metrics were used the root mean square error rmse and the adjusted coefficient of determination r2 low rmse indicates that the residuals are concentrated around the best fit line the r2 coefficient ranges between 1 and 0 where the value of 1 indicates a perfect model fit and the value of 0 indicates a poor fit 3 results and discussion 3 1 the eh θ t and gaseous o2 dynamics in sat an elaborated description of the eh θ t and gaseous o2 dynamics in the investigated sat site s vadose zone was given by turkeltaub et al 2022 to extend the reader s understanding of the eh θ t and gaseous o2 behavior under the drying and wetting cycles that are imposed in the sat a representative short window of time is presented fig 2 a drainage process expressed by the decrease in θ can be observed from june 3 5 2019 fig 2a non shaded during this period the t observations exhibited daily oscillations together with a decreasing trend of about 2 c fig 2a black line the gaseous o2 red line was retained at high concentration levels and the eh blue line remained in a high positive value range fig 2b once flooding began fig 1 on june 5 an intensive infiltration event caused a rapid increase in θ fig 2a green line subsequently with a 6 h lag time the t showed an increase which was most likely influenced by the infiltrating water fig 2a the gaseous o2 showed an instantaneous decline with the increase in θ followed by a more moderate decrease fig 2b the decrease in eh conditions started at an approximately 8 h delay time lag after the gaseous o2 decline 3 2 assessment of potential eh predictors correlations between the input variables o2 θ and t and the target variable eh were computed for measurements at 25 50 75 and 100 cm depths in station 1 fig 3 furthermore the correlations between the different decomposed sub series of the observed time series of o2 eh θ and t were included fig 3 for an example of the original measurements time series and the sub series products the reader is referred to the supporting information fig 1s calculated correlation matrices for the additional depths and for measurements from station 2 are also in the supporting information fig 2s in general the correlation coefficients revealed strong positive correlations between the different eh components and the gaseous o2 components at 25 cm depth fig 3 in the presence of gaseous o2 aerobic conditions prevail which sustains the eh conditions at high positive values once a decrease in gaseous o2 occurs the eh conditions decrease towards negative values turkeltaub et al 2022 however the correlation between gaseous o2 and eh decreases with depth which indicates that the gaseous o2 dictates eh conditions less strongly at deeper depths of the sat vadose zone fig 3 the daily changes in gaseous o2 δo2 day constitute the only component that can reflect the daily changes in eh δeh day note that the strongest correlation of δo2 day versus δeh day occurs at lag 1 which implies that changes in gaseous o2 precede the changes in eh fig 2 this lag in the eh response emphasizes the dependence of eh on the presence of o2 the correlations between the θ components and the eh components exhibit a mixture of relationships fig 3 additionally the correlation coefficients become smaller with depth fig 3 a negative correlation was calculated between δeh monthly and δθ monthly for all depths which is the result of the wetting and drying cycles that are implemented in sat fig 3 since the cycles are conducted over several days there are a number of days in the month where the θ is high and consequently the eh conditions decrease towards negative values for the remaining days in the same month the θ decreases and the eh conditions increase to positive values turkeltaub et al 2022 a positive relationship was calculated between eh monthly and θ monthly for 75 and 100 cm depths fig 3 these components reflect the seasonal signals which implies that when θ is higher during the year in winter due to lower evapotranspiration and drainage rates the eh conditions are high and positive however one would expect that under wetter conditions the microbial activity would be more intensive which would be expressed in the decrease of eh conditions to negative values it might be that due to the low microbial activity at the deeper depths the eh conditions remain at positive values turkeltaub et al 2022 the calculated correlation coefficients between the different t components and the eh components indicate that the seasonal signals t monthly versus eh monthly are negatively correlated fig 3 daily or monthly changes in soil temperature showed weak relationships with the different eh components these results are in accordance with turkeltaub et al 2022 who illustrated that the eh values become very negative during the summer months when temperatures are high due to intensive microbial activity may october 3 3 mlr analysis following the above correlation analyses the different decomposed components and the original measurements of the gaseous o2 θ and t were used as input variables for the mlr model to predict eh at different depths the performance evaluations are presented in table 2 and table 3 note that the potential nonlinear contribution of the gaseous o2 θ and t to the mlr performance was examined as well table 2 to include the nonlinearity the measured time series the predictors were raised to the m power until the lowest rmse and the highest r2 were achieved for example the expression i 1 9 θ i in table 2 can be written as follows β 1 θ 1 β 2 θ 2 β 9 θ 9 an example of the improvement in the model s performances is depicted in fig 4 it is evident from table 2 table 3 and fig 4 that the gaseous o2 is the most important predictor of the eh conditions for all depths including the nonlinear relationship between the gaseous o2 and the eh improves the mlr s performance as it is expressed in lower rmse and higher r2 table 2 table 3 implementing the decomposed components t monthly and δθ monthly in the mlr expression 14 in table 2 table 3 shows a performance similar to including the original time series for t and θ expression 15 in table 2 table 3 thus the eh conditions in the sat vadose zone are mostly affected by the seasonal signal of the temperature this relationship has been qualitatively described using boxplots in our previous study turkeltaub et al 2022 in which the substantial negative values and variability of eh mainly occurred during summer may october the δθ monthly component s contribution to the mlr comes through providing knowledge regarding the length of the wetting and drying cycles an additional exercise was conducted to improve eh predictions not shown by separating the data between the wetting and drying stages however no further contribution was obtained according to the mlr results the gaseous o2 explains the majority above 80 of the sat vadose zone s eh variability at 25 cm depth in station 1 table 2 and at 25 and 50 cm depths in station 2 table 3 this implies that at the shallow depths of the sat vadose zone the eh dynamic is mostly controlled by aerobic conditions note that the mlr performances decrease substantially with depth table 2 table 3 although the gaseous o2 is a good predictor at these depths the effect of aerobic conditions is less conclusive from a physical perspective it is difficult to prove that o2 at a power larger than one is a predictor for eh there is no evidence for a dominant chemical reaction requiring many o2 molecules all at once that would affect the eh conditions the following section is devoted to the physical interpretation of the relationship between eh and o2 as it is expressed by the mlr 3 4 the eh o2 relationship the relationship between gaseous o2 and eh at 25 cm depth as it is expressed using the mlr method is presented in fig 5 expression 6 in table 2 was used to calculate the eh values in order to reduce the dimensions but the trend of the curve did not substantially change using other expressions such as 14 or 15 a distinct characteristic that can be inferred from the observations and the mlr curve is the occurrence of different eh o2 relationships along the gaseous o2 range fig 5 these differences are most likely an outcome of the changes in oxygen fluxes into the soil and microbial activity a piecewise regression approach was implemented to determine the possible breakpoints in which the eh o2 relationship demonstrates an abrupt change following multiple runs of the segmented package in r muggeo 2014 the optimal solution included two breakpoints three sets of linear regression equations and a similar performance of the mlr analysis described above table 4 fig 5 furthermore when applying the measured variables at 25 cm depth in station 2 as inputs for the linear functions in table 4 similar prediction performances were calculated rmse 183 r2 0 76 in segment 1 fig 5 the decrease in gaseous o2 is expressed in higher o2 gradients which effectively increase the o2 flux to the soil the rise in oxygen demand may indicate that microbial activity escalates which is attributed to the nutrient availability as θ increases segment 2 represents an equilibrium a steady state where the gaseous o2 fluxes into the soil are equal to the microbial oxygen demand fig 5 segments 3 is most likely within the range of the critical air content in which the connectivity between the atmosphere and the vadose zone is mainly controlled by the level of soil saturation note that θ and gaseous o2 exhibit a strong relationship at the critical point as was reported by ganot and dahlke 2021 and indicated by the current study s data fig 6 thus the o2 diffusivity and the increase in tortuosity play a dominant role in determining the gaseous o2 fluxes although the o2 gradients increase the o2 diffusivity decreases dramatically which is expressed in low o2 fluxes the differences between segments 2 and 3 may be related to the changes in microbial communities as conditions have transitioned from suboxic to anoxic conditions however no information was collected throughout the current study to support or reject this hypothesis and further investigation should be conducted at deeper depths of the sat vadose zone the eh o2 relationship can be described by a step function fig 7 provided that gaseous o2 is present in the sat vadose zone the eh would have high positive values fig 7 under the absence of gaseous o2 the eh conditions decrease towards moderately to extremely negative values since no clear process is demonstrated by the eh o2 relationship at deeper depths of the vadose zone it is speculated that the presence of o2 is sufficient to sustain a relatively low level of microbial activity thus the shift in eh conditions from suboxic to anoxic conditions is attributed to the arrival of a soil solution with low eh i e poorer in dissolved oxygen 3 5 estimation of eh conditions using θ and t measuring θ and t in soil is relatively frequently and easily practiced therefore establishing a method to predict eh conditions using θ and t is a logical next step for this purpose we tested two approaches in the first approach the gaseous o2 was predicted by the θair using a piecewise regression following the relationship depicted in fig 6 and the results are summarized in the supporting information table s1 note that inputting the t data in the regression did not improve the model s performance and thus it was omitted in the second approach a physical based model was applied to estimate gaseous o2 using the θ and t information subsequently the predicted gaseous o2 of the two approaches was inputted to the piecewise regression from table 4 to predict the eh conditions using the first approach in which two piecewise regression functions that describe the θ o2 relationship and the o2 eh relationship was used to predict eh did not provide convincing results and the discussion below is focused on the physical based method running equations 3 to 6 for a range of res0 ref values between 0 0001 and 1 table 1 the solution that attained the lowest rmse and the highest r2 was for a res0 ref value of 0 0055 kg m 3 hour 1 the model s performance was compared with the gaseous o2 observations obtained at 25 cm depth in station 1 fig 8 when using the simulated gaseous o2 as an input to the piecewise regression table 4 for the prediction of eh the rmse and r2 values were 245 and 0 58 respectively fig 9 a the validation of the model performance was conducted by using eh t and θ datasets that were collected between july and september 2020 there are no o2 measurements for this period due to sensor failure according to the statistical analysis the model provided similar performance fig 9 studies that have examined models ability to predict eh are scarce in the most updated study by rodríguez escales et al 2020 statistical evaluations of model eh predictions were not reported thus it is difficult to assess whether the combination between physical o2 diffusion and piecewise regression provides a satisfactory performance probably implementing a simple analytical solution to describe oxygen diffusion in the soil affected eh predictions using sophisticated solutions that can acknowledge for multidimensional subsurface soil oxygen concentration profiles may improve eh predictions although the mlr approach performs better than the combined models there is no physical or chemical justification to be used the piecewise model is the optimal approach ultimately this study outlined one option for predicting eh conditions in which gaseous o2 mainly prevails 4 summary and conclusions this study presents a detailed analysis of the eh t θ and o2 time series that were obtained in the sat vadose zone strong positive correlations were demonstrated between eh and o2 for their original and decomposed components only the seasonal components of t and eh showed a relatively strong negative correlation while the daily and monthly changes of t did not exhibit a substantial relationship with eh the monthly changes of θ contribute to the knowledge on eh by accounting for the length of the wetting and drying cycles using the mlr it was illustrated that gaseous o2 is a superior predictor of eh this indicates that eh is mainly affected by aerobic conditions in sat furthermore a highly nonlinear o2 eh relationship was revealed at shallow depths of the vadose zone the o2 eh relationship was identified with a breakpoint transition characteristic applying a piecewise regression showed similar performances as when the nonlinear mlr method was applied which reaffirmed the breakpoint characteristic the different stages revealed by the piecewise regression were attributed to changes in soil o2 fluxes at deeper depths of the sat vadose zone the o2 eh relationship shows a step function behavior where in the presence of gaseous o2 the eh conditions remain positive under the absence of gaseous o2 eh becomes negative this step function behavior may be related to low microbial activity although the presence of gaseous o2 and the decrease in eh is explained by the arrival of the low eh solution ultimately we suggest implementing a simple o2 diffusion analytical model together with the piecewise regression to predict eh conditions in sat by using easy to acquire t and θ measurements since the measurement of eh is relatively easy one can question the need to predict it however its prediction constitutes the establishment of an adequate relationship between eh and other variables e g gaseous o2 t etc which can elucidate the dynamics in sat systems and other environments this study emphasizes that the eh conditions in a sat vadose zone are essentially dominated by the presence of gaseous o2 nevertheless the outcomes of the current study cast into doubt the contribution of anaerobic processes such as denitrification to the overall changes in eh although there are number of studies on denitrification processes in managed aquifer recharge facilities only a few have presented detailed quantification assessments for denitrification in sat vadose zones future studies should focus on the hydrological and geochemical vadose zone conditions that enable denitrification financial support this work has been supported within the frame work of the goldinger trust jewish federation of delaware and by the

2227,knowledge concerning the redox potential eh conditions in the vadose zone of a soil aquifer treatment sat system constitutes valuable information for assessing water quality and operational efficiency the complex nature of eh conditions in sat limits the ability to predict and quantify them using detailed models alternatively data driven models can be used for predictions and relationship analysis hourly measurements of eh volumetric water content θ soil temperature t and gaseous oxygen o2 were obtained at multiple depths of a sat vadose zone a correlation analysis showed that o2 correlated with eh for most temporal components only the monthly component of t and the daily component of θ were correlated with eh a detailed multiple linear regression mlr analysis illustrated that the gaseous o2 at shallow depths can explain the majority above 80 of the eh variability the mlr curve demonstrated breakpoints in the eh response to o2 at shallow depths which were identified using a piecewise regression these breakpoints explain in part the different stages of microbial activity throughout the sat wetting and drying cycles combining an oxygen transport analytical model with the piecewise regression enabled the eh prediction through easy to acquire t and θ measurements at deeper depths the eh o2 relationship demonstrates a step function characteristic which indicates that the changes in eh occur due to the arrival of a low eh solution thus the eh dynamic in the sat vadose zone is mostly controlled by aerobic conditions data

moshe et al 2020 to improve sat management frequent sampling of the soil pore water for chemical analysis is necessary however intensive collection of pore water samples is time consuming and

between the input variables and the output variable elshorbagy et al 2010a furthermore there are cases in which the improvement of model accuracy is obtained by integrating the ddm with a mechanistic model thus exploiting the strengths of each modeling approach humphrey et al 2016 turkeltaub et al 2022 have presented a high resolution time series of measured volumetric water content θ soil temperature t gaseous oxygen o2 and eh in the vadose zone of sat facilities part of the data has recently become available at the following link https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 19314032 they illustrated the potential of using these datasets for improving sat management efficiency by defining the optimal durations of the drying and wetting cycles previous studies reported on the complex and non linear behavior of the o2 eh relationship in soils armstrong 1967 mukhtar et al 1996 ganot and dahlke 2021 blackwell 1983 other studies indicated similar non linear patterns in the relationship between eh and soil air content dorau et al 2018 however in most cases no quantifying tools were applied to elaborate these relationships understanding of o2 θ t and eh relationships might illustrate the threshold state where the shift from oxidizing to reducing conditions occurs thus the current study explores the capability of implementing the o2 θ and t time series to predict eh by using a multi linear regression and a piecewise regression a correlation analysis was conducted before using the regression methods to examine the relationship between the variables to further elaborate on the correlation analysis the original time series were decomposed into three components seasonal daily and hourly using a moving average method the physical interpretation of the relationship established by the mlr and the piecewise regression between eh and gaseous o2 is discussed ultimately the eh is predicted using easy to acquire t and θ measurements by combining an analytical model that describes the soil gaseous o2 supply and microbial respiration with the piecewise regression 2 methods 2 1 study site the dan region reclamation project shafdan reclaims about 125 million m3 of effluent annually from the tel aviv metropolitan area in israel before the sat treatment the effluents undergo mechanical biological secondary treatment which is based on activated sludge to enable the infiltration of such large effluent quantities there are six infiltration pond clusters basins that cover an area of 1 053 km2 the infiltration ponds overlie israel s coastal aquifer where the water table is located between 30 and 40 m below surface furthermore the vadose zone is mostly composed of sand sandy loam soil and calcareous sandstone layers typically the ponds are flooded for one to two days max hydraulic head of about 50 cm followed by two to six days of drainage and soil surface drying the basin surface is ploughed on a regular basis to break up the developed biocrust and prevent clogging negev et al 2020 two in situ monitoring stations were established in an infiltration pond in 2018 pond 4103 in the yavne 1 cluster fig 1 the stations were equipped with time domain transmittance tdt probes acclima inc idaho usa for monitoring volumetric water content redox conditions were monitored using oxidation reduction potential orp electrodes elh016 van london co houston tx usa and o2 percentage probes ict02 sensor ict int australia were used to measure the content of oxygen in the soil data have been collected at 20 min intervals and logged on a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan ut usa since each station is operated separately there are differences between data acquisition periods due to technical issues in station 1 fig 1 θ t gaseous oxygen o2 and eh measurements were collected between 08 05 2019 and 23 10 2019 these data contain 9797 4 measurement points in time and space i e 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 5 m depths the data in station 2 were collected between 17 05 2019 and 30 11 2019 these datasets contain 9157 4 measurement points in time and space there are two breaks in data collection 22 05 2019 23 05 2019 and 03 09 2019 02 10 2019 for further description of the site the reader is referred to turkeltaub et al 2022 examples of the measured θ t gaseous oxygen o2 and eh time series are presented in the supporting information and in fig 2 2 2 exploratory statistical analysis 2 2 1 data decomposition we assumed that the variations in the observed hourly time series of eh t θ and o2 are composed of two basic components 1 a monthly component and 2 a daily component the monthly component is mainly related to differences between summer and winter including significant differences in air temperature hours of daylight infiltration rates water chemistry diffusion and degradation rates etc the daily component is related to the day and night cycles and to the wetting and drying cycles that are commonly imposed in sat systems note that the variability in the measured hourly time series is also related to differences in water chemistry and soil heterogeneity the movmean function in matlab was used to establish the temporal components a simple moving average of the past 24 h or 740 h were conducted to represent daily and monthly time lengths for the edge periods i e the first 24 h and 740 h the average included only the existing elements the decomposed sub series are represented by different notations as follows 1 z hourly original measured time series 2 z day the smoothed time series over 24 h 3 δz day the difference between the original time series and the smoothed time series over 24 h z hourly z day 4 z month the smoothed time series over 740 h and 5 δz month the difference between the smoothed time series over 24 h and the smoothed time series over 740 h z month z day for further illustration of the decomposing process the reader is referred to fig 1s in the supporting information 2 2 2 multiple linear regression to elucidate and quantify the relationship between eh and the other measured variables t θ and o2 a multiple linear regression mlr method together with a polynomial regression was implemented 1 y β 0 j 1 m i 1 n β i j x j i e where xj t θ o2 β0 is the intercept βi j is the coefficient of the i th power of variable j and e is the error an important step in mlr development is the selection of influential explanatory variables generally the input variables are not equally informative since variables may be correlated noisy or have no significant relationship with the dependent variable thus the linear coefficients are estimated in an iterative manner where in each iteration a different combination of predictors is tested the predictors can be the original measured time series z hourly or one of its temporal components z day δz day z month and δz month this approach ensures that the additive effect of each predictor is confirmed note that the above analysis is different from a stepwise regression analysis whose use is debatable whittingham et al 2006 here the selection of different combinations of the predictors variables were conducted manually no algorithm was applied following this step a regular mlr not stepwise is conducted and all the issues with stepwise mlr are not relevant the final model suggested is not the outcome of a stepwise mlr the mlr was calculated using the regress function in matlab 2 2 3 piecewise regression the mlr method is not always effective in describing nonlinear data due to the assumption of linear relationships among the variables to equip the mlr with nonlinear modeling capabilities the piecewise regression method has been suggested hoang 2019 mcgee and carleton 1970 this method enables including breakpoints in the linear regression in which the locations and the standard errors of the thresholds are calculated simultaneously the general form of a piecewise regression model joins straight lines at the breakpoints as follows holder 1985 2 y x j δ 1 γ 1 x j α 1 f o r α 1 x j α 2 δ 2 γ 2 x j α 2 f o r α 2 x j α 3 δ n γ n x j α n 1 f o r α n 1 x j α n where αn is the breakpoint the threshold γn is the estimated slope δn is the estimated intercept of the linear regression xj is the value for the independent variable and y xj is the estimated value of the dependent variable the segmented package in r muggeo 2014 was used to fit the piecewise regression functions 2 3 soil oxygen supply and microbial respiration model process based hydrologic models have been implemented for their capability to capture the dominant processes and provide predictions outside the range of the observations however when there is an insufficient scientific understanding or process representation alternative approaches such as ddm are applied the ddm disadvantage is related to the longer training data sets that are required to accurately capture the dynamics of complex processes especially to improve predictions outside of the range of data used for training recent studies illustrated that integrating between process based hydrologic models and data driven models can combine the strengths of both modeling approaches and improve predictions konapala et al 2020 the evaluation of the gaseous o2 supply to the aerobic microbial population deep in the soil profile is determined by the soil diffusion coefficient which mainly depends on the medium s physical properties and the oxygen consumption rates cook and knight 2003 cook 1995 these processes challenge the implementation of analytical solutions to calculate the gaseous oxygen diffusion in soils nevertheless previous studies showed that steady state o2 concentration profiles in soils develop rather quickly min to h radford and greenwood 1970 bronswijk et al 1993 thus a full solution for the one dimensional steady state soil oxygen diffusion model was solved according to cook 1995 which assumes that the soil respiration function decreases exponentially with depth and under the following boundary conditions 3a z 0 c c atm 3b z l d dc dz 0 c c 3c c z c atm z a 2 r e s 0 d 1 z z a e x p l z a e

millington and quirk 1961 4 d d 0 θ 10 3 0 8 where ø is the soil porosity and d0 is the diffusion coefficient of gaseous o2 in air l2 t the boundary condition 3b includes two possibilities for the oxygen concentration profile first as for z c is constant and non zero value the second possibility is where at depth z l the oxygen concentration goes to zero i e c z l c 0 the catm is the oxygen

piecewise regression model s predictive performances the following statistical metrics were used the root mean square error rmse and the adjusted coefficient of determination r2 low rmse indicates that the residuals are concentrated around the best fit line the r2 coefficient ranges between 1 and 0 where the value of 1 indicates a perfect model fit and the value of 0 indicates a poor fit 3 results and discussion 3 1 the eh θ t and gaseous o2 dynamics in sat an elaborated description of the eh θ t and gaseous o2 dynamics in the investigated sat site s vadose zone was given by turkeltaub et al 2022 to extend the reader s understanding of the eh θ t and gaseous o2 behavior under the drying and wetting cycles that are imposed in the sat a representative short window of time is presented fig 2 a drainage process expressed by the decrease in θ can be observed from june 3 5 2019 fig 2a non shaded during this period the t observations exhibited daily oscillations together with a decreasing trend of about 2 c fig 2a black line the gaseous o2 red line was retained at high concentration levels and the eh blue line remained in a high positive value range fig 2b once flooding began fig 1 on june 5 an intensive infiltration event caused a rapid increase in θ fig 2a green line subsequently with a 6 h lag time the t showed an increase which was most likely influenced by the infiltrating water fig 2a the gaseous o2 showed an instantaneous decline with the increase in θ followed by a more moderate decrease fig 2b the decrease in eh conditions started at an approximately 8 h delay time lag after the gaseous o2 decline 3 2 assessment of potential eh predictors correlations between the input variables o2 θ and t and the target variable eh were computed for measurements at 25 50 75 and 100 cm depths in station 1 fig 3 furthermore the correlations between the different decomposed sub series of the observed time series of o2 eh θ and t were included fig 3 for an example of the original measurements time series and the sub series products the reader is referred to the supporting information fig 1s calculated correlation matrices for the additional depths and for measurements from station 2 are also in the supporting information fig 2s in general the correlation coefficients revealed strong positive correlations between the different eh components and the gaseous o2 components at 25 cm depth fig 3 in the presence of gaseous o2 aerobic conditions prevail which sustains the eh conditions at high positive values once a decrease in gaseous o2 occurs the eh conditions decrease towards negative values turkeltaub et al 2022 however the correlation between gaseous o2 and eh decreases with depth which indicates that the gaseous o2 dictates eh conditions less strongly at deeper depths of the sat vadose zone fig 3 the daily changes in gaseous o2 δo2 day constitute the only component that can reflect the daily changes in eh δeh day note that the strongest correlation of δo2 day versus δeh day occurs at lag 1 which implies that changes in gaseous o2 precede the changes in eh fig 2 this lag in the eh response emphasizes the dependence of eh on the presence of o2 the correlations between the θ components and the eh components exhibit a mixture of relationships fig 3 additionally the correlation coefficients become smaller with depth fig 3 a negative correlation was calculated between δeh monthly and δθ monthly for all depths which is the result of the wetting and drying cycles that are implemented in sat fig 3 since the cycles are conducted over several days there are a number of days in the month where the θ is high and consequently the eh conditions decrease towards negative values for the remaining days in the same month the θ decreases and the eh conditions increase to positive values turkeltaub et al 2022 a positive relationship was calculated between eh monthly and θ monthly for 75 and 100 cm depths fig 3 these components reflect the seasonal signals which implies that when θ is higher during the year in winter due to lower evapotranspiration and drainage rates the eh conditions are high and positive however one would expect that under wetter conditions the microbial activity would be more intensive which would be expressed in the decrease of eh conditions to negative values it might be that due to the low microbial activity at the deeper depths the eh conditions remain at positive values turkeltaub et al 2022 the calculated correlation coefficients between the different t components and the eh components indicate that the seasonal signals t monthly versus eh monthly are negatively correlated fig 3 daily or monthly changes in soil temperature showed weak relationships with the different eh components these results are in accordance with turkeltaub et al 2022 who illustrated that the eh values become very negative during the summer months when temperatures are high due to intensive microbial activity may october 3 3 mlr analysis following the above correlation analyses the different decomposed components and the original measurements of the gaseous o2 θ and t were used as input variables for the mlr model to predict eh at different depths the performance evaluations are presented in table 2 and table 3 note that the potential nonlinear contribution of the gaseous o2 θ and t to the mlr performance was examined as well table 2 to include the nonlinearity the measured time series the predictors were raised to the m power until the lowest rmse and the highest r2 were achieved for example the expression i 1 9 θ i in table 2 can be written as follows β 1 θ 1 β 2 θ 2 β 9 θ 9 an example of the improvement in the model s performances is depicted in fig 4 it is evident from table 2 table 3 and fig 4 that the gaseous o2 is the most important predictor of the eh conditions for all depths including the nonlinear relationship between the gaseous o2 and the eh improves the mlr s performance as it is expressed in lower rmse and higher r2 table 2 table 3 implementing the decomposed components t monthly and δθ monthly in the mlr expression 14 in table 2 table 3 shows a performance similar to including the original time series for t and θ expression 15 in table 2 table 3 thus the eh conditions in the sat vadose zone are mostly affected by the seasonal signal of the temperature this relationship has been qualitatively described using boxplots in our previous study turkeltaub et al 2022 in which the substantial negative values and variability of eh mainly occurred during summer may october the δθ monthly component s contribution to the mlr comes through providing knowledge regarding the length of the wetting and drying cycles an additional exercise was conducted to improve eh predictions not shown by separating the data between the wetting and drying stages however no further contribution was obtained according to the mlr results the gaseous o2 explains the majority above 80 of the sat vadose zone s eh variability at 25 cm depth in station 1 table 2 and at 25 and 50 cm depths in station 2 table 3 this implies that at the shallow depths of the sat vadose zone the eh dynamic is mostly controlled by aerobic conditions note that the mlr performances decrease substantially with depth table 2 table 3 although the gaseous o2 is a good predictor at these depths the effect of aerobic conditions is less conclusive from a physical perspective it is difficult to prove that o2 at a power larger than one is a predictor for eh there is no evidence for a dominant chemical reaction requiring many o2 molecules all at once that would affect the eh conditions the following section is devoted to the physical interpretation of the relationship between eh and o2 as it is expressed by the mlr 3 4 the eh o2 relationship the relationship between gaseous o2 and eh at 25 cm depth as it is expressed using the mlr method is presented in fig 5 expression 6 in table 2 was used to calculate the eh values in order to reduce the dimensions but the trend of the curve did not substantially change using other expressions such as 14 or 15 a distinct characteristic that can be inferred from the observations and the mlr curve is the occurrence of different eh o2 relationships along the gaseous o2 range fig 5 these differences are most likely an outcome of the changes in oxygen fluxes into the soil and microbial activity a piecewise regression approach was implemented to determine the possible breakpoints in which the eh o2 relationship demonstrates an abrupt change following multiple runs of the segmented package in r muggeo 2014 the optimal solution included two breakpoints three sets of linear regression equations and a similar performance of the mlr analysis described above table 4 fig 5 furthermore when applying the measured variables at 25 cm depth in station 2 as inputs for the linear functions in table 4 similar prediction performances were calculated rmse 183 r2 0 76 in segment 1 fig 5 the decrease in gaseous o2 is expressed in higher o2 gradients which effectively increase the o2 flux to the soil the rise in oxygen demand may indicate that microbial activity escalates which is attributed to the nutrient availability as θ increases segment 2 represents an equilibrium a steady state where the gaseous o2 fluxes into the soil are equal to the microbial oxygen demand fig 5 segments 3 is most likely within the range of the critical air content in which the connectivity between the atmosphere and the vadose zone is mainly controlled by the level of soil saturation note that θ and gaseous o2 exhibit a strong relationship at the critical point as was reported by ganot and dahlke 2021 and indicated by the current study s data fig 6 thus the o2 diffusivity and the increase in tortuosity play a dominant role in determining the gaseous o2 fluxes although the o2 gradients increase the o2 diffusivity decreases dramatically which is expressed in low o2 fluxes the differences between segments 2 and 3 may be related to the changes in microbial communities as conditions have transitioned from suboxic to anoxic conditions however no information was collected throughout the current study to support or reject this hypothesis and further investigation should be conducted at deeper depths of the sat vadose zone the eh o2 relationship can be described by a step function fig 7 provided that gaseous o2 is present in the sat vadose zone the eh would have high positive values fig 7 under the absence of gaseous o2 the eh conditions decrease towards moderately to extremely negative values since no clear process is demonstrated by the eh o2 relationship at deeper depths of the vadose zone it is speculated that the presence of o2 is sufficient to sustain a relatively low level of microbial activity thus the shift in eh conditions from suboxic to anoxic conditions is attributed to the arrival of a soil solution with low eh i e poorer in dissolved oxygen 3 5 estimation of eh conditions using θ and t measuring θ and t in soil is relatively frequently and easily practiced therefore establishing a method to predict eh conditions using θ and t is a logical next step for this purpose we tested two approaches in the first approach the gaseous o2 was predicted by the θair using a piecewise regression following the relationship depicted in fig 6 and the results are summarized in the supporting information table s1 note that inputting the t data in the regression did not improve the model s performance and thus it was omitted in the second approach a physical based model was applied to estimate gaseous o2 using the θ and t information subsequently the predicted gaseous o2 of the two approaches was inputted to the piecewise regression from table 4 to predict the eh conditions using the first approach in which two piecewise regression functions that describe the θ o2 relationship and the o2 eh relationship was used to predict eh did not provide convincing results and the discussion below is focused on the physical based method running equations 3 to 6 for a range of res0 ref values between 0 0001 and 1 table 1 the solution that attained the lowest rmse and the highest r2 was for a res0 ref value of 0 0055 kg m 3 hour 1 the model s performance was compared with the gaseous o2 observations obtained at 25 cm depth in station 1 fig 8 when using the simulated gaseous o2 as an input to the piecewise regression table 4 for the prediction of eh the rmse and r2 values were 245 and 0 58 respectively fig 9 a the validation of the model performance was conducted by using eh t and θ datasets that were collected between july and september 2020 there are no o2 measurements for this period due to sensor failure according to the statistical analysis the model provided similar performance fig 9 studies that have examined models ability to predict eh are scarce in the most updated study by rodríguez escales et al 2020 statistical evaluations of model eh predictions were not reported thus it is difficult to assess whether the combination between physical o2 diffusion and piecewise regression provides a satisfactory performance probably implementing a simple analytical solution to describe oxygen diffusion in the soil affected eh predictions using sophisticated solutions that can acknowledge for multidimensional subsurface soil oxygen concentration profiles may improve eh predictions although the mlr approach performs better than the combined models there is no physical or chemical justification to be used the piecewise model is the optimal approach ultimately this study outlined one option for predicting eh conditions in which gaseous o2 mainly prevails 4 summary and conclusions this study presents a detailed analysis of the eh t θ and o2 time series that were obtained in the sat vadose zone strong positive correlations were demonstrated between eh and o2 for their original and decomposed components only the seasonal components of t and eh showed a relatively strong negative correlation while the daily and monthly changes of t did not exhibit a substantial relationship with eh the monthly changes of θ contribute to the knowledge on eh by accounting for the length of the wetting and drying cycles using the mlr it was illustrated that gaseous o2 is a superior predictor of eh this indicates that eh is mainly affected by aerobic conditions in sat furthermore a highly nonlinear o2 eh relationship was revealed at shallow depths of the vadose zone the o2 eh relationship was identified with a breakpoint transition characteristic applying a piecewise regression showed similar performances as when the nonlinear mlr method was applied which reaffirmed the breakpoint characteristic the different stages revealed by the piecewise regression were attributed to changes in soil o2 fluxes at deeper depths of the sat vadose zone the o2 eh relationship shows a step function behavior where in the presence of gaseous o2 the eh conditions remain positive under the absence of gaseous o2 eh becomes negative this step function behavior may be related to low microbial activity although the presence of gaseous o2 and the decrease in eh is explained by the arrival of the low eh solution ultimately we suggest implementing a simple o2 diffusion analytical model together with the piecewise regression to predict eh conditions in sat by using easy to acquire t and θ measurements since the measurement of eh is relatively easy one can question the need to predict it however its prediction constitutes the establishment of an adequate relationship between eh and other variables e g gaseous o2 t etc which can elucidate the dynamics in sat systems and other environments this study emphasizes that the eh conditions in a sat vadose zone are essentially dominated by the presence of gaseous o2 nevertheless the outcomes of the current study cast into doubt the contribution of anaerobic processes such as denitrification to the overall changes in eh although there are number of studies on denitrification processes in managed aquifer recharge facilities only a few have presented detailed quantification assessments for denitrification in sat vadose zones future studies should focus on the hydrological and geochemical vadose zone conditions that enable denitrification financial support this work has been supported within the frame work of the goldinger trust jewish federation of delaware and by the

2228,quantifying water availability in different soil layers to crop root water uptake rwu in different rainfall years helps deliver strategies to combat water scarcity and improve water productivity to investigate the responses of rwu to soil water availability across distinct rainfall years a field experiment of winter wheat was conducted in 2017 2018 wet year 2018 2019 dry year and 2019 2020 ordinary year in the north china plain stable isotopes δ18o and δd in precipitation irrigation water xylem water and soil water as well as soil water content swc were investigated during the three wheat growth seasons and were used to determine the soil water evaporation line swel the linear relationship between δd and δ18o in soil water the line conditioned excess lc excess the deviation between δd and the local meteoric water line in the dual isotope space and the proportion of rwu from different soil layers with the mixsiar model the results indicated that there were significant differences in δ18o and δd in soil water and xylem water across different rainfall years the slopes of swel and lc excess of the 0 100 cm soil layer in the dry year were significantly smaller than those in the ordinary and wet years which suggests that more substantial soil evaporation occurred in the dry year the mixsiar results revealed that the three year wheat rwu exhibited different patterns which were related to soil water availability wheat mainly utilized soil water from the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm layers during the greening to filling stage under the dry year while it mainly utilized the 0 20 cm soil layer under the wet and ordinary years however at the harvest stage wheat under all precipitation years could transfer its main rwu zone to the 20 60 cm soil layer there were significantly different proportions of rwu from 0 to 60 cm under different rainfall years shown as 75 3 67 5 and 69 5 in the wet year dry year and ordinary year respectively these findings indicated that the appropriate irrigation wetting depth should be set as 60 cm for all kinds of rainfall years keywords root water uptake rainfall years stable isotope mixsiar model winter wheat data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to face the challenges of water resource shortages caused by population increases consumption growth climate change etc numerous studies have been conducted mainly focusing on the water cycle in forest and agricultural ecosystems ding et al 2020 harrison et al 2020 muñoz villers et al 2020 root water uptake rwu is a vital process for water cycling in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac sprenger et al 2016 for crops rwu is also a very good index for indicating plants absorption ability to soil water and reflecting the changes in soil water content swc distribution dai et al 2020 muñoz villers et al 2020 penna et al 2020 thus more knowledge of rwu variations will be beneficial for a better understanding of plant water relations in spac and providing critical insights for agricultural water management the rwu pattern of plants has been widely investigated by measurements of phenological traits draye et al 2010 nehemy et al 2021 root distribution ahmad et al 2018 jha et al 2017 swc or soil matric potential ma and song 2019 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2019 and isotopic tracers beyer et al 2020 hou et al 2021 muñoz villers et al 2020 wang et al 2021 stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen δ18o and δd have been applied successfully to identify plant rwu due to their advantage in accurately quantifying the contribution of each water source irrigation water winter and summer precipitation etc temporally and spatially shallow middle and deep soil groundwater etc hardanto et al 2017 hou et al 2021 liu et al 2020 nehemy et al 2021 pan et al 2020 penna et al 2020 many recent studies have focused on determining the mechanisms and variability of plant rwu during the investigation periods allen et al 2019 hou et al 2021 muñoz villers et al 2020 nehemy et al 2021 zhao et al 2018a winter wheat or summer corn for instance mainly took water from the 0 30 cm soil layer during the seedling and jointing periods liu et al 2021 zhao et al 2018a and increasing rwu depths were found as the crops grew liu et al 2020 ma and song 2016 yang et al 2018 reaching 80 cm or even deeper during the filling period guo et al 2016 ma and song 2016 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 however there is a lack of understanding of the rwu pattern over different precipitation years for example it remains elusive to what extent a change in precipitation alters soil water distribution and rwu from different soil layers in addition irrigation changes the crop rwu patterns significantly and the combined influence of irrigation and precipitation on crop water acquisition has been overlooked but it is critical for optimizing irrigation scheduling winter wheat is one of the most important grain crops in the north china plain ncp and contributes approximately 70 of the national total wheat yield national bureau of statistics of china 2018 however wheat production consumes 70 of china s irrigation water although this number is intensively affected by weather especially the precipitation amount and distribution in winter wheat growing seasons tang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018b for example binzhou city located in the hinterland of the yellow river delta has annual precipitation variations ranging from 286 to 855 mm and a mean of 589 mm of the annual total precipitation only approximately 25 i e 152 61 mm is felt in the winter wheat growing season of middle october to middle june which results in a 210 330 mm water deficit for normal winter wheat growth zhao et al 2020 to maintain a high yield of winter wheat supplemental irrigation is often necessary farmers in the binzhou area generally irrigate 3 5 times during the whole winter wheat growing season however farmers usually choose overirrigation to maximize yield based on their experiences which may increase potential threats to groundwater security and decrease water use efficiency jha et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 crop yield can be effectively enhanced by optimizing irrigation water management in conjunction with precipitation several studies have found that wheat yield is significantly affected by the amount of precipitation de vita et al 2007 li et al 2021 precipitation also significantly impacts soil water distribution and plant rwu liu et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 therefore a better understanding of the interactions between precipitation and rwu may play an important role in formulating robust and reasonable irrigation scheduling under different hydrological years for the sustainable utilization of agricultural water resources we hypothesized that winter wheat would change its rwu source in response to the availability of soil moisture under different hydrological years to verify this hypothesis field experiments were conducted to measure stable isotopes δd and δ18o in precipitation soil water 0 150 cm depth irrigation water and xylem water in three winter wheat growth seasons with three typical rainfall patterns the objectives of this study were 1 to determine δd and δ18o variation in different water sources 2 to quantify the proportion of rwu at different growing stages of winter wheat and 3 to develop a suitable irrigation wetting depth for winter wheat in different precipitation years 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment field experiments on winter wheat were conducted in boxing

soil water content daily precipitation air temperature relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd in the study area during the three wheat seasons are shown in fig 1 the total amount of precipitation during the three seasons was significantly different it was 253 5 mm 95 5 mm and 162 7 mm in the 2017 2018 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 seasons respectively and distributed mainly from march to may fig 1a the mean daily air temperatures were 8 2 c 8 4 c and 8 8 c in the 2017 2018 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 seasons respectively fig 1a during the main experimental period of march to may the

dongying city which is approximately 70 km away from boxing county the probability of annual precipitation was calculated with the pearson iii frequency curve method the wet season ordinary season and dry season were defined as the exceedance probability of annual precipitation being 25 26 75 and 76 respectively the total annual rainfall ranged from 107 9 to 179 0 mm for the ordinary season 179 0 mm for the wet season and 107 9 mm for the dry season based on the definition it is reasonable to consider the 2017 2018 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons as wet year dry year and ordinary year respectively the average soil water content swc was 19 0 in the wet year 16 5 in the normal year and 15 9 in the dry year a tiny difference in swc existed among different precipitation years during the greening and jointing stages in the period of heading to early filling the variation in swc was mainly in the 0 60 cm soil layer in the wet year but in the 0 150 cm soil layer in the dry and normal years the swc of 0 150 cm drastically increased at the mid filling stage due to irrigation or heavy precipitation events at the end of the growing season the swc in the wet year was significantly greater than that in the dry and normal years generally the major changes in swc occurred in the 0 60 cm soil layer in the wet year and in the 0 100 cm soil layer in the ordinary and dry years fig 2 3 2 isotopic compositions of water samples the δ18o values of rainwater varied significantly over the whole study period ranging from 8 26 to 1 41 in the wet year 8 74 to 1 22 in the dry year and 5 90 to 0 47 in the ordinary year p 0 05 fig 3 the swc δd and δ18o values varied significantly among wheat growing seasons sd sampling date and soil layer depths p 0 01 table 2 the δd and δ18o of soil water in the ordinary year were significantly lower than those in the other two years p 0 05 fig 3 the δ18o values of soil water decreased gradually over depth and the enrichment of δ18o in the 0 60 cm layer was more obvious than those in the 60 100 cm and 100 150 cm soil layers p 0 01 for all sampling data the isotopic composition of soil water in the 0 60 cm layer was similar to that in precipitation but the isotopic composition of water samples from other soil layers was distinct from that in precipitation fig 3 the δ18o values of irrigation water in the ordinary year ranging from 8 28 to 7 34 were significantly lower than those in the other two precipitation years 7 94 to 6 93 in the wet year and 7 16 to 6 09 in the dry year p 0 05 fig 3 there was a relatively small variation in isotopic composition in irrigation water compared with that in rainfall and soil water the δd and δ18o values in crop xylem water were significantly different among years and sd p 0 01 table 2 the δ18o of xylem water in the ordinary year significantly differed from those in the wet year and dry year the δ18o in xylem water was significantly correlated with that in soil water from the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm layers during the three growing seasons p 0 05 except that of the 20 60 cm layer in the dry year p 0 05 3 3 relationship between δd and δ18o in different water sources the local meteoric water line lmwl and soil water evaporation line swel are shown in fig 3 the lmwl was fitted as δd 7 81 δ18o 12 71 in the wet year fig 3a in this study and its slope and intercept were closer to those of the gmwl but higher than those of the lmwl in the other two rainfall years fig 3b and c the output of the analysis of covariance indicated that there was a significant difference for the intercept of lmwl p 0 01 but no significant difference for the slope p 0 05 most soil water isotopic compositions fell below the lmwl fig 3a c which indicated that δd and δ18o in soil water underwent strong evaporative enrichment the slopes and intercepts of the δd and δ18o relationship line in soil water fig 3a c showed the same order wet year ordinary year dry year meanwhile there were significant differences in the slope and intercept of swel in the three rainfall years by the analysis of covariance p 0 01 the δd and δ18o of xylem water were similar to those of soil water in the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm layers fig 3 implying that water was mainly taken up from 0 to 60 cm 3 4 line conditioned excess the lc excess values in different water sources are shown in fig 3 the lc excess values of soil water varied significantly among rainfall years sd and soil layer depths p 0 01 table 2 the lc excess values of soil water in the 0 100 cm soil layer in the dry year were significantly lower than those in the other two rainfall years fig 3 the soil water lc excess increased roughly with increasing soil layer depth especially in the dry year and ordinary year which indicated that evaporation decreased with increasing soil depth p 0 05 overall the lc excess values of soil water and xylem water in the dry year were lower than those in the ordinary and wet years indicating a stronger evaporative signature in the dry year p 0 05 3 5 yield and root water uptake of winter wheat the wheat grain yield in the wet year was significantly less than that in the dry and ordinary years being 6686 kg ha 1 8656 kg ha 1 and 9283 kg ha 1 respectively this phenomenon was largely due to the low temperature at the early jointing stage of wheat in the wet year fig 1a which resulted in a decrease in tiller number and damage to vegetative organs to some extent in general the proportion of rwu in different soil layers varied significantly fig 4 and table 2 there were significant differences in rwu across sd and soil layer depth in the wet year as shown in fig 4 and table 2 p 0 01 but no significant differences were investigated in the other two rainfall years p 0 05 in wet and ordinary years wheat mainly utilized water from the shallow soil layer of 0 20 cm at the greening stage and filling stage with mean values of 49 7 and 41 1 fig 4a e much higher than the 25 6 and 28 4 contributions from the middle layer of 20 60 cm and 24 9 and 30 4 from the deep soil layer of 60 150 cm depth however wheat water uptake was mainly concentrated in the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm soil layers at the greening stage in the dry year and contributed 30 8 and 29 6 p 0 05 of the total water uptake respectively fig 4a as the crops grew the wheat rwu was concentrated mainly in the shallow 0 20 cm soil layer and contributed approximately 47 7 of the total rwu in the period of the jointing to filling stage in the dry year fig 4b e however the rwu was concentrated in the middle soil layer of 20 60 cm at the harvest stage in all precipitation years fig 4f and supplied 35 5 31 0 and 35 2 of the total rwu in wet dry and ordinary years p 0 05 respectively the differences in the contribution proportion of wheat rwu from different soil layers during all growing stages are shown in fig 4g the data show that on average wheat mainly utilized soil water from the 0 20 cm layer however the contribution of the 0 20 cm layer to rwu in the wet year is significantly higher than that in the dry and ordinary years being 49 7 41 0 and 41 1 respectively simultaneously the proportion of rwu at other layers in the wet year is significantly lower than that in the dry and ordinary years 4 discussion 4 1 isotopic variations in various water sources there were significant differences in the δd and δ18o of various water sources due to the isotopic fractionation effect sprenger et al 2019 the slope of lmwl under the dry year in the current study was less than that under the wet and ordinary years suggesting that a stronger evaporation rate occurs in the dry year similarly the slopes and intercept values of swel fig 3 showed the same order as lmwl wet year ordinary year dry year meanwhile analysis of covariance indicated that there were significant differences in the slopes and intercepts of swel among the three years p 0 01 these differences may be attributed to the result of isotope fractionation during evaporation and infiltration of irrigation and rainfall asbjornsen et al 2007 wu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 the stable isotopes of soil water varied among different depths the fluctuation of δd and δ18o values at 60 150 cm depth was significantly lower than that at 0 60 cm depth the δd and δ18o of 0 60 cm were more subject to either enrichment or depletion due to the dual influence of water input irrigation or precipitation and evaporation enrichment sprenger et al 2018 wu et al 2019 the stable isotopes δd and δ18o of stem water were similar to those of 0 60 cm soil water indicating that xylem water has a close hydraulic relationship with soil water in of the 0 60 cm layer indeed the results also demonstrated that no fractionation occurred during the process of rwu because the δd and δ18o of the xylem did not offset those of the soil the lc excess has been used to reflect the evaporation intensity of grasslands and forests in arid and semiarid areas lyu et al 2021 sprenger et al 2017 in this study the lc excess values of soil water in the dry year were significantly lower than those in the wet and ordinary years p 0 05 fig 3 in addition the lc excess of soil water also varied significantly among different sampling depths in the dry and ordinary years but did not differ in the wet year these data indicated that the order of evaporation intensity in the three years may be expressed as dry year ordinary year wet year previous studies showed that lc excess was dominated by evaporation fractionation factors and soil residual water storage hasselquist et al 2018 lyu et al 2021 sprenger et al 2017 indeed there were significant correlations between the lc excess and swc of the shallow soil layer in the wet and ordinary years while there was no significant correlation in the dry year 4 2 contrasting wheat root water uptake under different precipitation years previous studies have shown that winter wheat utilizes soil water primarily from the 0 20 cm layer during the greening and jointing stages zhao et al 2018a whereas the rwu depth is mainly within 20 60 cm during the flowering and harvest stages liu et al 2021 liu et al 2020 in this study winter wheat in the three rainfall years mainly absorbed soil water from the 0 60 cm layer over the growing seasons this phenomenon may be attributed to the majority of wheat roots concentrated in the 0 60 cm soil layer jha et al 2017 interestingly the predominant depth of rwu switched from the 0 20 cm soil layer at the filling stage to the 20 60 cm soil layer at the harvest stage three reasons contributed to the decrease in the rwu proportion in the 0 20 cm soil layer ① roots grew to deeper soil layers which made it easier to absorb water from deeper soil layers as growth progressed ② the senescence of roots in the topsoil layer reduced the contribution of rwu from the shallow layer yang et al 2018 and ③ the amount of available water in the shallow soil layer might decrease although winter wheat mainly utilized water from the 0 60 cm soil layer the rwu proportion from each soil water was significantly different under different precipitation years fig 4g p 0 05 during the wet and ordinary year winter wheat primarily absorbed soil water from 0 to 20 cm during the greening to filling stage in contrast wheat in the dry year mainly takes soil water from the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm layers this phenomenon may be related to the differences in soil moisture under different precipitation years langs et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 for instance more precipitation input occurred in the wet year and increased the 0 20 cm soil water availability at this stage accordingly the proportion of rwu for 0 20 cm soil water in the wet year is significantly higher than that in the dry and ordinary years such as at the greening heading and filling stages however the absence of irrigation or rainfall input notably decreased the 0 20 cm soil water availability at the jointing stage of the wet year consequently winter wheat increased its water uptake from the 20 60 cm soil layer to obtain sufficient water for crop growth and development in contrast the rwu proportion of the 0 20 cm soil layer at the jointing stage in the ordinary year was significantly higher than that in the other two years this was mainly due to the soil water availability of the 0 20 cm layer in the ordinary year being higher than that in the other years fig 2 these results were the findings of several researchers which revealed that the change in rwu was consistent with the variation in soil moisture availability liu et al 2021 liu et al 2020 yang et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to investigate the relationship between rwu and soil moisture the rwu was closely related to the soil moisture change during the growth stages grellier et al 2020 muñoz villers et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 a recent study reported that rwu was negatively correlated with soil moisture zhao et al 2018a in this study the rwu was also negatively correlated with the relative soil water content rswc the ratio of swc to field capacity and can be shown as rwu 0 56 rswc 0 69 r 0 53 p 0 01 rwu 0 41 rswc 0 52 r 0 52 p 0 01 and rwu 0 34 rswc 0 43 r 0 49 p 0 01 in the wet dry and ordinary years respectively these relationships indicated that persistent rwu could gradually result in soil drying during the wheat growing period simultaneously our results also showed that the contribution of 0 20 cm soil water in the wet year was significantly higher than that in the dry year p 0 05 fig 4g while the other soil layers showed the opposite result drought may further decrease shallow soil water availability this result is similar to a previous study that indicated that the reduction in rainfall amount may increase rwu from deeper soil layers for mongolian pine zhou et al 2019 drought would also strengthen evapotranspiration by increasing vpd and a considerable swc limitation to rwu would develop schlaepfer et al 2017 song et al 2020 therefore the relationship between the proportion of rswc in the 0 20 cm soil layer and vpd was developed as follows rswc 0 41 vpd 1 03 r 0 74 p 0 01 rswc 0 28 vpd 0 79 r 0 38 p 0 05 and rswc 0 39 vpd 0 95 r 0 80 p 0 01 for the wet dry and ordinary years respectively these results indicated that drought lowers the soil moisture of shallow layers by increasing vpd and in turn wheat tends to absorb middle soil water 4 3 implications this study quantified the contributions of various water sources to wheat rwu under different precipitation years based on stable isotope technology in this study winter wheat mainly acquired water from the 0 60 cm soil layer throughout all growth stages in the three different precipitation years although there were significant differences in the proportions of rwu from the 0 60 cm soil layer among different rainfall years the proportions varied in a smaller range and the real values were 75 3 67 5 and 69 5 in the wet dry and ordinary years respectively this result provides new insights into the agricultural water management of winter wheat under different rainfall years the suitable irrigation wetting depth should match the main depth of rwu yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 which ensures that as much irrigation water as possible may be stored in the main rwu zone therefore it is reasonable to suggest that the 0 60 cm soil layer is the appropriate irrigation wetting depth for all precipitation years in winter wheat production in the ncp 5 conclusion in this study the wheat rwu pattern was identified via stable isotope δd and δ18o techniques in three experimental years with different precipitation patterns in the north china plain most soil water isotope values are below the lmwl the slope values of swel are lower and given as 6 63 4 77 and 6 18 in the wet year dry year and ordinary year respectively in addition the lc excess of the 0 100 cm soil layer in the dry year was significantly lower than that in the ordinary and wet years which indicated that more substantial soil evaporation enrichment occurred in the dry year the mixsiar model revealed that wheat under the different precipitation years mainly utilized soil water from the 0 60 cm layer throughout all growth stages there were significant differences in the proportion of rwu from the 0 60 cm soil layer under different rainfall years but the values of the proportions in the three years varied in a small range with 75 3 67 5 and 69 5 in a wet year dry year and ordinary year respectively therefore the appropriate irrigation wetting depth may be suggested as 60 cm for all precipitation years for winter wheat production in the ncp author contributions yang gao and aiwang duan planned and designed the

2228,quantifying water availability in different soil layers to crop root water uptake rwu in different rainfall years helps deliver strategies to combat water scarcity and improve water productivity to investigate the responses of rwu to soil water availability across distinct rainfall years a field experiment of winter wheat was conducted in 2017 2018 wet year 2018 2019 dry year and 2019 2020 ordinary year in the north china plain stable isotopes δ18o and δd in precipitation irrigation water xylem water and soil water as well as soil water content swc were investigated during the three wheat growth seasons and were used to determine the soil water evaporation line swel the linear relationship between δd and δ18o in soil water the line conditioned excess lc excess the deviation between δd and the local meteoric water line in the dual isotope space and the proportion of rwu from different soil layers with the mixsiar model the results indicated that there were significant differences in δ18o and δd in soil water and xylem water across different rainfall years the slopes of swel and lc excess of the 0 100 cm soil layer in the dry year were significantly smaller than those in the ordinary and wet years which suggests that more substantial soil evaporation occurred in the dry year the mixsiar results revealed that the three year wheat rwu exhibited different patterns which were related to soil water availability wheat mainly utilized soil water from the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm layers during the greening to filling stage under the dry year while it mainly utilized the 0 20 cm soil layer under the wet and ordinary years however at the harvest stage wheat under all precipitation years could transfer its main rwu zone to the 20 60 cm soil layer there were significantly different proportions of rwu from 0 to 60 cm under different rainfall years shown as 75 3 67 5 and 69 5 in the wet year dry year and ordinary year respectively these findings indicated that the appropriate irrigation wetting depth should be set as 60 cm for all kinds of rainfall years keywords root water uptake rainfall years stable isotope mixsiar model winter wheat data

studies have been conducted mainly focusing on the water cycle in forest and agricultural ecosystems ding et al 2020 harrison et al 2020 muñoz villers et al 2020 root water uptake rwu is a vital process for water cycling in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac sprenger et al 2016 for crops rwu is also a very good index for indicating plants absorption ability to soil water and reflecting the changes in soil water content swc distribution dai et al 2020 muñoz villers et al 2020 penna et al 2020 thus more knowledge of rwu variations will be beneficial for a better understanding of plant water relations in spac and providing critical insights for agricultural water management the rwu pattern of plants has been widely investigated by measurements of phenological traits draye et al 2010

muñoz villers et al 2020 wang et al 2021 stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen δ18o and δd have been applied successfully to identify plant rwu due to their advantage in accurately quantifying the contribution of each water source irrigation water winter and summer precipitation etc temporally and spatially shallow middle and deep soil groundwater etc hardanto et al 2017 hou et al 2021 liu et al 2020 nehemy et al 2021 pan et al 2020 penna et al 2020 many recent studies have focused on determining the mechanisms and variability of plant rwu during the investigation periods allen et al 2019 hou et al 2021 muñoz villers et al 2020 nehemy et al 2021 zhao et al 2018a winter wheat or summer corn for instance mainly took water from the 0 30 cm soil layer during the seedling and jointing periods liu et al 2021 zhao et al 2018a and increasing rwu depths were found as the crops grew liu et al 2020 ma and song 2016 yang et al 2018 reaching 80 cm or even deeper during the filling period guo et al 2016 ma and song 2016 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 however there is a lack of understanding of the rwu pattern over different precipitation years for example it remains elusive to what extent a change in precipitation alters soil water distribution and rwu from different soil layers in addition irrigation changes the crop rwu patterns significantly and the combined influence of irrigation and precipitation on crop water acquisition has been overlooked but it is critical for optimizing irrigation scheduling winter wheat is one of the most important grain crops in the north china plain ncp and contributes approximately 70 of the national total wheat yield national bureau of statistics of china 2018 however wheat production consumes 70 of china s irrigation water although this number is intensively affected by weather especially the precipitation amount and distribution in winter wheat growing seasons tang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018b for example binzhou city located in the hinterland of the yellow river delta has annual precipitation variations ranging from 286 to 855 mm and a mean of 589 mm of the annual total precipitation only approximately 25 i e 152 61 mm is felt in the winter wheat growing season of middle october to middle june which results in a 210 330 mm water deficit for normal winter wheat growth zhao et al 2020 to maintain a high yield of winter wheat supplemental irrigation is often necessary farmers in the binzhou area generally irrigate 3 5 times during the whole winter wheat growing season however farmers usually choose overirrigation to maximize yield based on their experiences which may increase potential threats to groundwater security and decrease water use efficiency jha et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 crop yield can be effectively enhanced by optimizing irrigation water management in conjunction with precipitation several studies have found that wheat yield is significantly affected by the amount of precipitation de vita et al 2007 li et al 2021 precipitation also significantly impacts soil water distribution and plant rwu liu et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 therefore a better understanding of the interactions between precipitation and rwu may play an important role in formulating robust and reasonable irrigation scheduling under different hydrological years for the sustainable utilization of agricultural water resources we hypothesized that winter wheat would change its rwu source in response to the availability of soil moisture under different hydrological years to verify this hypothesis field experiments were conducted to measure stable isotopes δd and δ18o in precipitation soil water 0 150 cm depth irrigation water and xylem water in three winter wheat growth seasons with three typical rainfall patterns the objectives of this study were 1 to determine δd and δ18o variation in different water sources 2 to quantify the proportion of rwu at different growing stages of winter wheat and 3 to develop a suitable irrigation wetting depth for winter wheat in different precipitation years 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment field experiments on winter wheat were conducted in boxing county shandong province china 118 29 e 37 06 n from 2017 to 2020 the region is characterized by a temperate continental monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation from 1991 to 2020 was 589 146 4 mm with strong interannual and interseasonal variation and the mean air temperature was 13 4 0 5 c the soil type is silt loam with a bulk density of 1 5 g cm 3 the field capacity defined as the amount of water that remains after the gravity water has drained away from the saturated soil and the saturated water content for the 0 100 cm soil profile are 0 33 cm cm 3 and 0 39 cm cm 3 respectively the wheat variety used in 2017 2018 was jimai 22 and the variety jimai 23 was used in 2018 2020 due to the natural replacement of the variety wheat was sown in early october and harvested in early june three plots of 180 m2 9 m 20 m were selected to implement 3 replications basal fertilizer was applied in the field before wheat sowing with urea n calcium superphosphate p2o5 and potassium sulfate k2o when the average swc of the 0 100 cm soil layer in any plot was lower than 60 of the field capacity the planned water amount of 90 mm was irrigated immediately the scheduling of irrigation and fertilization application in the three seasons is shown in table 1 2 2 sampling and measurements wheat stem and soil samples were collected for stable isotopes δd and δ18o at the six growth stages of

respectively rainfall samples were preserved at 4 c and soil and crop samples were refrigerated at 15 c until analysis six wheat plants with three replicates were randomly sampled in each growth stage the stem between the soil surface and the first node of each plant was collected for isotopic analysis soil samples were collected at 5 cm intervals for the 0 10 cm layer 10 cm intervals from 10 to 40 cm layer 20 cm intervals from 40 to 120 cm and 30 cm intervals from 120 to 150 cm while swc was measured by the oven drying method crop xylem and soil water were extracted via the vacuum cryo distillation system li 2000 lica united technology limited beijing china in extracting soil or xylem samples the extraction temperature was set to 95 the system pressure was 0 2 pa and the duration was 180 min the water extraction efficiency was better than 98 0 otherwise the water sample was considered discarded zhao et al 2018a all of the extracted water was transferred into a 10 ml glass bottle and stored in a refrigerator at 4 before isotopic analysis all water samples were analyzed for δd and δ18o all water samples and isotopic standards were injected sequentially three times 0 1 μl

difference in isotopic composition for water samples the isotope compositions δd and δ18o were calculated as follows 1 δ r sample r s tan d a r d r s tan d a r d 1000 r sample r s tan d a r d 1 1000

crop stem 2 source data contain the δd and δ18o values for the different soil layers and 3 discrimination data was set to zero because no isotopic fractionation is expected to occur during root water uptake corneo et al 2018 dawson et al 2002 penna et al 2020 yang et al 2022 the error option was residual only and the parameter of markov chain monte carlo mcmc was set to long the convergence of the mixsiar model was seen from the gelman rubin and geweke diagnostic tests wang et al 2017 the water sources from different soil layers were combined into four layers i e 0 20 20 60 60 100 and 100 150 cm to facilitate the rwu analysis hierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify the soil layers according to the similarities in swc between the soil depths the groundwater table is over 30 m

soil water content daily precipitation air temperature relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd in the study area during the three wheat seasons are shown in fig 1 the total amount of precipitation during the three seasons was significantly different it was 253 5 mm 95 5 mm and 162 7 mm in the 2017 2018 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 seasons respectively and distributed mainly from march to may fig 1a the mean daily air temperatures were 8 2 c 8 4 c and 8 8 c in the 2017 2018 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 seasons respectively fig 1a during the main experimental period of march to may the mean daily values of rh and vpd were 67 5 and 0 63 kpa 63 3 and 0 66 kpa and 70 3 and 0 52 kpa in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 1b based on the 60 year precipitation data from 1955 to 2015 in dongying city which is approximately 70 km away from boxing county the probability of annual precipitation was calculated with the pearson iii frequency curve method the wet season ordinary season and dry season were defined as the exceedance probability of annual precipitation being 25 26 75 and 76 respectively the total annual rainfall ranged from 107 9 to 179 0 mm for the ordinary season 179 0 mm for the wet season and 107 9 mm for the dry season based on the definition it is reasonable to consider the 2017 2018 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 growing seasons as wet year dry year and ordinary year respectively the average soil water content swc was 19 0 in the wet year 16 5 in the normal year and 15 9 in the dry year a tiny difference in swc existed among different precipitation years during the greening and jointing stages in the period of heading to early filling the variation in swc was mainly in the 0 60 cm soil layer in the wet year but in the 0 150 cm soil layer in the dry and normal years the swc of 0 150 cm drastically increased at the mid filling stage due to irrigation or heavy precipitation events at the end of the growing season the swc in the wet year was significantly greater than that in the dry and normal years generally the major changes in swc occurred in the 0 60 cm soil layer in the wet year and in the 0 100 cm soil layer in the ordinary and dry years fig 2 3 2 isotopic compositions of water samples the δ18o values of rainwater varied significantly over the whole study period ranging from 8 26 to 1 41 in the wet year 8 74 to 1 22 in the dry year and 5 90 to 0 47 in the ordinary year p 0 05 fig 3 the swc δd and δ18o values varied significantly among wheat growing seasons sd sampling date and soil layer depths p 0 01 table 2 the δd and δ18o of soil water in the ordinary year were significantly lower than those in the other two years p 0 05 fig 3 the δ18o values of soil water decreased gradually over depth and the enrichment of δ18o in the 0 60 cm layer was more obvious than those in the 60 100 cm and 100 150 cm soil layers p 0 01 for all sampling data the isotopic composition of soil water in the 0 60 cm layer was similar to that in precipitation but the isotopic composition of water samples from other soil layers was distinct from that in precipitation fig 3 the δ18o values of irrigation water in the ordinary year ranging from 8 28 to 7 34 were significantly lower than those in the other two precipitation years 7 94 to 6 93 in the wet year and 7 16 to 6 09 in the dry year p 0 05 fig 3 there was a relatively small variation in isotopic composition in irrigation water compared with that in rainfall and soil water the δd and δ18o values in crop xylem water were significantly different among years and sd p 0 01 table 2 the δ18o of xylem water in the ordinary year significantly differed from those in the wet year and dry year the δ18o in xylem water was significantly correlated with that in soil water from the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm layers during the three growing seasons p 0 05 except that of the 20 60 cm layer in the dry year p 0 05 3 3 relationship between δd and δ18o in different water sources the local meteoric water line lmwl and soil water evaporation line swel are shown in fig 3 the lmwl was fitted as δd 7 81 δ18o 12 71 in the wet year fig 3a in this study and its slope and intercept were closer to those of the gmwl but higher than those of the lmwl in the other two rainfall years fig 3b and c the output of the analysis of covariance indicated that there was a significant difference for the intercept of lmwl p 0 01 but no significant difference for the slope p 0 05 most soil water isotopic compositions fell below the lmwl fig 3a c which indicated that δd and δ18o in soil water underwent strong evaporative enrichment the slopes and intercepts of the δd and δ18o relationship line in soil water fig 3a c showed the same order wet year ordinary year dry year meanwhile there were significant differences in the slope and intercept of swel in the three rainfall years by the analysis of covariance p 0 01 the δd and δ18o of xylem water were similar to those of soil water in the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm layers fig 3 implying that water was mainly taken up from 0 to 60 cm 3 4 line conditioned excess the lc excess values in different water sources are shown in fig 3 the lc excess values of soil water varied significantly among rainfall years sd and soil layer depths p 0 01 table 2 the lc excess values of soil water in the 0 100 cm soil layer in the dry year were significantly lower than those in the other two rainfall years fig 3 the soil water lc excess increased roughly with increasing soil layer depth especially in the dry year and ordinary year which indicated that evaporation decreased with increasing soil depth p 0 05 overall the lc excess values of soil water and xylem water in the dry year were lower than those in the ordinary and wet years indicating a stronger evaporative signature in the dry year p 0 05 3 5 yield and root water uptake of winter wheat the wheat grain yield in the wet year was significantly less than that in the dry and ordinary years being 6686 kg ha 1 8656 kg ha 1 and 9283 kg ha 1 respectively this phenomenon was largely due to the low temperature at the early jointing stage of wheat in the wet year fig 1a which resulted in a decrease in tiller number and damage to vegetative organs to some extent in general the proportion of rwu in different soil layers varied significantly fig 4 and table 2 there were significant differences in rwu across sd and soil layer depth in the wet year as shown in fig 4 and table 2 p 0 01 but no significant differences were investigated in the other two rainfall years p 0 05 in wet and ordinary years wheat mainly utilized water from the shallow soil layer of 0 20 cm at the greening stage and filling stage with mean values of 49 7 and 41 1 fig 4a e much higher than the 25 6 and 28 4 contributions from the middle layer of 20 60 cm and 24 9 and 30 4 from the deep soil layer of 60 150 cm depth however wheat water uptake was mainly concentrated in the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm soil layers at the greening stage in the dry year and contributed 30 8 and 29 6 p 0 05 of the total water uptake respectively fig 4a as the crops grew the wheat rwu was concentrated mainly in the shallow 0 20 cm soil layer and contributed approximately 47 7 of the total rwu in the period of the jointing to filling stage in the dry year fig 4b e however the rwu was concentrated in the middle soil layer of 20 60 cm at the harvest stage in all precipitation years fig 4f and supplied 35 5 31 0 and 35 2 of the total rwu in wet dry and ordinary years p 0 05 respectively the differences in the contribution proportion of wheat rwu from different soil layers during all growing stages are shown in fig 4g the data show that on average wheat mainly utilized soil water from the 0 20 cm layer however the contribution of the 0 20 cm layer to rwu in the wet year is significantly higher than that in the dry and ordinary years being 49 7 41 0 and 41 1 respectively simultaneously the proportion of rwu at other layers in the wet year is significantly lower than that in the dry and ordinary years 4 discussion 4 1 isotopic variations in various water sources there were significant differences in the δd and δ18o of various water sources due to the isotopic fractionation effect sprenger et al 2019 the slope of lmwl under the dry year in the current study was less than that under the wet and ordinary years suggesting that a stronger evaporation rate occurs in the dry year similarly the slopes and intercept values of swel fig 3 showed the same order as lmwl wet year ordinary year dry year meanwhile analysis of covariance indicated that there were significant differences in the slopes and intercepts of swel among the three years p 0 01 these differences may be attributed to the result of isotope fractionation during evaporation and infiltration of irrigation and rainfall asbjornsen et al 2007 wu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 the stable isotopes of soil water varied among different depths the fluctuation of δd and δ18o values at 60 150 cm depth was significantly lower than that at 0 60 cm depth the δd and δ18o of 0 60 cm were more subject to either enrichment or depletion due to the dual influence of water input irrigation or precipitation and evaporation enrichment sprenger et al 2018 wu et al 2019 the stable isotopes δd and δ18o of stem water were similar to those of 0 60 cm soil water indicating that xylem water has a close hydraulic relationship with soil water in of the 0 60 cm layer indeed the results also demonstrated that no fractionation occurred during the process of rwu because the δd and δ18o of the xylem did not offset those of the soil the lc excess has been used to reflect the evaporation intensity of grasslands and forests in arid and semiarid areas lyu et al 2021 sprenger et al 2017 in this study the lc excess values of soil water in the dry year were significantly lower than those in the wet and ordinary years p 0 05 fig 3 in addition the lc excess of soil water also varied significantly among different sampling depths in the dry and ordinary years but did not differ in the wet year these data indicated that the order of evaporation intensity in the three years may be expressed as dry year ordinary year wet year previous studies showed that lc excess was dominated by evaporation fractionation factors and soil residual water storage hasselquist et al 2018 lyu et al 2021 sprenger et al 2017 indeed there were significant correlations between the lc excess and swc of the shallow soil layer in the wet and ordinary years while there was no significant correlation in the dry year 4 2 contrasting wheat root water uptake under different precipitation years previous studies have shown that winter wheat utilizes soil water primarily from the 0 20 cm layer during the greening and jointing stages zhao et al 2018a whereas the rwu depth is mainly within 20 60 cm during the flowering and harvest stages liu et al 2021 liu et al 2020 in this study winter wheat in the three rainfall years mainly absorbed soil water from the 0 60 cm layer over the growing seasons this phenomenon may be attributed to the majority of wheat roots concentrated in the 0 60 cm soil layer jha et al 2017 interestingly the predominant depth of rwu switched from the 0 20 cm soil layer at the filling stage to the 20 60 cm soil layer at the harvest stage three reasons contributed to the decrease in the rwu proportion in the 0 20 cm soil layer ① roots grew to deeper soil layers which made it easier to absorb water from deeper soil layers as growth progressed ② the senescence of roots in the topsoil layer reduced the contribution of rwu from the shallow layer yang et al 2018 and ③ the amount of available water in the shallow soil layer might decrease although winter wheat mainly utilized water from the 0 60 cm soil layer the rwu proportion from each soil water was significantly different under different precipitation years fig 4g p 0 05 during the wet and ordinary year winter wheat primarily absorbed soil water from 0 to 20 cm during the greening to filling stage in contrast wheat in the dry year mainly takes soil water from the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm layers this phenomenon may be related to the differences in soil moisture under different precipitation years langs et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 for instance more precipitation input occurred in the wet year and increased the 0 20 cm soil water availability at this stage accordingly the proportion of rwu for 0 20 cm soil water in the wet year is significantly higher than that in the dry and ordinary years such as at the greening heading and filling stages however the absence of irrigation or rainfall input notably decreased the 0 20 cm soil water availability at the jointing stage of the wet year consequently winter wheat increased its water uptake from the 20 60 cm soil layer to obtain sufficient water for crop growth and development in contrast the rwu proportion of the 0 20 cm soil layer at the jointing stage in the ordinary year was significantly higher than that in the other two years this was mainly due to the soil water availability of the 0 20 cm layer in the ordinary year being higher than that in the other years fig 2 these results were the findings of several researchers which revealed that the change in rwu was consistent with the variation in soil moisture availability liu et al 2021 liu et al 2020 yang et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to investigate the relationship between rwu and soil moisture the rwu was closely related to the soil moisture change during the growth stages grellier et al 2020 muñoz villers et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 a recent study reported that rwu was negatively correlated with soil moisture zhao et al 2018a in this study the rwu was also negatively correlated with the relative soil water content rswc the ratio of swc to field capacity and can be shown as rwu 0 56 rswc 0 69 r 0 53 p 0 01 rwu 0 41 rswc 0 52 r 0 52 p 0 01 and rwu 0 34 rswc 0 43 r 0 49 p 0 01 in the wet dry and ordinary years respectively these relationships indicated that persistent rwu could gradually result in soil drying during the wheat growing period simultaneously our results also showed that the contribution of 0 20 cm soil water in the wet year was significantly higher than that in the dry year p 0 05 fig 4g while the other soil layers showed the opposite result drought may further decrease shallow soil water availability this result is similar to a previous study that indicated that the reduction in rainfall amount may increase rwu from deeper soil layers for mongolian pine zhou et al 2019 drought would also strengthen evapotranspiration by increasing vpd and a considerable swc limitation to rwu would develop schlaepfer et al 2017 song et al 2020 therefore the relationship between the proportion of rswc in the 0 20 cm soil layer and vpd was developed as follows rswc 0 41 vpd 1 03 r 0 74 p 0 01 rswc 0 28 vpd 0 79 r 0 38 p 0 05 and rswc 0 39 vpd 0 95 r 0 80 p 0 01 for the wet dry and ordinary years respectively these results indicated that drought lowers the soil moisture of shallow layers by increasing vpd and in turn wheat tends to absorb middle soil water 4 3 implications this study quantified the contributions of various water sources to wheat rwu under different precipitation years based on stable isotope technology in this study winter wheat mainly acquired water from the 0 60 cm soil layer throughout all growth stages in the three different precipitation years although there were significant differences in the proportions of rwu from the 0 60 cm soil layer among different rainfall years the proportions varied in a smaller range and the real values were 75 3 67 5 and 69 5 in the wet dry and ordinary years respectively this result provides new insights into the agricultural water management of winter wheat under different rainfall years the suitable irrigation wetting depth should match the main depth of rwu yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 which ensures that as much irrigation water as possible may be stored in the main rwu zone therefore it is reasonable to suggest that the 0 60 cm soil layer is the appropriate irrigation wetting depth for all precipitation years in winter wheat production in the ncp 5 conclusion in this study the wheat rwu pattern was identified via stable isotope δd and δ18o techniques in three experimental years with different precipitation patterns in the north china plain most soil water isotope values are below the lmwl the slope values of swel are lower and given as 6 63 4 77 and 6 18 in the wet year dry year and ordinary year respectively in addition the lc excess of the 0 100 cm soil layer in the dry year was significantly lower than that in the ordinary and wet years which indicated that more substantial soil evaporation enrichment occurred in the dry year the mixsiar model revealed that wheat under the different precipitation years mainly utilized soil water from the 0 60 cm layer throughout all growth stages there were significant differences in the proportion of rwu from the 0 60 cm soil layer under different rainfall years but the values of the proportions in the three years varied in a small range with 75 3 67 5 and 69 5 in a wet year dry year and ordinary year respectively therefore the appropriate irrigation wetting depth may be suggested as 60 cm for all precipitation years for winter wheat production in the ncp author contributions yang gao and aiwang duan planned and designed the

2229,several studies have looked at the evolution of droughts in a changing climate in various locations and have typically found that droughts are expected to become more severe in the future however relatively little work has been done on extreme droughts this study focuses on the evolution of extreme meteorological droughts over near 2036 2065 and far 2071 2100 future time periods monthly precipitation from two large multi member climate model ensembles the canadian earth system model canesm2 50 member ensemble and the community earth system model cesm1 40 member ensemble was used to calculate the standard precipitation index spi to quantify and explore the evolution of future meteorological droughts the use of these large ensembles allows for the calculation of the 20 and 100 year droughts return period and offers a unique perspective into those rare events both climate models project increases in extreme meteorological drought frequency over many of the world s regions the spatial patterns of regions with worsening droughts generally match those of projected change in mean annual precipitation although the former is more extensive indicating that changes in internal variability will increase drought frequency even in some regions projected to see increased mean annual precipitation the projected increase in meteorological drought frequency is more significant for short term jja droughts and for the larger return periods large increases in frequency are observed in many regions all the way up to 20 times for the historical100 year jja drought indicating a return period shift from 100 to 5 year considering the significant predicted increases in temperature it follows that future changes for both agricultural soil water deficit and hydrological droughts low stream levels which result from the interaction between precipitation deficit and temperature as well as other variables will be even more severe keywords climate change extreme meteorological droughts standardize precipitation index large ensemble data availability the data is available online and could be downloaded 1 introduction it is now widely accepted and recognized that climate change will have significant impacts on the hydrologic cycle arnell and gosling 2016 feng et al 2019 hegerl et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 trenberth et al 2014 climate change will affect the distribution and frequency of precipitation events mauger et al 2015 at one end of the spectrum changes in extreme precipitation frequency are expected to result in ever increasing damage to infrastructures and to affect populations in most parts of the world mailhot and duchesne 2009 rosenberg et al 2010 wilhelmi and morss 2013 however at the other end of the spectrum lack of precipitation is also a critical issue in many regions of the world droughts are recurring extreme events which can last from a few days to a few years and arguably constitute the most severe natural disaster due to their pronounced societal and economic impacts especially in semi arid and arid areas droughts and heat waves can significantly reduce food production lesk et al 2016 li et al 2015 the california drought in 2015 which was the fourth consecutive year with below average precipitation and runoff had a 2 7 billion total economic impact and affected 21 000 jobs in the state howitt et al 2015 mann and gleick 2015 forest fires linked to exceptionally dry winter droughts completely destroyed the town of fort mcmurray in may 2016 causing damages nearing 5 billion mcdonald 2016 droughts result from a combination of below normal precipitation higher than normal temperature low relative humidity and diminished cloud cover dai 2011 they can be characterized by intensity duration and probability of occurrence droughts are typically classified into four main classes meteorological droughts hydrological droughts agricultural droughts and socio economic droughts dracup et al 1980 wilhite and glantz 1985 meteorological droughts are related to the disruption of the precipitation pattern over a given time period since all droughts ultimately result from precipitation deficiencies monthly precipitation data has been commonly used to analyze droughts dai 2011 marengo et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2010 meteorological droughts impact industrial and domestic water supply as well as agricultural production agricultural droughts are related to low soil moisture conditions that cannot meet the water demand for crop growth during the growing season low soil moisture content restricts crop growth decreases yields and may eventually lead to total crop failure several drought indices combining temperature precipitation and soil moisture have been widely applied to study agricultural droughts mishra and singh 2010 hydrological droughts result from river streamflows being insufficient to support a water resource management system over a given period dai 2011 therefore these droughts are always analyzed by using streamflow data or water levels roudier et al 2016 zelenhasić and salvai 2010 although hydrological droughts are always related to meteorological droughts there can be significant differences in their magnitude and duration and the former may persist well past the end of the latter depending on the watershed size usage and non linear impacts between precipitation and other meteorological variables such as temperature heim 2002 socio economic droughts are different from the other three types of droughts their occurrence is related to the imbalance between the supply and demand of economic goods associated with the weather related water supply shortage kiem et al 2016 this work focuses exclusively on meteorological droughts because they are the primary driver of subsequent formation and propagation across different droughts types potop 2011 droughts can have major socio economic impacts and protection from them is complex and has typically required substantial structural adaptation measures in this context a better understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on drought severity is essential to any drought mitigation strategy a few studies have shown an increasing drought risk over the 21st century burke and brown 2008 cook et al 2015 dai 2011 sheffield and wood 2008 most of these studies concluded that more regions would experience more severe and long duration droughts especially in the summer with temperature increases predicted by all climate projections water demand is expected to exceed water supply in many regions of the world and to lead to more severe water deficit and droughts sushama et al 2010 studied dry spell characteristics across canada over three time periods 1971 2000 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 using a regional climate model and showed an increase in the mean number of dry days in southern regions of canada and a decrease in the mean number of dry days for the rest of canada dai 2011 assessed changes in droughts by calculating the palmer drought severity index pdsi using the cmip3 meehl et al 2007 multi model ensemble mean monthly climate data and found that severe droughts would likely occur in the latter half of this century over most continents this assessment was confirmed for the united states by cook et al 2015 marcos garcia et al 2017 applied a combination of relative standard drought indices to a mediterranean basin and the results showed that the intensity and magnitude of future meteorological and hydrological droughts would mostly see an increasing trend under a changed climate ukkola et al 2020 applied coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 projections to explore the future changes in meteorological droughts and found over the 45 of land areas would see change patterns under two emission scenarios to 2100 both precipitation mean and variability would introduce the changes in drought duration and frequency even under the lower emission scenario the model ensemble predicts robust drying across many regions companied with increases in frequency duration and spatial extent by the end of the 21st century cook et al 2020 wang et al 2021 however as is the case for most types of extreme events the consequences of such events do not scale linearly with their probability of occurrence in other words rare extreme events defined here as having a return period t 20 years cause a disproportionate amount of damage despite their low probability of occurrence there are several reasons for this the most important likely being that adaptation measures that have been put in place to deal with the more frequent extreme events are not sufficient to deal with the rare ones most of the previous work on droughts in a changing climate has focused on those frequent droughts and comparatively little has been done on changes in rare and very large droughts this work therefore focuses specifically on extreme meteorological droughts t 20 years and contrast future frequency changes in extreme droughts against those in average droughts the rest of this paper is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 describes the different datasets and the methodology used in this study results are shown in section 4 a discussion and a conclusion follow in section 5 2 data monthly precipitation data from two earth system model esm large ensembles were selected to analyze extreme meteorological droughts over the historical 1981 2010 near 2036 2065 and far 2071 2100 future periods the canadian earth system model canesm2 large ensemble spatial resolution of 2 8 2 8 covers the 1950 2100 period to produce the 50 member ensemble 5 simulations of the ocean state were performed over 1850 to 1950 from which 10 runs with small random atmospheric perturbations were initialized over the remaining 1950 2100 period from 2006 on the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 was used as the forcing scenario arora et al 2011 sigmond and fyfe 2016 von salzen et al 2013 this large ensemble results in 1500 equivalent years 30 years 50 members for each period considered the community earth system model cesm1 is a coupled climate model for simulating earth s climate system spatial resolution of 1 1 which covers the 1920 2100 period the cesm1 large ensemble has 40 members each obtained from random atmospheric perturbations kay et al 2015 this results in 1200 equivalent years for each considered period 30 years 40 members at the time of writing of this paper these were the only 2 global large ensembles readily available to the scientific community since this is a study solely based on climate models some level of validation against observation is therefore necessary although many climate change studies are only concerned with climate model data it is nonetheless always preferable to validate some climate characteristics relevant to a specific study this is especially the case when a small number of climate models are used as is the case in the present study to this end the global precipitation climatology center gpcc full data monthly product version 2018 was used as a reference dataset schneider 2018 this dataset covers the period 1901 2015 over land areas with a 0 5 resolution the annual and seasonal mean precipitations and their standard deviations were calculated over the reference period to be compared against outputs from both ensembles 3 methods there are several potential indices that can be used to quantify droughts dai 2011 in this study on extreme meteorological droughts the standardized precipitation index spi was chosen because of its simplicity and widespread use it is also recommended by wmo as the main meteorological drought index the spi is a dimensionless indicator which represents the precipitation deficit or excess relative to a long term mean at a given location and time scale mckee et al 1993 1995 the spi is normalized by its mean and standard deviation typically after fitting a 2 parameter gamma distribution to monthly precipitation values followed by a transformation to a gaussian distribution guttman 1999 positive spi values indicate precipitation above average while negative values are representative of a rainfall deficit over a given time duration the spi has been widely used over different time periods typically for durations varying between 1 and 24 months hayes et al 2011 mo 2008 short term spi values 1 to 3 months are often thought to be related to soil moisture deficit while longer time scales greater than1 year multi year droughts are related to groundwater and reservoir storage svoboda et al 2012 wu 2013 in this study spi values were calculated every month for both one spi 1 representing short term droughts and 24 months spi 24 representing multi year droughts in temperate climates the most intense streamflow droughts typically last only a few weeks the one month duration was found to be a good compromise for the study of short term droughts monthly spi 24 values represent the water deficit or surplus over the previous 24 months both indices were calculated over the reference and future periods the study looked at both the annual and seasonal scales at the annual scale the smallest value of spi 1 and spi 24 out of 12 monthly values was selected for the extreme value analysis irrespective of the month associated with its occurrence for seasonal june july august jja and december january february djf droughts the lowest spi 1 value associated with these months was chosen in hydrological terminology a return period refers to a recurrence interval of some specified hydrological events and is usually used to express the frequency of an extreme event sharma and panu 2015 sigdel and ikeda 2010 for both ensembles the very large number of available equivalent years allows the calculation of large return period events without having to resort to the generalized theory of extreme values different probability density distributions pdf have differences mainly at the tail level because a large ensemble provides a large enough sample size the empirical distribution can be calculated directly rather than fitting an appropriate theoretical distribution as is typically done in the analysis of extreme events to extrapolate toward larger quantiles since both ensembles provide respectively 1500 and 1200 years for each 30 year period the estimation of the 100 year return period can reliably be estimated from the empirical distribution this paper will look at droughts with a 2 20 and 100 year return period the 2 year drought represents a typical drought that should be exceeded every other year on average referred to as a moderate drought while the 20 and 100 year droughts represent extreme droughts that are only to be exceeded every 20 and 100 years on average respectively referred to as severe and extremely severe drought the empirical return period t of future spi values was calculated based on the cunnane s formula t n 0 2 m 0 4 in which n is the total number of years and m is the rank the mth smallest value cunnane 1978 considering the large sample size the use of other estimators would have essentially yielded the same result since different plotting formulas give very similar results except at the very end of the distribution rakhecha and singh 2009 to sum up for both ensembles the 2 20 and 100 year meteorological droughts were characterized by their 1 and 24 month spi values at both the annual and seasonal djf and jja scales in order to better display changes at the regional scale all land areas with the exception of antarctica were divided into the 21 regions of giorgi and francisco 2000 both canesm2 and cesm1 outputs were interpolated to the 0 5 gpcc grid resolution prior to computing the differences between metrics table 1 and fig 1 present details of each of the 21 individual regions 4 results 4 1 climate model validation fig 2 presents maps of mean annual and seasonal djf and jja precipitation for the 1981 2010 reference period for both ensembles and for the gpcc dataset the ensemble mean mean of all members for each ensemble is used to represent both ensembles the spatial distribution of precipitation is very well represented by both climate models at both the annual and seasonal scales since droughts originate from temporal variability in precipitation fields there is also a need to validate some measure of variability in the models to this end the inter annual standard deviation of total annual and seasonal precipitation is presented in fig 3 for climate models it was calculated for each member and each grid point and the median value was plotted once again the global spatial patterns are very similar indicating that both climate models do a reasonably good job at representing the inter annual variability of precipitation to further evaluate the models performance in simulating the precipitation differences between the models and observation in annual precipitation are shown in fig 4 also the ratio of standard deviation figures showing the differences and ratios for jja and djf could be found in the supplementary material figure s1 and s2 as shown in fig 4 both models show underestimations of annual precipitation amount in eastern north america ena amazon basin amz central north america cna and western north asia nas while overestimations in alaska ala western north america wna sahara sah eastern africa eaf southern africa saf east asia eas and eastern nas there are also some disagreements between the models take northern australia aus as an example cesm1 overestimates the mean annual precipitation while canesm2 is much drier than observations in the reference period generally cesm1 simulates a wetter world over the reference period overall the variability tends to be larger in climate models in most parts of the world with the exception of southeast north america and most parts of south america the largest ratios of standard deviation are found in sah in both models in all cases discussed above model performance is better in djf when variability is lower furthermore projected changes in annual mean temperature and precipitation for the ensemble means from two large ensembles compared to a broader selection of gcms 33 in total in the cmip5 project were presented in the supplementary material figure s3 inter model differences are much smaller for temperature than those for precipitation precipitation outputs from the two climate models fall into the center of the simulation envelope fig 5 presents the relative change of the mean annual precipitation for the two large ensembles for the far future period relative to the reference period both models predict an increasing future annual precipitation over most of the land areas except the south america and the western coast of africa in the northern hemisphere canesm2 simulates a wetter future compared to cesm1 while verse versa in the southern hemisphere different from precipitation there is smaller inter model variability between the two ensembles in annual mean temperature simulation the models project an increasing temperature in the future especially for the high latitude figure s4 in the following section figs 6 to 9 present results for short term meteorological droughts with accompanying tables 2 3 and 4 section 4 3 presents results for long term droughts within figs 10 and 11 and table 4 change patterns are very similar for both horizons and return periods and are essentially more pronounced for the latter accordingly only results of historical 100 year droughts from the far future are shown in the main body of the paper the 2 year drought patterns are also shown to present the difference between the frequent and extreme droughts results for the near future period and 20 year drought are presented in the supplementary material 4 2 short term droughts fig 6 presents future return periods for the historical 2 and 100 year droughts for both ensembles in the far future period results for the near future are shown in figure s5 these figures do not display absolute values of drought severity but rather show changes in the frequency of occurrence as done by martel et al 2018 for example for the historical 20 year drought a future value of 10 years indicates a doubling in frequency and a value of 5 years means a fourfold increase in frequency warm colors indicate an increase in frequency whereas cold colors show a decrease results from both climate ensembles display similar spatial patterns for all three return periods increases in drought frequency are particularly noticeable for the southern hemisphere especially for the canesm2 model patterns are similar but changes in drought frequency become more severe for larger return periods moderate meteorological droughts become less severe for all of the northern hemisphere with the exception of the mediterranean basin whereas this pattern progressively reverses over some northern regions for larger return period droughts cesm1 generally predicts a larger increase of extreme droughts as compared to canesm2 this is especially clear for north america asia and australia despite the general agreement between both climate models there are some regional differences in order to better summarize these differences fig 7 presents boxplots of drought frequency of historical short term extremely severe drought at the annual scale for each region of fig 6 the corresponding figure for the histrocial severe drought is shown in figure s6 each boxplot is comprised of all grid points within each region the boxplots show the median and interquartile range centered box while the lower and upper whiskers respectively display the grid point with the most and least dramatic change in drought frequency quantiles below the horizontal line 100 year indicate a worsening in the recurrence of historical extremely severe droughts decreasing return period increasing drought frequency whereas quantiles above the horizontal line indicate increasing return periods results show that cesm1 consistently predicts larger drought frequency increases as compared to canesm2 with the exception of south america sa and west africa waf the regions of south america sa oceania oc and the mediterranean basin med show the clearest signature of worsening extreme droughts for most of the grid points and for both models asia as north america na and northern europe neu are the regions least affected by a worsening of extreme meteorological droughts although there is significant variability within sub regions in na and as the main similarities and differences between both climate models are summarized in table 2 regions in which more than 55 grid points experience increasing decreasing drought frequency are labeled with an increasing decreasing trend the 55 value was semi quantitatively chosen as the best threshold to contrast regional behaviors the probability of having more than 55 of positive trends in a random sample is less than 5 for a region containing 300 grid points two climate ensembles project opposite trends for only 4 out of 21 regions there are 4 regions in which one model predicts no change and 13 regions where both models project trends in the same direction regions with increasing extreme meteorological drought frequency are mostly found in south america sa and oceania oc as well as africa af while most decreasing trends are found in asia as and north america na there are eight regions out of 21 where both models disagree on trend directions including three in na in all eight cases there is a lot of in region variability and overlap between boxplots from both climate models fig 8 shows the return periods of historical short term moderate and extremely severe droughts in jja for the far future period for both ensembles figure s7 presents results for the near future period once again the change pattern is similar for both climate models compared to the annual scale the patterns are more severe for all regions and particularly so for the northern hemisphere cesm1 predicts more significant changes in extreme meteorological droughts as compared to canesm2 east asia eas tibet tib alaska ala and southern us are the only regions with a projected decrease in extreme meteorological droughts the spatial patterns are similar for all return periods but the amplitude of changes gets larger for the larger return period fig 9 displays regional changes for the far future jja extremely severe droughts results are similar for the 20 year return period presented in figure s8 the regional changes are extremely similar to those presented in fig 7 with the difference being that jja increases in drought frequencies are consistently more severe than at the annual scale this is particularly striking for the europe domain where increases in historical 100 year drought frequency are now observed over almost all grid points as shown in table 3 two climate models predict opposite trends for only 2 out of 21 regions there is a trend agreement for 12 regions and there are 7 regions where no change is predicted in one climate model more regions would be hit by increasing extremely severe droughts as compared to moderate and severe droughts with the exception of alaska ala eastern asia eas and tibet tib most regions with a decreasing frequency trend are in asia in line with results at the annual scale once again cesm1 predicts larger frequency increases than canesm2 for most regions changes in drought frequency for djf are presented in figures s9 to s12 and table s2 patterns are similar between both climate models and frequency changes are noticeably smaller than for jja even for the southern hemisphere table 4 presents a summary of the regions most affected by a frequency increase in extreme meteorological droughts at the yearly and seasonal jja djf scales these regions are listed under two categories highest percentage of grid points experiencing frequency increases and highest mean magnitude of grid points with increasing extreme drought frequency at the regional scale results show that four regions are particularly affected by increases in extreme meteorological droughts they are all mid latitude regions located either in south america or around the mediterranean sea the largest frequency increases are found in the amazon basin amz with a mean frequency increase of 19 72 canesm2 and 9 32 cesm1 for extremely severe droughts in future jja these respectively correspond to future return periods of roughly 5 and 11 years for the current 100 year droughts 4 3 long term droughts long term droughts are shown in this work by the 24 month spi index as a representation of multi year droughts fig 10 presents future return periods of historical long term droughts for both climate model ensembles the affected regions are once again consistent across both ensembles a much smaller percentage of land areas is affected by a worsening of long term droughts as compared to short term droughts the main affected regions are the mediterranean basin med with cesm1 predicting the worst outcome south america sa southern africa saf and south australia for the latter canesm2 predicts the worst future extreme droughts conditions north america na with the exception of southwestern usa and most of asia are predicted to see a decrease in the frequency of long term meteorological droughts the above results are well emphasized in the regional plots presented in fig 11 the agreement between both climate models is also quite clear from this figure 5 discussion and conclusion 5 1 discussion the results presented in this paper indicate a worsening of extreme meteorological droughts in many regions of the world and particularly so for seasonal short term droughts these results are based on two large climate model ensembles the use of two large ensembles provides the important advantage of allowing a study extreme events with little uncertainty the disadvantage of using large ensembles is that such use does not allow a proper sampling of gcm esm uncertainty as would be the case in a multi model ensemble such as cmip5 it is therefore important to frame our results in comparison to others even though little previous work has been dedicated to extreme droughts similar to ours in sheffield and wood s work 2008 soil moisture data from 8 gcms from ipcc ar4 forced by sres a2 a1b and b1 scenarios was used to study global drought occurrence under future warming 2070 2099 in their study droughts were defined as the sequence of consecutive months with soil moisture quantiles lower than a threshold corresponding to a 10 year return period in the historical period 1961 1990 results showed that the mediterranean west african central asia and central american regions showed large increases in drought frequency and particularly for long term droughts more than 12 month duration a doubling in the frequency of short term droughts 4 6 months duration was observed as compared to the mid twentieth century under the future projections these results are mostly in line with the results of this study with the exception of western africa waf in the future roughly 70 of grid points would experience a worsening of long term droughts only in canesm2 at the annual scale overall sheffield and wood s 2008 future drought conditions were worse than in the current study because they considered agricultural droughts a point that will be discussed later the results presented in this paper are also mostly consistent with those of dai 2011 also some recent work conducted in the cmip6 cook et al 2020 ukkola et al 2020 wang et al 2021 northern mid high latitudes and some hot spot regions such as amz and med are projected to be with robust future changes in droughts in cmip 6 agree with this study the pattern of drought frequency changes is similar between cmip6 and cmip5 but changes in cmip6 are stronger wang et al 2021 indicating that the presented results are largely hold with cmip6 but larger change magnitude in cmip6 the general distribution of areas affected by increasing drought frequency is also in line with areas where mean annual precipitation is expected to decrease and particularly in tropical and subtropical zones ipcc 2013 to further this point the jja relationship between the frequency change of extreme droughts and mean total precipitation was also explored unsurprisingly there is a good spatial correlation between future mean jja changes and increases in future drought frequency the projected change for jja total precipitation for both models is shown in figure s15 areas affected by an increase in meteorological droughts are however larger than those affected by decreases in mean jja precipitation indicating that many regions where mean jja precipitation is expected to increase will nonetheless see worsening drought conditions for example this is especially clear for northern russia in canesm2 and in many regions of south america in cesm1 there is also a clear link with drought return periods with more extreme droughts more likely to increase in regions with increasing mean jja precipitation than for more common droughts this observed tendency in drought frequency to increase in regions getting wetter can only be explained by changes in temporal precipitation variability overall results obtained from both climate ensembles are fairly consistent with only some regional differences in all cases the observed differences correspond to regions already identified by the ipcc as having low inter model agreement these regions are typically characterized by high internal variability compared to the expected climate change signal better agreement was found at the seasonal scale for short term extreme droughts and especially in future djf in which inter annual variability is lower this is also likely the reason why jja extreme droughts will see a greater frequency increase than will djf as with any studies dealing with climate change in future horizons this work is impacted by many sources of uncertainty the work focused on meteorological droughts using a single index and with only two climate models under the pessimistic rcp 8 5 scenario the choice of models and scenario was imposed by the main objective of focusing on extreme droughts the focus on large ensembles was dictated by the need to reduce statistical uncertainty for large return period droughts and this led to the use of the only two global large ensembles available canesm2 and cesm1 large ensembles are expected to become more common in the future and this will help better frame extreme drought related inter model uncertainty such ensembles are now available at the regional scale leduc et al 2019 the use of different drought indices has been shown to potentially have an influence on the magnitude and sign of the change of drought burke and brown 2008 the spi index was chosen especially because of its simplicity its widespread use however the use of this index will likely result in an underestimation of the severity of future droughts under climate change because it ignores the role of temperature a critical contributor marcos garcia et al 2017 this study only looked at meteorological droughts since precipitation deficit is the main driver of all other types of droughts clearly agricultural and hydrological droughts are also affected by other climate variables such as wind humidity and temperature which control evapotranspiration and may worsen the impact of meteorological droughts global surface temperatures have been steadily on the rise over the past decades and the observed changes have already been larger than internal variability for most of the world s regions and sharp increases are expected everywhere especially at high latitudes by the end of the century fischer and knutti 2015 while this study did not look at agricultural and hydrological droughts it can be inferred with good confidence that results presented in this paper for meteorological droughts however dire they are for many regions of the world will pale in comparison to the combined impact of higher temperatures with the increasing frequency of extreme precipitation deficit further studies should focus on a better understanding of these combined effects and the interplay between anthropogenic forcing and the climate s internal variability studies on hydrological and agricultural droughts could easily be carried out using the methodological approach presented in this paper however runoff and soil moisture outputs from climate models should be treated with caution because there is lack of suitable observation to verify burke and brown 2008 alternatively extreme droughts were assessed by minimum spi in this work this choice was made to focus on the magnitude without considering the intensity sum of the spi values ultimately developing a better ability to forecast droughts will become critical to the development of adaptation strategies to cope with the increased frequency and severity of droughts 5 2 conclusions this study has explored the evolution of the frequency of future extreme meteorological droughts at the global scale using precipitation outputs from two large climate ensembles cesm1 and canesm2 under the rcp 8 5 emission scenario the major findings are summarized as follows both ensembles do a good job at replicating spatial patterns and the magnitude of annual total precipitation and interannual variability over the reference period 1981 2010 this provides confidence in each model s ability to adequately represent short term 1 month and long term 24 month drought frequency projected increases in future extreme meteorological drought frequency are mostly consistent across both climate ensembles although there are many regional differences mostly in regions that have already been labeled as having high internal variability by the ipcc the projected increases in meteorological drought frequency are much more severe for short term droughts than for long term droughts the patterns of increasing extreme meteorological drought frequency are consistent with those of future changes in mean annual precipitation indicating that regions with decreasing precipitation are unsurprisingly more at risk however the extent of the drought frequency increase patterns is larger than those for mean annual precipitation indicating a worsening of extreme droughts in some regions projected to see an increase in mean annual precipitation the total area affected by a worsening of droughts gets larger with the drought return periods in other words the frequency increase of the historical 100 year drought is more significant than for the 20 year drought for the most vulnerable region the jja short term drought frequency could increase by up to 20 times for the 100 year drought and by 9 times for the 20 year drought this means that the future return periods of the current 20 and 100 year droughts would become 2 and 5 years in the future for the most affected region credit authorship contribution statement

2229,several studies have looked at the evolution of droughts in a changing climate in various locations and have typically found that droughts are expected to become more severe in the future however relatively little work has been done on extreme droughts this study focuses on the evolution of extreme meteorological droughts over near 2036 2065 and far 2071 2100 future time periods monthly precipitation from two large multi member climate model ensembles the canadian earth system model canesm2 50 member ensemble and the community earth system model cesm1 40 member ensemble was used to calculate the standard precipitation index spi to quantify and explore the evolution of future meteorological droughts the use of these large ensembles allows for the calculation of the 20 and 100 year droughts return period and offers a unique perspective into those rare events both climate models project increases in extreme meteorological drought frequency over many of the world s regions the spatial patterns of regions with worsening droughts generally match those of projected change in mean annual precipitation although the former is more extensive indicating that changes in internal variability will increase drought frequency even in some regions projected to see increased mean annual precipitation the projected increase in meteorological drought frequency is more significant for short term jja droughts and for the larger return periods large increases in frequency are observed in many regions all the way up to 20 times for the historical100 year jja drought indicating a return period shift from 100 to 5 year considering the significant predicted increases in temperature it follows that future changes for both agricultural soil water deficit and hydrological droughts low stream levels which result from the interaction between precipitation deficit and temperature as well as other variables will be even more severe keywords climate change extreme meteorological droughts standardize precipitation index large ensemble data availability the data is available online and could be downloaded 1 introduction it is now widely accepted and recognized that climate change will have significant impacts on the hydrologic cycle arnell and gosling 2016 feng et al 2019 hegerl et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 trenberth et al 2014 climate change will affect the distribution and frequency of precipitation events mauger et al 2015 at one end of the spectrum changes in extreme precipitation frequency are expected to result in ever increasing damage to infrastructures and to affect populations in most parts of the world mailhot and duchesne 2009 rosenberg et al 2010 wilhelmi and morss 2013 however at the other end of the spectrum lack of precipitation is also a critical issue in many regions of the world droughts are recurring extreme events which can last from a few days to a few years and arguably constitute the most severe natural disaster due to their pronounced societal and economic impacts especially in semi arid and arid areas droughts and heat waves can significantly reduce food production lesk et al 2016 li et al 2015 the california drought in 2015 which was the fourth consecutive year with below average precipitation and runoff had a 2 7 billion total economic impact and affected 21 000 jobs in the state howitt et al 2015 mann and gleick 2015 forest fires linked to exceptionally dry winter droughts completely destroyed the town of fort mcmurray in may 2016 causing damages nearing 5 billion mcdonald 2016 droughts result from a combination of below normal precipitation higher than normal temperature low relative humidity and diminished cloud cover dai 2011 they can be characterized by intensity duration and probability of occurrence droughts are typically classified into four main classes meteorological droughts hydrological droughts agricultural droughts and socio economic droughts dracup et al 1980 wilhite and glantz 1985 meteorological droughts are related to the disruption of the precipitation pattern over a given time period since all droughts ultimately result from precipitation deficiencies monthly precipitation data has been commonly used to analyze droughts dai 2011 marengo et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2010 meteorological droughts impact industrial and domestic water supply as well as agricultural production agricultural droughts are related to low soil moisture conditions that cannot meet the water demand for crop growth during the growing season low soil moisture content restricts crop growth decreases yields and may eventually lead to total crop failure several drought indices combining temperature precipitation and soil moisture have been widely applied to study agricultural droughts mishra and singh 2010 hydrological droughts result from river streamflows being insufficient to support a water resource management system over a given period dai 2011 therefore these droughts are always analyzed by using streamflow data or water levels roudier et al 2016 zelenhasić and salvai 2010 although hydrological droughts are always related to meteorological droughts there can be significant differences in their magnitude and duration and the former may persist well past the end of the latter depending on the watershed size usage and non linear impacts between precipitation and other meteorological variables such as temperature heim 2002 socio economic droughts are different from the other three types of droughts their occurrence is related to the imbalance between the supply and demand of economic goods associated with the weather related water supply shortage kiem et al 2016 this work focuses exclusively on meteorological droughts because they are the primary driver of subsequent formation and propagation across different droughts types potop 2011 droughts can have major socio economic impacts and protection from them is complex and has typically required substantial structural adaptation measures in this context a better understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on drought severity is essential to any drought mitigation strategy a few studies have shown an increasing drought risk over the 21st century burke and brown 2008 cook et al 2015 dai 2011 sheffield and wood 2008 most of these studies concluded that more regions would experience more severe and long duration droughts especially in the summer with temperature increases predicted by all climate projections water demand is expected to exceed water supply in many regions of the world and to lead to more severe water deficit and droughts sushama et al 2010 studied dry spell characteristics across canada over three time periods 1971 2000 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 using a regional climate model and showed an increase in the mean number of dry days in southern regions of canada and a decrease in the mean number of dry days for the rest of canada dai 2011 assessed changes in droughts by calculating the palmer drought severity index pdsi using the cmip3 meehl et al 2007 multi model ensemble mean monthly climate data and found that severe droughts would likely occur in the latter half of this century over most continents this assessment was confirmed for the united states by cook et al 2015 marcos garcia et al 2017 applied a combination of relative standard drought indices to a mediterranean basin and the results showed that the intensity and magnitude of future meteorological and hydrological droughts would mostly see an increasing trend under a changed climate ukkola et al 2020 applied coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 projections to explore the future changes in meteorological droughts and found over the 45 of land areas would see change patterns under two emission scenarios to 2100 both precipitation mean and variability would introduce the changes in drought duration and frequency even under the lower emission scenario the model ensemble predicts robust drying across many regions companied with increases in frequency duration and spatial extent by the end of the 21st century cook et al 2020 wang et al 2021 however as is the case for most types of extreme events the consequences of such events do not scale linearly with their probability of occurrence in other words rare extreme events defined here as having a return period t 20 years cause a disproportionate amount of damage despite their low probability of occurrence there are several reasons for this the most important likely being that adaptation measures that have been put in place to deal with the more frequent extreme events are not sufficient to deal with the rare ones most of the previous work on droughts in a changing climate has focused on those frequent droughts and comparatively little has been done on changes in rare and very large droughts this work therefore focuses specifically on extreme meteorological droughts t 20 years and contrast future frequency changes in extreme droughts against those in average droughts the rest of this paper is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 describes the different datasets and the methodology used in this study results are shown in section 4 a discussion and a conclusion follow in section 5 2 data monthly precipitation data from two earth system model esm large

et al 2015 this results in 1200 equivalent years for each considered period 30 years 40 members at the time of writing of this paper these were the only 2 global large ensembles readily available to the scientific community since this is a study solely based on climate models some level of validation against observation is therefore necessary although many climate change studies are only concerned with climate model data it is nonetheless always preferable to validate some climate characteristics relevant to a specific study this is especially the case when a small number of climate models are used as is the case in the present study to this end the global precipitation climatology center gpcc full data monthly product version 2018 was used as a reference dataset schneider 2018 this dataset covers the period 1901 2015 over land areas with a 0 5 resolution the annual and seasonal mean precipitations and their standard deviations were calculated over the reference period to be compared against outputs from both ensembles 3 methods there are several potential indices that can be used to quantify droughts dai 2011 in this study on extreme meteorological droughts the standardized precipitation index spi was chosen because of its simplicity and widespread use it is also recommended by wmo as the main meteorological drought index the spi is a dimensionless indicator which represents the precipitation deficit or excess relative to a long term mean at a given location and time scale mckee et al 1993 1995 the spi is normalized by its mean and standard deviation typically after fitting a 2 parameter gamma distribution to monthly precipitation values followed by a transformation to a gaussian distribution guttman 1999 positive spi values indicate precipitation above average while negative values are representative of a rainfall deficit over a given time duration the spi has been widely used over different time periods typically for durations varying between 1 and 24 months hayes et al 2011 mo 2008 short term spi values 1 to 3 months are often thought to be related to soil moisture deficit while longer time scales greater than1 year multi year droughts are related to groundwater and reservoir storage svoboda et al 2012 wu 2013 in this study spi values were calculated every month for both one spi 1 representing short term droughts and 24 months spi 24 representing multi year droughts in temperate climates the most intense streamflow droughts typically last only a few weeks the one month duration was found to be a good compromise for the study of short term droughts monthly spi 24 values represent the water deficit or surplus over the previous 24 months both indices were calculated over the reference and future periods the study looked at both the annual and seasonal scales at the annual scale the smallest value of spi 1 and spi 24 out of 12 monthly values was selected for the extreme value analysis irrespective of the month associated with its occurrence for seasonal june july august jja and december january february djf droughts the lowest spi 1 value associated with these months was chosen in hydrological terminology a return period refers to a recurrence interval of some specified hydrological events and is usually used to express the frequency of an extreme event sharma and panu 2015 sigdel and ikeda 2010 for both ensembles the very large number of available equivalent years allows the calculation of large return period events without having to resort to the generalized theory of extreme values different probability density distributions pdf have differences mainly at the tail level because a large ensemble provides a large enough sample size the empirical distribution can be calculated directly rather than fitting an appropriate theoretical distribution as is typically done in the analysis of extreme events to extrapolate toward larger quantiles since both ensembles provide respectively 1500 and 1200 years for each 30 year period the estimation of the 100 year return period can reliably be estimated from the empirical distribution this paper will look at droughts with a 2 20 and 100 year return period the 2 year drought represents a typical drought that should be exceeded every other year on average referred to as a moderate drought while the 20 and 100 year droughts represent extreme droughts that are only to be exceeded every 20 and 100 years on average respectively referred to as severe and extremely severe drought the empirical return period t of future spi values was calculated based on the cunnane s formula t n 0 2 m 0 4 in which n is the total number of years and m is the rank the mth smallest value cunnane 1978 considering the large sample size the use of other estimators would have essentially yielded the same result since different plotting formulas give very similar results except at the very end of the distribution rakhecha and singh 2009 to sum up for both ensembles the 2 20 and 100 year meteorological droughts were characterized by their 1 and 24 month spi values at both the annual and seasonal djf and jja scales in order to better display changes at the regional scale all land areas with the exception of antarctica were divided into the 21 regions of giorgi and francisco 2000 both canesm2 and cesm1 outputs were interpolated to the 0 5 gpcc grid resolution prior to computing the differences between metrics table 1 and fig 1 present details of each of the 21 individual regions 4 results 4 1 climate model validation fig 2 presents maps of mean annual and seasonal djf and jja precipitation for the 1981 2010 reference period for both ensembles and for the gpcc dataset the ensemble mean mean of all members for each ensemble is used to represent both ensembles the spatial distribution of precipitation is very well represented by both climate models at both the annual and seasonal scales since droughts originate from temporal variability in precipitation fields there is also a need to validate some measure of variability in the models to this end the inter annual standard deviation of total annual and seasonal precipitation is presented in fig 3 for climate models it was calculated for each member and each grid point and the median value was plotted once again the global spatial patterns are very similar indicating that both climate models do a reasonably good job at representing the inter annual variability of precipitation to further evaluate the models performance in simulating the precipitation differences between the models and observation in annual precipitation are shown in fig 4 also the ratio of standard deviation figures showing the differences and ratios for jja and djf could be found in the supplementary material figure s1 and s2 as shown in fig 4 both models show underestimations of annual precipitation amount in eastern north america ena amazon basin amz central north america cna and western north asia nas while overestimations in alaska ala western north america wna sahara sah eastern africa eaf southern africa saf east asia eas and eastern nas there are also some disagreements between the models take northern australia aus as an example cesm1 overestimates the mean annual precipitation while canesm2 is much drier than observations in the reference period generally cesm1 simulates a wetter world over the reference period overall the variability tends to be larger in climate models in most parts of the world with the exception of southeast north america and most parts of south america the largest ratios of standard deviation are found in sah in both models in all cases discussed above model performance is better in djf when variability is lower furthermore projected changes in annual mean temperature and precipitation for the ensemble means from two large ensembles compared to a broader selection of gcms 33 in total in the cmip5 project were presented in the supplementary material figure s3 inter model differences are much smaller for temperature than those for precipitation precipitation outputs from the two climate models fall into the center of the simulation envelope fig 5 presents the relative change of the mean annual precipitation for the two large ensembles for the far future period relative to the reference period both models predict an increasing future annual precipitation over most of the land areas except the south america and the western coast of africa in the northern hemisphere canesm2 simulates a wetter future compared to cesm1 while verse versa in the southern hemisphere different from precipitation there is smaller inter model variability between the two ensembles in annual mean temperature simulation the models project an increasing temperature in the future especially for the high latitude figure s4 in the following section figs 6 to 9 present results for short term meteorological droughts with accompanying tables 2 3 and 4 section 4 3 presents results for long term droughts within figs 10 and 11 and table 4 change patterns are very similar for both horizons and return periods and are essentially more pronounced for the latter accordingly only results of historical 100 year droughts from the far future are shown in the main body of the paper the 2 year drought patterns are also shown to present the difference between the frequent and extreme droughts results for the near future period and 20 year drought are presented in the supplementary material 4 2 short term droughts fig 6 presents future return periods for the historical 2 and 100 year droughts for both ensembles in the far future period results for the near future are shown in figure s5 these figures do not display absolute values of drought severity but rather show changes in the frequency of occurrence as done by martel et al 2018 for example for the historical 20 year drought a future value of 10 years indicates a doubling in frequency and a value of 5 years means a fourfold increase in frequency warm colors indicate an increase in frequency whereas cold colors show a decrease results from both climate ensembles display similar spatial patterns for all three return periods increases in drought frequency are particularly noticeable for the southern hemisphere especially for the canesm2 model patterns are similar but changes in drought frequency become more severe for larger return periods moderate meteorological droughts become less severe for all of the northern hemisphere with the exception of the mediterranean basin whereas this pattern progressively reverses over some northern regions for larger return period droughts cesm1 generally predicts a larger increase of extreme droughts as compared to canesm2 this is especially clear for north america asia and australia despite the general agreement between both climate models there are some regional differences in order to better summarize these differences fig 7 presents boxplots of drought frequency of historical short term extremely severe drought at the annual scale for each region of fig 6 the corresponding figure for the histrocial severe drought is shown in figure s6 each boxplot is comprised of all grid points within each region the boxplots show the median and interquartile range centered box while the lower and upper whiskers respectively display the grid point with the most and least dramatic change in drought frequency quantiles below the horizontal line 100 year indicate a worsening in the recurrence of historical extremely severe droughts decreasing return period increasing drought frequency whereas quantiles above the horizontal line indicate increasing return periods results show that cesm1 consistently predicts larger drought frequency increases as compared to canesm2 with the exception of south america sa and west africa waf the regions of south america sa oceania oc and the mediterranean basin med show the clearest signature of worsening extreme droughts for most of the grid points and for both models asia as north america na and northern europe neu are the regions least affected by a worsening of extreme meteorological droughts although there is significant variability within sub regions in na and as the main similarities and differences between both climate models are summarized in table 2 regions in which more than 55 grid points experience increasing decreasing drought frequency are labeled with an increasing decreasing trend the 55 value was semi quantitatively chosen as the best threshold to contrast regional behaviors the probability of having more than 55 of positive trends in a random sample is less than 5 for a region containing 300 grid points two climate ensembles project opposite trends for only 4 out of 21 regions there are 4 regions in which one model predicts no change and 13 regions where both models project trends in the same direction regions with increasing extreme meteorological drought frequency are mostly found in south america sa and oceania oc as well as africa af while most decreasing trends are found in asia as and north america na there are eight regions out of 21 where both models disagree on trend directions including three in na in all eight cases there is a lot of in region variability and overlap between boxplots from both climate models fig 8 shows the return periods of historical short term moderate and extremely severe droughts in jja for the far future period for both ensembles figure s7 presents results for the near future period once again the change pattern is similar for both climate models compared to the annual scale the patterns are more severe for all regions and particularly so for the northern hemisphere cesm1 predicts more significant changes in extreme meteorological droughts as compared to canesm2 east asia eas tibet tib alaska ala and southern us are the only regions with a projected decrease in extreme meteorological droughts the spatial patterns are similar for all return periods but the amplitude of changes gets larger for the larger return period fig 9 displays regional changes for the far future jja extremely severe droughts results are similar for the 20 year return period presented in figure s8 the regional changes are extremely similar to those presented in fig 7 with the difference being that jja increases in drought frequencies are consistently more severe than at the annual scale this is particularly striking for the europe domain where increases in historical 100 year drought frequency are now observed over almost all grid points as shown in table 3 two climate models predict opposite trends for only 2 out of 21 regions there is a trend agreement for 12 regions and there are 7 regions where no change is predicted in one climate model more regions would be hit by increasing extremely severe droughts as compared to moderate and severe droughts with the exception of alaska ala eastern asia eas and tibet tib most regions with a decreasing frequency trend are in asia in line with results at the annual scale once again cesm1 predicts larger frequency increases than canesm2 for most regions changes in drought frequency for djf are presented in figures s9 to s12 and table s2 patterns are similar between both climate models and frequency changes are noticeably smaller than for jja even for the southern hemisphere table 4 presents a summary of the regions most affected by a frequency increase in extreme meteorological droughts at the yearly and seasonal jja djf scales these regions are listed under two categories highest percentage of grid points experiencing frequency increases and highest mean magnitude of grid points with increasing extreme drought frequency at the regional scale results show that four regions are particularly affected by increases in extreme meteorological droughts they are all mid latitude regions located either in south america or around the mediterranean sea the largest frequency increases are found in the amazon basin amz with a mean frequency increase of 19 72 canesm2 and 9 32 cesm1 for extremely severe droughts in future jja these respectively correspond to future return periods of roughly 5 and 11 years for the current 100 year droughts 4 3 long term droughts long term droughts are shown in this work by the 24 month spi index as a representation of multi year droughts fig 10 presents future return periods of historical long term droughts for both climate model ensembles the affected regions are once again consistent across both ensembles a much smaller percentage of land areas is affected by a worsening of long term droughts as compared to short term droughts the main affected regions are the mediterranean basin med with cesm1 predicting the worst outcome south america sa southern africa saf and south australia for the latter canesm2 predicts the worst future extreme droughts conditions north america na with the exception of southwestern usa and most of asia are predicted to see a decrease in the frequency of long term meteorological droughts the above results are well emphasized in the regional plots presented in fig 11 the agreement between both climate models is also quite clear from this figure 5 discussion and conclusion 5 1 discussion the results presented in this paper indicate a worsening of extreme meteorological droughts in many regions of the world and particularly so for seasonal short term droughts these results are based on two large climate model ensembles the use of two large ensembles provides the important advantage of allowing a study extreme events with little uncertainty the disadvantage of using large ensembles is that such use does not allow a proper sampling of gcm esm uncertainty as would be the case in a multi model ensemble such as cmip5 it is therefore important to frame our results in comparison to others even though little previous work has been dedicated to extreme droughts similar to ours in sheffield and wood s work 2008 soil moisture data from 8 gcms from ipcc ar4 forced by sres a2 a1b and b1 scenarios was used to study global drought occurrence under future warming 2070 2099 in their study droughts were defined as the sequence of consecutive months with soil moisture quantiles lower than a threshold corresponding to a 10 year return period in the historical period 1961 1990 results showed that the mediterranean west african central asia and central american regions showed large increases in drought frequency and particularly for long term droughts more than 12 month duration a doubling in the frequency of short term droughts 4 6 months duration was observed as compared to the mid twentieth century under the future projections these results are mostly in line with the results of this study with the exception of western africa waf in the future roughly 70 of grid points would experience a worsening of long term droughts only in canesm2 at the annual scale overall sheffield and wood s 2008 future drought conditions were worse than in the current study because they considered agricultural droughts a point that will be discussed later the results presented in this paper are also mostly consistent with those of dai 2011 also some recent work conducted in the cmip6 cook et al 2020 ukkola et al 2020 wang et al 2021 northern mid high latitudes and some hot spot regions such as amz and med are projected to be with robust future changes in droughts in cmip 6 agree with this study the pattern of drought frequency changes is similar between cmip6 and cmip5 but changes in cmip6 are stronger wang et al 2021 indicating that the presented results are largely hold with cmip6 but larger change magnitude in cmip6 the general distribution of areas affected by increasing drought frequency is also in line with areas where mean annual precipitation is expected to decrease and particularly in tropical and subtropical zones ipcc 2013 to further this point the jja relationship between the frequency change of extreme droughts and mean total precipitation was also explored unsurprisingly there is a good spatial correlation between future mean jja changes and increases in future drought frequency the projected change for jja total precipitation for both models is shown in figure s15 areas affected by an increase in meteorological droughts are however larger than those affected by decreases in mean jja precipitation indicating that many regions where mean jja precipitation is expected to increase will nonetheless see worsening drought conditions for example this is especially clear for northern russia in canesm2 and in many regions of south america in cesm1 there is also a clear link with drought return periods with more extreme droughts more likely to increase in regions with increasing mean jja precipitation than for more common droughts this observed tendency in drought frequency to increase in regions getting wetter can only be explained by changes in temporal precipitation variability overall results obtained from both climate ensembles are fairly consistent with only some regional differences in all cases the observed differences correspond to regions already identified by the ipcc as having low inter model agreement these regions are typically characterized by high internal variability compared to the expected climate change signal better agreement was found at the seasonal scale for short term extreme droughts and especially in future djf in which inter annual variability is lower this is also likely the reason why jja extreme droughts will see a greater frequency increase than will djf as with any studies dealing with climate change in future horizons this work is impacted by many sources of uncertainty the work focused on meteorological droughts using a single index and with only two climate models under the pessimistic rcp 8 5 scenario the choice of models and scenario was imposed by the main objective of focusing on extreme droughts the focus on large ensembles was dictated by the need to reduce statistical uncertainty for large return period droughts and this led to the use of the only two global large ensembles available canesm2 and cesm1 large ensembles are expected to become more common in the future and this will help better frame extreme drought related inter model uncertainty such ensembles are now available at the regional scale leduc et al 2019 the use of different drought indices has been shown to potentially have an influence on the magnitude and sign of the change of drought burke and brown 2008 the spi index was chosen especially because of its simplicity its widespread use however the use of this index will likely result in an underestimation of the severity of future droughts under climate change because it ignores the role of temperature a critical contributor marcos garcia et al 2017 this study only looked at meteorological droughts since precipitation deficit is the main driver of all other types of droughts clearly agricultural and hydrological droughts are also affected by other climate variables such as wind humidity and temperature which control evapotranspiration and may worsen the impact of meteorological droughts global surface temperatures have been steadily on the rise over the past decades and the observed changes have already been larger than internal variability for most of the world s regions and sharp increases are expected everywhere especially at high latitudes by the end of the century fischer and knutti 2015 while this study did not look at agricultural and hydrological droughts it can be inferred with good confidence that results presented in this paper for meteorological droughts however dire they are for many regions of the world will pale in comparison to the combined impact of higher temperatures with the increasing frequency of extreme precipitation deficit further studies should focus on a better understanding of these combined effects and the interplay between anthropogenic forcing and the climate s internal variability studies on hydrological and agricultural droughts could easily be carried out using the methodological approach presented in this paper however runoff and soil moisture outputs from climate models should be treated with caution because there is lack of suitable observation to verify burke and brown 2008 alternatively extreme droughts were assessed by minimum spi in this work this choice was made to focus on the magnitude without considering the intensity sum of the spi values ultimately developing a better ability to forecast droughts will become critical to the development of adaptation strategies to cope with the increased frequency and severity of droughts 5 2 conclusions this study has explored the evolution of the frequency of future extreme meteorological droughts at the global scale using precipitation outputs from two large climate ensembles cesm1 and canesm2 under the rcp 8 5 emission scenario the major findings are summarized as follows both ensembles do a good job at replicating spatial patterns and the magnitude of annual total precipitation and interannual variability over the reference period 1981 2010 this provides confidence in each model s ability to adequately represent short term 1 month and long term 24 month drought frequency projected increases in future extreme meteorological drought frequency are mostly consistent across both climate ensembles although there are many regional differences mostly in regions that have already been labeled as having high internal variability by the ipcc the projected increases in meteorological drought frequency are much more severe for short term droughts than for long term droughts the patterns of increasing extreme meteorological drought frequency are consistent with those of future changes in mean annual precipitation indicating that regions with decreasing precipitation are unsurprisingly more at risk however the extent of the drought frequency increase patterns is larger than those for mean annual precipitation indicating a worsening of extreme droughts in some regions projected to see an increase in mean annual precipitation the total area affected by a worsening of droughts gets larger with the drought return periods in other words the frequency increase of the historical 100 year drought is more significant than for the 20 year drought for the most vulnerable region the jja short term drought frequency could increase by up to 20 times for the 100 year drought and by 9 times for the 20 year drought this means that the future return periods of the current 20 and 100 year droughts would become 2 and 5 years in the future for the most affected region credit authorship contribution statement
