16725,the biodegradability of the anticonvulsant pregabalin pgb was studied in laboratory incubation experiments in contact with water sediment systems under different redox conditions pgb was degraded by biological processes under aerobic conditions reaching half lives of 8 to 10 d while inactivated and anaerobic control experiments revealed no significant decrease of pgb concentrations within experiments spiked with elevated pgb concentrations 12 tps were formed and tentative chemical structures could be proposed by accurate masses and fragmentation pathways detected via measurements with high resolution mass spectrometry lc qtof ms four of the proposed tps were finally confirmed either by authentic reference standards pgb lactam isa tp 157 a ii or a self synthesized standard na pgb pgb lactam was identified as the quantitatively most relevant tp formed via intramolecular cyclization under aerobic conditions reaching up to 33 of the initial pgb concentration incubation experiments spiked with pgb lactam revealed three times higher half lives compared to the parent compound indicating that pgb lactam is more stable than pgb a comparison with results gained from water sediment incubation experiments with the structurally related compound gabapentin gbp revealed that the transformation behaviour can be mainly extrapolated to pgb most of the observed transformation reactions found for pgb were comparable to the ones found for gbp the tps pgb lactam and na pgb as well as three gbp tps gbp lactam na gbp and ccha have been detected in german wastewater treatment plants wwtps effluents and the river rhine including some of its tributaries such as main neckar moselle and aare moreover gbp and pgb as well as some of their tps were detected in german bank filtrates and finished drinking waters up to 260 ng l 1 for that reason these compounds should be monitored in drinking water in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pregabalin biological transformation water sediment systems structurally related antiepileptics drinking water 1 introduction since 2004 in germany pgb is applied as supplementary therapy to treat partial seizures but to date it is predominantly 89 implemented for handling neuropathic pain as german prescription numbers of traditional antiepileptics were decreasing in the last decade e g carbamazepine 50 those of new antiepileptics such as gabapentin gbp doubled 44 mio prescribed defined daily doses ddd in germany in 2018 and those of pgb were even 4 times higher than in 2007 schwabe and paffrath 2007 schwabe et al 2019 these prescription alterations made pgb to the leading antiepileptic drug followed by levetiracetam and gbp in humans pgb is barely metabolized 10 and therefore excreted by 92 unchanged via urine bockbrader et al 2010 chew et al 2014 considering 104 mio prescribed ddd s ddd 0 3 g 31 tons of pgb were discharged into german sewer systems in 2018 schwabe et al 2019 who 2020 information about the concentrations in rivers groundwater and drinking water are rare since the occurrence of pgb in the aquatic environment was started to be studied five years ago in german wwtps influent concentrations of pgb were detected at concentrations levels ranging between 2 0 and 8 3 µg l 1 24 h and 72 h composite samples gago ferrero et al 2020 gurke et al 2015b hermes et al 2018 pgb was also analysed in wastewater influents of greece ibáñez et al 2017 and the us gago ferrero et al 2020 oliveira et al 2015 between 0 3 and 1 6 µg l 1 in a few studies the removal of pgb was studied during wastewater treatment reaching elimination rates between 34 and 88 gago ferrero et al 2020 gurke et al 2015a gurke et al 2015b hermes et al 2018 oliveira et al 2015 thus pgb is incompletely removed during wastewater treatment and therefore discharged into rivers receiving wwtp effluents however concentrations in rivers and streams were reported to be not higher than 0 07 µg l 1 in germany and 0 25 µg l 1 in the usa bai et al 2018 hermes et al 2018 furthermore pgb was still detected in three different german bank filtrates with average concentrations of 0 05 0 01 µg l 1 hermes et al 2018 an elimination of pgb in the aquatic environment via sorption to sludge or sediments is negligible due to its high hydrophilicity and rather low sorption affinity to sludge and sediments log koc of 1 6 boulard et al 2020 furthermore vukkum et al 2015 showed in a pharmaceutical study with laboratory degradation tests that hydrolysis and transformation via uv can be excluded as a degradation mechanism a few research articles reported the transport and elimination behaviour of pgb in the aquatic environment bergé et al 2018 burke et al 2018 li and mclachlan 2020 sanz prat et al 2020 li and mclachlan 2020 reported that half lives dt50 dissipation time of pgb determined in unspiked oecd 309 tests with lake water inoculated with wastewater effluent dt50 11 d were substantially lower than half lives measured in a field study at the corresponding swedish lake dt50 81 d probably due to an adapted microbial community present in the inoculum an efficient removal of pgb was observed by burke et al 2018 in oxic zones of sediment cores from a bank filtration site dt50 0 5 2 h while no degradation was observed in the suboxic and anoxic zones thus pgb is only eliminated during bank filtration under oxic conditions and is therefore present in bank filtrates in real bank filtration sites in berlin germany for pgb a half live of 139 d was determined sanz prat et al 2020 most likely induced by at least partially anoxic anaerobic zones grünheid et al 2005 the structurally related compound gbp reached a half life of 407 d gurke et al 2015a gurke et al 2015b hermes et al 2018 while these studies confirmed the biodegradability of pgb no tps of pgb have been identified in contact with environmental matrices so far to close this knowledge gap this study was designed to elucidate the transformation behaviour of pgb in contact with river sediments and surface water special focus was laid on i the biodegradability of pgb in lab scale water sediment systems under various redox conditions ii the identification of tps and iii the proposal of a transformation pathway in the end all observations were compared with findings obtained for the structurally related compound gbp henning et al 2018 here we discussed a possible extrapolation of transformation behaviour from gbp to pgb in addition environmental samples from several sites wwtps surface water bank filtrate drinking water were analysed to elucidate whether the identified tps from pgb and gbp can be detected in the aquatic environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals s pregabalin

gbp as well as their biological tps along a river stretch therefore automated samplers p6 l and p6 mini maxx gmbh rangendingen germany were positioned at two sampling sites a and b with a distance of

between the two sampling sites there was no discharge of treated or untreated wastewater furthermore grab samples from 10 german bank filtrates and 6 drinking waters were collected and analysed for the selected target compounds the influents and effluents of 6 german conventional wwtps without post treatment were sampled by collecting corresponding 72 h composite samples for details see supporting information si all environmental samples were collected in amber glass bottles and transported under cooled conditions to the lab within 6 h in the lab samples were filtered 0 45 µm and stored at 4 c in amber glass bottles and analysed within the next 5 d considering the relatively slow degradation observed in the batch experiments and the expected significantly reduced microbial activity by filtration and cooling analytes were expected to be stable until analysis for preparation of samples for analysis see next section 2 3 1 environmental samples preparation samples from bank filtrates and drinking water were prepared via freeze drying christ alpha 2 4 christ osterode am harz germany samples 10 ml were freeze dried in 50 ml polypropylen centrifuge tubes rotilabo carl roth karlsruhe germany to determine recoveries samples 10 ml were spiked with 10 µl of either 0 01 0 1 2 or 10 mg l 1 analyte mix prior to freeze drying the freeze dried samples were eluted in 1 ml of ultra pure water using ultrasound and spiked with internal standards 200 ng l 1 further environmental samples surface water wastewater influents and effluents were previously filtered 0 45 µm syringe filters whatman and analysed either undiluted or diluted with ultra pure water 1 2 to 1 10 depending on their matrix prior to analysis an internal standard mix was added 200 ng l 1 linear calibration ranged between 1 and 5 000 ng l 1 recoveries in all matrices were determined by adding 10 100 and 1 000 ng l 1 the analytical procedure was analogous to the incubation samples see section 2 4 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 quantification of target compounds for the quantification of target compounds and identified tps in samples from degradation experiments or sampling campaigns a high

chemdraw ultra 12 0 2 cambridgesoft 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation products formed from pgb in aerobic water sediment systems spiked with elevated concentrations a complete degradation of pgb was only observed under aerobic conditions see section 3 3 in order to identify tps of pgb lab scale degradation experiments were therefore conducted in aerobic water sediment systems spiked with elevated concentrations 15 mg l 1 of pgb exp 1 2 over an incubation time of 50 d the formation of tps was observed via lc qtof ms in the aqueous phase of the experiments pgb concentration decreased by more than 99 within 23 4 d to 31 11 d in wss a and wss b respectively for data of all relicates see si figure 2 within both experiments an initial lag phase was observed lasting up to 14 to 35 d of incubation time wss a and wss b in this phase phase p1 pgb was removed by up to 18 10 and 11 7 in wss a and wss b respectively for data of all replicates see si figure 2 subsequent to the lag phase a rapid dissipation phase was observed phase p2 lasting for up to 9 d here the remaining proportion of the initially spiked pgb was completely removed si figure 2 the lag phase followed by a fast dissipation indicates the adaption of the microbial consortium to the usage of pgb as carbon source for bacterial growth madigan et al 2019 in total 12 tps were detected in aerobic active experiments with pgb the structures of 4 tps pgb lactam 2 isobutylsuccinic acid isa tp 157 a ii and na pgb were unambiguously confirmed using either available authentic reference standards or a self synthesized na pgb see si standard moreover the extracted ion chromatograms of at least 5 tps revealed the formation of up to 5 isomeric structures illustrated with roman numerals abbreviations of a and b within the label of isomeric tps indicate whether the tp structure includes a pgb a free carboxylic and amine group or pgb lactam b amide backbone in fig 1 a the time courses of the tps formed in one replicate with pgb as initial substance in contact with wss b are shown either as their peak areas or concentration in relation to the initial peak area or concentration of the parent compound esi or only as their peak area in case of only negatively measurable tps esi fig 1 b one replicate with pgb lactam as initial substance transformation reactions observed consisted of amidation amide hydrolysis hydroxylation oxidation dehydrogenation oxidative deamination and n conjugations n acetylation or n acetate conjugation fig 3 3 1 1 pgb lactam pgb lactam tp 141 was observed as one major tp based on the m z of 142 1225 a molecular formula of c8h16no mass accuracy 1 ppm could be proposed the chemical structure was suggested to consist of pgb with a γ lactam ring structure molecular structure see fig 3 formed via an intramolecular cyclization at the primary amine and carboxylic acid under the cleavage of water pgb lactam 4 isobutylpyrrolidin 2 one has already been identified as one major tp from pgb being formed under oxidative conditions 10 hydrogen peroxide vukkum et al 2015 characteristic fragments of m z 83 0856 c6h11 1 2 ppm and 55 0542 c4h7 1 ppm represented the loss of c2h4no δ59 and c4h9no δ87 at the γ lactam ring structure respectively furthermore the chemical structure of pgb lactam was confirmed via an authentic reference standard further follow up tps of pgb lactam were tp 139 formed via oxidation loss of two hydrogen atoms and tp 157 b and tp 173 b formed by one and two fold hydroxylation introduction of one and two oxygen atoms for structure see fig 3 the position of the hydroxyl groups could not be determined however based on a comparison with an authentic standard of 6 6 dihydroxylpregabalin lactam the position of both hydroxyl groups at the c 6 position could be excluded for tp 173 b due to the negligible formation of tp 139 and tp 173 b the structural elucidation is not discussed in detail for more information see the si a description of the structural elucidation of tp 157 b is given below within phase p1 of pgb incubation an intermediate formation of pgb lactam of less than 1 in contact with wss a and of up to 5 of the initial molar pgb concentration in contact with wss b was observed similar to pgb the tp pgb lactam was also completely removed within phase p2 see fig 1 and si fig 2 the follow up tps of pgb lactam were all formed during phase p1 and decreased very quickly in phase p2 see fig 1 a and b however even in phase p1 they were of minor quantitative importance as peak areas reached less than 0 1 of the initial pgb or pgb lactam peak area fig 1 a and b the overall removal of pgb could proceed predominantly via pgb lactam if pgb lactam itself would be very fast further degraded however this hypothesis was not supported by experiments conducted with pgb lactam as initial substance here pgb lactam was degraded more slowly or similar compared to pgb si fig 2 c and d exp 2 2 therefore it is likely that the degradation of pgb is predominantly occurring via an alternative pathway although follow up tps of pgb lactam were detected 3 1 2 isa tp 172 and tp 190 isa tp 174 is the quantitatively most relevant tp formed from pgb spiked at elevated concentrations it was detected only in negative ionization mode at a m z of 173 0828 and a molecular formula of c8h13o4 mass accuracy 5 2 ppm could be proposed characteristic fragments in the ms2 spectrum were m z 129 0924 δ44 c7h13o2 2 3 ppm formed via co2 cleavage and 83 0863 δ90 c6h11 3 6 ppm formed via co2 and an additional ch2o2 cleavage respectively the proposed chemical structure fig 3 was confirmed via the comparison with an authentic reference standard 2 isobutylsuccinic acid isa therefore isa was most likely formed via an oxidative deamination of the primary amine resulting in a carboxylic acid in contact with wss b pgb was transformed to isa to up to 10 of the initial molar concentration si fig 2 a and b the concentration of isa showed an abrupt increase in phase p2 of all replicates the oxidative deamination of primary amines is a biological transformation reaction being reported for a few compounds like the structurally related gabapentin henning et al 2018 and primaquine gulde et al 2016 gulde et al 2016 showed in a systematic study investigating the transformation of various compounds with amine moieties that oxidative dealkylation of amines also called oxidative deamination in case of primary amines is a typical transformation reaction but primary amines seemed to be less accessible compared to secondary and tertiary amines interestingly isa was also observed in incubation experiments with pgb lactam as initial substance as it increased to up to 2 of the initial pgb lactam concentration in incubations with wss a and wss b si fig 2 c and d this indicates that pgb lactam is hydrolysed back to pgb followed by the oxidative deamination forming isa however pgb was only detected at very low amounts 0 1 in phase p1 of experiments with pgb lactam as initial substance a plausible explanation is that the oxidative deamination of pgb to isa proceeded at a considerably higher rate than the amide hydrolysis causing no relevant accumulation of pgb in the experiments with pgb lactam as initial substance isa was completely removed within the ongoing incubation and was therefore not stable in water sediment systems intensities of tp 172 and tp190 increased very quickly in phase p2 of incubation experiments with pgb as initial substance which is why they were suggested to be follow up tps of isa this was supported by the proposed chemical structures of tp 172 and tp 190 as it is demonstrated in the following tp 172 was detected with a m z of 171 0670 and a molecular formula of c8h11o4 4 1 ppm could be proposed it might be formed via the oxidation of isa leading to a double bond loss of two hydrogen atoms however characteristic fragments like m z 127 0765 δ44 c7h11o2 0 4 ppm and 83 0867 δ88 c6h11 1 0 ppm representing one and two fold cleavage of carbon dioxide from the carboxylic acid groups did not allow for determining the position of the double bond tp 190 was detected with a mean m z of 189 0773 esi and revealed 3 peaks tp 190 i iii in the extracted ion chromatogram due to the detected exact mass a molecular formula of c8h13o5 2 8 ppm could be proposed which indicates that tp 190 is formed from isa via the introduction of an oxygen atom hydroxylation characteristic fragments observed in the ms2 spectra of all isobaric tps were m z 171 0669 δ18 c8h11o4 3 3 ppm representing the loss of water from the hydroxyl group and m z 127 0771 δ62 c7h11o2 5 0 ppm formed via the additional cleavage of co2 from the carboxylic groups however the exact position of the introduced hydroxyl group within the chemical structure could not be determined with the available ms2 spectra both tp 172 and tp 190 did not reveal a quantitative relevance within the degradation of pgb in contact with water sediment systems comparing the peak areas of isa with tp 190 and tp 172 in experiments with pgb lactam as initial substance tp 190 or tp 172 were not observed which might be due to concentrations below the detection limit fig 1 and si fig 2 3 1 3 tp 157 a and tp 157 b further transformation of pgb occurred via the cleavage of two hydrogen atoms tp 157 a the introduction of an oxygen atom tp 175 for structural elucidation see si and a combination of both tp 173 a for structural elucidation see si the extracted ion chromatogram xic of tp 173 and tp 157 revealed 3 and 5 peaks of isobaric compounds indicated by roman numerals respectively these isobaric compounds consist either of a pgb backbone a or a pgb lactam backbone γ lactam ring structure b in combination with further modifications within the proposed molecular formula for chemical structures see fig 3 the specific ms2 fragmentation pattern as well as their presence or absence in experiments with pgb or pgb lactam as initial substances were used to differentiate between tps with a pgb or pgb lactam backbone this procedure is explained in more detail for tp 157 a and tp 157 b in the following tp 157 was detected in positive ionization mode at a mean m z of 158 1170 and a molecular formula of c8h16no2 3 5 ppm could be proposed thus the chemical structure could consist of pgb less two hydrogen atoms or pgb lactam with an additional oxygen atom while tp 157 b i and ii were formed in experiments with both pgb and pgb lactam as initial substance tp 157 a i iii were only formed with pgb as initial substance the isomeric structure of 4 5 dehydro pregabalin was available as an authentic reference standard and therefore identified as tp 157 a ii via the specific ms2 fragmentation pattern and retention time comparing the ms2 spectra of the tp 157 isomers with the authentic reference standard 4 5 dehydro pregabalin tp 157 a ii many common fragments were observed for tp 157 a i and iii these were for example a m z of 141 0906 δ17 c8h13o2 2 8 ppm representing the loss of nh3 and m z 81 0695 δ77 c6h9 4 9 ppm formed by an additional c2h4o2 cleavage for further common fragments see si this led to the presumption that tp 157 a i and iii are also isomers of the dehydrogenated pgb the ms2 fragmentation patterns supported this presumption but the exact positions of the double bonds could not be determined tp 157 a i iii was not detected in experiments with pgb lactam as initial substance this might be explained by the negligible formation of pgb of less than 1 of the initial pgb lactam concentration fig 1 fundamental differences in the ms2 spectra were found by comparing 4 5 dehydro pregabalin tp 157 a ii and tp 157 b for details see si here the detection of fragment m z 84 0441 δ74 c4h6no 3 6 ppm representing the loss of c4h10o clearly indicated a pgb lactam backbone moreover the predominant fragment m z 140 1063 δ18 c8h14no 5 0 ppm was formed via the cleavage of water which occurs with alcohol moieties at alkyl chains hesse et al 2012 furthermore tp 157 b i and ii were detected in experiments with both pgb and pgb lactam as initial substance fig 1 thus tp 157 b i and ii were formed from pgb lactam which was formed from pgb in experiments with pgb as initial substance therefore tp 157 b i and ii were proposed to consist of hydroxylated pgb lactam whereby the exact position of the hydroxyl group could not be determined 3 1 4 side reactions further reactions observed were conjugations at the primary amine like the n acetylation forming na pgb tp 201 or acetate conjugation forming tp 217 fig 3 na pgb was detected at a m z of 200 1299 in negative ionization mode and at a m z of 202 144 in positive ionization mode molecular formulas of c10h18no3 3 5 ppm and c10h20no3 1 0 ppm could be proposed from negative and positive ionization measurements respectively besides others one characteristic fragment detected in the negative ms2 spectrum was formed via the loss of the amine conjugate δc2h2o resulting in a m z of 158 1192 representing a molecular formula of c8h16no2 δ42 3 2 ppm for more details see si tp 217 was detected at a m z of 216 1246 in esi and 218 1377 in esi mode respectively and a molecular formula of c10h18no4 2 5 ppm for esi and c10h20no4 4 5 ppm for esi could be proposed in negative ionization mode characteristic fragmentation reactions showed for example the loss of c2h3no2 forming a fragment of m z 143 1077 δ73 c8h15o2 0 3 ppm for details see the si however these tps were not quantitatively relevant since their peak areas reached less than 0 1 of the initial pgb peak area fig 1 moreover the conjugation of pgb with acetyl and acetate appeared to be only side reactions within the overall removal mechanism 3 2 proposed overall transformation pathway of pgb incubated at elevated concentrations in aerobic active water sediment systems according to the tp time courses during the incubation of elevated concentrations of pgb or pgb lactam as well as considering their chemical structures identified tps could be subdivided into tps either formed in phase p1 or phase p2 tps generated in phase p1 are formed by amidation hydroxylation oxidation and n conjugations all reactions include an amide or amine functional group tps formed within the lag phase phase p1 were fully or almost completely degraded very fast during phase p2 while several other intermediate tps isa tp 172 tp 190 were formed within a short incubation time of 3 to 5 d after the lag phase tps solely formed in phase p2 were initially generated via oxidative deamination of the primary amine of pgb forming isa and further hydroxylation tp 190 or oxidation tp 172 and therefore do not include any nitrogen containing functional group this demonstrates that pgb incubated at elevated concentrations and its intermediate tps e g pgb lactam na pgb formed in phase p1 are all most likely finally further transformed by the oxidative deamination isa was also rapidly further degraded within the incubation of both pgb and pgb lactam even though isa belongs to the group of 3 branched alkanoic acids which is generally known to be less biodegradable than 2 branched alkanoic acids lau et al 1980 due to the hindered beta oxidation it might be degraded by alternative mechanisms given by lau et al 1980 however lau et al 1980 reported three alternative mechanisms for the microbial degradation of the 3 branched alkanoic acid 3 methylvaleric acid 3 mva with three bacterial strains two of these strains originated from activated sludge and were capable of metabolizing 3 mva either via alpha oxidation or omega oxidation under the involvement of coenzyme a lau et al 1980 consequently also isa could be degraded to smaller c2 c1 units and or co2 moreover the total dissolved organic carbon doc in the supernatant showed a decrease of the doc parallel to the disappearance of the initially spiked substances pgb and pgb lactam down to the doc concentration level of non spiked replicates si fig 2 c and d and si fig 3 c and d this strongly suggests that a further transformation of isa tp 190 and tp 172 finally led to an almost complete mineralization or uptake into the biomass rather than to the formation of stable tps which have not been amenable to the analytical method in contrast sorption processes as an alternative explanation can be considered rather unlikely due to the relatively high polarity of pgb and their tps 3 3 degradation and transformation of pgb incubated at low concentrations incubation experiments with low initial pgb concentrations 50 µg l 1 were conducted to determine degradation kinetics under various conditions a complete removal of pgb 98 of initial pgb concentration was observed under aerobic active conditions within 14 to 25 d in contact with wss a and b respectively fig 2 a and b in abiotic autoclaved control experiments pgb was not significantly removed over an incubation time of 58 d fig 2 a and b furthermore no significant decrease in pgb concentration was observed in anaerobic experiments within 28 d active and abiotic exp 1 5 and 1 6 fig 2 c these findings were in good agreement with observations made by burke et al 2018 showing no degradability of pgb in suboxic and anoxic zones of sediment cores from a bank filtration site due to the high polarity of pgb log koc 1 6 reported by boulard et al 2020 sorption is expected to play a minor role as elimination mechanism in conclusion the decrease of pgb concentration in aerobic active lab scale incubations at low spike concentrations was most likely mediated by biotransformation processes elimination of pgb can be described by zero order kinetics kbiol during the first 14 d of incubation kbiol wss a 4 0 0 2 µg l 1 d 1 kbiol wss b 2 8 0 8 µg l 1 d 1 due to a linear decrease in pgb concentrations r² 0 9 0 1 for more details on the calculation of kinetics see si in comparison to observations at high spike concentrations a lag phase was not observed indicating no considerable adaption of the microbial community at low spike concentration half lives of pgb dt50 pgb revealed to be similar in contact with both sediments wss a 8 0 1 d and wss b 10 2 6 d fig 2 a and b however a complete removal of pgb was achieved faster in contact with wss a comparing to wss b due to a flattening decrease of pgb concentration in experiments with wss b the half lives of pgb and the structurally related anticonvulsant gabapentin gbp were in the same range dt50 gbp in wss a 2 d and in wss b 7 d but gbp showed a four times lower dt50 in contact with wss a compared to pgb henning et al 2018 during the incubation of low concentrations of pgb in aerobic active water sediment systems only the formation of pgb lactam was detected furthermore pgb lactam was not detected in any of the autoclaved or anaerobic setups low spike concentrations fig 2 a c being most likely formed by aerobic biological processes experiments conducted in contact with wss b revealed a four times higher formation of pgb lactam formed up to 33 of the initial pgb concentration compared to wss a up to 8 this indicated that a faster degradation of pgb occurred with a lower formation of pgb lactam wss a while a slower degradation of pgb resulted in higher amounts of pgb lactam wss b interestingly similar observations were made for gbp and its major tp gbp lactam henning et al 2018 here gbp lactam was formed up to 2 of the initial gbp concentration in contact with wss a and up to 18 in contact with wss b experiments with pgb and gbp did not run in parallel lower amounts of lactam tps detected in wss a compared to wss b might be explained by a faster degradation of pgb and gbp via alternative reactions in case of pgb oxidative deamination oxidation dehydrogenation and conjugation or a fast transformation of the lactam tps as already discussed above the latter option was unlikely as incubation experiments with pgb lactam as initial compound low concentrations revealed three times higher half lives of initially spiked pgb lactam dt50 wss b 26 6 d dt50 wss a 25 5 d compared to pgb wss a 8 0 1 d and wss b 10 3 d fig 2 d f therefore also at low concentrations the biological tp pgb lactam is more stable in water sediment systems compared to its parent compound pgb the same observations have been made for gbp and its major tp gbp lactam here gbp lactam was removed six times slower from the water phase comparing incubation experiments with wss a henning et al 2018 neither in anaerobic batches nor in inactivated controls spiked with low pgb lactam concentrations pgb lactam was removed significantly from the water phase fig 2 d f furthermore a log koc of 1 8 of the structurally related gbp lactam which is insignificantly higher compared to gbp log koc 1 7 and pgb log koc 1 6 boulard et al 2020 indicates that sorption might be of minor importance within the removal of pgb lactam thus the degradation of pgb lactam is most likely linked to aerobic transformation processes despite the observations made in experiments with elevated pgb concentrations isa was not detected in incubations of low pgb concentrations in water sediment systems but in experiments conducted only with surface water experiment 1 3 see si here isa was formed up to 1 while pgb lactam reached 2 of the initially spiked pgb concentration furthermore incubations with surface water ws a experiments 1 3 2 3 and 3 1 data not shown here see si for details spiked separately with 50 µg l 1 of pgb pgb lactam and isa revealed that isa was the least stable compared to pgb and pgb lactam being completely removed within 7 d of incubation time complete removal of pgb within 30 d while pgb lactam was the most stable no decrease within 30 d of incubation therefore it is likely that isa is immediately further transformed which would not result in a detectable accumulation when pgb or pgb lactam are incubated at low spike concentrations in water sediment experiments in conclusion the oxidative deamination is proposed to represent the main degradation mechanism of pgb incubated in water sediment systems at aerobic active conditions which most likely leads to mineralization and or uptake into the biomass except for the n acetate conjugation all transformation reactions found for pgb were also observed in experiments with gbp these included i amidation amide hydrolysis ii hydroxylation iii oxidation iv n acetylation and v oxidative deamination the most relevant stable tp formed from pgb and gbp spiked at environmental concentrations turned out to be the γ lactam formed via amidation therefore the transformation behaviour of gbp could be extrapolated to the structurally related compound pgb furthermore for both compounds the oxidative deamination 1 carboxycyclohexane acetic acid ccha and isa was only observed in water sediment incubations spiked with elevated concentrations tps formed from pgb fit quite well the prior reported tps from gbp fig 3 in contrast the reverse reaction of the amidation amide hydrolysis from pgb lactam to pgb was not observed while gbp was formed by 18 from gbp lactam in contact with wss b under aerobic active conditions referring to the above discussion a reverse reaction of pgb lactam to pgb was most likely not detected due to a very fast further transformation of pgb via oxidative deamination 3 4 occurrence of pgb gbp and their biological tps in the environment 3 4 1 wwtp in order to investigate the discharge of pgb gbp and its biological tps into aquatic systems and their behaviour during wastewater treatment corresponding 72 h composite samples were taken from 6 german wwtps influents and effluents and analysed via lc ms ms according to prescription numbers gbp was detected at 3 times higher mean concentrations in wwtp influents compared to pgb reaching 10 4 µg l 1 and 3 1 µg l 1 respectively table 2 furthermore all analysed tps pgb lactam na pgb isa gbp lactam na gbp and ccha were already detected in influents assuming biological transformation processes to occur in the sewer systems none of the tps have been observed as human metabolites in urine or faeces as gbp is excreted completely unmetabolized and pgb shows less than 1 of n methyl pgb in urine bockbrader et al 2010 chew et al 2014 corrigan et al 2001 gallimore and gidal 2010 mclean 1994 vollmer et al 1986 during conventional biological wastewater treatment with denitrification and nitrification pgb and gbp showed mean removals of 89 6 and 46 19 respectively hence the data indicates that gbp is about 2 times more stable in wwtps and therefore discharged at 12 fold higher mean concentrations in comparison to pgb table 2 a higher stability of gbp was not observed in the water sediment degradation experiments of this study and in henning et al 2018 but is in good agreement with former studies investigating the removal of pharmaceuticals in wwtps gurke et al 2015a hermes et al 2018 nevertheless during wastewater treatment pgb lactam and gbp lactam were identified as the major tps formed from pgb and gbp as it was already observed in water sediment incubation experiments henning et al 2018 pgb lactam was formed by 19 18 and gbp lactam by 42 23 table 2 in case of isa and ccha the concentrations decreased within the wastewater treatment and were not detected above the loq in wwtp effluents while na pgb was detected at very low median concentrations in wwtp influents and effluents 0 012 and 0 005 µg l 1 respectively and no formation could be observed the concentration of na gbp was detected at a much higher median concentrations which considerably increased during biological wastewater treatment from 0 3 µg l 1 in the influents to 0 7 µg l 1 in the effluents hence na gbp can also be considered as a major tp from gbp in wwtps in contrast to water sediment incubation experiments where na gbp was not observed at a low initial gbp concentration henning et al 2018 thus na gbp is discharged at similar median concentrations as gbp lactam 1 1 µg l 1 into receiving waters table 2 although it should be mentioned that the recovery in wastewater influent matrix determined with standard addition was 149 55 for na gbp see si therefore concentrations should be considered with caution for both pgb and gbp the mass balances were not closed for the investigated wwtps as the formation of tps could only explain about 19 18 and 57 23 respectively of the removal of their parent compounds table 2 this was also observed in degradation experiments with water sediment systems as already hypothesized from incubations in water sediment systems the alternate transformation pathway of gbp and pgb might also be via the oxidative deamination in wwtps which at least was observed to occur in the sewer system as isa and ccha were present in influents a fast degradation of the primary tps of the oxidative deamination isa and ccha similar to water sediment incubation might be the reason why these tps could not be detected above the loq in the effluents thus the gab in mass balance might be explained by a further degradation mineralization or uptake into biomass of all tps as it was observed that they are not recalcitrant to biological degradation 3 4 2 stream usa in order to investigate the transformation behaviour of pgb and gbp along a river stretch a sampling campaign was carried out at the small stream usa in hessen germany data see si over a period of 7 days corresponding 24 h composite samples were taken at two sampling sites a and b in a distance of 9 km to evaluate the degradation formation of the analytes along the river stretch a compensation for dilution processes was needed this was carried out in correspondence to henning et al 2018 and kunkel and radke 2012 by normalizing the analytes concentrations by the concentrations of cbz detected at the two sampling points see fig 26 in the si which is known to be stable in natural systems löffler et al 2005 the decrease of cbz between a and b was therefore attributed to dilution processes thereby the degradation of pgb and gbp along the river stretch was observed to be in the same range of about 17 and 18 respectively between sampling site a and b data see si in contrast no considerable change in the lactam tps concentration was observed as the cbz normalized removal of pgb lactam and gbp lactam was only 10 and 2 respectively this is in a good agreement with the degradation experiments conducted in water sediment systems as the parent compounds were observed to be less stable compared to the lactam tps henning et al 2018 in contrast further detected tps na pgb na gbp and ccha were observed to be removed more efficiently by 31 21 and 26 it can be concluded that the degradation of gbp and pgb was relatively low 20 and no tp formation was observed along the investigated 9 km river stretch thus the occurrence of gbp and pgb tps in surface waters is most likely mainly caused by their discharge from wwtps rather than from their formation in rivers and streams 3 4 3 spatial distribution in the rhine and selected tributaries to give an overview about the spatial distribution of the occurrence of pgb gbp and their lactam tps in the river rhine and its selected tributaries 21 grab samples were taken and analysed via lc ms ms for data see si here concentrations of pgb and gbp ranged from 5 to 500 ng l 1 and 50 to 5 000 ng l 1 respectively see si thus gbp reached up to 7 times higher median concentrations 190 ng l 1 compared to pgb 30 ng l 1 which can be explained by a higher consumption of gbp schwabe et al 2019 its higher stability in wwtps and therefore higher discharge into receiving waters furthermore the concentrations of the main biological tps pgb lactam and gbp lactam reached median concentrations of 20 ng l 1 and 30 ng l 1 respectively data see si the data reveal that along the river stretch high amounts of all analytes are mainly introduced from tributaries and locations with high industrial activities or population density or both such as schwarzbach main and emscher the mean ratio between the parent compounds and the lactam tps is 1 4 0 7 for pgb n 17 and 6 0 2 3 for gbp n 21 this is comparable to the ratios in the wwtp effluents 0 9 0 6 pgb pgb lactam ratio 4 1 2 5 gbp gbp lactam ratio and further supports that gbp pgb and their lactam tps are not considerably affected by degradation transformation processes in surface waters 3 4 4 temporal fluctuation in the river rhine the analysis of 28 24h composite samples of the river rhine at koblenz from february 2019 gives an overview about the fluctuation of the concentrations of the compounds over a period of one month fig 4 a b gbp was detected at higher median concentrations 28 ng l 1 compared to pgb which reached a median of 5 ng l 1 for calculation values loq were substituted with ½ loq in contrast to gbp which was detected in every sample pgb was found only in 9 out of 28 samples due to rather low concentrations of pgb close to the limit of quantification loq 10 ng l 1 fig 4 a which is why the median is below the loq both parent compounds show a parallel fluctuation over time which does not correlate with concentrations of the wastewater indicator substance cbz fig 4 a and b na pgb and isa were not found in the samples but pgb lactam was detected in all analysed samples at a slightly higher median of 27 ng l 1 compared to its parent compound pgb interestingly concentrations of pgb lactam were not fluctuating over the investigated period the same was observed for gbp lactam which was detected at a median of 35 ng l 1 this might be explained by the discharges of pharmaceutical companies na gbp was detected at a similar median 22 ng l 1 compared to gbp lactam this did not fit the results observed in water sediment degradation experiments with gbp as na gbp was not detected within incubation experiments with low gbp spike concentrations henning et al 2018 but can be explained by the concentrations discharged by wwtps table 2 neither isa nor ccha were observed in any sample which is in good accordance with results gained from water sediment degradation experiments at low spike concentrations conducted in this study and in henning et al 2018 and also with data from wwtps 3 4 5 bank filtrates and drinking water moreover the analysis of samples from german bank filtrates n 10 and drinking water n 6 data see table 3 and table 4 revealed the sporadic occurrence of pgb 3 10 and 1 6 in bank filtrates and drinking water respectively and its two tps pgb lactam 9 10 and 3 6 and na pgb 2 10 and 0 10 in the low ng l 1 range while isa was not observed in any of the samples gbp and all of its analysed tps gbp lactam na gbp and ccha showed positive results in both bank filtrates and drinking water respectively thus several tps from pgb and gbp can reach drinking waters or be formed during bank filtration processes while concentrations of tps from gbp are slightly higher in bank filtrates and drinking water compared to tps from pgb nevertheless gbp and its biological tps gbp lactam and na gbp are quite stable in wwtps and need further improvement of treatment technologies in order to reduce discharge into receiving waters and transport into drinking water therefore in 2015 the german environment agency uba published health related orientation values for gbp and gbp lactam at 1 0 µg l 1 umweltbundesamt 2020 which were not exceeded in the here investigated samples of drinking water or bank filtrate 4 conclusions conducted lab scale degradation experiments in water sediment systems spiked with pgb under varied redox conditions resulted in the following conclusions like it was previously determined for gbp also pgb is stable under abiotic and anaerobic conditions but degradable under aerobic active conditions thus transformation reactions are most likely driven by aerobic microorganisms present in the sediment elucidation of tps revealed that the knowledge from the gbp transformation pathway can be extrapolated to the transformation pathway of the structurally related pgb monitoring data confirmed that pgb and gbp and some of their biological tps are ubiquitously present in the aquatic environment therefore we recommend to implement at least the lactam tps and na gbp in monitoring programs and to investigate their ecotoxicological effects to evaluate their potential environmental impact with regard to the increasing relevance of pgb further studies with radiolabelled pgb and pgb lactam in lab scale experiments could reveal whether mineralization or uptake into biomass is the driving degradation mechanism supplementary material

16725,the biodegradability of the anticonvulsant pregabalin pgb was studied in laboratory incubation experiments in contact with water sediment systems under different redox conditions pgb was degraded by biological processes under aerobic conditions reaching half lives of 8 to 10 d while inactivated and anaerobic control experiments revealed no significant decrease of pgb concentrations within experiments spiked with elevated pgb concentrations 12 tps were formed and tentative chemical structures could be proposed by accurate masses and fragmentation pathways detected via measurements with high resolution mass spectrometry lc qtof ms four of the proposed tps were finally confirmed either by authentic reference standards pgb lactam isa tp 157 a ii or a self synthesized standard na pgb pgb lactam was identified as the quantitatively most relevant tp formed via intramolecular cyclization under aerobic conditions reaching up to 33 of the initial pgb concentration incubation experiments spiked with pgb lactam revealed three times higher half lives compared to the parent compound indicating that pgb lactam is more stable than pgb a comparison with results gained from water sediment incubation experiments with the structurally related compound gabapentin gbp revealed that the transformation behaviour can be mainly extrapolated to pgb most of the observed transformation reactions found for pgb were comparable to the ones found for gbp the tps pgb lactam and na pgb as well as three gbp tps gbp lactam na gbp and ccha have been detected in german wastewater treatment plants wwtps effluents and the river rhine including some of its tributaries such as main neckar moselle and aare moreover gbp and pgb as well as some of their tps were detected in german bank filtrates and finished drinking waters up to 260 ng l 1 for that reason these compounds should be monitored in drinking water in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pregabalin biological transformation water sediment systems structurally related antiepileptics drinking water 1 introduction since 2004 in germany pgb is applied as supplementary therapy to treat partial seizures but to date it is predominantly 89 implemented for handling neuropathic pain as german prescription numbers of traditional antiepileptics were decreasing in the last decade e g carbamazepine 50 those of new antiepileptics such as gabapentin gbp doubled 44 mio prescribed defined daily doses ddd in germany in 2018 and those of pgb were even 4 times higher than in 2007 schwabe and paffrath 2007 schwabe et al 2019 these prescription alterations made pgb to the leading antiepileptic drug followed by levetiracetam and gbp in humans pgb is barely metabolized 10 and therefore excreted by 92 unchanged via urine bockbrader et al 2010 chew et al 2014 considering 104 mio prescribed ddd s ddd 0 3 g 31 tons of pgb were discharged into german sewer systems in 2018 schwabe et al 2019 who 2020 information about the concentrations in rivers groundwater and drinking water are rare since the occurrence of pgb in the aquatic environment was started to be studied five years ago in german wwtps influent concentrations of pgb were detected at concentrations levels ranging between 2 0 and 8 3 µg l 1 24 h and 72 h composite samples gago ferrero et al 2020 gurke et al 2015b hermes et al 2018 pgb was also analysed in wastewater influents of greece ibáñez et al 2017 and the us gago ferrero et al 2020 oliveira et al 2015 between 0 3 and 1 6 µg l 1 in a few studies the removal of pgb was studied during wastewater treatment reaching elimination rates between 34 and 88 gago ferrero et al 2020 gurke et al 2015a gurke et al 2015b hermes et al 2018 oliveira et al 2015 thus pgb is incompletely removed during wastewater treatment and therefore discharged into rivers receiving wwtp effluents however concentrations in rivers and streams were reported to be not higher than 0 07 µg l 1 in germany and 0 25 µg l 1 in the usa bai et al 2018 hermes et al 2018 furthermore pgb was still detected in three different german bank filtrates with average concentrations of 0 05 0 01 µg l 1 hermes et al 2018 an elimination of pgb in the aquatic environment via sorption to sludge or sediments is negligible due to its high hydrophilicity and rather low sorption affinity to sludge and sediments log koc of 1 6 boulard et al 2020 furthermore vukkum et al 2015 showed in a pharmaceutical study with laboratory degradation tests that hydrolysis and transformation via uv can be excluded as a degradation mechanism a few research articles reported the transport and elimination behaviour of pgb in the aquatic environment bergé et al 2018 burke et al 2018 li and mclachlan 2020 sanz prat et al 2020 li and mclachlan 2020 reported that half lives dt50 dissipation time of pgb determined in unspiked oecd 309 tests with lake water inoculated with wastewater effluent dt50 11 d were substantially lower than half lives measured in a field study at the corresponding swedish lake dt50 81 d probably due to an adapted microbial community present in the inoculum an efficient removal of pgb was observed by burke et al 2018 in oxic zones of sediment cores from a bank filtration site dt50 0 5 2 h while no degradation was observed in the suboxic and anoxic zones thus pgb is only eliminated during bank filtration under oxic conditions and is therefore present in bank filtrates in real bank filtration sites in berlin germany for pgb a half live of 139 d was determined sanz prat et al 2020 most likely induced by at least partially anoxic anaerobic zones grünheid et al 2005 the structurally related compound gbp reached a half life of 407 d gurke et al 2015a gurke et al 2015b hermes et al 2018 while these studies confirmed the biodegradability of pgb no tps of pgb have been identified in contact with environmental matrices so far to close this knowledge gap this study was designed to elucidate the transformation behaviour of pgb in contact with river sediments and surface water special focus was laid on i the biodegradability of pgb in lab scale water sediment systems under various redox conditions ii the identification of tps and iii the proposal of a transformation pathway in the end all observations were compared with findings obtained for the structurally related compound gbp henning et al 2018 here we discussed a possible extrapolation of transformation behaviour from gbp to pgb in addition environmental samples from several sites wwtps surface water bank filtrate drinking water were analysed to elucidate whether the identified tps from pgb and gbp can be detected in the aquatic environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals s pregabalin

pgb was only observed under aerobic conditions see section 3 3 in order to identify tps of pgb lab scale degradation experiments were therefore conducted in aerobic water sediment systems spiked with elevated concentrations 15 mg l 1 of pgb exp 1 2 over an incubation time of 50 d the formation of tps was observed via lc qtof ms in the aqueous phase of the experiments pgb concentration decreased by more than 99 within 23 4 d to 31 11 d in wss a and wss b respectively for data of all relicates see si figure 2 within both experiments an initial lag phase was observed lasting up to 14 to 35 d of incubation time wss a and wss b in this phase phase p1 pgb was removed by up to 18 10 and 11 7 in wss a and wss b respectively for data of all replicates see si figure 2 subsequent to the lag phase a rapid dissipation phase was observed phase p2 lasting for up to 9 d here the remaining proportion of the initially spiked pgb was completely removed si figure 2 the lag phase followed by a fast dissipation indicates the adaption of the microbial consortium to the usage of pgb as carbon source for bacterial growth madigan et al 2019 in total 12 tps were detected in aerobic active experiments with pgb the structures of 4 tps pgb lactam 2 isobutylsuccinic acid isa tp 157 a ii and na pgb were unambiguously confirmed using either available authentic reference standards or a self synthesized na pgb see si standard moreover the extracted ion chromatograms of at least 5 tps revealed the formation of up to 5 isomeric structures illustrated with roman numerals abbreviations of a and b within the label of isomeric tps indicate whether the tp structure includes a pgb a free carboxylic and amine group or pgb lactam b amide backbone in fig 1 a the time courses of the tps formed in one replicate with pgb as initial substance in contact with wss b are shown either as their peak areas or concentration in relation to the initial peak area or concentration of the parent compound esi or only as their peak area in case of only negatively measurable tps esi fig 1 b one replicate with pgb lactam as initial substance transformation reactions observed consisted of amidation amide hydrolysis hydroxylation oxidation dehydrogenation oxidative deamination and n conjugations n acetylation or n acetate conjugation fig 3 3 1 1 pgb lactam pgb lactam tp 141 was observed as one major tp based on the m z of 142 1225 a molecular formula of c8h16no mass accuracy 1 ppm could be proposed the chemical structure was suggested to consist of pgb with a γ lactam ring structure molecular structure see fig 3 formed via an intramolecular cyclization at the primary amine and carboxylic acid under the cleavage of water pgb lactam 4 isobutylpyrrolidin 2 one has already been identified as one major tp from pgb being formed under oxidative conditions 10 hydrogen peroxide vukkum et al 2015 characteristic fragments of m z 83 0856 c6h11 1 2 ppm and 55 0542 c4h7 1 ppm represented the loss of c2h4no δ59 and c4h9no δ87 at the γ lactam ring structure respectively furthermore the chemical structure of pgb lactam was confirmed via an authentic reference standard further follow up tps of pgb lactam were tp 139 formed via oxidation loss of two hydrogen atoms and tp 157 b and tp 173 b formed by one and two fold hydroxylation introduction of one and two oxygen atoms for structure see fig 3 the position of the hydroxyl groups could not be determined however based on a comparison with an authentic standard of 6 6 dihydroxylpregabalin lactam the position of both hydroxyl groups at the c 6 position could be excluded for tp 173 b due to the negligible formation of tp 139 and tp 173 b the structural elucidation is not discussed in detail for more information see the si a description of the structural elucidation of tp 157 b is given below within phase p1 of pgb incubation an intermediate formation of pgb lactam of less than 1 in contact with wss a and of up to 5 of the initial molar pgb concentration in contact with wss b was observed similar to pgb the tp pgb lactam was also completely removed within phase p2 see fig 1 and si fig 2 the follow up tps of pgb lactam were all formed during phase p1 and decreased very quickly in phase p2 see fig 1 a and b however even in phase p1 they were of minor quantitative importance as peak areas reached less than 0 1 of the initial pgb or pgb lactam peak area fig 1 a and b the overall removal of pgb could proceed predominantly via pgb lactam if pgb lactam itself would be very fast further degraded however this hypothesis was not supported by experiments conducted with pgb lactam as initial substance here pgb lactam was degraded more slowly or similar compared to pgb si fig 2 c and d exp 2 2 therefore it is likely that the degradation of pgb is predominantly occurring via an alternative pathway although follow up tps of pgb lactam were detected 3 1 2 isa tp 172 and tp 190 isa tp 174 is the quantitatively most relevant tp formed from pgb spiked at elevated concentrations it was detected only in negative ionization mode at a m z of 173 0828 and a molecular formula of c8h13o4 mass accuracy 5 2 ppm could be proposed characteristic fragments in the ms2 spectrum were m z 129 0924 δ44 c7h13o2 2 3 ppm formed via co2 cleavage and 83 0863 δ90 c6h11 3 6 ppm formed via co2 and an additional ch2o2 cleavage respectively the proposed chemical structure fig 3 was confirmed via the comparison with an authentic reference standard 2 isobutylsuccinic acid isa therefore isa was most likely formed via an oxidative deamination of the primary amine resulting in a carboxylic acid in contact with wss b pgb was transformed to isa to up to 10 of the initial molar concentration si fig 2 a and b the concentration of isa showed an abrupt increase in phase p2 of all replicates the oxidative deamination of primary amines is a biological transformation reaction being reported for a few compounds like the structurally related gabapentin henning et al 2018 and primaquine gulde et al 2016 gulde et al 2016 showed in a systematic study investigating the transformation of various compounds with amine moieties that oxidative dealkylation of amines also called oxidative deamination in case of primary amines is a typical transformation reaction but primary amines seemed to be less accessible compared to secondary and tertiary amines interestingly isa was also observed in incubation experiments with pgb lactam as initial substance as it increased to up to 2 of the initial pgb lactam concentration in incubations with wss a and wss b si fig 2 c and d this indicates that pgb lactam is hydrolysed back to pgb followed by the oxidative deamination forming isa however pgb was only detected at very low amounts 0 1 in phase p1 of experiments with pgb lactam as initial substance a plausible explanation is that the oxidative deamination of pgb to isa proceeded at a considerably higher rate than the amide hydrolysis causing no relevant accumulation of pgb in the experiments with pgb lactam as initial substance isa was completely removed within the ongoing incubation and was therefore not stable in water sediment systems intensities of tp 172 and tp190 increased very quickly in phase p2 of incubation experiments with pgb as initial substance which is why they were suggested to be follow up tps of isa this was supported by the proposed chemical structures of tp 172 and tp 190 as it is demonstrated in the following tp 172 was detected with a m z of 171 0670 and a molecular formula of c8h11o4 4 1 ppm could be proposed it might be formed via the oxidation of isa leading to a double bond loss of two hydrogen atoms however characteristic fragments like m z 127 0765 δ44 c7h11o2 0 4 ppm and 83 0867 δ88 c6h11 1 0 ppm representing one and two fold cleavage of carbon dioxide from the carboxylic acid groups did not allow for determining the position of the double bond tp 190 was detected with a mean m z of 189 0773 esi and revealed 3 peaks tp 190 i iii in the extracted ion chromatogram due to the detected exact mass a molecular formula of c8h13o5 2 8 ppm could be proposed which indicates that tp 190 is formed from isa via the introduction of an oxygen atom hydroxylation characteristic fragments observed in the ms2 spectra of all isobaric tps were m z 171 0669 δ18 c8h11o4 3 3 ppm representing the loss of water from the hydroxyl group and m z 127 0771 δ62 c7h11o2 5 0 ppm formed via the additional cleavage of co2 from the carboxylic groups however the exact position of the introduced hydroxyl group within the chemical structure could not be determined with the available ms2 spectra both tp 172 and tp 190 did not reveal a quantitative relevance within the degradation of pgb in contact with water sediment systems comparing the peak areas of isa with tp 190 and tp 172 in experiments with pgb lactam as initial substance tp 190 or tp 172 were not observed which might be due to concentrations below the detection limit fig 1 and si fig 2 3 1 3 tp 157 a and tp 157 b further transformation of pgb occurred via the cleavage of two hydrogen atoms tp 157 a the introduction of an oxygen atom tp 175 for structural elucidation see si and a combination of both tp 173 a for structural elucidation see si the extracted ion chromatogram xic of tp 173 and tp 157 revealed 3 and 5 peaks of isobaric compounds indicated by roman numerals respectively these isobaric compounds consist either of a pgb backbone a or a pgb lactam backbone γ lactam ring structure b in combination with further modifications within the proposed molecular formula for chemical structures see fig 3 the specific ms2 fragmentation pattern as well as their presence or absence in experiments with pgb or pgb lactam as initial substances were used to differentiate between tps with a pgb or pgb lactam backbone this procedure is explained in more detail for tp 157 a and tp 157 b in the following tp 157 was detected in positive ionization mode at a mean m z of 158 1170 and a molecular formula of c8h16no2 3 5 ppm could be proposed thus the chemical structure could consist of pgb less two hydrogen atoms or pgb lactam with an additional oxygen atom while tp 157 b i and ii were formed in experiments with both pgb and pgb lactam as initial substance tp 157 a i iii were only formed with pgb as initial substance the isomeric structure of 4 5 dehydro pregabalin was available as an authentic reference standard and therefore identified as tp 157 a ii via the specific ms2 fragmentation pattern and retention time comparing the ms2 spectra of the tp 157 isomers with the authentic reference standard 4 5 dehydro pregabalin tp 157 a ii many common fragments were observed for tp 157 a i and iii these were for example a m z of 141 0906 δ17 c8h13o2 2 8 ppm representing the loss of nh3 and m z 81 0695 δ77 c6h9 4 9 ppm formed by an additional c2h4o2 cleavage for further common fragments see si this led to the presumption that tp 157 a i and iii are also isomers of the dehydrogenated pgb the ms2 fragmentation patterns supported this presumption but the exact positions of the double bonds could not be determined tp 157 a i iii was not detected in experiments with pgb lactam as initial substance this might be explained by the negligible formation of pgb of less than 1 of the initial pgb lactam concentration fig 1 fundamental differences in the ms2 spectra were found by comparing 4 5 dehydro pregabalin tp 157 a ii and tp 157 b for details see si here the detection of fragment m z 84 0441 δ74 c4h6no 3 6 ppm representing the loss of c4h10o clearly indicated a pgb lactam backbone moreover the predominant fragment m z 140 1063 δ18 c8h14no 5 0 ppm was formed via the cleavage of water which occurs with alcohol moieties at alkyl chains hesse et al 2012 furthermore tp 157 b i and ii were detected in experiments with both pgb and pgb lactam as initial substance fig 1 thus tp 157 b i and ii were formed from pgb lactam which was formed from pgb in experiments with pgb as initial substance therefore tp 157 b i and ii were proposed to consist of hydroxylated pgb lactam whereby the exact position of the hydroxyl group could not be determined 3 1 4 side reactions further reactions observed were conjugations at the primary amine like the n acetylation forming na pgb tp 201 or acetate conjugation forming tp 217 fig 3 na pgb was detected at a m z of 200 1299 in negative ionization mode and at a m z of 202 144 in positive ionization mode molecular formulas of c10h18no3 3 5 ppm and c10h20no3 1 0 ppm could be proposed from negative and positive ionization measurements respectively besides others one characteristic fragment detected in the negative ms2 spectrum was formed via the loss of the amine conjugate δc2h2o resulting in a m z of 158 1192 representing a molecular formula of c8h16no2 δ42 3 2 ppm for more details see si tp 217 was detected at a m z of 216 1246 in esi and 218 1377 in esi mode respectively and a molecular formula of c10h18no4 2 5 ppm for esi and c10h20no4 4 5 ppm for esi could be proposed in negative ionization mode characteristic fragmentation reactions showed for example the loss of c2h3no2 forming a fragment of m z 143 1077 δ73 c8h15o2 0 3 ppm for details see the si however these tps were not quantitatively relevant since their peak areas reached less than 0 1 of the initial pgb peak area fig 1 moreover the conjugation of pgb with acetyl and acetate appeared to be only side reactions within the overall removal mechanism 3 2 proposed overall transformation pathway of pgb incubated at elevated concentrations in aerobic active water sediment systems according to the tp time courses during the incubation of elevated concentrations of pgb or pgb lactam as well as considering their chemical structures identified tps could be subdivided into tps either formed in phase p1 or phase p2 tps generated in phase p1 are formed by amidation hydroxylation oxidation and n conjugations all reactions include an amide or amine functional group tps formed within the lag phase phase p1 were fully or almost completely degraded very fast during phase p2 while several other intermediate tps isa tp 172 tp 190 were formed within a short incubation time of 3 to 5 d after the lag phase tps solely formed in phase p2 were initially generated via oxidative deamination of the primary amine of pgb forming isa and further hydroxylation tp 190 or oxidation tp 172 and therefore do not include any nitrogen containing functional group this demonstrates that pgb incubated at elevated concentrations and its intermediate tps e g pgb lactam na pgb formed in phase p1 are all most likely finally further transformed by the oxidative deamination isa was also rapidly further degraded within the incubation of both pgb and pgb lactam even though isa belongs to the group of 3 branched alkanoic acids which is generally known to be less biodegradable than 2 branched alkanoic acids lau et al 1980 due to the hindered beta oxidation it might be degraded by alternative mechanisms given by lau et al 1980 however lau et al 1980 reported three alternative mechanisms for the microbial degradation of the 3 branched alkanoic acid 3 methylvaleric acid 3 mva with three bacterial strains two of these strains originated from activated sludge and were capable of metabolizing 3 mva either via alpha oxidation or omega oxidation under the involvement of coenzyme a lau et al 1980 consequently also isa could be degraded to smaller c2 c1 units and or co2 moreover the total dissolved organic carbon doc in the supernatant showed a decrease of the doc parallel to the disappearance of the initially spiked substances pgb and pgb lactam down to the doc concentration level of non spiked replicates si fig 2 c and d and si fig 3 c and d this strongly suggests that a further transformation of isa tp 190 and tp 172 finally led to an almost complete mineralization or uptake into the biomass rather than to the formation of stable tps which have not been amenable to the analytical method in contrast sorption processes as an alternative explanation can be considered rather unlikely due to the relatively high polarity of pgb and their tps 3 3 degradation and transformation of pgb incubated at low concentrations incubation experiments with low initial pgb concentrations 50 µg l 1 were conducted to determine degradation kinetics under various conditions a complete removal of pgb 98 of initial pgb concentration was observed under aerobic active conditions within 14 to 25 d in contact with wss a and b respectively fig 2 a and b in abiotic autoclaved control experiments pgb was not significantly removed over an incubation time of 58 d fig 2 a and b furthermore no significant decrease in pgb concentration was observed in anaerobic experiments within 28 d active and abiotic exp 1 5 and 1 6 fig 2 c these findings were in good agreement with observations made by burke et al 2018 showing no degradability of pgb in suboxic and anoxic zones of sediment cores from a bank filtration site due to the high polarity of pgb log koc 1 6 reported by boulard et al 2020 sorption is expected to play a minor role as elimination mechanism in conclusion the decrease of pgb concentration in aerobic active lab scale incubations at low spike concentrations was most likely mediated by biotransformation processes elimination of pgb can be described by zero order kinetics kbiol during the first 14 d of incubation kbiol wss a 4 0 0 2 µg l 1 d 1 kbiol wss b 2 8 0 8 µg l 1 d 1 due to a linear decrease in pgb concentrations r² 0 9 0 1 for more details on the calculation of kinetics see si in comparison to observations at high spike concentrations a lag phase was not observed indicating no considerable adaption of the microbial community at low spike concentration half lives of pgb dt50 pgb revealed to be similar in contact with both sediments wss a 8 0 1 d and wss b 10 2 6 d fig 2 a and b however a complete removal of pgb was achieved faster in contact with wss a comparing to wss b due to a flattening decrease of pgb concentration in experiments with wss b the half lives of pgb and the structurally related anticonvulsant gabapentin gbp were in the same range dt50 gbp in wss a 2 d and in wss b 7 d but gbp showed a four times lower dt50 in contact with wss a compared to pgb henning et al 2018 during the incubation of low concentrations of pgb in aerobic active water sediment systems only the formation of pgb lactam was detected furthermore pgb lactam was not detected in any of the autoclaved or anaerobic setups low spike concentrations fig 2 a c being most likely formed by aerobic biological processes experiments conducted in contact with wss b revealed a four times higher formation of pgb lactam formed up to 33 of the initial pgb concentration compared to wss a up to 8 this indicated that a faster degradation of pgb occurred with a lower formation of pgb lactam wss a while a slower degradation of pgb resulted in higher amounts of pgb lactam wss b interestingly similar observations were made for gbp and its major tp gbp lactam henning et al 2018 here gbp lactam was formed up to 2 of the initial gbp concentration in contact with wss a and up to 18 in contact with wss b experiments with pgb and gbp did not run in parallel lower amounts of lactam tps detected in wss a compared to wss b might be explained by a faster degradation of pgb and gbp via alternative reactions in case of pgb oxidative deamination oxidation dehydrogenation and conjugation or a fast transformation of the lactam tps as already discussed above the latter option was unlikely as incubation experiments with pgb lactam as initial compound low concentrations revealed three times higher half lives of initially spiked pgb lactam dt50 wss b 26 6 d dt50 wss a 25 5 d compared to pgb wss a 8 0 1 d and wss b 10 3 d fig 2 d f therefore also at low concentrations the biological tp pgb lactam is more stable in water sediment systems compared to its parent compound pgb the same observations have been made for gbp and its major tp gbp lactam here gbp lactam was removed six times slower from the water phase comparing incubation experiments with wss a henning et al 2018 neither in anaerobic batches nor in inactivated controls spiked with low pgb lactam concentrations pgb lactam was removed significantly from the water phase fig 2 d f furthermore a log koc of 1 8 of the structurally related gbp lactam which is insignificantly higher compared to gbp log koc 1 7 and pgb log koc 1 6 boulard et al 2020 indicates that sorption might be of minor importance within the removal of pgb lactam thus the degradation of pgb lactam is most likely linked to aerobic transformation processes despite the observations made in experiments with elevated pgb concentrations isa was not detected in incubations of low pgb concentrations in water sediment systems but in experiments conducted only with surface water experiment 1 3 see si here isa was formed up to 1 while pgb lactam reached 2 of the initially spiked pgb concentration furthermore incubations with surface water ws a experiments 1 3 2 3 and 3 1 data not shown here see si for details spiked separately with 50 µg l 1 of pgb pgb lactam and isa revealed that isa was the least stable compared to pgb and pgb lactam being completely removed within 7 d of incubation time complete removal of pgb within 30 d while pgb lactam was the most stable no decrease within 30 d of incubation therefore it is likely that isa is immediately further transformed which would not result in a detectable accumulation when pgb or pgb lactam are incubated at low spike concentrations in water sediment experiments in conclusion the oxidative deamination is proposed to represent the main degradation mechanism of pgb incubated in water sediment systems at aerobic active conditions which most likely leads to mineralization and or uptake into the biomass except for the n acetate conjugation all transformation reactions found for pgb were also observed in experiments with gbp these included i amidation amide hydrolysis ii hydroxylation iii oxidation iv n acetylation and v oxidative deamination the most relevant stable tp formed from pgb and gbp spiked at environmental concentrations turned out to be the γ lactam formed via amidation therefore the transformation behaviour of gbp could be extrapolated to the structurally related compound pgb furthermore for both compounds the oxidative deamination 1 carboxycyclohexane acetic acid ccha and isa was only observed in water sediment incubations spiked with elevated concentrations tps formed from pgb fit quite well the prior reported tps from gbp fig 3 in contrast the reverse reaction of the amidation amide hydrolysis from pgb lactam to pgb was not observed while gbp was formed by 18 from gbp lactam in contact with wss b under aerobic active conditions referring to the above discussion a reverse reaction of pgb lactam to pgb was most likely not detected due to a very fast further transformation of pgb via oxidative deamination 3 4 occurrence of pgb gbp and their biological tps in the environment 3 4 1 wwtp in order to investigate the discharge of pgb gbp and its biological tps into aquatic systems and their behaviour during wastewater treatment corresponding 72 h composite samples were taken from 6 german wwtps influents and effluents and analysed via lc ms ms according to prescription numbers gbp was detected at 3 times higher mean concentrations in wwtp influents compared to pgb reaching 10 4 µg l 1 and 3 1 µg l 1 respectively table 2 furthermore all analysed tps pgb lactam na pgb isa gbp lactam na gbp and ccha were already detected in influents assuming biological transformation processes to occur in the sewer systems none of the tps have been observed as human metabolites in urine or faeces as gbp is excreted completely unmetabolized and pgb shows less than 1 of n methyl pgb in urine bockbrader et al 2010 chew et al 2014 corrigan et al 2001 gallimore and gidal 2010 mclean 1994 vollmer et al 1986 during conventional biological wastewater treatment with denitrification and nitrification pgb and gbp showed mean removals of 89 6 and 46 19 respectively hence the data indicates that gbp is about 2 times more stable in wwtps and therefore discharged at 12 fold higher mean concentrations in comparison to pgb table 2 a higher stability of gbp was not observed in the water sediment degradation experiments of this study and in henning et al 2018 but is in good agreement with former studies investigating the removal of pharmaceuticals in wwtps gurke et al 2015a hermes et al 2018 nevertheless during wastewater treatment pgb lactam and gbp lactam were identified as the major tps formed from pgb and gbp as it was already observed in water sediment incubation experiments henning et al 2018 pgb lactam was formed by 19 18 and gbp lactam by 42 23 table 2 in case of isa and ccha the concentrations decreased within the wastewater treatment and were not detected above the loq in wwtp effluents while na pgb was detected at very low median concentrations in wwtp influents and effluents 0 012 and 0 005 µg l 1 respectively and no formation could be observed the concentration of na gbp was detected at a much higher median concentrations which considerably increased during biological wastewater treatment from 0 3 µg l 1 in the influents to 0 7 µg l 1 in the effluents hence na gbp can also be considered as a major tp from gbp in wwtps in contrast to water sediment incubation experiments where na gbp was not observed at a low initial gbp concentration henning et al 2018 thus na gbp is discharged at similar median concentrations as gbp lactam 1 1 µg l 1 into receiving waters table 2 although it should be mentioned that the recovery in wastewater influent matrix determined with standard addition was 149 55 for na gbp see si therefore concentrations should be considered with caution for both pgb and gbp the mass balances were not closed for the investigated wwtps as the formation of tps could only explain about 19 18 and 57 23 respectively of the removal of their parent compounds table 2 this was also observed in degradation experiments with water sediment systems as already hypothesized from incubations in water sediment systems the alternate transformation pathway of gbp and pgb might also be via the oxidative deamination in wwtps which at least was observed to occur in the sewer system as isa and ccha were present in influents a fast degradation of the primary tps of the oxidative deamination isa and ccha similar to water sediment incubation might be the reason why these tps could not be detected above the loq in the effluents thus the gab in mass balance might be explained by a further degradation mineralization or uptake into biomass of all tps as it was observed that they are not recalcitrant to biological degradation 3 4 2 stream usa in order to investigate the transformation behaviour of pgb and gbp along a river stretch a sampling campaign was carried out at the small stream usa in hessen germany data see si over a period of 7 days corresponding 24 h composite samples were taken at two sampling sites a and b in a distance of 9 km to evaluate the degradation formation of the analytes along the river stretch a compensation for dilution processes was needed this was carried out in correspondence to henning et al 2018 and kunkel and radke 2012 by normalizing the analytes concentrations by the concentrations of cbz detected at the two sampling points see fig 26 in the si which is known to be stable in natural systems löffler et al 2005 the decrease of cbz between a and b was therefore attributed to dilution processes thereby the degradation of pgb and gbp along the river stretch was observed to be in the same range of about 17 and 18 respectively between sampling site a and b data see si in contrast no considerable change in the lactam tps concentration was observed as the cbz normalized removal of pgb lactam and gbp lactam was only 10 and 2 respectively this is in a good agreement with the degradation experiments conducted in water sediment systems as the parent compounds were observed to be less stable compared to the lactam tps henning et al 2018 in contrast further detected tps na pgb na gbp and ccha were observed to be removed more efficiently by 31 21 and 26 it can be concluded that the degradation of gbp and pgb was relatively low 20 and no tp formation was observed along the investigated 9 km river stretch thus the occurrence of gbp and pgb tps in surface waters is most likely mainly caused by their discharge from wwtps rather than from their formation in rivers and streams 3 4 3 spatial distribution in the rhine and selected tributaries to give an overview about the spatial distribution of the occurrence of pgb gbp and their lactam tps in the river rhine and its selected tributaries 21 grab samples were taken and analysed via lc ms ms for data see si here concentrations of pgb and gbp ranged from 5 to 500 ng l 1 and 50 to 5 000 ng l 1 respectively see si thus gbp reached up to 7 times higher median concentrations 190 ng l 1 compared to pgb 30 ng l 1 which can be explained by a higher consumption of gbp schwabe et al 2019 its higher stability in wwtps and therefore higher discharge into receiving waters furthermore the concentrations of the main biological tps pgb lactam and gbp lactam reached median concentrations of 20 ng l 1 and 30 ng l 1 respectively data see si the data reveal that along the river stretch high amounts of all analytes are mainly introduced from tributaries and locations with high industrial activities or population density or both such as schwarzbach main and emscher the mean ratio between the parent compounds and the lactam tps is 1 4 0 7 for pgb n 17 and 6 0 2 3 for gbp n 21 this is comparable to the ratios in the wwtp effluents 0 9 0 6 pgb pgb lactam ratio 4 1 2 5 gbp gbp lactam ratio and further supports that gbp pgb and their lactam tps are not considerably affected by degradation transformation processes in surface waters 3 4 4 temporal fluctuation in the river rhine the analysis of 28 24h composite samples of the river rhine at koblenz from february 2019 gives an overview about the fluctuation of the concentrations of the compounds over a period of one month fig 4 a b gbp was detected at higher median concentrations 28 ng l 1 compared to pgb which reached a median of 5 ng l 1 for calculation values loq were substituted with ½ loq in contrast to gbp which was detected in every sample pgb was found only in 9 out of 28 samples due to rather low concentrations of pgb close to the limit of quantification loq 10 ng l 1 fig 4 a which is why the median is below the loq both parent compounds show a parallel fluctuation over time which does not correlate with concentrations of the wastewater indicator substance cbz fig 4 a and b na pgb and isa were not found in the samples but pgb lactam was detected in all analysed samples at a slightly higher median of 27 ng l 1 compared to its parent compound pgb interestingly concentrations of pgb lactam were not fluctuating over the investigated period the same was observed for gbp lactam which was detected at a median of 35 ng l 1 this might be explained by the discharges of pharmaceutical companies na gbp was detected at a similar median 22 ng l 1 compared to gbp lactam this did not fit the results observed in water sediment degradation experiments with gbp as na gbp was not detected within incubation experiments with low gbp spike concentrations henning et al 2018 but can be explained by the concentrations discharged by wwtps table 2 neither isa nor ccha were observed in any sample which is in good accordance with results gained from water sediment degradation experiments at low spike concentrations conducted in this study and in henning et al 2018 and also with data from wwtps 3 4 5 bank filtrates and drinking water moreover the analysis of samples from german bank filtrates n 10 and drinking water n 6 data see table 3 and table 4 revealed the sporadic occurrence of pgb 3 10 and 1 6 in bank filtrates and drinking water respectively and its two tps pgb lactam 9 10 and 3 6 and na pgb 2 10 and 0 10 in the low ng l 1 range while isa was not observed in any of the samples gbp and all of its analysed tps gbp lactam na gbp and ccha showed positive results in both bank filtrates and drinking water respectively thus several tps from pgb and gbp can reach drinking waters or be formed during bank filtration processes while concentrations of tps from gbp are slightly higher in bank filtrates and drinking water compared to tps from pgb nevertheless gbp and its biological tps gbp lactam and na gbp are quite stable in wwtps and need further improvement of treatment technologies in order to reduce discharge into receiving waters and transport into drinking water therefore in 2015 the german environment agency uba published health related orientation values for gbp and gbp lactam at 1 0 µg l 1 umweltbundesamt 2020 which were not exceeded in the here investigated samples of drinking water or bank filtrate 4 conclusions conducted lab scale degradation experiments in water sediment systems spiked with pgb under varied redox conditions resulted in the following conclusions like it was previously determined for gbp also pgb is stable under abiotic and anaerobic conditions but degradable under aerobic active conditions thus transformation reactions are most likely driven by aerobic microorganisms present in the sediment elucidation of tps revealed that the knowledge from the gbp transformation pathway can be extrapolated to the transformation pathway of the structurally related pgb monitoring data confirmed that pgb and gbp and some of their biological tps are ubiquitously present in the aquatic environment therefore we recommend to implement at least the lactam tps and na gbp in monitoring programs and to investigate their ecotoxicological effects to evaluate their potential environmental impact with regard to the increasing relevance of pgb further studies with radiolabelled pgb and pgb lactam in lab scale experiments could reveal whether mineralization or uptake into biomass is the driving degradation mechanism supplementary material

16726,compared with anaerobic pressure sewers gravity sewers have much more complex operational conditions such as anaerobic aerobic spatial variations along variable structures of the pipe network this greatly complicates the prediction of sulfide generation from spatially heterogeneous sewer sediments this study proposes a novel quantitative approach for rapidly estimating the sulfide generation flux by understanding the sulfidogenic conversion under complex sewer conditions significant anaerobic aerobic spatial variations were the most critical factor affecting the sulfide production in residential gravity sewers the dynamic aeration related process stimulated the growth of sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob in the surface zone while the sulfidogenic and methanogenic zone moved into deeper layers a detailed mechanism model incorporating dynamic alternative anaerobic aerobic transformation was developed to predict apparent sulfide production as well as the microscale spatial profiles of chemicals and microbial communities in sediments the model was evaluated to establish a rapid quantitative approach that only depended on a few key parameters e g flow velocity pipe diameter slope mean hydraulic depth and sulfate concentration which can provide an important basis for estimating different sulfide generation fluxes under various sewer factors the identification of sulfide generation hotspots will greatly help determine how to economically control sulfide generation by chemical dosing or pipe structural modification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gravity sewer sediment dynamic sulfide flux model prediction quantification 1 introduction hydrogen sulfide produced in sewers by sulfate reducing bacteria srb is highly undesirable due to its odor and toxicity and because it also results in serious sewer pipe corrosion that requires costly rehabilitation pikaar et al 2014 over the years extensive studies in the field of sulfide prediction and control have focused on anaerobic sewer biofilms particularly those in pressure sewers ganigue et al 2011 however more than 95 of sewers are gravity systems xu et al 2018 in which deposited sediments have greater sulfide production potentials liu et al 2015a schmitt and seyfried 1992 which results in gaseous hydrogen sulfide concentrations up to hundreds of ppm zuo et al 2019 compared with pressure mains gravity sewer networks present much more complicated operating conditions one significant difference is that gravity sewers operate in a partially filled manner which causes reaeration a process that has multiple effects on carbon sulfur cycles in sewers yongsiri et al 2003 this process is subject to complex influences by many sewer factors such as flow velocity sewer slope hydraulic depth drop structure and so on jensen 1995 guo et al 2018 due to these highly spatially heterogeneous sewer factors the quantitative evaluation of sulfide generation flux is very challenging over the years many empirical models carrera et al 2017 such as the wastewater aerobic anaerobic transformations in sewers wats model yongsiri et al 2003 or sewex model sharma et al 2008a 2008b have been developed to simulate in sewer biological reactions these empirical models use organic matter and sulfate as predictive variables but do not focus on differences in in sediment biochemical conversion or microbial growth this probably produces unreliable predictions of sulfide generation in heterogeneous sewer sediments because sulfur related microbial characteristics under dynamic sewer factors are significantly different dong et al 2017 therefore understanding the spatial heterogeneity within sewer sediments is critical for establishing an effective sulfide prediction method recent studies have revealed that sewer sediments exhibit different stratified microbial structures and sulfidogenic activity along their depth due to diffusion limits of chemical liu et al 2015a this spatial heterogeneity of sediments changes depending on the sewer conditions for example sulfides are mainly produced in the surface layer of sediments under anaerobic conditions but the sulfide producing zone migrates to the deeper layers in the presence of abundant nitrate or ferric ions in the overlying water cao et al 2019 liu et al 2015b our previous study showed that decreasing the shear velocity reduced the sulfidogenic activity in the surface layer of sediments by increasing the diffusion boundary layer dbl thickness zuo et al 2021 based on these insights into biochemical processes in sediments models have evolved from empirical models to detailed mechanism models jiang et al 2009 liu et al 2015a sun et al 2018 these advanced models provide better microscale descriptions of chemical conversion and microbial growth within anaerobic sediments thus providing deeper insights into anaerobic sewers a major drawback however is that few studies have explored differences in the microscale biochemical conversions in spatially heterogeneous gravity sewers with widespread anaerobic and aerobic alternation the lack of a mechanism also restricts the establishment of a mechanism model making it difficult to determine dynamic sulfide generation flux under complex gravity sewer factors this study proposes a new prediction approach for the rapid quantification of sulfide generation flux from spatially heterogeneous gravity sediments a systematic research methodology was adopted in this study fig 1 field trials were firstly conducted to determine the critical factors affecting sulfide spatial variations in gravity sewers based on field results lab scale experiment and analysis assays were performed using a variety of in situ measurement techniques to understand the chemical conversion and microbial communities within sediments then a sediment model was developed to describe the growth of srb methanogenic archaea ma sulfide oxidating bacteria sob and other heterotrophic microorganisms under anaerobic aerobic sewer conditions based on the model evaluation a rapid quantitative equation was developed for estimating dynamic sulfide generation fluxes in complex sewer networks to provide more economical and effective control of sulfides 2 materials and methods 2 1 field trials to investigate dynamic sulfide generation from sewer sediments in the study a field survey was conducted first to reveal spatial sulfide variations in a typical residential sewer network located in yixing city jiangsu province china fig 2 shows the information of the studied sewer trunk the main drainage pipe gm1 to gm2 receives domestic wastewater from nearby residences gm1 and gm2 are two manholes along the main drainage pipe a residential area connected with gm2 was taken as the main experimental site the residential main sewer pipe is about 300 m long and has a diameter of 300 400 mm rm1 rm5 are the five manholes along the residential main sewer pipe the average depth of these manholes is approx 3 m the wastewater flow velocity is 0 0 1 m s in the upstream pipes rm1 rm3 and 0 1 0 3 m s in the downstream pipes rm3 rm5 respectively a total of 8 lateral pipes are connected to the residential main pipe these lateral pipes have a diameter of 200 mm with an average depth of 1 m each lateral pipe receives the wastewater with an average daily flow of about 30 m3 d from buildings the wastewater flow velocity in these pipes is 0 0 1 m s the water level in all sewer pipes is low 50 mm so the walls of the pipes are almost free of biofilms rm4a and rm4b are the two manholes along the lateral pipe connected to rm4 and rm5a is the manhole along the lateral pipe connected to rm5 the lateral pipe connected to rm5 receives a mixture of restaurant wastewater and domestic wastewater the characteristics of sewage and sediment in gravity sewers were described in the supplementary information text s1 the experiment procedure included three tests as summarized in table 1 in test i a total of 10 sampling points gm1 gm2 rm1 rm2 rm3 rm4 rm5 rm4a rm4b and rm5a in the field trial were selected for wastewater quality measurements sampling was carried out in dry weather at an ambient temperature of 30 3 c june specifically two 100 ml wastewater samples were collected from each manhole using a field sewage sampler si 1 jihpump china fig s1 in supplementary information one of the two samples was immediately filtered through a 0 45 μ filter membrane after being extracted from the sewer then 5 ml of sodium hydroxide 4 solution and 5 ml of zinc acetate sodium 4 solution were added to this sample to prevent the oxidization and volatilization of sulfides the other sample was measured in terms of its chemical oxidation demand cod sulfate ammonium and total phosphorus before these samples were transported to the laboratory they were placed in a box filled with ice to prevent changes in water quality wastewater dissolved oxygen do and flow velocity at these sampling points were in situ monitored and recorded using a do meter wtw ph oxi340i and a flow meter yd ii china respectively fig s2 in the supplementary information moreover the sediment in five manholes rm1 rm2 rm3 rm4a and rm4b was collected using a shovel and then transported to the laboratory to determine the sulfide production activity of sediments test ii the detailed method is shown in text s2 in the supplementary information to further explore the sulfide production distribution within the field sediments a new in situ measurement technique namely diffusive gradients in thin films dgt was applied in the field sewer sediment test iii it has been reported that the dgt technique can accurately determine the sulfide production in sediments ding et al 2012 sun et al 2016 before dgt probes were transported to the sampling site they were deoxygenated with nitrogen and placed in sealed bags prior to deploying the dgt probe cotton wool was attached to the back of the dgt probe as a marking tool for accurately identifying the sediment water interface the dgt probe was inserted into the sediments of four sewer manholes rm2 rm3 rm4a and rm4b the probe was retrieved after 1 h and brought to the laboratory for further analysis as further described in section 2 3 2 2 lab scale tests to determine the substrate and microbe profiles within sediments to gain insight into the anaerobic aerobic sediments two sewer sediment systems were operated to mimic anaerobic conditions 0 mg o2 l and aerobic conditions 2 4 mg o2 l the details of system operation and monitoring e g sulfide effluent concentration and maximum sulfide production rate are shown in fig s3 and text s3 in the supplementary information after these two sediment systems were operated for 60 days spatial variations in the sulfide production activity do sulfate cod concentrations and microbial communities in sediments were investigated synchronously as follows dgt technique to determine sulfide production distribution in sediment the dgt technique was used for in situ measurements of the 2d sulfide flux in sediment the dgt probes were inserted vertically into the sediment the sediment water interface was labeled using a ceramic knife after 1 h the dgt probes were taken out and the binding gel was removed and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water before drying its surface with filter paper planar optode po technique to monitor the permeation of do from overlying water to sediment the two dimensional distribution

film 20 mm 60 mm of do was vertically inserted into the sediments from two systems and attached to the inner wall of the systems the side coated with fluorescent dye on the fluorescent film must face the deposit so that oxygen can react with the fluorescent film a ccd camera ft u31 200 fortune technology co ltd china and excitation light source were fixed at 300 mm from the system with a camera exposure time of 2500 ms and a gain of 2 all photos were collected in the dark at night high resolution dialysis technique to obtain pore water in sediment high resolution dialysis hr peeper was used to obtain the pore water in the sediments for subsequent analysis of the sulfate and cod concentrations hr peeper probes were prepared according to xu et al 2012 hr peeper was purged under nitrogen before deployment and then the hr peeper probes were inserted into the sediments and maintained for 48 h after removal the hr peeper probes were cleaned sequentially with wet filter paper and deionized water a plastic membrane was placed on the filter membrane surface of the probe to prevent oxidation of the porewater a 0 4 ml porewater sample was collected from each chamber to measure the sulfate and cod concentrations sludge sampling along the sediment depth for microbial analysis sludge samples in the two systems were obtained with 10 ml cutoff plastic syringes at depths of 0 1 1 2 2 3 5 and 3 5 5 cm below the sediment surface using the method described by hoehler et al 1994 the sludge samples were stored at 20 c for further microbial analysis 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1 chemical

technology co ltd shanghai china using novaseq reagent kits hiseq x reagent kits for the detailed high throughput sequencing methods see the text s5 in the supplementary information 2 4 mathematical modeling a one dimensional 1d sediment biochemical model with multispecies was established to describe the chemical conversion and associated microbial growth in sewer sediment the schematic representation of the biochemical processes included in the model is illustrated in fig 3 the model contains seven reactants i e sulfate sso4 sulfide sh2s slow biodegradable cod xcod fermentable cod sfcod vfa svfa methane sch4 oxygen so2 and five biomass groups i e heterotrophic biomass xb fermentation bacteria xf srb xsrb sob xsob and ma xma monod based equations were applied to describe the enzymatic reactions for heterotrophic biomass fermentation bacteria srb and ma to describe sob growth a first order type with respect to the sulfide concentration and the monod type with respect to the do concentration were used as reported by wilmot et al 1988 a chemical process i e sulfide chemical oxidation chen and morris 1972 is also contained in this model to reduce computational demands and improve the application efficiency of the model the model was simplified as follows it does not distinguish between microbes that use different types of organic matter e g propionate based srb acetate based srb and hydrogenotrophic srb instead srb using vfa as the substrate was considered as the only sulfidogenesis the same assumption applied to other microbes the detailed stoichiometric matrix kinetic expressions and model parameters are given in tables s1 s3 in the supplementary information the sediment matrix was modeled by dividing its thickness from the substratum to the surface into 50 layers the biochemical conversion within each layer and mass transfer between two layers were modeled according to a one dimensional conservation law described by wanner and reichert 1996 our previous study showed the effect of shear velocity on the thickness of the diffusion boundary layer dbl on the sediment zuo et al 2021 which was also considered in this model after the model was implemented in aquasim software wanner and morgenroth 2004 it was used to simulate the sulfide production rate of sediment as well as the vertical profiles of chemicals i e sulfate cod and do and microbial distribution i e srb ma and sob in sediments key parameters were re determined by comparing them with the experimentally measured results afterward the verified model was used to determine the effects of reaeration on the sulfide production flux g s m 2 d 1 in sewers to this end in the model simulation the reaeration coefficient klao2 ranged from 0 to 50 d 1 with an increment of 0 5 d 1 in each step this simulation was carried out at different sulfate concentrations 10 20 30 40 50 mg so4 2 s l and dbl thicknesses 0 0002 0 0004 0 0006 0 0008 0 001 m 3 results 3 1 characteristics of sulfide generation and transport in gravity sewers this section outlines the results of a field survey in a typical gravity drainage system of a residential area as summarized in figs 4 and s4 s5 in supplementary information preliminary test results showed a marked variation in the sulfide concentration along residential sewers fig 4 a the wastewater in the residential lateral pipes e g rm4a rm4b and rm5a contained negligible sulfide with an average concentration of 0 68 0 1 mg s l after the wastewater entered the residential main pipe rm1 to rm5 the sulfide concentration rapidly increased and reached a maximum at rm2 i e 3 95 0 9 mg s l before gradually decreasing along the rm2 rm5 pipeline fig 4 a the large spatial variation of sulfide may be explained by do variations along the pipe r2 0 78 fig s4 when wastewater flowed along the rm1 rm2 pipeline the do rapidly decreased from 1 86 to 0 1 mg s l creating an anaerobic environment for sulfide formation fig 4 a however the high flow velocity and drop structures in the downstream pipes rm2 to rm5 intensified reaeration e g 4 mg o2 l at rm5 resulting in the oxidative removal of sulfide the substrate concentration i e scod and sulfate was sufficiently high in fresh wastewater obtained directly from buildings zuo et al 2019 and was expected to not limit the sulfide production by a few milligrams e g 3 95 0 9 mg s l at rm2 we also monitored the daily behavior of do and sulfide and observed that sulfide still had a temporal change at rm2 although do was 0 mg o2 l at rm2 throughout the day fig s5 in supplementary information this suggests that diurnal variation of sulfide may be more influenced by other sewer factors as our previous field investigations have shown that there is a strong relationship between sulfide diurnal dynamics and wastewater flow variations zuo et al 2019 therefore the present study emphasizes that the effect of do on sulfide is mainly reflected in spatial dynamics to further understand the activity of different sewer sediments the maximum sulfide production rate of sediments was evaluated similar sediment activities were observed between aerobic locations e g rm4a rm4b and rm1 and anaerobic locations e g rm2 and rm3 fig 4 b this finding was unexpected since oxygen was generally thought to inhibit srb activity and reduce its sulfide production rate gutierrez et al 2008 to interpret this result an innovative monitoring technique i e dgt was applied to perform a microanalysis of sulfide production within sediments ding et al 2012 as shown in fig 4 c the sulfide production flux varied greatly along the sediment depth i e from 0 0 to 2 5 g m 2 d 1 in the anaerobic manholes e g rm2 and rm3 the sulfide flux was high near the surface layer of sediment and gradually decreased with the sediment depth which is consistent with previous laboratory results liu et al 2015a zuo et al 2020a 2020b however in the aerobic manholes e g rm4a rm4b there was no significant stratification of sulfide flux within sediments this is the first in situ observation of variable sulfidogenic conversion within different sediments in real sewers 3 2 sulfidogenic conversion within anaerobic aerobic sediments to fully understand the sulfidogenic transformation within different sewer sediments this section provides more in depth laboratory experimental results by operating two laboratory scale sediment systems r1 and r2 under anaerobic and aerobic conditions respectively supplementary information text s3 3 2 1 apparent sulfide production from sediments sulfide in the effluent of the anaerobic system r1 and aerobic system r2 was monitored with average concentrations of 21 4 and 2 2 0 5 mg s l respectively fig 5 a a 90 removal of sulfide was achieved batch tests further showed that the maximum sulfide production rate of sediment was 5 7 1 5 g s m 2 d 1 in r1 which was higher than that of r2 i e 3 9 1 0 g s m 2 d 1 fig 5 b this was inconsistent with the field results which showed similar sediment activity at different sewer locations fig 4 b 3 2 2 in sediment biochemical conversion the results of this analysis obtained by in situ measurement techniques i e dgt po and hr peeper are summarized in fig 6 in the anaerobic sediment system fig 6 a the sulfide generation flux was much higher near the sediment surface 1 cm which was similar to the field results fig 4 c the sulfate vertical distribution shows that the sulfate concentration rapidly declined from 17 mg s l at the water sediment interface to 7 mg s l at a depth of 1 cm indicating the rapid conversion of sulfate into sulfide near the sediment surface 1 cm the low sulfate concentration below 1 cm average 4 6 1 5 mg s l limited the sulfidogenic activity in deep layers 1 cm compared with sulfate scod may not be a limiting factor in sulfide production because the in sediment scod concentration remained at an average value of 84 21 mg cod l the aerobic sediment system presented a significantly different sulfidogenic process from the anaerobic sediment system fig 6 b first under continuous aeration the do of the overlying water remained at 3 mg o2 l the high do concentration caused no sulfide generation flux at the sediment surface as indicated by the dgt results however a larger sulfide generation flux still appeared in the deep layer 1 1 0 1 g s m 2 d 1 below 1 cm indicating that the sediments were still undergoing sulfidogenesis even though they were exposed to oxygen this is because the oxygen concentration rapidly dropped to 0 mg o2 l when passing through the water sediment interface thus an anaerobic environment still existed in the deep layer a similar phenomenon has been reported for sewer biofilms gutierrez et al 2008 the oxygen in the overlying water can re convert the sulfide into sulfate leading to a sufficient sulfate concentration in the sediment surface 40 mg s l therefore sulfate can penetrate into the deep anaerobic zone and result in sulfide generation as mentioned in section 3 2 1 the maximum sulfide production of aerobic sediment was lower than that of anaerobic sediment fig 5 b this is because most scod was consumed in the aerobic environment leading to a low concentration in the sediment 60 mg l which limited the sulfide generation rate fig 6 b however in the field test the similar sulfide formation rate of different sediments fig 4 b was observed because residential sewers directly collect fresh wastewater containing sufficient substrates 3 2 3 in sediment microbial distribution 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing further revealed the differences in microbial community compositions within the anaerobic and aerobic sediments the α diversity estimators shannon chao and ace index and principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on unweighted unifrac i e β analysis indicated that the bacterial richness and community in the aerobic sediment surface was significantly different from those in other samples table s4 and fig s6 in the supplementary information fig 7 shows the relative abundances of srb sob and ma in the sediments in the surface layer 0 1 cm of sediment in the anaerobic sediment system r1 the relative abundances of srb and ma were similar fig 7 a along the sediment depth there was a significant increase in the relative abundance of ma while most srb disappeared due to competition between srb and ma a relatively high ratio of sulfate to cod can stimulate srb growth and inhibit ma growth in the surface layer while the lack of sulfate in the deep layer allowed methanogens to play a key role liu et al 2015a reported similar results further analysis of the distribution of srb sob and ma in the sediments of the aerobic sediment system r2 revealed that all three microorganisms underwent significant changes fig 7 b the relative abundance of srb and ma in the surface layer was very low 1 10 and 0 66 due to the presence of oxygen instead abundant sob e g thiothrix existed at the sediment surface 0 1 cm which played a key role in sulfide oxidation in the deep layer of sediments the high relative abundance of srb confirmed that sulfidogenic conversion still occurred however the abundance of ma in the deeper layer was lower due to the penetration of high concentrations of sulfate 3 3 model development and validation a 1d sediment model incorporating microbial growth was adapted to predict sulfidogenic conversion within anaerobic aerobic sediments most kinetic parameters were taken from the literature except for three parameters the maximum growth rate of srb i e μ s r b and the yield of ma and sob i e y ma and y sob by fitting maximum sulfide production rate of sediment in anaerobic reactor fig 5 b μ s r b was adjusted to 1 8 d 1 which is higher than the values 0 8 d 1 used for biofilms jiang et al 2009 because sediment had a higher potential for sulfide formation by fitting relative abundances of ma and sob along the sediment depth fig 7 both y ma and y sob were determined to be 0 1 gcod gcod all other experimental data were used for model validation by adjusting only these three parameters this model accurately predicted the datasets of 1 the sulfide effluent concentration and maximum sulfide production rate fig 5 2 vertical profiles of chemicals sulfate do cod fig 6 and 3 microbial communities i e the relative fractions of srb sob and ma fig 7 these comprehensive simulation results indicate that the developed model can reliably predict the sulfide generation process within anaerobic aerobic sediments to the best of our knowledge this is the first time the aeration process has been incorporated into a 1d biochemical diffusion sediment model 3 4 model based evaluation of sulfide generation flux under various sewer factors although the proposed mechanism model has been fully verified in the above section the complexity of the parameters and components in the model makes it impossible to predict sulfide in large scale complex sewer networks as previous stated liu et al 2015a sun et al 2018 some researchers put forward very simple empirical equations with high practicality by using mechanism models for comprehensive prediction under various conditions therefore in this study we also expect to use the present mechanism model to establish a simple equation suitable for sulfide spatial prediction in large scale partially filled gravity sewers in this section we investigate the sulfide generation fluxes under various sewer factors based on the model evaluation as can be seen from fig 8 there was a significant variation in the sulfide generation flux from 0 to 4 5 g s m 2 d 1 at different reaeration coefficients an increazed reaeration coefficient klao2 significantly reduced the sulfide generation flux notably when the reaeration coefficient reached 50 d 1 the sulfide generation flux declined to 0 g s m 2 d 1 this has important implications for sewer design and sulfide control which will be discussed later a decrease in the sulfate concentration significantly inhibited the sulfide generation flux fig 8 a which is expected since sulfate serves as the substrate for sulfide production similar changes were found when the dbl thickness was increazed fig 8 b increasing the dbl thickness from 0 0002 to 0 001 μm reduced the sulfide generation flux by 31 indicating that mass transfer resistance at water sediment interface also plays a key role however an increase in the reaeration coefficient diminished the influences of sulfate and mass transfer resistance the reaeration coefficient became the sole factor determining the sulfide production flux when it exceeded 30 d 1 the relationship between the reaeration coefficient and sulfide generation can be well described by a simple polynomial model f h2s a klao2 2 b klao2 c r 2 0 999 where f h2s is the sulfide generation flux g s m 2 d 1 a b and c values depend on the sulfate concentration and dbl thickness table s5 in the supplementary information for practical application of the developed quantitative method we propose to use this equation for two dbl thickness i e 0 0002 and 0 001 m because the dbl remains unchanged at 0 0002 m when the flow exceeds 0 07 m s which satisfies the daytime flow of most sewer pipes another common scenario is that there is almost no flow at midnight causing the dbl thickness to increase to the maximum 0 001 m therefore in addition to simulating sulfide generation flux under different klao2 and sso4 conditions when dbl is 0 0002 m as shown in fig 8 a we also conducted the same model simulation at 0 001 m thickness of dbl fig s7 in supplementary information we found that a b and c varied linearly with sulfate concentration i e a a sso4 b b sso4 and c c sso4 fig s8 in supplementary information therefore we proposed the following integrated empirical model to predict the sulfide generation flux in large scale partially filled gravity sewers 4 f h 2 s a k l a o 2 2 b k l a o 2 c s so 4 where a b and c are constant parameters in the model and have different values at two dbl thickness i e 0 0002 and 0 001 m as shown in table 2 relatively narrow confidence intervals indicate that these parameters are acceptably identifiable it should be noted that the application range of this equation is klao2 50 d 1 f h2s remains 0 g s m 2 d 1 when klao2 50 d 1 using this simple equation the sulfide generation flux under different sewer factors can be rapidly estimated 3 5 rapid quantification of sulfide generation flux in the studied field sewer in this section the proposed klao2 prediction approach was applied to provide a heat map evaluation of sulfide generation flux in the studied field sewer as shown in fig 9 the klao2 value was calculated based on a well known equation involving flow velocity slope pipe diameter and mean hydraulic depth yongsiri et al 2004 the results showed a significant spatial difference in the sulfide generation flux fig 9 the highest sulfide generation flux appeared in the pipe rm1 rm2 2 4 3 1 g s m 2 d 1 which explained the rapid increase in sulfide concentration from rm1 to rm2 observed in the field test fig 4 a klao2increazed upon increasing the downstream pipe diameter and flow velocity which decreazed the sulfide generation fluxes thus the sulfide generation flux in spatially heterogeneous gravity sewers was visualized it should be noted however that the sulfide generation flux may vary throughout a day for instance the sulfide generation flux in the pipe rm1 rm2 was quantified within the range 2 4 3 1 g s m 2 d 1 this is because differences in day night flow velocities were taken into account in the calculations there is almost no flow at midnight which will decreaze liquid gas transfer i e reduce klao2 which is conducive to the formation of sulfide however stagnant conditions significantly increazed the dbl thickness at the water sediment interface leading to a greater reduction in the sulfide generation flux as indicated by fig 8 b another point is that the continuous water drop structure downstream greatly influenced the reaeration process matias et al 2017 however this study only proposes a new quantitative approach without optimizing it for complex sewer structures which should be comprehensively considered in practice 4 discussion 4 1 sulfide generation at the residential scale of the sewer network previous researches have mainly focused on sulfide formation in anaerobic pressure sewers ganigue et al 2011 while some recent studies have also confirmed the great potential of sediments to produce sulfide in gravity sewers liu et al 2015a however most investigations on sulfide formation in sediments were conducted under virtual simple homogeneous sewer conditions and the understanding of sulfide formation in real complex gravity sewers was still lacking here we investigated a new sulfide generation hotspot i e residential gravity sewers which has been neglected in previous studies in the studied sewer the sulfide concentration reached 4 mg s l e g rm2 with a maximum sediment activity of 2 5 g s m 2 d 1 fig 4 such a high sulfide production has been demonstrated to result in significant emissions of gaseous h2s under highly turbulent conditions e g drop structures guo et al 2018 matias et al 2017 zuo et al 2019 which will produce odors that may affect nearby residents therefore there is still a great deal of work to be performed in this area in addition we have applied the novel dgt technique for the first time to real complex gravity sewers providing in situ 2d and high resolution profiles of sulfide production activities within different sediments this also implies the potential of dgt technique for the in situ analysis in real sewer systems there are several possible factors that make residential gravity sewers more susceptible to sulfide formation 1 as a starting point for the entire network residential gravity sewers collect wastewater directly from buildings so the wastewater is very fresh and contains sufficient substrate for sulfide production 2 the sewage flow velocity in residential gravity sewers is generally low so it easily forms an anaerobic zone suitable for sulfide formation 3 the low flow velocity is also more likely to lead to sediment deposition for a greater sulfide production rate our findings showed that spatial sulfide variations may be closely related to anaerobic aerobic spatial alternation in sewers fig s4 however this spatial variation is affected by many sewer factors e g slope flow velocity drop structure and so on therefore further research is needed to comprehensively evaluate the effects of complex sewer factors on anaerobic aerobic spatial changes 4 2 model improvement for spatial heterogeneous sewer sediments in partially filled gravity sewers the reaeration process occurs more significantly at different sewer locations which plays a dominant role in determining sulfide generation fig 8 however previous models have mainly investigated the effects of wastewater quality on sulfide generation in pressure mains carrera et al 2016 although yongsiri et al 2003 and sharma et al 2008 developed equations for predicting sulfide production in aerobic anaerobic sediment the models do not address differences in microbial growth e g srb ma and sob in aerobic anaerobic sediments making it difficult to predict chemical and microbial micro profile along the sediment depths under anaerobic aerobic conditions such a simple assumption is not reliable for spatially heterogeneous gravity sediments as our results explicitly show significant differences in microbial components along sediment depths fig 7 although previous studies have reported similar microbial characteristics under anaerobic conditions liu et al 2015 zuo et al 2021 the influence of aerobic processes is still unclear this study clarifies the mechanism of sob srb and ma shifts within different layers of sediments driven by anaerobic aerobic spatial alternation this deep insight into microbial reactions is a prerequisite for the development of the mechanism model therefore this study developed a biochemical diffusion model incorporating different forms of microbial growth to fully predict apparent sulfide production and micro scale chemical conversion and microbial shift within anaerobic aerobic sewer sediments this improved model is an important step towards a more complete understanding of the effect of reaeration on the sulfur cycle within sediments it should be noted that however the proposed model is mainly for the prediction of spatial dynamics of sulfide in sewers in most sewer systems the water depth in the sewers varies hourly daily and monthly which results in significant temporal dynamics in redox conditions therefore the proposed model requires further verification under dynamic redox conditions in future studies based on the assessment of sulfide fluxes under different sewer conditions by the mechanism model a new quantitative approach was proposed table 2 a key strength of this approach is the establishment of a direct relationship between sulfide generation flux and klao2 which can be used to rapidly quantify the sulfide generation flux from spatially heterogeneous sewer sediments by calculating klao2 as shown in fig 9 however this requires further verification in real sewers 4 3 implications for sulfide control in partially filled gravity sewers the identification of sulfide generation hotspots based on rapid estimations by the proposed quantitative approach is a key prerequisite for more economical sulfide control once sulfide generation hotspots are identified biocidal chemicals such as free nitrous acid and free ammonia can be used to effectively reduce sediment activity or other chemicals e g ferric iron salts and nitrate can be dosed to rapidly decrease the sulfide concentration in the liquid phase cao et al 2019 jiang et al 2011 liu et al 2015b zuo et al 2020a these targeted controls are expected to achieve more cost effective sulfide mitigation across the sewer network our simulation study also reveals that a klao2 around 50 d 1 is the critical point that affects sulfide generation flux when klao2 exceeded 50 d 1 almost no sulfide was produced this finding has important implications for the design or modification of sewer piping structures as described by yongsiri et al 2003 the klao2 value mainly depends on the flow velocity pipe diameter slope and mean hydraulic depth thus the klao2 range was calculated to be 2 37 23 23 d 1 under different diameters according to the water supply and drainage design manual di et al 2017 table s6 in the supplementary information the overall sulfide generation rate under such klao2 values is still approx 1 4 g s m 2 d 1 based on the proposed equation table 2 this implies that the irregular designs of gravity sewers may be the root cause of sulfide generation therefore structural modification of sulfide generation hotspots in sewers e g increasing the slope to improve the klao2 value is expected to permanently prevent sulfide formation this hypothesis requires further tests collectively these results provide a new perspective for sulfide prediction and control in complex heterogeneous sewer sediments 5 conclusions overall in this study we comprehensively investigated sulfide formation from complex heterogeneous sewer sediments our results indicated that residential gravity sewers are sulfide generation hotspots where anaerobic aerobic spatial transformation was identified to be the critical factor determining sulfide distribution characteristics along the pipelines the aeration related processes could stimulate sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob growth in the surface zone and drive the sulfidogenic and methanogenic zones into deeper layers the microscale chemical conversion and microbial shift within the anaerobic and aerobic sediments could be fully predicted by the developed sediment model incorporating different microbial growth the model was evaluated to establish a rapid quantitative approach that only depends on a few key sewer parameters that can dynamically estimate the sulfide generation fluxes in a complex sewer network this will be of great significance for improving the economic benefits of

16726,compared with anaerobic pressure sewers gravity sewers have much more complex operational conditions such as anaerobic aerobic spatial variations along variable structures of the pipe network this greatly complicates the prediction of sulfide generation from spatially heterogeneous sewer sediments this study proposes a novel quantitative approach for rapidly estimating the sulfide generation flux by understanding the sulfidogenic conversion under complex sewer conditions significant anaerobic aerobic spatial variations were the most critical factor affecting the sulfide production in residential gravity sewers the dynamic aeration related process stimulated the growth of sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob in the surface zone while the sulfidogenic and methanogenic zone moved into deeper layers a detailed mechanism model incorporating dynamic alternative anaerobic aerobic transformation was developed to predict apparent sulfide production as well as the microscale spatial profiles of chemicals and microbial communities in sediments the model was evaluated to establish a rapid quantitative approach that only depended on a few key parameters e g flow velocity pipe diameter slope mean hydraulic depth and sulfate concentration which can provide an important basis for estimating different sulfide generation fluxes under various sewer factors the identification of sulfide generation hotspots will greatly help determine how to economically control sulfide generation by chemical dosing or pipe structural modification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gravity sewer sediment dynamic sulfide flux model prediction quantification 1 introduction hydrogen sulfide produced in sewers by sulfate reducing bacteria srb is highly undesirable due to its odor and toxicity and because it also results in serious sewer pipe corrosion that requires costly rehabilitation pikaar et al 2014 over the years extensive studies in the field of sulfide prediction and control have focused on anaerobic sewer biofilms particularly those in pressure sewers ganigue et al 2011 however more than 95 of sewers are gravity systems xu et al 2018 in which deposited sediments have greater sulfide production potentials liu et al 2015a schmitt and seyfried 1992 which results in gaseous hydrogen sulfide concentrations up to hundreds of ppm zuo et al 2019 compared with pressure mains gravity sewer networks present much more complicated operating conditions one significant difference is that gravity sewers operate in a partially filled manner which causes reaeration a process that has multiple effects on carbon sulfur cycles in sewers yongsiri et al 2003 this process is subject to complex influences by many sewer factors such as flow velocity sewer slope hydraulic depth drop structure and so on jensen 1995 guo et al 2018 due to these highly spatially heterogeneous sewer factors the quantitative evaluation of sulfide generation flux is very challenging over the years many empirical models carrera et al 2017 such as the wastewater aerobic anaerobic transformations in sewers wats model yongsiri et al 2003 or sewex model sharma et al 2008a 2008b have been developed to simulate in sewer biological reactions these empirical models use organic matter and sulfate as predictive variables but do not focus on differences in in sediment biochemical conversion or microbial growth this probably produces unreliable predictions of sulfide generation in heterogeneous sewer sediments because sulfur related microbial characteristics under dynamic sewer factors are significantly different dong et al 2017 therefore understanding the spatial heterogeneity within sewer sediments is critical for establishing an effective sulfide prediction method recent studies have revealed that sewer sediments exhibit different stratified microbial structures and sulfidogenic activity along their depth due to diffusion limits of chemical liu et al 2015a this spatial heterogeneity of sediments changes depending on the sewer conditions for example sulfides are mainly produced in the surface layer of sediments under anaerobic conditions but the sulfide producing zone migrates to the deeper layers in the presence of abundant nitrate or ferric ions in the overlying water cao et al 2019 liu et al 2015b our previous study showed that decreasing the shear velocity reduced the sulfidogenic activity in the surface layer of sediments by increasing the diffusion boundary layer dbl thickness zuo et al 2021 based on these insights into biochemical processes in sediments models have evolved from empirical models to detailed mechanism models jiang et al 2009 liu et al 2015a sun et al 2018 these advanced models provide better microscale descriptions of chemical conversion and microbial growth within anaerobic sediments thus providing deeper insights into anaerobic sewers a major drawback however is that few studies have explored differences in the microscale biochemical conversions in spatially heterogeneous gravity sewers with widespread anaerobic and aerobic alternation the lack of a mechanism also restricts the establishment of a mechanism model making it difficult to determine dynamic sulfide generation flux under complex gravity sewer factors this study proposes a new prediction approach for the rapid quantification of sulfide generation flux from spatially heterogeneous gravity sediments a systematic research methodology was adopted in this study fig 1 field trials were firstly conducted to determine the critical factors affecting sulfide spatial variations in gravity sewers based on field results lab scale experiment and analysis assays were performed using a variety of in situ measurement techniques to understand the chemical conversion and microbial communities within sediments then a sediment model was developed to describe the growth of srb methanogenic archaea ma sulfide oxidating bacteria sob and other heterotrophic microorganisms under anaerobic aerobic sewer conditions based on the model evaluation a rapid quantitative equation was developed for estimating dynamic sulfide generation fluxes in complex sewer networks to provide more economical and effective control of sulfides 2 materials and methods 2 1 field trials to investigate dynamic sulfide generation from sewer sediments in the study a field survey was conducted first to reveal spatial sulfide variations in a typical residential sewer network located in yixing city jiangsu province china fig 2 shows the information of the studied sewer trunk the main drainage pipe gm1 to gm2 receives domestic wastewater from nearby residences gm1 and gm2 are two manholes along the main drainage pipe a residential area connected with gm2 was taken as the main experimental site the residential main sewer pipe is about 300 m long and has a diameter of 300 400 mm rm1 rm5 are the five manholes along the residential main sewer pipe the average depth of these manholes is approx 3 m the wastewater flow velocity is 0 0 1 m s in the upstream pipes rm1 rm3 and 0 1 0 3 m s in the downstream pipes rm3 rm5 respectively a total of 8 lateral pipes are connected to the residential main pipe these lateral pipes have a diameter of 200 mm with an average depth of 1 m each lateral pipe receives the wastewater with an average daily flow of about 30 m3 d from buildings the wastewater flow velocity in these pipes is 0 0 1 m s the water level in all sewer pipes is low 50 mm so the walls of the pipes are almost free of biofilms rm4a and rm4b are the two manholes along the lateral pipe connected to rm4 and rm5a is the manhole along the lateral pipe connected to rm5 the lateral pipe connected to rm5 receives a mixture of restaurant wastewater and domestic wastewater the characteristics of sewage and sediment in gravity sewers were described in the supplementary information text s1 the experiment procedure included three tests as summarized in table 1 in test i a total of 10 sampling points gm1 gm2 rm1 rm2 rm3 rm4 rm5 rm4a rm4b and rm5a in the field trial were selected for wastewater quality measurements sampling was carried out in dry weather at an ambient temperature of 30 3 c june specifically two 100 ml wastewater samples were collected from each manhole using a field sewage sampler si 1 jihpump china fig s1 in supplementary information one of the two samples was immediately filtered through a 0 45 μ filter membrane after being extracted from the sewer then 5 ml of sodium hydroxide 4 solution and 5 ml of zinc acetate sodium 4 solution were added to this sample to prevent the oxidization and volatilization of sulfides the other sample was measured in terms of its chemical oxidation demand cod sulfate ammonium and total phosphorus before these samples were transported to the laboratory they were placed in a box filled with ice to prevent changes in water quality wastewater dissolved oxygen do and flow velocity at these sampling points were in situ monitored and recorded using a do meter wtw ph oxi340i and a flow meter yd ii china respectively fig s2 in the supplementary information moreover the sediment in five manholes rm1 rm2 rm3 rm4a and rm4b was collected using a shovel and then transported to the laboratory to determine the sulfide production activity of sediments test ii the detailed method is shown in text s2 in the supplementary information to further explore the sulfide production distribution within the field sediments a new in situ measurement technique namely diffusive gradients in thin films dgt was applied in the field sewer sediment test iii it has been reported that the dgt technique can accurately determine the sulfide production in sediments ding et al 2012 sun et al 2016 before dgt probes were transported to the sampling site they were deoxygenated with nitrogen and placed in sealed bags prior to deploying the dgt probe cotton wool was attached to the back of the dgt probe as a marking tool for accurately identifying the sediment water interface the dgt probe was inserted into the sediments of four sewer manholes rm2 rm3 rm4a and rm4b the probe was retrieved after 1 h and brought to the laboratory for further analysis as further described in section 2 3 2 2 lab scale tests to determine the substrate and microbe profiles within sediments to gain insight into the anaerobic aerobic sediments two sewer sediment systems were operated to mimic anaerobic conditions 0 mg o2 l and aerobic conditions 2 4 mg o2 l the details of system operation and monitoring e g sulfide effluent concentration and maximum sulfide production rate are shown in fig s3 and text s3 in the supplementary information after these two sediment systems were operated for 60 days spatial variations in the sulfide production activity do sulfate cod concentrations and microbial communities in sediments were investigated synchronously as follows dgt technique to determine sulfide production distribution in sediment the dgt technique was used for in situ measurements of the 2d sulfide flux in sediment the dgt probes were inserted vertically into the sediment the sediment water interface was labeled using a ceramic knife after 1 h the dgt probes were taken out and the binding gel was removed and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water before drying its surface with filter paper planar optode po technique to monitor the permeation of do from overlying water to sediment the two dimensional distribution of oxygen at the water sediment interface was in situ detected by a novel po technique the detailed principle of po can be found in previous literatures li et al 2019 in our experiment a fluorescent film 20 mm 60 mm of do was vertically inserted into the sediments from two systems and attached to the inner wall of the systems the side coated with fluorescent dye on the fluorescent film must face the deposit so that oxygen can react with the fluorescent film a ccd camera ft u31 200 fortune technology co ltd china and excitation light source were fixed at 300 mm from the system with a camera exposure time of 2500 ms and a gain of 2 all photos were collected in the dark at night high resolution dialysis technique to obtain pore water in sediment high resolution dialysis hr peeper was used to obtain the pore water in the sediments for subsequent analysis of the sulfate and cod concentrations hr peeper probes were prepared according to xu et al 2012 hr peeper was purged under nitrogen before deployment and then the hr peeper probes were inserted into the sediments and maintained for 48 h after removal the hr peeper probes were cleaned sequentially with wet filter paper and deionized water a plastic membrane was placed on the filter membrane surface of the probe to prevent oxidation of the porewater a 0 4 ml porewater sample was collected from each chamber to measure the sulfate and cod concentrations sludge sampling along the sediment depth for microbial analysis sludge samples in the two systems were obtained with 10 ml cutoff plastic syringes at depths of 0 1 1 2 2 3 5 and 3 5 5 cm below the sediment surface using the method described by hoehler et al 1994 the sludge samples were stored at 20 c for further microbial analysis 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1 chemical

technology co ltd shanghai china using novaseq reagent kits hiseq x reagent kits for the detailed high throughput sequencing methods see the text s5 in the supplementary information 2 4 mathematical modeling a one dimensional 1d sediment biochemical model with multispecies was established to describe the chemical conversion and associated microbial growth in sewer sediment the schematic representation of the biochemical processes included in the model is illustrated in fig 3 the model contains seven reactants i e sulfate sso4 sulfide sh2s slow biodegradable cod xcod fermentable cod sfcod vfa svfa methane sch4 oxygen so2 and five biomass groups i e heterotrophic biomass xb fermentation bacteria xf srb xsrb sob xsob and ma xma monod based equations were applied to describe the enzymatic reactions for heterotrophic biomass fermentation bacteria srb and ma to describe sob growth a first order type with respect to the sulfide concentration and the monod type with respect to the do concentration were used as reported by wilmot et al 1988 a chemical process i e sulfide chemical oxidation chen and morris 1972 is also contained in this model to reduce computational demands and improve the application efficiency of the model the model was simplified as follows it does not distinguish between microbes that use different types of organic matter e g propionate based srb acetate based srb and hydrogenotrophic srb instead srb using vfa as the substrate was considered as the only sulfidogenesis the same assumption applied to other microbes the detailed stoichiometric matrix kinetic expressions and model parameters are given in tables s1 s3 in the supplementary information the sediment matrix was modeled by dividing its thickness from the substratum to the surface into 50 layers the biochemical conversion within each layer and mass transfer between two layers were modeled according to a one dimensional conservation law described by wanner and reichert 1996 our previous study showed the effect of shear velocity on the thickness of the diffusion boundary layer dbl on the sediment zuo et al 2021 which was also considered in this model after the model was implemented in aquasim software wanner and morgenroth 2004 it was used to simulate the sulfide production rate of sediment as well as the vertical profiles of chemicals i e sulfate cod and do and microbial distribution i e srb ma and sob in sediments key parameters were re determined by comparing them with the experimentally measured results afterward the verified model was used to determine the effects of reaeration on the sulfide production flux g s m 2 d 1 in sewers to this end in the model simulation the reaeration coefficient klao2 ranged from 0 to 50 d 1 with an increment of 0 5 d 1 in each step this simulation was carried out at different sulfate concentrations 10 20 30 40 50 mg so4 2 s l and dbl thicknesses 0 0002 0 0004 0 0006 0 0008 0 001 m 3 results 3 1 characteristics of sulfide generation and transport in gravity sewers this section outlines the results of a field survey in a typical gravity drainage system of a residential area as summarized in figs 4 and s4 s5 in supplementary information preliminary test results showed a marked variation in the sulfide concentration along residential sewers fig 4 a the wastewater in the residential lateral pipes e g rm4a rm4b and rm5a contained negligible sulfide with an average concentration of 0 68 0 1 mg s l after the wastewater entered the residential main pipe rm1 to rm5 the sulfide concentration rapidly increased and reached a maximum at rm2 i e 3 95 0 9 mg s l before gradually decreasing along the rm2 rm5 pipeline fig 4 a the large spatial variation of sulfide may be explained by do variations along the pipe r2 0 78 fig s4 when wastewater flowed along the rm1 rm2 pipeline the do rapidly decreased from 1 86 to 0 1 mg s l creating an anaerobic environment for sulfide formation fig 4 a however the high flow velocity and drop structures in the downstream pipes rm2 to rm5 intensified reaeration e g 4 mg o2 l at rm5 resulting in the oxidative removal of sulfide the substrate concentration i e scod and sulfate was sufficiently high in fresh wastewater obtained directly from buildings zuo et al 2019 and was expected to not limit the sulfide production by a few milligrams e g 3 95 0 9 mg s l at rm2 we also monitored the daily behavior of do and sulfide and observed that sulfide still had a temporal change at rm2 although do was 0 mg o2 l at rm2 throughout the day fig s5 in supplementary information this suggests that diurnal variation of sulfide may be more influenced by other sewer factors as our previous field investigations have shown that there is a strong relationship between sulfide diurnal dynamics and wastewater flow variations zuo et al 2019 therefore the present study emphasizes that the effect of do on sulfide is mainly reflected in spatial dynamics to further understand the activity of different sewer sediments the maximum sulfide production rate of sediments was evaluated similar sediment activities were observed between aerobic locations e g rm4a rm4b and rm1 and anaerobic locations e g rm2 and rm3 fig 4 b this finding was unexpected since oxygen was generally thought to inhibit srb activity and reduce its sulfide production rate gutierrez et al 2008 to interpret this result an innovative monitoring technique i e dgt was applied to perform a microanalysis of sulfide production within sediments ding et al 2012 as shown in fig 4 c the sulfide production flux varied greatly along the sediment depth i e from 0 0 to 2 5 g m 2 d 1 in the anaerobic manholes e g rm2 and rm3 the sulfide flux was high near the surface layer of sediment and gradually decreased with the sediment depth which is consistent with previous laboratory results liu et al 2015a zuo et al 2020a 2020b however in the aerobic manholes e g rm4a rm4b there was no significant stratification of sulfide flux within sediments this is the first in situ observation of variable sulfidogenic conversion within different sediments in real sewers 3 2 sulfidogenic conversion within anaerobic aerobic sediments to fully understand the sulfidogenic transformation within different sewer sediments this section provides more in depth laboratory experimental results by operating two laboratory scale sediment systems r1 and r2 under anaerobic and aerobic conditions respectively supplementary information text s3 3 2 1 apparent sulfide production from sediments sulfide in the effluent of the anaerobic system r1 and aerobic system r2 was monitored with average concentrations of 21 4 and 2 2 0 5 mg s l respectively fig 5 a a 90 removal of sulfide was achieved batch tests further showed that the maximum sulfide production rate of sediment was 5 7 1 5 g s m 2 d 1 in r1 which was higher than that of r2 i e 3 9 1 0 g s m 2 d 1 fig 5 b this was inconsistent with the field results which showed similar sediment activity at different sewer locations fig 4 b 3 2 2 in sediment biochemical conversion the results of this analysis obtained by in situ measurement techniques i e dgt po and hr peeper are summarized in fig 6 in the anaerobic sediment system fig 6 a the sulfide generation flux was much higher near the sediment surface 1 cm which was similar to the field results fig 4 c the sulfate vertical distribution shows that the sulfate concentration rapidly declined from 17 mg s l at the water sediment interface to 7 mg s l at a depth of 1 cm indicating the rapid conversion of sulfate into sulfide near the sediment surface 1 cm the low sulfate concentration below 1 cm average 4 6 1 5 mg s l limited the sulfidogenic activity in deep layers 1 cm compared with sulfate scod may not be a limiting factor in sulfide production because the in sediment scod concentration remained at an average value of 84 21 mg cod l the aerobic sediment system presented a significantly different sulfidogenic process from the anaerobic sediment system fig 6 b first under continuous aeration the do of the overlying water remained at 3 mg o2 l the high do concentration caused no sulfide generation flux at the sediment surface as indicated by the dgt results however a larger sulfide generation flux still appeared in the deep layer 1 1 0 1 g s m 2 d 1 below 1 cm indicating that the sediments were still undergoing sulfidogenesis even though they were exposed to oxygen this is because the oxygen concentration rapidly dropped to 0 mg o2 l when passing through the water sediment interface thus an anaerobic environment still existed in the deep layer a similar phenomenon has been reported for sewer biofilms gutierrez et al 2008 the oxygen in the overlying water can re convert the sulfide into sulfate leading to a sufficient sulfate concentration in the sediment surface 40 mg s l therefore sulfate can penetrate into the deep anaerobic zone and result in sulfide generation as mentioned in section 3 2 1 the maximum sulfide production of aerobic sediment was lower than that of anaerobic sediment fig 5 b this is because most scod was consumed in the aerobic environment leading to a low concentration in the sediment 60 mg l which limited the sulfide generation rate fig 6 b however in the field test the similar sulfide formation rate of different sediments fig 4 b was observed because residential sewers directly collect fresh wastewater containing sufficient substrates 3 2 3 in sediment microbial distribution 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing further revealed the differences in microbial community compositions within the anaerobic and aerobic sediments the α diversity estimators shannon chao and ace index and principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on unweighted unifrac i e β analysis indicated that the bacterial richness and community in the aerobic sediment surface was significantly different from those in other samples table s4 and fig s6 in the supplementary information fig 7 shows the relative abundances of srb sob and ma in the sediments in the surface layer 0 1 cm of sediment in the anaerobic sediment system r1 the relative abundances of srb and ma were similar fig 7 a along the sediment depth there was a significant increase in the relative abundance of ma while most srb disappeared due to competition between srb and ma a relatively high ratio of sulfate to cod can stimulate srb growth and inhibit ma growth in the surface layer while the lack of sulfate in the deep layer allowed methanogens to play a key role liu et al 2015a reported similar results further analysis of the distribution of srb sob and ma in the sediments of the aerobic sediment system r2 revealed that all three microorganisms underwent significant changes fig 7 b the relative abundance of srb and ma in the surface layer was very low 1 10 and 0 66 due to the presence of oxygen instead abundant sob e g thiothrix existed at the sediment surface 0 1 cm which played a key role in sulfide oxidation in the deep layer of sediments the high relative abundance of srb confirmed that sulfidogenic conversion still occurred however the abundance of ma in the deeper layer was lower due to the penetration of high concentrations of sulfate 3 3 model development and validation a 1d sediment model incorporating microbial growth was adapted to predict sulfidogenic conversion within anaerobic aerobic sediments most kinetic parameters were taken from the literature except for three parameters the maximum growth rate of srb i e μ s r b and the yield of ma and sob i e y ma and y sob by fitting maximum sulfide production rate of sediment in anaerobic reactor fig 5 b μ s r b was adjusted to 1 8 d 1 which is higher than the values 0 8 d 1 used for biofilms jiang et al 2009 because sediment had a higher potential for sulfide formation by fitting relative abundances of ma and sob along the sediment depth fig 7 both y ma and y sob were determined to be 0 1 gcod gcod all other experimental data were used for model validation by adjusting only these three parameters this model accurately predicted the datasets of 1 the sulfide effluent concentration and maximum sulfide production rate fig 5 2 vertical profiles of chemicals sulfate do cod fig 6 and 3 microbial communities i e the relative fractions of srb sob and ma fig 7 these comprehensive simulation results indicate that the developed model can reliably predict the sulfide generation process within anaerobic aerobic sediments to the best of our knowledge this is the first time the aeration process has been incorporated into a 1d biochemical diffusion sediment model 3 4 model based evaluation of sulfide generation flux under various sewer factors although the proposed mechanism model has been fully verified in the above section the complexity of the parameters and components in the model makes it impossible to predict sulfide in large scale complex sewer networks as previous stated liu et al 2015a sun et al 2018 some researchers put forward very simple empirical equations with high practicality by using mechanism models for comprehensive prediction under various conditions therefore in this study we also expect to use the present mechanism model to establish a simple equation suitable for sulfide spatial prediction in large scale partially filled gravity sewers in this section we investigate the sulfide generation fluxes under various sewer factors based on the model evaluation as can be seen from fig 8 there was a significant variation in the sulfide generation flux from 0 to 4 5 g s m 2 d 1 at different reaeration coefficients an increazed reaeration coefficient klao2 significantly reduced the sulfide generation flux notably when the reaeration coefficient reached 50 d 1 the sulfide generation flux declined to 0 g s m 2 d 1 this has important implications for sewer design and sulfide control which will be discussed later a decrease in the sulfate concentration significantly inhibited the sulfide generation flux fig 8 a which is expected since sulfate serves as the substrate for sulfide production similar changes were found when the dbl thickness was increazed fig 8 b increasing the dbl thickness from 0 0002 to 0 001 μm reduced the sulfide generation flux by 31 indicating that mass transfer resistance at water sediment interface also plays a key role however an increase in the reaeration coefficient diminished the influences of sulfate and mass transfer resistance the reaeration coefficient became the sole factor determining the sulfide production flux when it exceeded 30 d 1 the relationship between the reaeration coefficient and sulfide generation can be well described by a simple polynomial model f h2s a klao2 2 b klao2 c r 2 0 999 where f h2s is the sulfide generation flux g s m 2 d 1 a b and c values depend on the sulfate concentration and dbl thickness table s5 in the supplementary information for practical application of the developed quantitative method we propose to use this equation for two dbl thickness i e 0 0002 and 0 001 m because the dbl remains unchanged at 0 0002 m when the flow exceeds 0 07 m s which satisfies the daytime flow of most sewer pipes another common scenario is that there is almost no flow at midnight causing the dbl thickness to increase to the maximum 0 001 m therefore in addition to simulating sulfide generation flux under different klao2 and sso4 conditions when dbl is 0 0002 m as shown in fig 8 a we also conducted the same model simulation at 0 001 m thickness of dbl fig s7 in supplementary information we found that a b and c varied linearly with sulfate concentration i e a a sso4 b b sso4 and c c sso4 fig s8 in supplementary information therefore we proposed the following integrated empirical model to predict the sulfide generation flux in large scale partially filled gravity sewers 4 f h 2 s a k l a o 2 2 b k l a o 2 c s so 4 where a b and c are constant parameters in the model and have different values at two dbl thickness i e 0 0002 and 0 001 m as shown in table 2 relatively narrow confidence intervals indicate that these parameters are acceptably identifiable it should be noted that the application range of this equation is klao2 50 d 1 f h2s remains 0 g s m 2 d 1 when klao2 50 d 1 using this simple equation the sulfide generation flux under different sewer factors can be rapidly estimated 3 5 rapid quantification of sulfide generation flux in the studied field sewer in this section the proposed klao2 prediction approach was applied to provide a heat map evaluation of sulfide generation flux in the studied field sewer as shown in fig 9 the klao2 value was calculated based on a well known equation involving flow velocity slope pipe diameter and mean hydraulic depth yongsiri et al 2004 the results showed a significant spatial difference in the sulfide generation flux fig 9 the highest sulfide generation flux appeared in the pipe rm1 rm2 2 4 3 1 g s m 2 d 1 which explained the rapid increase in sulfide concentration from rm1 to rm2 observed in the field test fig 4 a klao2increazed upon increasing the downstream pipe diameter and flow velocity which decreazed the sulfide generation fluxes thus the sulfide generation flux in spatially heterogeneous gravity sewers was visualized it should be noted however that the sulfide generation flux may vary throughout a day for instance the sulfide generation flux in the pipe rm1 rm2 was quantified within the range 2 4 3 1 g s m 2 d 1 this is because differences in day night flow velocities were taken into account in the calculations there is almost no flow at midnight which will decreaze liquid gas transfer i e reduce klao2 which is conducive to the formation of sulfide however stagnant conditions significantly increazed the dbl thickness at the water sediment interface leading to a greater reduction in the sulfide generation flux as indicated by fig 8 b another point is that the continuous water drop structure downstream greatly influenced the reaeration process matias et al 2017 however this study only proposes a new quantitative approach without optimizing it for complex sewer structures which should be comprehensively considered in practice 4 discussion 4 1 sulfide generation at the residential scale of the sewer network previous researches have mainly focused on sulfide formation in anaerobic pressure sewers ganigue et al 2011 while some recent studies have also confirmed the great potential of sediments to produce sulfide in gravity sewers liu et al 2015a however most investigations on sulfide formation in sediments were conducted under virtual simple homogeneous sewer conditions and the understanding of sulfide formation in real complex gravity sewers was still lacking here we investigated a new sulfide generation hotspot i e residential gravity sewers which has been neglected in previous studies in the studied sewer the sulfide concentration reached 4 mg s l e g rm2 with a maximum sediment activity of 2 5 g s m 2 d 1 fig 4 such a high sulfide production has been demonstrated to result in significant emissions of gaseous h2s under highly turbulent conditions e g drop structures guo et al 2018 matias et al 2017 zuo et al 2019 which will produce odors that may affect nearby residents therefore there is still a great deal of work to be performed in this area in addition we have applied the novel dgt technique for the first time to real complex gravity sewers providing in situ 2d and high resolution profiles of sulfide production activities within different sediments this also implies the potential of dgt technique for the in situ analysis in real sewer systems there are several possible factors that make residential gravity sewers more susceptible to sulfide formation 1 as a starting point for the entire network residential gravity sewers collect wastewater directly from buildings so the wastewater is very fresh and contains sufficient substrate for sulfide production 2 the sewage flow velocity in residential gravity sewers is generally low so it easily forms an anaerobic zone suitable for sulfide formation 3 the low flow velocity is also more likely to lead to sediment deposition for a greater sulfide production rate our findings showed that spatial sulfide variations may be closely related to anaerobic aerobic spatial alternation in sewers fig s4 however this spatial variation is affected by many sewer factors e g slope flow velocity drop structure and so on therefore further research is needed to comprehensively evaluate the effects of complex sewer factors on anaerobic aerobic spatial changes 4 2 model improvement for spatial heterogeneous sewer sediments in partially filled gravity sewers the reaeration process occurs more significantly at different sewer locations which plays a dominant role in determining sulfide generation fig 8 however previous models have mainly investigated the effects of wastewater quality on sulfide generation in pressure mains carrera et al 2016 although yongsiri et al 2003 and sharma et al 2008 developed equations for predicting sulfide production in aerobic anaerobic sediment the models do not address differences in microbial growth e g srb ma and sob in aerobic anaerobic sediments making it difficult to predict chemical and microbial micro profile along the sediment depths under anaerobic aerobic conditions such a simple assumption is not reliable for spatially heterogeneous gravity sediments as our results explicitly show significant differences in microbial components along sediment depths fig 7 although previous studies have reported similar microbial characteristics under anaerobic conditions liu et al 2015 zuo et al 2021 the influence of aerobic processes is still unclear this study clarifies the mechanism of sob srb and ma shifts within different layers of sediments driven by anaerobic aerobic spatial alternation this deep insight into microbial reactions is a prerequisite for the development of the mechanism model therefore this study developed a biochemical diffusion model incorporating different forms of microbial growth to fully predict apparent sulfide production and micro scale chemical conversion and microbial shift within anaerobic aerobic sewer sediments this improved model is an important step towards a more complete understanding of the effect of reaeration on the sulfur cycle within sediments it should be noted that however the proposed model is mainly for the prediction of spatial dynamics of sulfide in sewers in most sewer systems the water depth in the sewers varies hourly daily and monthly which results in significant temporal dynamics in redox conditions therefore the proposed model requires further verification under dynamic redox conditions in future studies based on the assessment of sulfide fluxes under different sewer conditions by the mechanism model a new quantitative approach was proposed table 2 a key strength of this approach is the establishment of a direct relationship between sulfide generation flux and klao2 which can be used to rapidly quantify the sulfide generation flux from spatially heterogeneous sewer sediments by calculating klao2 as shown in fig 9 however this requires further verification in real sewers 4 3 implications for sulfide control in partially filled gravity sewers the identification of sulfide generation hotspots based on rapid estimations by the proposed quantitative approach is a key prerequisite for more economical sulfide control once sulfide generation hotspots are identified biocidal chemicals such as free nitrous acid and free ammonia can be used to effectively reduce sediment activity or other chemicals e g ferric iron salts and nitrate can be dosed to rapidly decrease the sulfide concentration in the liquid phase cao et al 2019 jiang et al 2011 liu et al 2015b zuo et al 2020a these targeted controls are expected to achieve more cost effective sulfide mitigation across the sewer network our simulation study also reveals that a klao2 around 50 d 1 is the critical point that affects sulfide generation flux when klao2 exceeded 50 d 1 almost no sulfide was produced this finding has important implications for the design or modification of sewer piping structures as described by yongsiri et al 2003 the klao2 value mainly depends on the flow velocity pipe diameter slope and mean hydraulic depth thus the klao2 range was calculated to be 2 37 23 23 d 1 under different diameters according to the water supply and drainage design manual di et al 2017 table s6 in the supplementary information the overall sulfide generation rate under such klao2 values is still approx 1 4 g s m 2 d 1 based on the proposed equation table 2 this implies that the irregular designs of gravity sewers may be the root cause of sulfide generation therefore structural modification of sulfide generation hotspots in sewers e g increasing the slope to improve the klao2 value is expected to permanently prevent sulfide formation this hypothesis requires further tests collectively these results provide a new perspective for sulfide prediction and control in complex heterogeneous sewer sediments 5 conclusions overall in this study we comprehensively investigated sulfide formation from complex heterogeneous sewer sediments our results indicated that residential gravity sewers are sulfide generation hotspots where anaerobic aerobic spatial transformation was identified to be the critical factor determining sulfide distribution characteristics along the pipelines the aeration related processes could stimulate sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob growth in the surface zone and drive the sulfidogenic and methanogenic zones into deeper layers the microscale chemical conversion and microbial shift within the anaerobic and aerobic sediments could be fully predicted by the developed sediment model incorporating different microbial growth the model was evaluated to establish a rapid quantitative approach that only depends on a few key sewer parameters that can dynamically estimate the sulfide generation fluxes in a complex sewer network this will be of great significance for improving the economic benefits of

16727,the dual scripps plankton camera dspc is a new approach for automated in situ monitoring of phyto and zooplankton communities based on a dual magnification dark field imaging microscope here we present the dspc and its associated image processing while evaluating its capabilities in i detecting and characterizing plankton species of different size and taxonomic categories and ii measuring their abundance in both laboratory and field applications in the laboratory body size and abundance estimates by the dspc significantly and robustly scaled with measurements derived by microscopy in the field a dspc installed permanently at 3 m depth in lake greifensee switzerland delivered images of plankton individuals colonies and heterospecific aggregates at hourly timescales without disrupting natural arrangements of interacting organisms their microenvironment or their behavior the dspc was able to track the dynamics of taxa mostly at the genus level in the size range between 10 μm to 1 cm covering many components of the planktonic food web including parasites and potentially toxic cyanobacteria comparing data from the field deployed dspc to traditional sampling and microscopy revealed a general overall agreement in estimates of plankton diversity and abundances the most significant disagreements between traditional methods and the dspc resided in the measurements of zooplankton community properties our data suggest that the dspc is better equipped to study the dynamics and demography of heterogeneously distributed organisms such as zooplankton because high temporal resolution and continuous sampling offer more information and less variability in taxa detection and quantification than traditional sampling time series collected by the dspc depicted ecological succession patterns algal bloom dynamics and diel fluctuations with a temporal frequency and morphological resolution that was never observed by traditional methods access to high frequency reproducible and real time data of a large spectrum of the planktonic ecosystem expands our understanding of both applied and fundamental plankton ecology we conclude the dspc is robust for both research and water quality monitoring and suitable for stable long term deployments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phytoplankton zooplankton size microscopy classification

introduction plankton are a key component of global ecology that play important roles in carbon and nutrient cycling as well as providing essential services to human society e g clean water and fisheries behrenfeld et al 2001 falkowski 2012 plankton or drifters is a collective term for all organisms that inhabit aqueous ecosystems that are unable to control their horizontal position in the water column hence plankton comprises both prokaryotes and eukaryotes phytoplankton are the planktonic photosynthetic autotrophs and the primary producers of the pelagic open water ecosystem while zooplankton comprises consumers that can be either herbivores carnivores or both most phytoplankton clades contain mixotrophic taxa which combine photosynthesis with phagotrophic uptake of prey usually bacteria or small protists the phytoplankton are composed of an enormous variety of taxa shapes and sizes they span four orders of magnitude in size from roughly 1 µm to 1 mm overlapping with the zooplankton size range while a single zooplankton sample in a lake may consist of several tens of taxa the phytoplankton inventory of a lake may comprise hundreds of them their short lifespans and strong sensitivity to environmental conditions make plankton effective indicators of environmental change and ecosystem health and they are used to assess water and aquatic ecosystem quality worldwide xu 2001 directive 2000 60 ec information about plankton biomass and community composition including variation among key functional traits is essential to judge the state of ecological systems according to the water framework directive in europe directive 2000 60 ec plankton biodiversity surveys are also crucial to evaluate the resilience to change of ecosystem processes extinctions and invasions and to manage ecosystem services bartley et al 2019 cardinale et al 2012 pomati et al 2011 assessing plankton community composition is critically important for the monitoring and forecasting of harmful algal blooms events of algal overgrowth that are dominated by toxic species in freshwater ecosystems cyanobacterial blooms cause large ecological and economical damage huisman et al 2018 and have been increasing worldwide due to the effects of land use and climate change chorus and bartram 1999 ho et al 2019 given the importance of plankton for ecosystem processes and services there is not only scientific interest but also a societal need and a policy requirement for monitoring plankton communities at low cost and ideally in real time initiatives such as the water framework directive in europe demand that policymakers achieve good status for all water bodies and secure drinking water supplies for the population requiring member states to consistently monitor aquatic biodiversity including plankton communities and indicator species directive 2000 60 ec the assessment of plankton community composition and taxa relative abundance is however the most difficult time consuming and expensive aspect pomati et al 2011 dedicated laboratories use skilled and trained taxonomists to identify and count microalgae and zooplankton manually sometimes taking several hours to count a sample taxonomists frequently misclassify items count some objects more than once or overlook others macleod et al 2010 and mistakes are not traceable back in time in many monitoring programs microscope counts are only completed weeks or months after samples are collected and are therefore unable to provide information in a timely actionable manner sample collection transport and storage also demand proper infrastructure and personnel time aquatic ecosystem monitoring would hence tremendously benefit from an automated reliable standalone system for plankton identification classification and counting that produces transparent and reproducible results not dependent on personal judgment in near real time and that does not require sample collection and storage additional costs several automated quantitative tools for plankton counting have been established for use in the laboratory e g flow cam flow cytometry microscopy imaging zooscan and in the field e g fluorescence probes cytobuoy flowcytobot imaging cameras reviewed in lombard et al 2019 laboratory based tools can automate counting and sorting but still require sample collection and processing which changes the nature of the sample and requires time resources and infrastructure field applications are more promising but they too have limitations fluorescence sensors measuring chlorophyll a phycocyanin or other photosynthetic pigments are common and widely deployed in the field but they are unable to resolve taxonomic distinctions beyond coarse levels and pigment content within and across species can vary widely making estimates of abundances and biomass difficult johnson and martiny 2015 automated in situ flow cytometry has shown encouraging results for high frequency monitoring of phytoplankton community dynamics and morpho physiological traits fontana et al 2018 hunter cevera et al 2016 pomati et al 2011 sosik et al 2010 flow cytometry complemented by water physics and chemistry data and machine learning for analysis demonstrated the potential of high frequency information for modeling environmental responses and predicting phytoplankton dynamics thomas et al 2018 the dynamics of single species of phytoplankton and microzooplankton can be tracked and studied with flow cytometry if assisted by imaging hunter cevera et al 2016 lombard et al 2019 still flow cytometers require constant maintenance and calibration and may disrupt natural spatial aggregates while sampling additionally they have limited dynamic range in terms of size often being able to follow the dynamics of a single trophic level only lombard et al 2019 for phytoplankton particularly high frequency data of herbivore zooplankton could be essential to study variation in top down controls as a response to environmental change murphy et al 2020 here we describe a monitoring approach based on dark field underwater imaging by means of a dual magnification camera derived from the scripps plankton camera spc system orenstein et al 2020 it was designed to be a flexible easily configurable imaging system that can observe objects from 10s of microns to several millimeters and sample at high temporal frequency with minimal influence on the fluid being imaged similar cameras have been successfully deployed in marine systems murphy et al 2020 orenstein et al 2020 but never deployed before in freshwater environments in this study we compared the dspc to traditional microscopy and high frequency fluorescence based monitoring using both field and laboratory comparisons we then used this tool to observe plankton dynamics and trait distributions e g size across the whole planktonic food web in situ in the eutrophic lake greifensee with high temporal resolution days hours our results promote underwater imaging as an auspicious approach to generate empirical high resolution plankton time series 2 methods 2 1 description of the dual magnification camera 2 1 1 instrument s design the plankton camera dspc used in this study is a dual magnification dark field underwater microscope based on the scripps plankton camera spc system orenstein et al 2020 when compared to the original spc the dspc has several new features designed specifically to target plankton monitoring in freshwater first it is a dual magnification microscope extending the size range that can be photographed by overlapping spatial resolution fig 1 based on our trials the highest magnification 5p0x 5x magnification has a detection range between 10 μm 150 μm while the lower magnification 0p5x 0 5x magnification ranges between 100 μm 1 cm these estimates depend on the features of the imaged objects e g color transparency and therefore are not fixed the imaged volumes per frame for the two magnifications are from high resolution to blob detection 5p0x 0 2 10 μl 0p5x 4 200 μl respectively second internal batteries allow autonomous measurements for up to 3 hours without recharging which is needed for manual depth profiling or sampling of remote sites i e lakes ponds finally the distance between light sources and objective has been reduced to 5 cm to shorten the illumination path length and allow transmission of light in turbid waters e g during thick algal blooms the dspc is compact enough for one person to carry 57 cm l x 19 w 27 2 kg weight and is composed of two housings one with the led light sources and another with the controlling hardware cameras and lenses fig 1 the instrument has no moving parts therefore it has low maintenance requirements only cleaning of external surfaces housings have facing acrylic viewports that allow transmitting light from the led to the microscopes water flows freely between the two viewports to reduce fouling our system was complemented with a uv lamp https amloceanographic com biofouling control installed facing the acrylic viewports fig 1 the onboard computer uses a linux based operating system the camera works automatically there is no need for regular calibration and if installed in a monitoring platform like the dspc at lake greifensee pictures can be available in real time if a power supply computer and internet are available the acquisition rate for pictures can be easily modified the maximum rate is 10 frames per second recording of videos is also possible the actual specifics of the instrument can be found in supplemental table s1 the configurations of the machine used for imaging are reported in the methods section relative to laboratory and field application 2 1 2 image processing we use a modified version of the original python spcconvert image processing script orenstein et al 2020 which converts raw regions of interest rois from the plankton camera into image mosaics and extracts statistics per processed sample and features of detected objects the process consists of color conversion edge detection and segmentation morphological feature extraction foreground masking and inverse filtering of the masked foreground the results are then saved into a new directory and a web app html file is built from the data showing converted pictures the program creates a spreadsheet with 64 features e g area aspect ratio max length or orientation color features and more of every detected object the original python code can be found here https github com tooploox spcconvert because of their complex shape and moveable appendages measuring body size in zooplankton is not straightforward often zooplankton can be much wider than they are long when antennas are included e g copepods meaning that the major axis cannot reliably be used moreover the presence of predators and other stressors also influences the overall shape of zooplankton and can induce the growth of defensive structures e g spines helmets and elongated tails further complicating the estimation of body size tollrian and drew harvell 1999 to overcome these complexities we developed the daphnia ruler https github com nelstevens the daphnia ruler which effectively removes these appendages from calculations of zooplankton body size using the same edge detection concepts as spcconvert the outline of the zooplankton is refined by repeatedly eroding and dilating the binary image with round structuring elements of varying sizes until a threshold solidity is reached indicating that all protuberances have been sufficiently removed the resulting ellipse can then be treated as the core body and measured as for any other spheroid planktonic object 2 2 annotation of images and classification based on deep learning many labeled pictures are needed to create a training database for an automatic classification based on deep learning we utilized a free and open source platform taxonify which expedites the process of species annotation through this platform one can rapidly label pictures to taxon level and can add additional attributes to the pictures e g colonies dividing or parasites present more information can be found on https www taxonify org and software codes are freely available at https github com tooploox taxonify gui for this study we annotated a variable amount of images per class of interest mainly zooplankton in the 0p5x magnification ranging from a minimum of 10 chaoborus to a maximum of 3321 dinobryon supplemental table s2 we then developed an automated deep learning classifier for objects detected by the 0p5x magnification of the dspc the model we used was a convolutional neural network cnn trained to distinguish 34 different classes of zooplankton phytoplankton and other suspended solids junk supplemental table s2 in the si text we describe the used cnn and its hyperparameters and we show a series of validation benchmarks we provide access to the code and a ready to use release of the classifier at the following address https github com mbaityje plankifier releases tag v1 1 1 the default code settings contain all hyperparameter values used in this study 2 3 laboratory calibration of dspc imaging to use the dspc in the laboratory the space between the two viewports fig 1 was covered with a black rubber sheet and flooded with water tissue culture flasks containing the imaged samples were manually held in the focal plane of the dspc between the viewports to take measurements for cultures where the sedimentation rate was high we mixed the sample every 30 seconds with a pasteur pipette through the lid of the flask 2 3 1 calibration of plankton body size estimates we compared body size estimates for small 5p0x and large 0p5x plankton organisms by the dspc featuring automated object detection and features extraction to body size measurements done with images taken by inverted microscopy using manual object detection and feature extraction using imagej https imagej nih gov ij having information on only two dimensions size was evaluated as the area of objects rather than volume for the comparison only rois by dspc that were comparable to manual microscopy i e not cropped and imaged from the frontal plane were selected and used for feature extraction i e object area body size was estimated from dspc images using spc convert scripts see section 2 1 2 taxon specific mean body size was calculated by taking an average area in pixels overall saved objects both for dspc and microscopy 5p0x magnification we used the following phytoplankton cultures aphanizomenon flos aquae cyclotella meneghiniana scenedesmus acuminatus tetraedron minimum eudorina unicocca lagerheimia hindakii staurastrum punctulatum cosmarium botrytis oocystis solitaria planktothrix rubescens cystodinium sp volvox aureus peridinium sp all cultures were grown in wc medium guillard 1975 under standard conditions 20 c and 10 14 light dark cycle for at least 2 weeks cultures of two small zooplankton were also imaged at 5p0x magnification the protist euglena sp and the rotifer cephalodella sp these were grown under standard conditions and with a protozoan pellet medium provided by carolinatm biological supply company burlington nc usa a volume of 2 10 ml depending on initial culture densities was inoculated into a 25 cm2 tissue culture flask vented cap sterile vwr 743 2311 and topped with tap water to a final volume of 60 ml 0p5x magnification we used the two large protists blepharisma sp spirostomum sp which were grown under the same conditions as the protists used for 5p0x calibration we also used living samples of copepods sp daphnia sp keratella quadrata keratella cochlearis and kellicotia sp taken from lake greifensee switzerland traditional microscopy an aliquot of the imaged sample was taken and photographed with a light inverted microscope leica dmi8 magnification x160 or x320 depending on the size of the plankton species using imagej the maximum and minimum axis lengths perpendicular were manually measured for 50 to 200 individuals and then used to calculate the object area by applying an ellipses formula 2 3 2 calibration of dspc object detection relative to plankton density we compared the average number of objects detected per frame i e per second in the dspc to density measurements obtained by inverted microscopy for small 5p0x and stereomicroscopy for large 0p5x plankton organisms in serial dilutions this dspc metric is not sensitive to frame rate and we tested its comparability to volumetric measurements 5p0x magnification the following cultures were used scenedesmus acuminatus oocystis solitaria tetraedron minimum botryococcus braunii euglena sp and cephalodella sp for this experiment we used culturing flasks as in the previous experiment an initial sample of 0 5 to 10 ml of the culture was taken and topped to 60 ml with tap water after imaging each culture for 5 minutes 30 ml of the samples were replaced with tap water to prepare the next dilution step 1 2 dilution followed by imaging with the dspc this was repeated for five dilution steps for scenedesmus acuminatus oocystis solitaria tetraedron minimum botryococcus braunii and six dilution steps for euglena sp and cephalodella sp images were then sorted out manually whereas cropped or wrong images were not considered the initial culture density was estimated from a subsample counted manually under an inverted microscope 0p5x magnification cultures of three daphnia species of different size classes d magna d longispina d cucullata were used they were diluted 1 2 in six decreasing levels from 200 to 7 individuals counted manually and imaged in a culturing flask total volume of 60 ml for 5 minutes each the images were manually sorted first all pictures containing daphnia including cropped or and not in focus were used for density estimation second for the size estimation only pictures of daphnia in focus and not cropped were considered 2 4 field deployment and comparison with traditional monitoring 2 4 1 automated deployment and monitoring station the dual magnification dspc was installed at our automated monitoring station located in greifensee a peri alpine eutrophic lake in switzerland 47 35 n 8 68 e specific details about the automated monitoring platform can be found in pomati et al 2011 the station features a multiparametric probe ocean7 and an automated profiler https www idronaut it a meteorological station ws700 umb from ott hydrometrie lufft a local computer and data network by 4g modem allowing data transmission all data are streamlined and published in real time on our website www aquascope ch 2 4 2 dspc settings and data the dspc is permanently installed at a depth of 3 m monitoring the plankton community hourly for 10 minutes at the start of every hour at an imaging rate of 1 frame second the weekly maintenance consisted of cleaning the viewports which did not require uninstalling the dspc and bringing it to the laboratory the dspc never experienced any major structural damage and the yearly maintenance was performed only for replacing an anode cleaning and checking internal humidity no interruption of function was caused by the failure of hardware the longest interruption was due to the use of the dspc during an international exposition in january 2019 which required uninstalling it from the monitoring station for a month phytoplankton for comparisons with traditional monitoring we used only the 5p0x magnification and selected the images of the dspc that were taken in the same hour as a microscopy sample this was mostly between 10 00 12 00 in the morning the whole 10 minutes of running time and associated images were used the images were then classified taxonomically to the lowest possible classification level zooplankton we used only the 0p5x magnification data and aggregated discrete hourly samples over an entire day to allow for comparisons with traditional twin net tows specifically we took the mean of a 24 h running time 10 minutes every hour this was to increase dspc sample size since net tows concentrate hundreds of liters of water the images of 0p5x magnification were subset to every 6 seconds in order to exclude multiple imaging of the same object since some individuals were observed to remain in the focal plane of the camera for some seconds particularly when the water was calm the images were then classified at the lowest possible taxonomic level using the trained cnn described in section 2 2 2 4 3 traditional sampling and microscopy water samples were taken every week for 12 consecutive months starting in april 2019 except for winter months november early march 2020 when we sampled fortnightly all samples were taken between 10 00 and 12 00 in the morning phytoplankton water samples were taken near the dspc at 3 m depth with a 5 l niskin bottle an aliquot of 50 ml was fixed with lugol s iodine solution and then identified and counted in the laboratory under an inverted microscope utermöhl method zooplankton integrated water column samples starting from march 2020 onwards were taken with a 95 μm twin net from 17 m to the surface samples were filtered with a 95 μm mesh and fixed in 50 ml of 100 ethanol identification and counting were done under a stereomicroscope 2 5 data analysis all data analyses and plotting were performed in the r programming environment https www r project org all the laboratory and monitoring data from this study are available at https doi org 10 25678 0004bw 2 5 1 laboratory calibration body size we calculated the size of objects as 2 dimensional areas of the object mask as automatically provided by our image processing scripts for dspc or manually per each taxon in microscopy we used a least squares linear regression to correlate microscopy measurements the benchmark and measures taken by the dspc in log10 space size density curves were done by using geom density from the ggplot2 package on untransformed areas geom density ggplot2 3 2 1 density measurements were log10 transformed with zeros set to an arbitrarily low value 0 1 before the transformation when dilution series were run multiple times we took the mean between technical repeats density estimates by microscopy the benchmark and dspc were then compared using linear regression for each taxon similarly an overall relationship between microscopy and dspc was calculated with linear regression in log10 space for each magnification 2 5 2 field application seasonal patterns we estimated the mean size of the phytoplankton community as the area of rois detected by the 5p0x magnification and its densities using the dspc data from 2018 as a comparison to dspc density estimates we used the chlorophyll a chl a concentration recorded by the ctd probe fluorimeter https chelsea co uk products trilux using averages of chl a measurements from 2 9 to 3 1 m from each profile we classified objects at 0p5x magnification including zooplankton taxa and several large colonial phytoplankton with the trained cnn using images sampled from the full dataset every 6 seconds again to avoid multiple images of the same object counts were then aggregated into coarser taxonomic levels copepods daphnids rotifers predators and nauplia day night patterns to study phytoplankton daily division cells grow during the day and divide during the night and the consequent change in community average size and zooplankton community day night migrations we used phyto and zooplankton body size area and abundance roi second data over 24 h across 34 non consecutive days extracted with a weekly interval from the data collected in 2020 again 0p5x data were down sampled to one frame every 6 seconds then rois were classified with the cnn model and finally aggregated into coarse taxonomic groups community diversity community diversity metrics were estimated using roi counts performed manually classification and counting of images for the 5p0x magnification and automatically cnn for the 0p5x magnification for both comparisons the number of data points used amounted to the weekly samples taken for traditional plankton monitoring methods n 44 for phytoplankton and 30 for zooplankton richness shannon diversity and pilou s evenness were calculated using functions of the r package vegan 2 5 6 and linear density data relationships between traditional monitoring and dspc in terms of plankton abundance and diversity were estimated using least squares linear regression 3 results 3 1 laboratory calibration to assess the dspc sensitivity in automatically detecting objects how such detection scales with plankton densities and its accuracy in extracting object features such as plankton body size i e the area of the object in two dimensions we performed laboratory experiments to compare dspc results with traditional manual microscopy methods we used living phytoplankton cultures protists cultures daphnia cultures and field samples for rotifers copepods and other zooplankton species selected species represented a wide range of sizes from tetraedron minimum 0 00018 mm2 to daphnia magna 3 2 mm2 overall we found a strong linear relationship in log log space log10 r2 0 959 between inverted microscopy area calculation based on imagej versus automated imaging and roi area extraction using the dspc fig 2 the relationship indicates that size estimates tended to be larger in the dspc for both magnifications we observed a stronger deviation from the linear relationship at the smaller size end fig 2 a shows how the lower resolution for smaller taxa in dspc images makes small objects appear overpixeld and blurry biasing the automated edge detection and therefore area estimation the only taxon lying below the 1 1 line was volvox aureus a very large phytoplankton colony for which we detected many partial images individual size distributions for each taxon confirmed an overestimation of size as roi area at the lower size end in both magnifications density distributions of size estimates overlapped better for larger taxa i e daphnia cephalodella oocystis compared to smaller taxa i e keratella quadrata scenedesmus acuminatus tetraedron minimum supplemental fig s1 for all taxa density estimations by microscopy scaled significantly and accurately with roi s detected by the dspc fig 3 r2 0 89 and r2 0 73 for phytoplankton and zooplankton respectively we compared the number of objects detected per second i e per frame in the dspc to density measurements obtained by inverted microscopy for small 5p0x and stereomicroscopy for large 0p5x plankton organisms we performed serial dilutions of zoo and phytoplankton taxa ranging of different sizes 118 um2 3 2 mm2 the overall scaling was more consistent across taxa for 5p0x magnification than for 0p5x however the strength of the relationship did not depend on size 3 2 field deployment and biodiversity dynamics to explore the potential of the new in situ imaging approach for automated monitoring of plankton community dynamics we installed a dual magnification dspc permanently at the stationary depth of 3 m at the eawag platform in the middle of lake greifensee switzerland www aquascope ch the instrument has been operating autonomously with rare interruptions of a few days a year for maintenance since april 2018 during this time we have acquired imaging data to describe the dynamics of the planktonic food web at high temporal frequency and regularly taken samples with traditional monitoring approaches to compare biodiversity measurements by the dspc to standard sampling and analysis methods patterns collected between 2018 2020 highlight seasonal successions and bloom dynamics circadian rhythms in abundance and size comparisons with traditional methods reveal the advantages and limitations of this new approach 3 2 1 dspc characterization of plankton diversity in over two years of data collection in lake greifensee we could identify 28 plankton taxa with the 0p5x magnification mostly zooplankton and 80 taxa with 5p0x magnification mostly phytoplankton some taxa were present in both magnifications i e ciliates rotifers and large phytoplankton colonies fig 4 a displays a collage of images representing the diversity of plankton as was observed with the dual magnification dspc in the field which encompassed primary producers mixotrophs herbivore grazers and carnivore zooplankton qualitatively the high resolution and dark field background of images made taxon identification possible and facilitated image processing and training of a deep learning classifier for zooplankton see further sections with both morphology and color playing an important role the dspc imaging approach represented a non invasive and unbiased method to study plankton in the field since taxa and their microenvironment were monitored without disturbing natural behavior heterospecific aggregates and colonies structures fig 4 b d some potentially toxic algae such as the cyanobacteria mycrocystis or planktothrix were successfully imaged and clearly recognized fig 4 b apart from colonies and natural aggregates such as lake snow fig 4 c we observed direct interactions between for example hosts and parasites fig 4 d or predators and prey fig 4 f some of these images might be the first ever to capture direct individual trophic interactions in freshwater microbes from the field such as ciliates and rotifers preying on phytoplankton fig 4 f colored images enabled us to distinguish between living and dead cells and to observe plankton division and reproduction i e by imaging dividing cells or individuals carrying eggs fig 4 e for some large zooplankton like daphnia it is possible to count eggs from images the images also allowed us to identify and count different life stages of zooplankton as is the case for juvenile copepods and nauplii 3 2 2 comparison with traditional sampling and microscopy we compared phytoplankton and zooplankton biodiversity metrics estimated by the dspc at 3 m to those obtained by traditional monitoring methods our regular monitoring campaign in lake greifensee with manual sampling and microscopy captured in total 159 different zoo and phytoplankton taxa supplemental table s5 we could observe 88 7 141 of them in the dspc we noticed that issues in identification arise when relatively small or thin taxa are not imaged i e chromulina sp or leptothrix sp from the dspc images we could create 101 unique and distinguishable zoo or phytoplankton taxa categories of them 95 were identified at least to genus level which is about 30 less than what can be archived with traditional microscopy i e a total of 134 taxa identified at genus level the taxonomic identification in dspc images was variable depending on the taxon and on whether the characters that are used for classification were distinguishable from the images for both magnifications taxonomic classification was harder at the lower end of the detection spectrum of the cameras phytoplankton richness estimates by the two approaches were in overall agreement however considering the differences in both sampling and analysis methods the dspc data systematically underestimates richness compared to traditional methods fig 5 a temporal trends in phytoplankton richness highlighted this offset which varied over time depending on phytoplankton community composition the data showed better agreement between the two approaches in winter when fewer and easily detectable taxa such as cryptomonas sp were present fig 5 b zooplankton communities are in general less rich than phytoplankton and both approaches detected low diversity in our samples max 11 species we did not find a significant correlation between zooplankton richness estimates by dspc and traditional methods and the relationship appeared even negative fig 5 c in the case of zooplankton richness estimation the dspc which averaged data over a 24 h period detected higher richness than the traditional method based on a daytime net tow and microscopy total phytoplankton and zooplankton community densities estimated by the dspc agreed well with data from traditional sampling methods fig 6 a b the phytoplankton relationship was statistically significant and robust roi s generated by the dspc correlated strongly also with chl a concentrations measured in situ next to the instrument fig 5 and supplemental fig s2 for zooplankton the relationship between density estimates by daytime net tows and dspc 24 h averages were statistically significant but poor fig 6 b the relationship between phytoplankton taxa relative abundances i e evenness by dspc and traditional methods was not statistically significant and poor with data however scattered around the 1 1 line fig 6 c zooplankton taxa evenness instead showed a significant and relatively strong relationship between the two approaches fig 6 d 3 2 3 seasonal patterns the dspc data in 2018 depicted the most intense algal bloom in lake greifensee since the early 1990s in terms of phytoplankton densities see chl a levels in fig 7 a roi s collected by the dspc for the 5p0x magnification correlated highly with the chl a measured by a ctd fluorometer at 3 m depth r2 0 94 p 0 001 supplemental fig s2 both chl a concentration and roi s by the dspc fig 7 showed a relatively small increase in phytoplankton at the end of july and then a large accumulation in the middle of september which was characterized by a relatively smaller mean phytoplankton community size roi area compared to non bloom periods fig 7 a the late summer bloom was dominated by the small single cell taxon oocystis sp as identified by dspc images while pre bloom communities were more heterogeneous supplemental fig s3 patterns of co occurring zooplankton taxa and their abundance roi s showed that relatively high density of herbivore grazers particularly daphnids in the pre bloom phase middle of august was followed by a decrease in their abundance after the dspc detected the presence of carnivore species particularly leptodora at the onset of the phytoplankton bloom fig 7 b this release from top down grazing pressure might have been involved in the emergence of the bloom which was dominated by a small edible taxon at the end of september the algal bloom declined as we observed an increase in small fast growing herbivores i e rotifers which might have been involved in bloom termination fig 7 b 3 2 4 diel patterns time series generated by the dspc which was set for 10 min of measurements every hour 24 7 allowed the study of diel size dynamics and of zooplankton day night migratory behavior fig 8 phytoplankton mean community size showed to be slightly larger during the day compared to the night when both grazing and cell division mostly occur fig 8 a zooplankton mean community size was larger instead during the night than during the day fig 8 b this was likely due to different migration behaviors of large relative to small herbivore grazers fig 8 c f copepods and daphnids were more abundant higher roi s during the night and peaked between midnight and 3 am fig 8 c d during the day daphnids were almost undetectable conversely nauplii and rotifers the most abundant group at 3 m did not show any significant circadian patterns fig 8 e f 4 discussion the dspc allowed imaging plankton individuals colonies and aggregates of taxa and other suspended solids e g lake snow without disrupting natural arrangements of interacting organisms their micro environment or their behavior the instrument reliably delivered high resolution images in real time and measurements of traits like size shape and color this included detection capability across a wide reaching size range of the planktonic food web capturing around 90 of the plankton taxa in lake greifensee when compared to traditional monitoring plankton taxa found in lake greifensee including for example herbivore grazer i e copepods and daphnids or toxic cyanobacteria i e microcystis sp and planktothrix rubescens are common members of plankton communities in all temperate lakes suggesting that the dspc could be effective across other lakes and reservoirs detecting particles from nanoplankton to mesoplankton with high resolution is a dynamic range never achieved before in other in situ imaging systems lombard et al 2019 taxonomic identification was variable depending on the detected taxon and the resolution of the image in general the colored images with dark backgrounds afforded high object definition and contrast qualities that facilitate the identification of taxa and the annotation of rois for the training of deep learning models automated image classification was achieved for plankton with the 0p5x magnification in this study supplemental methods and elsewhere campbell et al 2020 orenstein et al 2020 the training of a phytoplankton classifier will be manageable with relatively low effort kenitz et al 2020 however more tedious due to the larger number of taxa to annotate an approach based on imaging has the potential to yield high frequency and standardized plankton monitoring data lombard et al 2019 and boosted by continuous and open source advances in image processing and artificial intelligence offers the prospect to automate and standardize the taxonomic classification of plankton macleod et al 2010 time series collected by the stationary dspc in lake greifensee depicted seasonal succession patterns bloom dynamics and circadian fluctuations with a temporal and spatial i e microenvironment and morphology resolution that would have been virtually impossible to collect based on traditional methods in particular the dspc data included all essential planktonic groups to understand and forecast community dynamics including algal blooms but are often overlooked in routine monitoring e g ciliates chytrid fungi fig 2 in addition automated underwater imaging allows following the dynamics of important individual level traits distributions such as size shape and pigmentation which are extremely hard to measure manually on large numbers of individuals morphological characteristics of phytoplankton e g length surface coloniality and pigmentation correlate with species functional properties e g resource acquisition growth rate sinking rate grazing resistance and therefore with population abundances and responses to environmental gradients fontana et al 2019 kruk et al 2010 pomati et al 2013 in this study dspc imaging and feature extraction allowed calculation of bi dimensional areas for rois which related well to areas of plankton taxa based on traditional microscopy and manual measurements although measured in two dimensions the body size estimates by one or two linear dimensions scale with biovolume estimates by traditional methods mittler et al 2019 body size was overestimated by the dspc at the lower size end where both regression lines for the 0p5x and 5p0x magnification deviated for smaller species from a perfect 1 1 relationship the deviation was due to a lack of resolution in pixels for smaller individuals particularly when slightly out of focus this error can be corrected using the relationship derived by laboratory calibration fig 2 the overestimation of size would be even greater when using estimates of 3 d biovolume rather than 2 d area and care should be given when calculating biovolume estimates similarly dspc measures of plankton densities roi s or alternatively roi frame can be translated into a number of individuals per unit of volume e g l based on the laboratory calibration fig 3 note however that the initial densities in our laboratory experiments were much higher than those usually found in nature for the goal of an absolute quantitation of plankton densities we suggest a laboratory calibration targeted towards specific instrument settings and realistic densities measuring densities based on detected roi s would be suitable to estimate relative abundances other issues emerging from the comparison of dspc data with traditional plankton sampling include i the difference between methods in terms of sampled volume that is used to estimate plankton community indices ii no detection of phytoplankton 10 μm resulting in an underestimation of some small but common species iii the spatial heterogeneity and circadian behavior of zooplankton the dspc imaged volume supplemental table s1 is small compared to traditional monitoring samples and variable depending on water optical conditions orenstein et al 2020 unlike traditional counting methods the dspc cannot easily change sampled volume to respond to changes in densities while we can increase imaging sampling effort by applying a space for time substitution assessing the actual differences in sample size between dspc and traditional methods remains difficult this disagreement in sampled volume which applies to almost all automated in situ methods has been already acknowledged lombard et al 2019 while automated imaging data allow the scaling of measures of diversity based on sample size e g by temporally aggregating data and applying rarefaction and probability estimate of metrics chase and knight 2013 this is generally impossible with traditional sampling methods those differences in scaling hamper our understanding of why imaging and traditional methods sometimes fail to converge to the same diversity estimates fig 5 6 the dspc showed difficulties in detecting small species for the 5p0x magnification and in quantifying densities of large rare species including carnivorous zooplankton for the 0p5x magnification the lack of taxonomic resolution for small phytoplankton taxa in 5p0x is a limitation of the optical system itself solvable by an extra higher magnification the correlations between dspc and microscopy estimates for phytoplankton richness and total abundance were however robust figs 5 a and 6 a with the limitations in taxonomic resolution becoming more evident in the comparison of relative abundance estimates fig 6 c the lack of reliable quantitation of large zooplankton taxa in the 0p5x magnification instead resides in the relationship between spatial density and body size of organisms white et al 2007 imaging with the dspc for a longer time particularly at night when these organisms are more active might ameliorate this problem by increasing the sampling effort due to a relatively small focal volume however large individuals tend to be imaged and cropped multiple times we suggest that large carnivorous zooplankton can only be studied with presence absence data or during periods when their densities reach very high levels zooplankton species have patchy distributions and exhibit diel vertical and horizontal migrations measuring their community and population properties could lead to systematic biases if based on non replicated or only daytime samples doubek et al 2020 we propose that the poor correlation between dspc and traditional sampling for zooplankton richness and abundances was caused by the heterogeneous distribution of taxa over space and time further supported by high levels of variation among replicated samples particularly for traditional methods fig s7 in this perspective dspc data integrated over 24 h and including day night samples may be more trustworthy than the traditional daytime net tows which have been previously suggested not to be an appropriate approach for monitoring doubek et al 2020 availability of high resolution real time plankton data represents a potential breakthrough in both applied and fundamental plankton ecology and might be more important for water quality monitoring than a fine taxonomic resolution high frequency data have been shown to provide exciting prospects for modeling understanding and predicting plankton dynamics and ecosystem processes fontana et al 2018 thomas et al 2018 the seasonal patterns depicted in fig 7 highlight the rich description of the ecological succession of taxa that dspc data can offer for studying plankton communities natural processes fostering high plankton biodiversity on one hand and leading to the emergence of harmful algal blooms on the other hand represent unresolved questions in aquatic ecology burford et al 2020 fox et al 2010 huisman et al 2018 li and chesson 2016 the dspc was able to detect and count all the most common and potentially toxic cyanobacterial taxa forming blooms in lakes including their large colonies fig 2 if supported by an automated deep learning classifier and paired with meteorological and ctd data and or a calibrated lake process models the dspc could be instrumental to develop forecasting models for harmful cyanobacterial blooms and the stability and biodiversity of natural plankton communities pomati et al 2011 thomas et al 2018 time series generated by instruments like the dspc can be combined with novel data analysis approaches including equation free modeling and machine learning to reverse engineer community ecology based on observational information and to develop effective forecasting tools deyle et al 2016 martin et al 2018 sugihara et al 2012 thomas et al 2018 the combination of high frequency data a broad taxonomic spectrum and artificial intelligence for data assimilation and modeling presents an unparalleled potential for capturing the processes acting in natural ecosystems this approach offers great opportunities to advance our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the dynamics of the complex networks of interacting plankton species 5 conclusions the dspc presented in this article allowed us to obtain automated plankton data at the food web level with high temporal frequency and adequate image resolution the plankton camera employed here was demonstrated to be very robust and reliable showed low requirements in terms of maintenance and running costs and offered complete automation we conclude from our comparison with traditional monitoring methods that the dspc is mature as a research tool and suitable for stable continuous deployment with great potential for application in water quality monitoring automated in situ imaging data are available in real time and they are shareable traceable transparent and independently verifiable biases in the data processing and analysis can be corrected by simply re processing and re analyzing archived raw data yet new generation monitoring tools like the dspc present the challenge of managing and analyzing large datasets this might prove particularly relevant if underwater imaging cameras become more affordable and to increase sampling effort or account for spatial variability in water bodies both vertical and horizontal multiple instruments are employed locally and used in full time operation e g to gain power for density estimates of rare taxa recent publications suggest that this transition from relatively expensive tools to more affordable and therefore scalable instruments are already underway lertvilai 2020 streamlined and open source data management protocols image processing software and automated image

independent data we rely on abstention to be able to tune the precision recall trade off in a simple manner this consists of labeling as unclassified all the images for which the classifier has a confidence lower than a threshold θ in fig s7 we show the precision and recall of our model with θ 0 on the classes that are relevant for our study the average precision is 0 84 and the average recall is 0 8 if we set θ 0 8 the average precision is 0 91 and the average recall is 0 67 which means that around 30 of the data is not being classified but the data that gets classified has a very low error rate the data shown in this paper uses θ 0 8 since in this study we were interested in a higher level taxonomic description of the observed organisms we created some macro classes each comprising more than one of the classes described in table s3 obviously the classifier performances with the macro classes are at least as good as those of fig s7 
16727,the dual scripps plankton camera dspc is a new approach for automated in situ monitoring of phyto and zooplankton communities based on a dual magnification dark field imaging microscope here we present the dspc and its associated image processing while evaluating its capabilities in i detecting and characterizing plankton species of different size and taxonomic categories and ii measuring their abundance in both laboratory and field applications in the laboratory body size and abundance estimates by the dspc significantly and robustly scaled with measurements derived by microscopy in the field a dspc installed permanently at 3 m depth in lake greifensee switzerland delivered images of plankton individuals colonies and heterospecific aggregates at hourly timescales without disrupting natural arrangements of interacting organisms their microenvironment or their behavior the dspc was able to track the dynamics of taxa mostly at the genus level in the size range between 10 μm to 1 cm covering many components of the planktonic food web including parasites and potentially toxic cyanobacteria comparing data from the field deployed dspc to traditional sampling and microscopy revealed a general overall agreement in estimates of plankton diversity and abundances the most significant disagreements between traditional methods and the dspc resided in the measurements of zooplankton community properties our data suggest that the dspc is better equipped to study the dynamics and demography of heterogeneously distributed organisms such as zooplankton because high temporal resolution and continuous sampling offer more information and less variability in taxa detection and quantification than traditional sampling time series collected by the dspc depicted ecological succession patterns algal bloom dynamics and diel fluctuations with a temporal frequency and morphological resolution that was never observed by traditional methods access to high frequency reproducible and real time data of a large spectrum of the planktonic ecosystem expands our understanding of both applied and fundamental plankton ecology we conclude the dspc is robust for

introduction plankton are a key component of global ecology that play important roles in carbon and nutrient cycling as well as providing essential services to human society e g clean water and fisheries behrenfeld et al 2001 falkowski 2012 plankton or drifters is a collective term for all organisms that inhabit aqueous ecosystems that are unable to control their horizontal position in the water column hence plankton comprises both prokaryotes and eukaryotes phytoplankton are the planktonic photosynthetic autotrophs and the primary producers of the pelagic open water ecosystem while zooplankton comprises consumers that can be either herbivores carnivores or both most phytoplankton clades contain mixotrophic taxa which combine photosynthesis with phagotrophic uptake of prey usually bacteria or small protists the phytoplankton are composed of an enormous variety of taxa shapes and sizes they span four orders of magnitude in size from roughly 1 µm to 1 mm overlapping with the zooplankton size range while a single zooplankton sample in a lake may consist of several tens of taxa the phytoplankton inventory of a lake may comprise hundreds of them their short lifespans and strong sensitivity to environmental conditions make plankton effective indicators of environmental change and ecosystem health and they are used to assess water and aquatic ecosystem quality worldwide xu 2001 directive 2000 60 ec information about plankton biomass and community composition including variation among key functional traits is essential to judge the state of ecological systems according to the water framework directive in europe directive 2000 60 ec plankton biodiversity surveys are also crucial to evaluate the resilience to change of ecosystem processes extinctions and invasions and to manage ecosystem services bartley et al 2019 cardinale et al 2012 pomati et al 2011 assessing plankton community composition is critically important for the monitoring and forecasting of harmful algal blooms events of algal overgrowth that are dominated by toxic species in freshwater ecosystems cyanobacterial blooms cause large ecological and economical damage huisman et al 2018 and have been increasing worldwide due to the effects of land use and climate change chorus and bartram 1999 ho et al 2019 given the importance of plankton for ecosystem processes and services there is not only scientific interest but also a societal need and a policy requirement for monitoring plankton communities at low cost and ideally in real time initiatives such as the water framework directive in europe demand that policymakers achieve good status for all water bodies and secure drinking water supplies for the population requiring member states to consistently monitor aquatic biodiversity including plankton communities and indicator species directive 2000 60 ec the assessment of plankton community composition and taxa relative abundance is however the most difficult time consuming and expensive aspect pomati et al 2011 dedicated laboratories use skilled and trained taxonomists to identify and count microalgae and zooplankton manually sometimes taking several hours to count a sample taxonomists frequently misclassify items count some objects more than once or overlook others macleod et al 2010 and mistakes are not traceable back in time in many monitoring programs microscope counts are only completed weeks or months after samples are collected and are therefore unable to provide information in a timely actionable manner sample collection transport and storage also demand proper infrastructure and personnel time aquatic ecosystem monitoring would hence tremendously benefit from an automated reliable standalone system for plankton identification classification and counting that produces transparent and reproducible results not dependent on personal judgment in near real time and that does not require sample collection and storage additional costs several automated quantitative tools for plankton counting have been established for use in the laboratory e g flow cam flow cytometry microscopy imaging zooscan and in the field e g fluorescence probes cytobuoy flowcytobot imaging cameras reviewed in lombard et al 2019 laboratory based tools can automate counting and sorting but still require sample collection and processing which changes the nature of the sample and requires time resources and infrastructure field applications are more promising but they too have limitations fluorescence sensors measuring chlorophyll a phycocyanin or other photosynthetic pigments are common and widely deployed in the field but they are unable to resolve taxonomic distinctions beyond coarse levels and pigment content within and across species can vary widely making estimates of abundances and biomass difficult johnson and martiny 2015 automated in situ flow cytometry has shown encouraging results for high frequency monitoring of phytoplankton community dynamics and morpho physiological traits fontana et al 2018 hunter cevera et al 2016 pomati et al 2011 sosik et al 2010 flow cytometry complemented by water physics and chemistry data and machine learning for analysis demonstrated the potential of high frequency information for modeling environmental responses and predicting phytoplankton dynamics thomas et al 2018 the dynamics of single species of phytoplankton and microzooplankton can be tracked and studied with flow cytometry if assisted by imaging hunter cevera et al 2016 lombard et al 2019 still flow cytometers require constant maintenance and calibration and may disrupt natural spatial aggregates while sampling additionally they have limited dynamic range in terms of size often being able to follow the dynamics of a single trophic level only lombard et al 2019 for phytoplankton particularly high frequency data of herbivore zooplankton could be essential to study variation in top down controls as a response to environmental change murphy et al 2020 here we describe a monitoring approach based on dark field underwater imaging by means of a dual magnification camera derived from the scripps plankton camera spc system orenstein et al 2020 it was designed to be a flexible easily configurable imaging system that can observe objects from 10s of microns to several millimeters and sample at high temporal frequency with minimal influence on the fluid being imaged similar cameras have been successfully deployed in marine systems murphy et al 2020 orenstein et al 2020 but never deployed before in freshwater environments in this study we compared the dspc to traditional microscopy and high frequency fluorescence based monitoring using both field and laboratory comparisons we then used this tool to observe plankton dynamics and trait distributions e g size across the whole planktonic food web in situ in the eutrophic lake greifensee with high temporal resolution days hours our results promote underwater imaging as an auspicious approach to generate empirical high resolution plankton time series 2 methods 2 1 description of the dual magnification camera 2 1 1 instrument s design the plankton camera dspc used in this study is a dual magnification dark field underwater microscope based on the scripps plankton camera spc system orenstein et al 2020 when compared to the original spc the dspc has several new features designed specifically to target plankton monitoring in freshwater first it is a dual magnification microscope extending the size range that can be photographed by overlapping spatial resolution fig 1 based on our trials the highest magnification 5p0x 5x magnification has a detection range between 10 μm 150 μm while the lower magnification 0p5x 0 5x magnification ranges between 100 μm 1 cm these estimates depend on the features of the imaged objects e g color transparency and therefore are not fixed the imaged volumes per frame for the two magnifications are from high resolution to blob detection 5p0x 0 2 10 μl 0p5x 4 200 μl respectively second internal batteries allow autonomous measurements for up to 3 hours without recharging which is needed for manual depth profiling or sampling of remote sites i e lakes ponds finally the distance between light sources and objective has been reduced to 5 cm to shorten the illumination path length and allow transmission of light in turbid waters e g during thick algal blooms the dspc is compact enough for one person to carry 57 cm l x 19 w 27 2 kg weight and is composed of two housings one with the led light sources and another with the controlling hardware cameras and lenses fig 1 the instrument has no moving parts therefore it has low maintenance requirements only cleaning of external surfaces housings have facing acrylic viewports that allow transmitting light from the led to the microscopes water flows freely between the two viewports to reduce fouling our system was complemented with a uv lamp https amloceanographic com biofouling control installed facing the acrylic viewports fig 1 the onboard computer uses a linux based operating system the camera works automatically there is no need for regular calibration and if installed in a monitoring platform like the dspc at lake greifensee pictures can be available in real time if a power supply computer and internet are available the acquisition rate for pictures can be easily modified the maximum rate is 10 frames per second recording of videos is also possible the actual specifics of the instrument can be found in supplemental table s1 the configurations of the machine used for imaging are reported in the methods section relative to laboratory and field application 2 1 2 image processing we use a modified version of the original python spcconvert image processing script orenstein et al 2020 which converts raw regions of interest rois from the plankton camera into image mosaics and extracts statistics per processed sample and features of detected objects the process consists of color conversion edge detection and segmentation morphological feature extraction foreground masking and inverse filtering of the masked foreground the results are then saved into a new directory and a web app html file is built from the data showing converted pictures the program creates a spreadsheet with 64 features e g area aspect ratio max length or orientation color features and more of every detected object the original python code can be found here https github com tooploox spcconvert because of their complex shape and moveable appendages measuring body size in zooplankton is not straightforward often zooplankton can be much wider than they are long when antennas are included e g copepods meaning that the major axis cannot reliably be used moreover the presence of predators and other stressors also influences the overall shape of zooplankton and can induce the growth of defensive structures e g spines helmets and elongated tails further complicating the estimation of body size tollrian and drew harvell 1999 to overcome these complexities we developed the daphnia ruler https github com nelstevens the daphnia ruler which effectively removes these appendages from calculations of zooplankton body size using the same edge detection concepts as spcconvert the outline of the zooplankton is refined by repeatedly eroding and dilating the binary image with round structuring elements of varying sizes until a threshold solidity is reached indicating that all protuberances have been sufficiently removed the resulting ellipse can then be treated as the core body and measured as for any other spheroid planktonic object 2 2 annotation of images and classification based on deep learning many labeled pictures are needed to create a training database for an automatic classification based on deep learning we utilized a free and open source platform taxonify which expedites the process of species annotation through this platform one can rapidly label pictures to taxon level and can add additional attributes to the pictures e g colonies dividing or parasites present more information can be found on https www taxonify org and software codes are freely available at https github com tooploox taxonify gui for this study we annotated a variable amount of images per class of interest mainly zooplankton in the 0p5x magnification ranging from a minimum of 10 chaoborus to a maximum of 3321 dinobryon supplemental table s2 we then developed an automated deep learning classifier for objects detected by the 0p5x magnification of the dspc the model we used was a convolutional neural network cnn trained to distinguish 34 different classes of zooplankton phytoplankton and other suspended solids junk supplemental table s2 in the si text we describe the used cnn and its hyperparameters and we show a series of validation benchmarks we provide access to the code and a ready to use release of the classifier at the following address https github com mbaityje plankifier releases tag v1 1 1 the default code settings contain all hyperparameter values used in this study 2 3 laboratory calibration of dspc imaging to use the dspc in the laboratory the space between the two viewports fig 1 was covered with a black rubber sheet and flooded with water tissue culture flasks containing the imaged samples were manually held in the focal plane of the dspc between the viewports to take measurements for cultures where the sedimentation rate was high we mixed the sample every 30 seconds with a pasteur pipette through the lid of the flask 2 3 1 calibration of plankton body size estimates we compared body size estimates for small 5p0x and large 0p5x plankton organisms by the dspc featuring automated object detection and features extraction to body size measurements done with images taken by inverted microscopy using manual object detection and feature extraction using imagej https imagej nih gov ij having information on only two dimensions size was evaluated as the area of objects rather than volume for the comparison only rois by dspc that were comparable to manual microscopy i e not cropped and imaged from the frontal plane were selected and used for feature extraction i e object area body size was estimated from dspc images using spc convert scripts see section 2 1 2 taxon specific mean body size was calculated by taking an average area in pixels overall saved objects both for dspc and microscopy 5p0x magnification we used the following phytoplankton cultures aphanizomenon flos aquae cyclotella meneghiniana scenedesmus acuminatus tetraedron minimum eudorina unicocca lagerheimia hindakii staurastrum punctulatum cosmarium botrytis oocystis solitaria planktothrix rubescens cystodinium sp volvox aureus peridinium sp all cultures were grown in wc medium guillard 1975 under standard conditions 20 c and 10 14 light dark cycle for at least 2 weeks cultures of two small zooplankton were also imaged at 5p0x magnification the protist euglena sp and the rotifer cephalodella sp these were grown under standard conditions and with a protozoan pellet medium provided by carolinatm biological supply company burlington nc usa a volume of 2 10 ml depending on initial culture densities was inoculated into a 25 cm2 tissue culture flask vented cap sterile vwr 743 2311 and topped with tap water to a final volume of 60 ml 0p5x magnification we used the two large protists blepharisma sp spirostomum sp which were grown under the same conditions as the protists used for 5p0x calibration we also used living samples of copepods sp daphnia sp keratella quadrata keratella cochlearis and kellicotia sp taken from lake greifensee switzerland traditional microscopy an aliquot of the imaged sample was taken and photographed with a light inverted microscope leica dmi8 magnification x160 or x320 depending on the size of the plankton species using imagej the maximum and minimum axis lengths perpendicular were manually measured for 50 to 200 individuals and then used to calculate the object area by applying an ellipses formula 2 3 2 calibration of dspc object detection relative to plankton density we compared the average number of objects detected per frame i e per second in the dspc to density measurements obtained by inverted microscopy for small 5p0x and stereomicroscopy for large 0p5x plankton organisms in serial dilutions this dspc metric is not sensitive to frame rate and we tested its comparability to volumetric measurements 5p0x magnification the following cultures were used scenedesmus acuminatus oocystis solitaria tetraedron minimum botryococcus braunii euglena sp and cephalodella sp for this experiment we used culturing flasks as in the previous experiment an initial sample of 0 5 to 10 ml of the culture was taken and topped to 60 ml with tap water after imaging each culture for 5 minutes 30 ml of the samples were replaced with tap water to prepare the next dilution step 1 2 dilution followed by imaging with the dspc this was repeated for five dilution steps for scenedesmus acuminatus oocystis solitaria tetraedron minimum botryococcus braunii and six dilution steps for euglena sp and cephalodella sp images were then sorted out manually whereas cropped or wrong images were not considered the initial culture density was estimated from a subsample counted manually under an inverted microscope 0p5x magnification cultures of three daphnia species of different size classes d magna d longispina d cucullata were used they were diluted 1 2 in six decreasing levels from 200 to 7 individuals counted manually and imaged in a culturing flask total volume of 60 ml for 5 minutes each the images were manually sorted first all pictures containing daphnia including cropped or and not in focus were used for density estimation second for the size estimation only pictures of daphnia in focus and not cropped were considered 2 4 field deployment and comparison with traditional monitoring 2 4 1 automated deployment and monitoring station the dual magnification dspc was installed at our automated monitoring station located in greifensee a peri alpine eutrophic lake in switzerland 47 35 n 8 68 e specific details about the automated monitoring platform can be found in pomati et al 2011 the station features a multiparametric probe ocean7 and an automated profiler https www idronaut it a meteorological station ws700 umb from ott hydrometrie lufft a local computer and data network by 4g modem allowing data transmission all data are streamlined and published in real time on our website www aquascope ch 2 4 2 dspc settings and data the dspc is permanently installed at a depth of 3 m monitoring the plankton community hourly for 10 minutes at the start of every hour at an imaging rate of 1 frame second the weekly maintenance consisted of cleaning the viewports which did not require uninstalling the dspc and bringing it to the laboratory the dspc never experienced any major structural damage and the yearly maintenance was performed only for replacing an anode cleaning and checking internal humidity no interruption of function was caused by the failure of hardware the longest interruption was due to the use of the dspc during an international exposition in january 2019 which required uninstalling it from the monitoring station for a month phytoplankton for comparisons with traditional monitoring we used only the 5p0x magnification and selected the images of the dspc that were taken in the same hour as a microscopy sample this was mostly between 10 00 12 00 in the morning the whole 10 minutes of running time and associated images were used the images were then classified taxonomically to the lowest possible classification level zooplankton we used only the 0p5x magnification data and aggregated discrete hourly samples over an entire day to allow for comparisons with traditional twin net tows specifically we took the mean of a 24 h running time 10 minutes every hour this was to increase dspc sample size since net tows concentrate hundreds of liters of water the images of 0p5x magnification were subset to every 6 seconds in order to exclude multiple imaging of the same object since some individuals were observed to remain in the focal plane of the camera for some seconds particularly when the water was calm the images were then classified at the lowest possible taxonomic level using the trained cnn described in section 2 2 2 4 3 traditional sampling and microscopy water samples were taken every week for 12 consecutive months starting in april 2019 except for winter months november early march 2020 when we sampled fortnightly all samples were taken between 10 00 and 12 00 in the morning phytoplankton water samples were taken near the dspc at 3 m depth with a 5 l niskin bottle an aliquot of 50 ml was fixed with lugol s iodine solution and then identified and counted in the laboratory under an inverted microscope utermöhl method zooplankton integrated water column samples starting from march 2020 onwards were taken with a 95 μm twin net from 17 m to the surface samples were filtered with a 95 μm mesh and fixed in 50 ml of 100 ethanol identification and counting were done under a stereomicroscope 2 5 data analysis all data analyses and plotting were performed in the r programming environment https www r project org all the laboratory and monitoring data from this study are available at https doi org 10 25678 0004bw 2 5 1 laboratory calibration body size we calculated the size of objects as 2 dimensional areas of the object mask as automatically provided by our image processing scripts for dspc or manually per each taxon in microscopy we used a least squares linear regression to correlate microscopy measurements the benchmark and measures taken by the dspc in log10 space size density curves were done by using geom density from the ggplot2 package on untransformed areas geom density ggplot2 3 2 1 density measurements were log10 transformed with zeros set to an arbitrarily low value 0 1 before the transformation when dilution series were run multiple times we took the mean between technical repeats density estimates by microscopy the benchmark and dspc were then compared using linear regression for each taxon similarly an overall relationship between microscopy and dspc was calculated with linear regression in log10 space for each magnification 2 5 2 field application seasonal patterns we estimated the mean size of the phytoplankton community as the area of rois detected by the 5p0x magnification and its densities using the dspc data from 2018 as a comparison to dspc density estimates we used the chlorophyll a chl a concentration recorded by the ctd probe fluorimeter https chelsea co uk products trilux using averages of chl a measurements from 2 9 to 3 1 m from each profile we classified objects at 0p5x magnification including zooplankton taxa and several large colonial phytoplankton with the trained cnn using images sampled from the full dataset every 6 seconds again to avoid multiple images of the same object counts were then aggregated into coarser taxonomic levels copepods daphnids rotifers predators and nauplia day night patterns to study phytoplankton daily division cells grow during the day and divide during the night and the consequent change in community average size and zooplankton community day night migrations we used phyto and zooplankton body size area and abundance roi second data over 24 h across 34 non consecutive days extracted with a weekly interval from the data collected in 2020 again 0p5x data were down sampled to one frame every 6 seconds then rois were classified with the cnn model and finally aggregated into coarse taxonomic groups community diversity community diversity metrics were estimated using roi counts performed manually classification and counting of images for the 5p0x magnification and automatically cnn for the 0p5x magnification for both comparisons the number of data points used amounted to the weekly samples taken for traditional plankton monitoring methods n 44 for phytoplankton and 30 for zooplankton richness shannon diversity and pilou s evenness were calculated using functions of the r package vegan 2 5 6 and linear density data relationships between traditional monitoring and dspc in terms of plankton abundance and diversity were estimated using least squares linear regression 3 results 3 1 laboratory calibration to assess the dspc sensitivity in automatically detecting objects how such detection scales with plankton densities and its accuracy in extracting object features such as plankton body size i e the area of the object in two dimensions we performed laboratory experiments to compare dspc results with traditional manual microscopy methods we used living phytoplankton cultures protists cultures daphnia cultures and field samples for rotifers copepods and other zooplankton species selected species represented a wide range of sizes from tetraedron minimum 0 00018 mm2 to daphnia magna 3 2 mm2 overall we found a strong linear relationship in log log space log10 r2 0 959 between inverted microscopy area calculation based on imagej versus automated imaging and roi area extraction using the dspc fig 2 the relationship indicates that size estimates tended to be larger in the dspc for both magnifications we observed a stronger deviation from the linear relationship at the smaller size end fig 2 a shows how the lower resolution for smaller taxa in dspc images makes small objects appear overpixeld and blurry biasing the automated edge detection and therefore area estimation the only taxon lying below the 1 1 line was volvox aureus a very large phytoplankton colony for which we detected many partial images individual size distributions for each taxon confirmed an overestimation of size as roi area at the lower size end in both magnifications density distributions of size estimates overlapped better for larger taxa i e daphnia cephalodella oocystis compared to smaller taxa i e keratella quadrata scenedesmus acuminatus tetraedron minimum supplemental fig s1 for all taxa density estimations by microscopy scaled significantly and accurately with roi s detected by the dspc fig 3 r2 0 89 and r2 0 73 for phytoplankton and zooplankton respectively we compared the number of objects detected per second i e per frame in the dspc to density measurements obtained by inverted microscopy for small 5p0x and stereomicroscopy for large 0p5x plankton organisms we performed serial dilutions of zoo and phytoplankton taxa ranging of different sizes 118 um2 3 2 mm2 the overall scaling was more consistent across taxa for 5p0x magnification than for 0p5x however the strength of the relationship did not depend on size 3 2 field deployment and biodiversity dynamics to explore the potential of the new in situ imaging approach for automated monitoring of plankton community dynamics we installed a dual magnification dspc permanently at the stationary depth of 3 m at the eawag platform in the middle of lake greifensee switzerland www aquascope ch the instrument has been operating autonomously with rare interruptions of a few days a year for maintenance since april 2018 during this time we have acquired imaging data to describe the dynamics of the planktonic food web at high temporal frequency and regularly taken samples with traditional monitoring approaches to compare biodiversity measurements by the dspc to standard sampling and analysis methods patterns collected between 2018 2020 highlight seasonal successions and bloom dynamics circadian rhythms in abundance and size comparisons with traditional methods reveal the advantages and limitations of this new approach 3 2 1 dspc characterization of plankton diversity in over two years of data collection in lake greifensee we could identify 28 plankton taxa with the 0p5x magnification mostly zooplankton and 80 taxa with 5p0x magnification mostly phytoplankton some taxa were present in both magnifications i e ciliates rotifers and large phytoplankton colonies fig 4 a displays a collage of images representing the diversity of plankton as was observed with the dual magnification dspc in the field which encompassed primary producers mixotrophs herbivore grazers and carnivore zooplankton qualitatively the high resolution and dark field background of images made taxon identification possible and facilitated image processing and training of a deep learning classifier for zooplankton see further sections with both morphology and color playing an important role the dspc imaging approach represented a non invasive and unbiased method to study plankton in the field since taxa and their microenvironment were monitored without disturbing natural behavior heterospecific aggregates and colonies structures fig 4 b d some potentially toxic algae such as the cyanobacteria mycrocystis or planktothrix were successfully imaged and clearly recognized fig 4 b apart from colonies and natural aggregates such as lake snow fig 4 c we observed direct interactions between for example hosts and parasites fig 4 d or predators and prey fig 4 f some of these images might be the first ever to capture direct individual trophic interactions in freshwater microbes from the field such as ciliates and rotifers preying on phytoplankton fig 4 f colored images enabled us to distinguish between living and dead cells and to observe plankton division and reproduction i e by imaging dividing cells or individuals carrying eggs fig 4 e for some large zooplankton like daphnia it is possible to count eggs from images the images also allowed us to identify and count different life stages of zooplankton as is the case for juvenile copepods and nauplii 3 2 2 comparison with traditional sampling and microscopy we compared phytoplankton and zooplankton biodiversity metrics estimated by the dspc at 3 m to those obtained by traditional monitoring methods our regular monitoring campaign in lake greifensee with manual sampling and microscopy captured in total 159 different zoo and phytoplankton taxa supplemental table s5 we could observe 88 7 141 of them in the dspc we noticed that issues in identification arise when relatively small or thin taxa are not imaged i e chromulina sp or leptothrix sp from the dspc images we could create 101 unique and distinguishable zoo or phytoplankton taxa categories of them 95 were identified at least to genus level which is about 30 less than what can be archived with traditional microscopy i e a total of 134 taxa identified at genus level the taxonomic identification in dspc images was variable depending on the taxon and on whether the characters that are used for classification were distinguishable from the images for both magnifications taxonomic classification was harder at the lower end of the detection spectrum of the cameras phytoplankton richness estimates by the two approaches were in overall agreement however considering the differences in both sampling and analysis methods the dspc data systematically underestimates richness compared to traditional methods fig 5 a temporal trends in phytoplankton richness highlighted this offset which varied over time depending on phytoplankton community composition the data showed better agreement between the two approaches in winter when fewer and easily detectable taxa such as cryptomonas sp were present fig 5 b zooplankton communities are in general less rich than phytoplankton and both approaches detected low diversity in our samples max 11 species we did not find a significant correlation between zooplankton richness estimates by dspc and traditional methods and the relationship appeared even negative fig 5 c in the case of zooplankton richness estimation the dspc which averaged data over a 24 h period detected higher richness than the traditional method based on a daytime net tow and microscopy total phytoplankton and zooplankton community densities estimated by the dspc agreed well with data from traditional sampling methods fig 6 a b the phytoplankton relationship was statistically significant and robust roi s generated by the dspc correlated strongly also with chl a concentrations measured in situ next to the instrument fig 5 and supplemental fig s2 for zooplankton the relationship between density estimates by daytime net tows and dspc 24 h averages were statistically significant but poor fig 6 b the relationship between phytoplankton taxa relative abundances i e evenness by dspc and traditional methods was not statistically significant and poor with data however scattered around the 1 1 line fig 6 c zooplankton taxa evenness instead showed a significant and relatively strong relationship between the two approaches fig 6 d 3 2 3 seasonal patterns the dspc data in 2018 depicted the most intense algal bloom in lake greifensee since the early 1990s in terms of phytoplankton densities see chl a levels in fig 7 a roi s collected by the dspc for the 5p0x magnification correlated highly with the chl a measured by a ctd fluorometer at 3 m depth r2 0 94 p 0 001 supplemental fig s2 both chl a concentration and roi s by the dspc fig 7 showed a relatively small increase in phytoplankton at the end of july and then a large accumulation in the middle of september which was characterized by a relatively smaller mean phytoplankton community size roi area compared to non bloom periods fig 7 a the late summer bloom was dominated by the small single cell taxon oocystis sp as identified by dspc images while pre bloom communities were more heterogeneous supplemental fig s3 patterns of co occurring zooplankton taxa and their abundance roi s showed that relatively high density of herbivore grazers particularly daphnids in the pre bloom phase middle of august was followed by a decrease in their abundance after the dspc detected the presence of carnivore species particularly leptodora at the onset of the phytoplankton bloom fig 7 b this release from top down grazing pressure might have been involved in the emergence of the bloom which was dominated by a small edible taxon at the end of september the algal bloom declined as we observed an increase in small fast growing herbivores i e rotifers which might have been involved in bloom termination fig 7 b 3 2 4 diel patterns time series generated by the dspc which was set for 10 min of measurements every hour 24 7 allowed the study of diel size dynamics and of zooplankton day night migratory behavior fig 8 phytoplankton mean community size showed to be slightly larger during the day compared to the night when both grazing and cell division mostly occur fig 8 a zooplankton mean community size was larger instead during the night than during the day fig 8 b this was likely due to different migration behaviors of large relative to small herbivore grazers fig 8 c f copepods and daphnids were more abundant higher roi s during the night and peaked between midnight and 3 am fig 8 c d during the day daphnids were almost undetectable conversely nauplii and rotifers the most abundant group at 3 m did not show any significant circadian patterns fig 8 e f 4 discussion the dspc allowed imaging plankton individuals colonies and aggregates of taxa and other suspended solids e g lake snow without disrupting natural arrangements of interacting organisms their micro environment or their behavior the instrument reliably delivered high resolution images in real time and measurements of traits like size shape and color this included detection capability across a wide reaching size range of the planktonic food web capturing around 90 of the plankton taxa in lake greifensee when compared to traditional monitoring plankton taxa found in lake greifensee including for example herbivore grazer i e copepods and daphnids or toxic cyanobacteria i e microcystis sp and planktothrix rubescens are common members of plankton communities in all temperate lakes suggesting that the dspc could be effective across other lakes and reservoirs detecting particles from nanoplankton to mesoplankton with high resolution is a dynamic range never achieved before in other in situ imaging systems lombard et al 2019 taxonomic identification was variable depending on the detected taxon and the resolution of the image in general the colored images with dark backgrounds afforded high object definition and contrast qualities that facilitate the identification of taxa and the annotation of rois for the training of deep learning models automated image classification was achieved for plankton with the 0p5x magnification in this study supplemental methods and elsewhere campbell et al 2020 orenstein et al 2020 the training of a phytoplankton classifier will be manageable with relatively low effort kenitz et al 2020 however more tedious due to the larger number of taxa to annotate an approach based on imaging has the potential to yield high frequency and standardized plankton monitoring data lombard et al 2019 and boosted by continuous and open source advances in image processing and artificial intelligence offers the prospect to automate and standardize the taxonomic classification of plankton macleod et al 2010 time series collected by the stationary dspc in lake greifensee depicted seasonal succession patterns bloom dynamics and circadian fluctuations with a temporal and spatial i e microenvironment and morphology resolution that would have been virtually impossible to collect based on traditional methods in particular the dspc data included all essential planktonic groups to understand and forecast community dynamics including algal blooms but are often overlooked in routine monitoring e g ciliates chytrid fungi fig 2 in addition automated underwater imaging allows following the dynamics of important individual level traits distributions such as size shape and pigmentation which are extremely hard to measure manually on large numbers of individuals morphological characteristics of phytoplankton e g length surface coloniality and pigmentation correlate with species functional properties e g resource acquisition growth rate sinking rate grazing resistance and therefore with population abundances and responses to environmental gradients fontana et al 2019 kruk et al 2010 pomati et al 2013 in this study dspc imaging and feature extraction allowed calculation of bi dimensional areas for rois which related well to areas of plankton taxa based on traditional microscopy and manual measurements although measured in two dimensions the body size estimates by one or two linear dimensions scale with biovolume estimates by traditional methods mittler et al 2019 body size was overestimated by the dspc at the lower size end where both regression lines for the 0p5x and 5p0x magnification deviated for smaller species from a perfect 1 1 relationship the deviation was due to a lack of resolution in pixels for smaller individuals particularly when slightly out of focus this error can be corrected using the relationship derived by laboratory calibration fig 2 the overestimation of size would be even greater when using estimates of 3 d biovolume rather than 2 d area and care should be given when calculating biovolume estimates similarly dspc measures of plankton densities roi s or alternatively roi frame can be translated into a number of individuals per unit of volume e g l based on the laboratory calibration fig 3 note however that the initial densities in our laboratory experiments were much higher than those usually found in nature for the goal of an absolute quantitation of plankton densities we suggest a laboratory calibration targeted towards specific instrument settings and realistic densities measuring densities based on detected roi s would be suitable to estimate relative abundances other issues emerging from the comparison of dspc data with traditional plankton sampling include i the difference between methods in terms of sampled volume that is used to estimate plankton community indices ii no detection of phytoplankton 10 μm resulting in an underestimation of some small but common species iii the spatial heterogeneity and circadian behavior of zooplankton the dspc imaged volume supplemental table s1 is small compared to traditional monitoring samples and variable depending on water optical conditions orenstein et al 2020 unlike traditional counting methods the dspc cannot easily change sampled volume to respond to changes in densities while we can increase imaging sampling effort by applying a space for time substitution assessing the actual differences in sample size between dspc and traditional methods remains difficult this disagreement in sampled volume which applies to almost all automated in situ methods has been already acknowledged lombard et al 2019 while automated imaging data allow the scaling of measures of diversity based on sample size e g by temporally aggregating data and applying rarefaction and probability estimate of metrics chase and knight 2013 this is generally impossible with traditional sampling methods those differences in scaling hamper our understanding of why imaging and traditional methods sometimes fail to converge to the same diversity estimates fig 5 6 the dspc showed difficulties in detecting small species for the 5p0x magnification and in quantifying densities of large rare species including carnivorous zooplankton for the 0p5x magnification the lack of taxonomic resolution for small phytoplankton taxa in 5p0x is a limitation of the optical system itself solvable by an extra higher magnification the correlations between dspc and microscopy estimates for phytoplankton richness and total abundance were however robust figs 5 a and 6 a with the limitations in taxonomic resolution becoming more evident in the comparison of relative abundance estimates fig 6 c the lack of reliable quantitation of large zooplankton taxa in the 0p5x magnification instead resides in the relationship between spatial density and body size of organisms white et al 2007 imaging with the dspc for a longer time particularly at night when these organisms are more active might ameliorate this problem by increasing the sampling effort due to a relatively small focal volume however large individuals tend to be imaged and cropped multiple times we suggest that large carnivorous zooplankton can only be studied with presence absence data or during periods when their densities reach very high levels zooplankton species have patchy distributions and exhibit diel vertical and horizontal migrations measuring their community and population properties could lead to systematic biases if based on non replicated or only daytime samples doubek et al 2020 we propose that the poor correlation between dspc and traditional sampling for zooplankton richness and abundances was caused by the heterogeneous distribution of taxa over space and time further supported by high levels of variation among replicated samples particularly for traditional methods fig s7 in this perspective dspc data integrated over 24 h and including day night samples may be more trustworthy than the traditional daytime net tows which have been previously suggested not to be an appropriate approach for monitoring doubek et al 2020 availability of high resolution real time plankton data represents a potential breakthrough in both applied and fundamental plankton ecology and might be more important for water quality monitoring than a fine taxonomic resolution high frequency data have been shown to provide exciting prospects for modeling understanding and predicting plankton dynamics and ecosystem processes fontana et al 2018 thomas et al 2018 the seasonal patterns depicted in fig 7 highlight the rich description of the ecological succession of taxa that dspc data can offer for studying plankton communities natural processes fostering high plankton biodiversity on one hand and leading to the emergence of harmful algal blooms on the other hand represent unresolved questions in aquatic ecology burford et al 2020 fox et al 2010 huisman et al 2018 li and chesson 2016 the dspc was able to detect and count all the most common and potentially toxic cyanobacterial taxa forming blooms in lakes including their large colonies fig 2 if supported by an automated deep learning classifier and paired with meteorological and ctd data and or a calibrated lake process models the dspc could be instrumental to develop forecasting models for harmful cyanobacterial blooms and the stability and biodiversity of natural plankton communities pomati et al 2011 thomas et al 2018 time series generated by instruments like the dspc can be combined with novel data analysis approaches including equation free modeling and machine learning to reverse engineer community ecology based on observational information and to develop effective forecasting tools deyle et al 2016 martin et al 2018 sugihara et al 2012 thomas et al 2018 the combination of high frequency data a broad taxonomic spectrum and artificial intelligence for data assimilation and modeling presents an unparalleled potential for capturing the processes acting in natural ecosystems this approach offers great opportunities to advance our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the dynamics of the complex networks of interacting plankton species 5 conclusions the dspc presented in this article allowed us to obtain automated plankton data at the food web level with high temporal frequency and adequate image resolution the plankton camera employed here was demonstrated to be very robust and reliable showed low requirements in terms of maintenance and running costs and offered complete automation we conclude from our comparison with traditional monitoring methods that the dspc is mature as a research tool and suitable for stable continuous deployment with great potential for application in water quality monitoring automated in situ imaging data are available in real time and they are shareable traceable transparent and independently verifiable biases in the data processing and analysis can be corrected by simply re processing and re analyzing archived raw data yet new generation monitoring tools like the dspc present the challenge of managing and analyzing large datasets this might prove particularly relevant if underwater imaging cameras become more affordable and to increase sampling effort or account for spatial variability in water bodies both vertical and horizontal multiple instruments are employed locally and used in full time operation e g to gain power for density estimates of rare taxa recent publications suggest that this transition from relatively expensive tools to more affordable and therefore scalable instruments are already underway lertvilai 2020 streamlined and open source data management protocols image processing software and automated image

independent data we rely on abstention to be able to tune the precision recall trade off in a simple manner this consists of labeling as unclassified all the images for which the classifier has a confidence lower than a threshold θ in fig s7 we show the precision and recall of our model with θ 0 on the classes that are relevant for our study the average precision is 0 84 and the average recall is 0 8 if we set θ 0 8 the average precision is 0 91 and the average recall is 0 67 which means that around 30 of the data is not being classified but the data that gets classified has a very low error rate the data shown in this paper uses θ 0 8 since in this study we were interested in a higher level taxonomic description of the observed organisms we created some macro classes each comprising more than one of the classes described in table s3 obviously the classifier performances with the macro classes are at least as good as those of fig s7 
16728,evolving complex mixtures of pharmaceuticals and transformation products in effluent dominated streams pose potential impacts to aquatic species thus understanding the attenuation dynamics in the field and characterizing the prominent attenuation mechanisms of pharmaceuticals and their transformation products tps is critical for hazard assessments herein we determined the attenuation dynamics and the associated prominent mechanisms of pharmaceuticals and their corresponding tps via a combined long term field study and controlled laboratory experiments for the field study we quantified spatiotemporal exposure concentrations of five pharmaceuticals and six associated tps in a small temperate region effluent dominated stream during baseflow conditions where the wastewater plant was the main source of pharmaceuticals we selected four sites upstream at and two progressively downstream from effluent discharge and collected water samples at 16 time points 64 samples in total approximately twice monthly depending on flows for 1 year concurrently we conducted photolysis sorption and biodegradation batch tests under controlled conditions to determine the major attenuation mechanisms we observed 10 fold greater attenuation rates in the field compared to batch tests demonstrating that connecting laboratory batch tests with field measurements to enhance

laboratory studies li et al 2013 rúa gómez and püttmann 2013 although these studies help explain the observed persistence and widespread detection in surface waters and are valuable to understanding mechanisms laboratory based experiments yield different transformation kinetics compared to real world conditions making it difficult to translate results into attenuation rates in the stream fu et al 2020 li and mclachlan 2019 for example spiking standardized bottle tests with pharmaceuticals at a concentration markedly higher than their environmental concentrations can strongly influence biodegradation and yield different degradation rates than unspiked tests lessening the environmental relevance of test results li and mclachlan 2019 although in stream assessment of chemical fate is informative spiking of additional chemicals into a natural system is often impractical furthermore biodegradation kinetics can be influenced by the amount of chemical added and spiking can also change the microbial population fahlman et al 2018 li and mclachlan 2019 for field studies long term frequency measurements can better capture the variation of chemical concentration and compositions in the effluent and along the stream reach compared to one time snapshot sampling zhi et al 2020 to our knowledge no prior studies have evaluated in stream attenuation of pharmaceutical compounds using controlled laboratory tests under environmentally relevant i e unspiked conditions combined with a long term effluent dominated field study from an existing ecosystem with a single continuous point source i e wastewater discharge in recent prior work we demonstrated that spatiotemporal changes of complex pharmaceutical mixtures in a temperate region wastewater effluent dominated stream are primarily driven by input variation from the wastewater treatment plant wwtp and differential attenuation level of individual pharmaceuticals zhi et al 2020 yet the mechanisms that contribute to differential compound attenuation or formation of corresponding tps remain a critical knowledge gap therefore the objective of this work was to combine laboratory and field experimental approaches to determine the prominent attenuation mechanisms of pharmaceuticals and corresponding tps that contribute to evolving complex pharmaceutical mixtures and concomitant unique exposure conditions to aquatic organisms here we quantified pharmaceutical tp attenuation dynamics in the field at baseflow conditions over a one year time period and concurrently quantified laboratory batch attenuation transformation i e sorption biotransformation photolysis of the field collected un spiked water we hypothesized that batch tests can predict the major transformation mechanisms but in stream attenuation rates would be faster due to the complex conditions in the natural environment thus both approaches in tandem are critical to developing a comprehensive study and will yield synergistic understanding this research will enable better future predictions of the fate and transport of complex pharmaceutical parent and tp mixtures in wastewater effluent dominated streams and can inform

analytes 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of pharmaceuticals and associated transformation products consistently high concentrations of both pharmaceutical parent compounds and their respective tps in the wwtp effluent and the corresponding stream reach below the wwtp outfall indicates that complex mixture evolution is driven by variation in the effluent and differential in stream attenuation of individual pharmaceuticals and tps rather than in stream transformation from parent to tps fig 1 in the effluent venlafaxine was the parent pharmaceutical present at the highest concentration followed by metformin citalopram bupropion and carbamazepine the same rank order occurred at ds1 thus with only 100 m of transport in stream attenuation processes did not have a large impact on pharmaceutical relative composition during baseflow conditions at ds2 5 1 km downstream from the effluent discharge in contrast venlafaxine was the parent pharmaceutical present at the highest concentration followed by metformin bupropion carbamazepine and citalopram thus illustrating differential in stream attenuation of compounds due to all processes occurred with longer stream transport distances the concentrations of citalopram and bupropion were higher than their associated tps in 100 of samples p 0 02 and p 0 0001 respectively for all three sites effluent ds1 ds2 table s 13 most literature reports hydroxybupropion at higher concentrations than bupropion in wastewater effluent and surface water bai et al 2018 metcalfe et al 2010 writer et al 2013b but at least one prior study was consistent with our results deo 2014 the concentrations of metformin and guanylurea were not different at the effluent or either downstream sites suggesting no differential attenuation occurred p 0 5 for all three sites table s 13 no substantive inputs of pharmaceuticals from nonpoint sources were expected based on land use along the reach table s 2 desvenlafaxine concentrations were always higher than parent compound venlafaxine in wastewater effluent and accounted for 50 ranged 22 86 median 70 of the total concentration of venlafaxine desvenlafaxine and n o didesmethylvenlafaxine hereafter ddv an inactive phase ii product of venlafaxine colvard 2014 this is likely because desvenlafaxine is both a major active phase i product from venlafaxine and also a prescribed pharmaceutical gasser et al 2012 desvenlafaxine concentrations were consistently and significantly higher than venlafaxine in the effluent p 0 0084 but concentrations of the two compounds were not significantly different at ds1 p 0 15 or ds2 p 0 08 suggesting differential attenuation between venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine the concentration of ddv was consistently lower than venlafaxine or desvenlafaxine along the stream p 0 009 table s 13 transformation from desvenlafaxine to ddv may be reversed by biodegradation in the treatment systems gasser et al 2012 but information is lacking on the presence of ddv in aquatic environments carbamazepine and dihydroxycarbazepine concentrations were not significantly different in the effluent and ds1 p 0 09 but dihydroxycarbazepine concentration was significantly higher than carbamazepine at ds2 p 0 02 table s 13 suggesting differential attenuation overall only trace levels of pharmaceuticals and tps were sporadically detected at us1 above the wwtp outfall median 13 ng l detection frequency 19 indicating the wastewater effluent was a consistent pharmaceutical point source during baseflow conditions year round in this system as we documented previously zhi et al 2020 because the land uses between the effluent input and ds2 do not substantially differ from upstream nonpoint contributions of pharmaceuticals along this reach are likely minor compared to the wwtp effluent consistent detection frequencies of metformin 50 and guanylurea 25 but low concentrations median 3 ng l at us1 table s 12 indicated unknown upstream sources such as septic systems stormwater runoff or leaking pipes kolok et al 2014 masoner et al 2019 indeed metformin was detected in 73 of 49 urban stormwater samples across the united states masoner et al 2019 3 2 spatiotemporal patterns of parent to product ratios ptps quantifying spatiotemporal patterns of parent to product ratios ptps i e the measured concentration of parent compound divided by the measured concentration of individual tp is critical to differentiate between in stream parent to product transformation and differential attenuation of individual parent compounds and tps mahler et al 2021 writer et al 2013a for example increasing ptp ratios along the stream can indicate either greater product than parent loss or back conversion from product to parent conversely decreasing ptp ratios along the reach could indicate greater parent than product loss or transformation of parent to product in the stream unchanging ptp ratios suggests similar attenuation or a lack of attenuation at our study site the parent pharmaceutical compounds and related tps attenuated to different extents in the stream reach between the effluent discharge and downstream sites for example both citalopram and desmethylcitalopram were significantly attenuated at ds1 and ds2 p 0 0001 likely due to rapid sorption and dilution beretsou et al 2016 klement et al 2018 citalopram ptps at ds2 were significantly lower than ptps in the effluent or ds1 p 0 0001 fig 2 indicating differential attenuation between citalopram and desmethylcitalopram indeed the median citalopram and desmethylcitalopram attenuation was 41 and 36 at ds1 and 92 and 83 at ds2 respectively indicating greater citalopram loss than tp loss similar relationships between citalopram and desmethylcitalopram in wastewater effluent and surface water have been reported previously writer et al 2013b for venlafaxine and associated tps we quantified the venlafaxine to ddv ratios venlafaxine ptps and desvenlafaxine to ddv ratios desvenlafaxine ptps figs 2 and s 8 both venlafaxine ptps and desvenlafaxine ptps significantly decreased from effluent to ds2 venlafaxine p 0 02 desvenlafaxine p 0 008 indicating faster attenuation of venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine compared to ddv or possible transformation from parent compounds to products in the stream we also observed seasonal patterns in the concentrations of metformin and its tp guanylurea figs 2 and s 9 which is consistent with our previous work zhi et al 2020 and studies in greek wastewaters where the highest concentrations of guanylurea were detected in winter kosma et al 2015 although the reason for this seasonal trend is unclear moreover metformin and guanylurea are largely resistant against further degradation in surface water markiewicz et al 2017a 2017b but a recent study demonstrated that the resident microbial community in the sediments can degrade both compounds forming biuret as a product posselt et al 2020 citalopram carbamazepine and venlafaxine ptps also exhibited temporal patterns under different water temperature conditions i e when ambient water temperatures measured at site us1 native water unimpacted by the anthropogenic effluent temperature effects 10 c during our sampling events were considered warm conditions whereas 10 c at us1 were considered cool conditions table s 11 figures s 9 s 11 zhi et al 2020 both venlafaxine ptps p 0 04 and carbamazepine ptps p 0 0074 were higher under warm conditions compared to cool conditions at all three sites matched pairs analysis whereas citalopram ptps were higher under cool conditions compared to warm conditions at all sites p 0 04 overall the spatiotemporal patterns of ptps along the stream reach during baseflow conditions indicated the changing composition of complex pharmaceutical mixtures figs 1 and 2 s 8 creating unique exposure conditions to aquatic and terrestrial biota 3 3 tandem laboratory batch tests and field measurements increase the understanding of attenuation processes our batch tests demonstrated that sorption was the major attenuation process for 7 of the 11 pharmaceuticals tps measured including citalopram t1 2 0 33 0 01d p 0 0042 desmethylcitalopram t1 2 0 30 0 07d p 0 0051 venlafaxine t1 2 0 94 0 14d p 0 0052 and desvenlafaxine t1 2 1 86 0 30 d p 0 0048 the other 4 compounds i e metformin hydroxybupropion carbamazepine and dihydroxycarbazepine however remained 50 in the aqueous phase during the 14 day laboratory experiment fig 3 this is consistent with our field measurements in terms of the compound rank order biodegradation as a specific attenuation process only impacted bupropion t1 2 11 5 1 92 d p 0 0567 and desmethylcitalopram t1 2 9 86 1 41 d p 0 0306 indicating the generally poor biodegradability of most compounds in the aqueous phase the predicted biodegradation half lives for the studied pharmaceuticals tps ranged 3 36 6 54 d u s epa 2020 table s 1 which is much longer than the estimated travel time in our stream reach but still underestimated the persistence of these compounds in the aqueous phase measured via batch tests metformin and guanylurea are both polar and mobile compounds in the aquatic environment and not readily biodegradable under typical conditions kosma et al 2015 markiewicz et al 2017a in our batch tests however 50 of guanylurea was removed during the 14 day period in the sorption group contrasting sorption behavior between metformin and guanylurea has been previously reported briones and sarmah 2018 guanylurea exhibits a higher affinity to organic matter than metformin while metformin partitions to negatively charged sorption sites e g clay minerals metformin carbamazepine and dihydroxycarbazepine were stable in our batch systems consistent with our field data although there was no significant difference between the sorption group and sorption biodegradation combined group p 0 05 for the majority of compounds 8 out of 11 compounds the remaining 3 compounds desvenlafaxine guanylurea and ddv exhibited enhanced attenuation in the sorption biodegradation combined experimental group suggesting that sediments can enhance the elimination of pharmaceuticals in the aqueous phase this phenomenon may be because microbes in the water column can become enriched in sediments and increase biodegradation in sediments as biofilms thereby enhancing the elimination of chemicals in the water column desiante et al 2021 kunkel et al 2008 yamamoto et al 2009 with the exception of desvenlafaxine t1 2 0 54 d and ddv t1 2 1 51 d figure s 16 photolysis did not significantly impact any of the pharmaceuticals tps under raw unfiltered water conditions interestingly 40 of citalopram p 0 0042 and 60 of desmethylcitalopram p 0 0192 dissipated via photolysis under the filtered conditions whereas both remained present in the aqueous phase under the raw water laboratory conditions these results suggest that particle screening may be a potentially important mechanism that furthers the persistence of these compounds and warrants further investigation a previous study demonstrated that citalopram degraded less than 0 5 at ph 7 in aqueous phase during a 30 day exposure period under simulated sunlight kwon and armbrust 2005 however citalopram may migrate from the aqueous phase to sediments due to high sorption potential in real environments klement et al 2018 negligible photolysis of bupropion venlafaxine and relatively slow photolysis of desvenlafaxine estimated t1 2 0 75 d in surface water has been previously reported no photolysis is known to occur for metformin or guanylurea santoke et al 2012 trautwein and kümmerer 2011 but photolysis can be significant to some effluent derived pharmaceuticals including diclofenac products jaeger et al 2019 hydrolysis is not believed to be an important attenuation mechanism of pharmaceutical compounds lam et al 2004 and losses appeared negligible in the negative abiotic control groups p 0 05 field results exhibited faster in stream attenuation rates when compared to laboratory batch tests for example citalopram desmethylcitalopram and venlafaxine had half lives of 0 33 0 06 d 0 23 0 001 d and 0 91 0 13 d in batch tests respectively whereas faster attenuation occurred in the field 0 06 0 04 d 0 19 0 13 d 0 15 0 17 d respectively table s 16 similarly biodegradation was the main loss process for bupropion in the batch tests t1 2 11 5 1 92 d table s 17 however we observed faster attenuation in the field t1 2 0 18 0 18 d table s 16 this phenomenon is likely due to greater opportunities for physical and biological attenuation processes in the field such as dilution dispersion hyporheic exchange and possible plant phytoplankton uptake bradley et al 2016 keefe et al 2019 lefevre et al 2015 romeijn et al 2021 schmadel et al 2016 that make complex field conditions more conducive to in situ biochemical attenuation processes e g sorption biodegradation processes become more efficacious when combined with the enhanced physical attenuation like hyporheic exchange additionally at the ph conditions at the field study site ds2 ph 7 6 8 3 table s 11 bupropion pka 8 2 may undergo electrostatic interactions with bed sediments and suspended sediments we did not observe strong significant correlations however between bupropion concentrations and water ph at ds2 pearson r 0 22 p 0 60 figure s 12 the ph conditions for lab experiments were neutral ph 7 and were similar to field conditions ph 7 5 8 3 most of the investigated compounds have pka values greater than 8 2 and thus ph conditions were thus unlikely important to dissipation rates we demonstrated through this work that although carefully controlled laboratory tests can determine major attenuation mechanisms batch tests and field conditions can yield substantially different attenuation half lives consequently a single approach may be insufficient to adequately predict behaviors of pharmaceuticals and tps in the environment and we recommend the tandem approach embodied herein conducting research studies at well established field sites e g in this study zhi et al 2020 using tandem lab and field approachs can help us better understand and contextualize results of other studies that either examine field or lab with the limitations of each approach in proper context for example several recent studies have examined the limitations of oecd guidelines for standard laboratory batch tests as the guideline spiking conditions can generate different attenuation kinetics e g first order kinetics vs zero order kinetics with a 15 28 day lag phase coll et al 2020 li and mclachlan 2019 although standardized bottle tests can be useful for assessing spill scenarios these spiked batch tests are less relevant for assessing biodegradation under natural conditions where chemicals already exist continuously likewise conducting field studies alone can make elucidating attenuation mechanisms difficult schultz et al 2010 thus connecting field studies to laboratory batch tests can improve the context for a regulatory framework for natural water systems especially in surface waters with high ambient levels of chemicals i e effluent dominated systems moreover tandem field work and laboratory controlled tests can inform contextualize existing work that only employed a single lab field approach and also improve the modeling framework for risk assessment of pharmaceuticals in effluent dominated systems high spatiotemporal resolution sampling synergized with comprehensive analytical analysis and the application of appropriate simulation models would provide the most comprehensive assessment of the potential risks of pharmaceuticals in effluent dominated systems based on our prior research in this study reach pharmaceuticals in the water and sediment of our field site can be assumed at pseudo equilibrium under baseflow conditions due to consistent influx of treated wastewater zhi et al 2020 consequently the sediment in the creek bed is potentially both a major sink and source of chemicals via sorption and desorption kolok et al 2014 we therefore estimated the partitioning coefficients kd of four investigated parent compounds described in the si table s 19 these results further support sorption as a major attenuation process for compounds e g citalopram venlafaxine compounds with the lowest kd values e g metformin are expected to exhibit minimal sorption the mid range kd values of carbamazepine and venlafaxine and the low kd value for citalopram suggests that sorption to sediment is a progressively more influential attenuation process for these compounds consistent with our batch tests except for carbamazepine carbamazepine is known to exhibit a low sorption affinity kd 0 21 l kg to sandy sediments scheytt et al 2005 indicating the theoretical partitioning coefficient may sometimes overestimate the sorption although we did not quantify sediment pharmaceutical concentrations an analogous usgs study boulder creek colorado usa reported high concentrations of citalopram up to 14 95 ng g and venlafaxine up to 26 07 ng g in the sediments whereas bupropion concentration was one order of magnitude lower in the sediments up to 2 12 ng g schultz et al 2010 thus determining the theoretical partitioning of pseudo persistent pharmaceuticals is important for contextualizing laboratory batch and field results while improving predictive power for sites beyond the initial study location tandem batch tests and field measurements demonstrated that although the temporal variability of the complex mixture evolution was mainly due to effluent contributions the spatial mixture evolution was driven by differential attenuation via sorption rather than in stream product formation i e biodegradation photolysis hydrolysis for example citalopram has a high reported sorption capacity to sediment kd 1 9 104 l kg under similar organic matter content and ph conditions toc 0 93 ph 7 8 respectively as our system kwon and armbrust 2008 biodegradation in general is considered a less important processes in the water column due to the relatively low abundance of microbes in surface water fatta kassinos et al 2011 although microorganisms can degrade pharmaceuticals to different extents in batch experiments casas et al 2015 lin et al 2010 xu et al 2011 in contrast the sediment compartment is known to contain a comparatively high density of microorganisms representing a potential major site of pharmaceutical loss via biodegradation and sorption both in the lab and field studies martínez hernández et al 2014 radke and maier 2014 the sediment as a sink may also release pharmaceutical compounds via desorption even when the compound is not present in the wwtp effluent at a particular time which may occur at our study site and further contribute to the pseudo persistence of exposure conditions kolok et al 2014 we do however recognize that this finding is applicable to baseflow conditions but may not represent elevated flow conditions where stormflow can enhance the mobilization of pharmaceuticals thus affecting sorption processes the focus of this study and indeed the vast majority of hydrologic conditions experienced at this site fig s 5 is baseflow wherein the aforementioned sorption description would be applicable under pseudo persistent conditions kolok et al 2014 physical attenuation such as dilution and groundwater exchange also contribute to concentration attenuation in the water column a few studies have focused on the attenuation processes occurring in hyporheic zones where pharmaceuticals have been frequently detected lewandowski et al 2011 posselt et al 2020 schaper et al 2019 biodegradation of pharmaceuticals in hyporheic zones is considered more efficient than in wwtps and surface water due to longer residence times and higher microbial diversity which also contributes to the evolving complex pharmaceutical mixtures in the aquatic environment lewandowski et al 2011 peter et al 2019 in summary multiple mechanisms can contribute to the evolving parent product mixture in the stream generating complex exposure conditions for aquatic and terrestrial biota with potential implications combining laboratory and field approaches improves characterization of processes and kinetics and can inform future modeling efforts or context for established guidelines on chemical fate e g oecd batch degradation tests 4 conclusions the tandem field and laboratory research at the muddy creek research site have documented important conclusions regarding pharmaceutical attenuation pharmaceuticals and tps were attenuated faster in the small effluent dominated stream field site compared to laboratory batch tests indicating that although batch tests alone can illuminate mechanisms tandem laboratory batch tests and field measurements are complementary for comprehensive assessment of attenuation behaviors in real world systems and help inform a modeling framework for effluent dominated streams parent pharmaceuticals and their tps were mainly derived from point source release i e wwtp discharge rather than in stream product formation sorption to sediment was the predominant attenuation process rather than biodegradation or photolysis during baseflow conditions trends in sorption were consistent between batch field and theoretical results tps were present in high concentrations along with parent compounds in wwtp discharge and surface water and contribute to evolving complex pharmaceutical mixtures thus tps are an important component to understanding the fate and effects of pharmaceuticals

the field and characterizing the prominent attenuation mechanisms of pharmaceuticals and their transformation products tps is critical for hazard assessments herein we determined the attenuation dynamics and the associated prominent mechanisms of pharmaceuticals and their corresponding tps via a combined long term field study and controlled laboratory experiments for the field study we quantified spatiotemporal exposure concentrations of five pharmaceuticals and six associated tps in a small temperate region effluent dominated stream during baseflow conditions where the wastewater plant was the main source of pharmaceuticals we selected four sites upstream at and two progressively downstream from effluent discharge and collected water samples at 16 time points 64 samples in total approximately twice monthly depending on flows for 1 year concurrently we conducted photolysis sorption and biodegradation batch tests under controlled conditions to determine the major attenuation mechanisms we observed 10 fold greater attenuation rates in the field compared to batch tests demonstrating that connecting laboratory batch tests with field measurements to enhance predictive power is a critical need batch systems alone often used for assessment are useful for determining fate processes but poorly approximate in stream attenuation kinetics sorption was the dominant attenuation process t1 2 7 7 d for 5 of 11 compounds in the batch tests while the other compounds n 6 persisted in the batch tests and along the 5 1 km stream reach in stream parent to

streams are becoming increasingly common globally including in temperate regions due to climate change and demands on water resources rice et al 2013 rice and westerhoff 2015 pharmaceuticals commonly present in effluent dominated streams generate unique elevated concentration complex exposure conditions for aquatic and terrestrial biota with potential ecological implications arnnok et al 2017 bartelt hunt et al 2009 bradley et al 2014 schultz et al 2011 zhi et al 2020 most pharmaceutical studies have focused on active ingredient parent compounds with comparatively little attention to corresponding pharmaceutical transformation products tps godoy et al 2015 grabicova et al 2017 santos et al 2013 risk assessments typically assume transformation results in decreased toxicological risks chen et al 2014 unfortunately growing evidence indicates that tps of some pharmaceuticals e g diclofenac metformin can exhibit similar or greater toxicity than parent compounds fu et al 2020 tps

scheurer et al 2012 tisler et al 2019 parent pharmaceuticals and tps contribute to complex mixtures that can vary substantially through space and time writer et al 2013b the evolving spatiotemporal nature of complex pharmaceutical mixtures in receiving waters makes assessment of impact challenging carpenter and helbling 2018 fairbairn et al 2016 zhi et al 2020 although many pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater effluent dominated streams are considered pseudo persistent in the aquatic environment because the attenuation rate is balanced by continuous influx daughton 2003 it is critical to understand the relevant contributing mechanisms and corresponding attenuation kinetics for pharmaceuticals and tps relatively few studies have evaluated the occurrence and spatiotemporal distributions of different pharmaceutical mixtures in surface water including lakes rivers and streams worldwide cantwell et al 2018 lópez serna et al 2012 writer et al 2013b differential attenuation of individual pharmaceutical compounds tps contributes to the complex mixtures that create spatially and temporally unique exposure conditions for aquatic and terrestrial biota pharmaceuticals and tps may undergo attenuation processes including physical chemical processes e g dilution sorption photolysis and biodegradation andreozzi et al 2003 boix et al 2016 schaper et al 2019 the primary mechanism of pharmaceutical removal is thought to be sorption to sediments and stream biofilms writer et al 2013a some pharmaceuticals e g citalopram venlafaxine are differentially persistent compared to their respective tps writer et al 2013a contributing to the evolving complex mixture along the stream to date attenuation mechanisms of parent compounds have received the greatest focus thus studies on attenuation of tps in aquatic systems are limited but critical when considering evolving complex mixtures combining laboratory and field measurements is critical to characterize and understand the attenuation of evolving complex pharmaceutical mixtures the majority of research on potential attenuation processes of pharmaceutical compounds has been conducted under controlled laboratory studies li et al 2013 rúa gómez and püttmann 2013 although these studies help explain the observed persistence and widespread detection in surface waters and are valuable to understanding mechanisms laboratory based experiments yield different transformation kinetics compared to real world conditions making it difficult to translate results into attenuation rates in the stream fu et al 2020 li and mclachlan 2019 for example spiking standardized bottle tests with pharmaceuticals at a concentration markedly higher than their environmental concentrations can strongly influence biodegradation and yield different degradation rates than unspiked tests lessening the environmental relevance of test results li and mclachlan 2019 although in stream assessment of chemical fate is informative spiking of additional chemicals into a natural system is often impractical furthermore biodegradation kinetics can be influenced by the amount of chemical added and spiking can also change the microbial population fahlman et al 2018 li and mclachlan 2019 for field studies long term frequency measurements can better capture the variation of chemical concentration and compositions in the effluent and along the stream reach compared to one time snapshot sampling zhi et al 2020 to our knowledge no prior studies have evaluated in stream attenuation of pharmaceutical compounds using controlled laboratory tests under environmentally relevant i e unspiked conditions combined with a long term effluent dominated field study from an existing ecosystem with a single continuous point source i e wastewater discharge in recent prior work we demonstrated that spatiotemporal changes of complex pharmaceutical mixtures in a temperate region wastewater effluent dominated stream are primarily driven by input variation from the wastewater treatment plant wwtp and differential attenuation level of individual pharmaceuticals zhi et al 2020 yet the mechanisms that contribute to differential compound attenuation or formation of corresponding tps remain a critical knowledge gap therefore the objective of this work was to combine laboratory and field experimental approaches to determine the prominent attenuation mechanisms of pharmaceuticals and corresponding tps that contribute to evolving complex pharmaceutical mixtures and concomitant unique exposure conditions to aquatic organisms here we quantified pharmaceutical tp attenuation dynamics in the field at baseflow conditions over a one year time period and concurrently quantified laboratory batch attenuation transformation i e sorption biotransformation photolysis of the field collected un spiked water we hypothesized that batch tests can predict the major transformation mechanisms but in stream attenuation rates would be faster due to the complex conditions in the natural environment thus both approaches in tandem are critical to developing a comprehensive study and will yield synergistic understanding this research will enable better future predictions of the fate and transport of complex pharmaceutical parent and tp mixtures in wastewater effluent dominated streams and can inform

analytes 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of pharmaceuticals and associated transformation products consistently high concentrations of both pharmaceutical parent compounds and their respective tps in the wwtp effluent and the corresponding stream reach below the wwtp outfall indicates that complex mixture evolution is driven by variation in the effluent and differential in stream attenuation of individual pharmaceuticals and tps rather than in stream transformation from parent to tps fig 1 in the effluent venlafaxine was the parent pharmaceutical present at the highest concentration followed by metformin citalopram bupropion and carbamazepine the same rank order occurred at ds1 thus with only 100 m of transport in stream attenuation processes did not have a large impact on pharmaceutical relative composition during baseflow conditions at ds2 5 1 km downstream from the effluent discharge in contrast venlafaxine was the parent pharmaceutical present at the highest concentration followed by metformin bupropion carbamazepine and citalopram thus illustrating differential in stream attenuation of compounds due to all processes occurred with longer stream transport distances the concentrations of citalopram and bupropion were higher than their associated tps in 100 of samples p 0 02 and p 0 0001 respectively for all three sites effluent ds1 ds2 table s 13 most literature reports hydroxybupropion at higher concentrations than bupropion in wastewater effluent and surface water bai et al 2018 metcalfe et al 2010 writer et al 2013b but at least one prior study was consistent with our results deo 2014 the concentrations of metformin and guanylurea were not different at the effluent or either downstream sites suggesting no differential attenuation occurred p 0 5 for all three sites table s 13 no substantive inputs of pharmaceuticals from nonpoint sources were expected based on land use along the reach table s 2 desvenlafaxine concentrations were always higher than parent compound venlafaxine in wastewater effluent and accounted for 50 ranged 22 86 median 70 of the total concentration of venlafaxine desvenlafaxine and n o didesmethylvenlafaxine hereafter ddv an inactive phase ii product of venlafaxine colvard 2014 this is likely because desvenlafaxine is both a major active phase i product from venlafaxine and also a prescribed pharmaceutical gasser et al 2012 desvenlafaxine concentrations were consistently and significantly higher than venlafaxine in the effluent p 0 0084 but concentrations of the two compounds were not significantly different at ds1 p 0 15 or ds2 p 0 08 suggesting differential attenuation between venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine the concentration of ddv was consistently lower than venlafaxine or desvenlafaxine along the stream p 0 009 table s 13 transformation from desvenlafaxine to ddv may be reversed by biodegradation in the treatment systems gasser et al 2012 but information is lacking on the presence of ddv in aquatic environments carbamazepine and dihydroxycarbazepine concentrations were not significantly different in the effluent and ds1 p 0 09 but dihydroxycarbazepine concentration was significantly higher than carbamazepine at ds2 p 0 02 table s 13 suggesting differential attenuation overall only trace levels of pharmaceuticals and tps were sporadically detected at us1 above the wwtp outfall median 13 ng l detection frequency 19 indicating the wastewater effluent was a consistent pharmaceutical point source during baseflow conditions year round in this system as we documented previously zhi et al 2020 because the land uses between the effluent input and ds2 do not substantially differ from upstream nonpoint contributions of pharmaceuticals along this reach are likely minor compared to the wwtp effluent consistent detection frequencies of metformin 50 and guanylurea 25 but low concentrations median 3 ng l at us1 table s 12 indicated unknown upstream sources such as septic systems stormwater runoff or leaking pipes kolok et al 2014 masoner et al 2019 indeed metformin was detected in 73 of 49 urban stormwater samples across the united states masoner et al 2019 3 2 spatiotemporal patterns of parent to product ratios ptps quantifying spatiotemporal patterns of parent to product ratios ptps i e the measured concentration of parent compound divided by the measured concentration of individual tp is critical to differentiate between in stream parent to product transformation and differential attenuation of individual parent compounds and tps mahler et al 2021 writer et al 2013a for example increasing ptp ratios along the stream can indicate either greater product than parent loss or back conversion from product to parent conversely decreasing ptp ratios along the reach could indicate greater parent than product loss or transformation of parent to product in the stream unchanging ptp ratios suggests similar attenuation or a lack of attenuation at our study site the parent pharmaceutical compounds and related tps attenuated to different extents in the stream reach between the effluent discharge and downstream sites for example both citalopram and desmethylcitalopram were significantly attenuated at ds1 and ds2 p 0 0001 likely due to rapid sorption and dilution beretsou et al 2016 klement et al 2018 citalopram ptps at ds2 were significantly lower than ptps in the effluent or ds1 p 0 0001 fig 2 indicating differential attenuation between citalopram and desmethylcitalopram indeed the median citalopram and desmethylcitalopram attenuation was 41 and 36 at ds1 and 92 and 83 at ds2 respectively indicating greater citalopram loss than tp loss similar relationships between citalopram and desmethylcitalopram in wastewater effluent and surface water have been reported previously writer et al 2013b for venlafaxine and associated tps we quantified the venlafaxine to ddv ratios venlafaxine ptps and desvenlafaxine to ddv ratios desvenlafaxine ptps figs 2 and s 8 both venlafaxine ptps and desvenlafaxine ptps significantly decreased from effluent to ds2 venlafaxine p 0 02 desvenlafaxine p 0 008 indicating faster attenuation of venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine compared to ddv or possible transformation from parent compounds to products in the stream we also observed seasonal patterns in the concentrations of metformin and its tp guanylurea figs 2 and s 9 which is consistent with our previous work zhi et al 2020 and studies in greek wastewaters where the highest concentrations of guanylurea were detected in winter kosma et al 2015 although the reason for this seasonal trend is unclear moreover metformin and guanylurea are largely resistant against further degradation in surface water markiewicz et al 2017a 2017b but a recent study demonstrated that the resident microbial community in the sediments can degrade both compounds forming biuret as a product posselt et al 2020 citalopram carbamazepine and venlafaxine ptps also exhibited temporal patterns under different water temperature conditions i e when ambient water temperatures measured at site us1 native water unimpacted by the anthropogenic effluent temperature effects 10 c during our sampling events were considered warm conditions whereas 10 c at us1 were considered cool conditions table s 11 figures s 9 s 11 zhi et al 2020 both venlafaxine ptps p 0 04 and carbamazepine ptps p 0 0074 were higher under warm conditions compared to cool conditions at all three sites matched pairs analysis whereas citalopram ptps were higher under cool conditions compared to warm conditions at all sites p 0 04 overall the spatiotemporal patterns of ptps along the stream reach during baseflow conditions indicated the changing composition of complex pharmaceutical mixtures figs 1 and 2 s 8 creating unique exposure conditions to aquatic and terrestrial biota 3 3 tandem laboratory batch tests and field measurements increase the understanding of attenuation processes our batch tests demonstrated that sorption was the major attenuation process for 7 of the 11 pharmaceuticals tps measured including citalopram t1 2 0 33 0 01d p 0 0042 desmethylcitalopram t1 2 0 30 0 07d p 0 0051 venlafaxine t1 2 0 94 0 14d p 0 0052 and desvenlafaxine t1 2 1 86 0 30 d p 0 0048 the other 4 compounds i e metformin hydroxybupropion carbamazepine and dihydroxycarbazepine however remained 50 in the aqueous phase during the 14 day laboratory experiment fig 3 this is consistent with our field measurements in terms of the compound rank order biodegradation as a specific attenuation process only impacted bupropion t1 2 11 5 1 92 d p 0 0567 and desmethylcitalopram t1 2 9 86 1 41 d p 0 0306 indicating the generally poor biodegradability of most compounds in the aqueous phase the predicted biodegradation half lives for the studied pharmaceuticals tps ranged 3 36 6 54 d u s epa 2020 table s 1 which is much longer than the estimated travel time in our stream reach but still underestimated the persistence of these compounds in the aqueous phase measured via batch tests metformin and guanylurea are both polar and mobile compounds in the aquatic environment and not readily biodegradable under typical conditions kosma et al 2015 markiewicz et al 2017a in our batch tests however 50 of guanylurea was removed during the 14 day period in the sorption group contrasting sorption behavior between metformin and guanylurea has been previously reported briones and sarmah 2018 guanylurea exhibits a higher affinity to organic matter than metformin while metformin partitions to negatively charged sorption sites e g clay minerals metformin carbamazepine and dihydroxycarbazepine were stable in our batch systems consistent with our field data although there was no significant difference between the sorption group and sorption biodegradation combined group p 0 05 for the majority of compounds 8 out of 11 compounds the remaining 3 compounds desvenlafaxine guanylurea and ddv exhibited enhanced attenuation in the sorption biodegradation combined experimental group suggesting that sediments can enhance the elimination of pharmaceuticals in the aqueous phase this phenomenon may be because microbes in the water column can become enriched in sediments and increase biodegradation in sediments as biofilms thereby enhancing the elimination of chemicals in the water column desiante et al 2021 kunkel et al 2008 yamamoto et al 2009 with the exception of desvenlafaxine t1 2 0 54 d and ddv t1 2 1 51 d figure s 16 photolysis did not significantly impact any of the pharmaceuticals tps under raw unfiltered water conditions interestingly 40 of citalopram p 0 0042 and 60 of desmethylcitalopram p 0 0192 dissipated via photolysis under the filtered conditions whereas both remained present in the aqueous phase under the raw water laboratory conditions these results suggest that particle screening may be a potentially important mechanism that furthers the persistence of these compounds and warrants further investigation a previous study demonstrated that citalopram degraded less than 0 5 at ph 7 in aqueous phase during a 30 day exposure period under simulated sunlight kwon and armbrust 2005 however citalopram may migrate from the aqueous phase to sediments due to high sorption potential in real environments klement et al 2018 negligible photolysis of bupropion venlafaxine and relatively slow photolysis of desvenlafaxine estimated t1 2 0 75 d in surface water has been previously reported no photolysis is known to occur for metformin or guanylurea santoke et al 2012 trautwein and kümmerer 2011 but photolysis can be significant to some effluent derived pharmaceuticals including diclofenac products jaeger et al 2019 hydrolysis is not believed to be an important attenuation mechanism of pharmaceutical compounds lam et al 2004 and losses appeared negligible in the negative abiotic control groups p 0 05 field results exhibited faster in stream attenuation rates when compared to laboratory batch tests for example citalopram desmethylcitalopram and venlafaxine had half lives of 0 33 0 06 d 0 23 0 001 d and 0 91 0 13 d in batch tests respectively whereas faster attenuation occurred in the field 0 06 0 04 d 0 19 0 13 d 0 15 0 17 d respectively table s 16 similarly biodegradation was the main loss process for bupropion in the batch tests t1 2 11 5 1 92 d table s 17 however we observed faster attenuation in the field t1 2 0 18 0 18 d table s 16 this phenomenon is likely due to greater opportunities for physical and biological attenuation processes in the field such as dilution dispersion hyporheic exchange and possible plant phytoplankton uptake bradley et al 2016 keefe et al 2019 lefevre et al 2015 romeijn et al 2021 schmadel et al 2016 that make complex field conditions more conducive to in situ biochemical attenuation processes e g sorption biodegradation processes become more efficacious when combined with the enhanced physical attenuation like hyporheic exchange additionally at the ph conditions at the field study site ds2 ph 7 6 8 3 table s 11 bupropion pka 8 2 may undergo electrostatic interactions with bed sediments and suspended sediments we did not observe strong significant correlations however between bupropion concentrations and water ph at ds2 pearson r 0 22 p 0 60 figure s 12 the ph conditions for lab experiments were neutral ph 7 and were similar to field conditions ph 7 5 8 3 most of the investigated compounds have pka values greater than 8 2 and thus ph conditions were thus unlikely important to dissipation rates we demonstrated through this work that although carefully controlled laboratory tests can determine major attenuation mechanisms batch tests and field conditions can yield substantially different attenuation half lives consequently a single approach may be insufficient to adequately predict behaviors of pharmaceuticals and tps in the environment and we recommend the tandem approach embodied herein conducting research studies at well established field sites e g in this study zhi et al 2020 using tandem lab and field approachs can help us better understand and contextualize results of other studies that either examine field or lab with the limitations of each approach in proper context for example several recent studies have examined the limitations of oecd guidelines for standard laboratory batch tests as the guideline spiking conditions can generate different attenuation kinetics e g first order kinetics vs zero order kinetics with a 15 28 day lag phase coll et al 2020 li and mclachlan 2019 although standardized bottle tests can be useful for assessing spill scenarios these spiked batch tests are less relevant for assessing biodegradation under natural conditions where chemicals already exist continuously likewise conducting field studies alone can make elucidating attenuation mechanisms difficult schultz et al 2010 thus connecting field studies to laboratory batch tests can improve the context for a regulatory framework for natural water systems especially in surface waters with high ambient levels of chemicals i e effluent dominated systems moreover tandem field work and laboratory controlled tests can inform contextualize existing work that only employed a single lab field approach and also improve the modeling framework for risk assessment of pharmaceuticals in effluent dominated systems high spatiotemporal resolution sampling synergized with comprehensive analytical analysis and the application of appropriate simulation models would provide the most comprehensive assessment of the potential risks of pharmaceuticals in effluent dominated systems based on our prior research in this study reach pharmaceuticals in the water and sediment of our field site can be assumed at pseudo equilibrium under baseflow conditions due to consistent influx of treated wastewater zhi et al 2020 consequently the sediment in the creek bed is potentially both a major sink and source of chemicals via sorption and desorption kolok et al 2014 we therefore estimated the partitioning coefficients kd of four investigated parent compounds described in the si table s 19 these results further support sorption as a major attenuation process for compounds e g citalopram venlafaxine compounds with the lowest kd values e g metformin are expected to exhibit minimal sorption the mid range kd values of carbamazepine and venlafaxine and the low kd value for citalopram suggests that sorption to sediment is a progressively more influential attenuation process for these compounds consistent with our batch tests except for carbamazepine carbamazepine is known to exhibit a low sorption affinity kd 0 21 l kg to sandy sediments scheytt et al 2005 indicating the theoretical partitioning coefficient may sometimes overestimate the sorption although we did not quantify sediment pharmaceutical concentrations an analogous usgs study boulder creek colorado usa reported high concentrations of citalopram up to 14 95 ng g and venlafaxine up to 26 07 ng g in the sediments whereas bupropion concentration was one order of magnitude lower in the sediments up to 2 12 ng g schultz et al 2010 thus determining the theoretical partitioning of pseudo persistent pharmaceuticals is important for contextualizing laboratory batch and field results while improving predictive power for sites beyond the initial study location tandem batch tests and field measurements demonstrated that although the temporal variability of the complex mixture evolution was mainly due to effluent contributions the spatial mixture evolution was driven by differential attenuation via sorption rather than in stream product formation i e biodegradation photolysis hydrolysis for example citalopram has a high reported sorption capacity to sediment kd 1 9 104 l kg under similar organic matter content and ph conditions toc 0 93 ph 7 8 respectively as our system kwon and armbrust 2008 biodegradation in general is considered a less important processes in the water column due to the relatively low abundance of microbes in surface water fatta kassinos et al 2011 although microorganisms can degrade pharmaceuticals to different extents in batch experiments casas et al 2015 lin et al 2010 xu et al 2011 in contrast the sediment compartment is known to contain a comparatively high density of microorganisms representing a potential major site of pharmaceutical loss via biodegradation and sorption both in the lab and field studies martínez hernández et al 2014 radke and maier 2014 the sediment as a sink may also release pharmaceutical compounds via desorption even when the compound is not present in the wwtp effluent at a particular time which may occur at our study site and further contribute to the pseudo persistence of exposure conditions kolok et al 2014 we do however recognize that this finding is applicable to baseflow conditions but may not represent elevated flow conditions where stormflow can enhance the mobilization of pharmaceuticals thus affecting sorption processes the focus of this study and indeed the vast majority of hydrologic conditions experienced at this site fig s 5 is baseflow wherein the aforementioned sorption description would be applicable under pseudo persistent conditions kolok et al 2014 physical attenuation such as dilution and groundwater exchange also contribute to concentration attenuation in the water column a few studies have focused on the attenuation processes occurring in hyporheic zones where pharmaceuticals have been frequently detected lewandowski et al 2011 posselt et al 2020 schaper et al 2019 biodegradation of pharmaceuticals in hyporheic zones is considered more efficient than in wwtps and surface water due to longer residence times and higher microbial diversity which also contributes to the evolving complex pharmaceutical mixtures in the aquatic environment lewandowski et al 2011 peter et al 2019 in summary multiple mechanisms can contribute to the evolving parent product mixture in the stream generating complex exposure conditions for aquatic and terrestrial biota with potential implications combining laboratory and field approaches improves characterization of processes and kinetics and can inform future modeling efforts or context for established guidelines on chemical fate e g oecd batch degradation tests 4 conclusions the tandem field and laboratory research at the muddy creek research site have documented important conclusions regarding pharmaceutical attenuation pharmaceuticals and tps were attenuated faster in the small effluent dominated stream field site compared to laboratory batch tests indicating that although batch tests alone can illuminate mechanisms tandem laboratory batch tests and field measurements are complementary for comprehensive assessment of attenuation behaviors in real world systems and help inform a modeling framework for effluent dominated streams parent pharmaceuticals and their tps were mainly derived from point source release i e wwtp discharge rather than in stream product formation sorption to sediment was the predominant attenuation process rather than biodegradation or photolysis during baseflow conditions trends in sorption were consistent between batch field and theoretical results tps were present in high concentrations along with parent compounds in wwtp discharge and surface water and contribute to evolving complex pharmaceutical mixtures thus tps are an important component to understanding the fate and effects of pharmaceuticals

16729,catastrophic shifts in river ecosystems can abruptly degrade their structures and functions often reducing the efficacy of traditional remediation targeting physicochemical properties alternative stable states theory can not only explain this phenomenon but also provide a new insight into river restoration however little is known about the existence and implications of alternative stable states in a river considering the important role of benthic microbiota in sustaining river ecosystem structures and functions ecological theory and high throughput sequencing were combined to firstly investigate multi stability in microbial communities and its relationship with environmental factors in river sediments the nanjing reach of the yangtze river was selected as the study area because of its huge spatial heterogeneity and varying degrees of pollution bimodal distributions combined with temporal variations of microbiota status provided direct evidence of bistability by showing the instability at the intermediate in addition environmental stress particularly concentrations of nh 4 n and no 3 n was identified as an important driver of alternative microbiota states from the perspectives of the behavior of bistable ecosystems comparison of α diversity indices and network properties between two alternative microbiota states revealed that the diversity and co occurrence pattern of microbial communities will be high if they are settled in favorable environments i e comprehensive sediment quality identification index 3 7 key taxa including clostridiales nitrospirales and myxococcales were discerned by combining lefse and network analysis and their strong interspecies interactions were believed to be an important factor in triggering alternative microbiota states this study suggests alternative stable states theory should be considered in river remediation to better understand the response of river ecosystems to environmental stress and the effect of hysteresis benefiting the implementation of effective monitoring and restoration strategies in a river of urban area graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords river sediments alternative stable states theory hysteresis microbial communities environmental stress effective river restoration 1 introduction rivers are considered a valuable freshwater resource globally while rapid industrial development and increased human population have caused significant quantities of pollutants entering into water bodies impairing river ecology and making river remediation efforts indispensable best 2018 in order to making effective river remediation strategies various studies have been conducted on the recovery of degraded river ecosystems anderson et al 2012 best 2018 heisler et al 2008 however it has been found that traditional remediation measures which aim to improve environmental physicochemical conditions to their original levels are insufficient to restore regional biodiversity and thus cause repeated deterioration of river environmental quality with associated high costs in terms of time and money liu et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 under such conditions alternative methods under the guidance of ecological theory are urgently required to halt deterioration recently alternative stable states theory has raised great scientific interest as it can explain sudden catastrophic shifts in ecosystems e g a shift from a macrophyte dominated clear water state towards a phytoplankton dominated turbid water state in shallow lakes scheffer et al 2001 1993 in addition this theory provides an instructive insight into the restoration of species diversity which has been considered a key of ecosystem stability and multifunctionality scheffer et al 2001 soliveres et al 2016 worm and duffy 2003 therefore it is necessary to identify whether alternative stable states theory can serve the restoration of river ecosystems in rivers microbes play an important role in both providing ecosystem services and influencing ecosystem functions zhang et al 2019a given that aquatic macrophytes and invertebrates have extremely low biomass in polluted rivers li et al 2017 wu et al 2017 benthic microorganisms are probably the first to recover from environmental stress due to their extreme sensitivity to environmental conditions their high diversity and their growth rate wu et al 2019 it should be noted that benthic communities contribute largely to the overall bacterial diversity in river ecosystems liu et al 2018 wang et al 2021 in addition their detection using high throughput sequencing is relatively more reliable than planktonic microorganisms detection in rivers because river water contains dna and biodiversity information from not only water collected at a particular sampling site but also upstream rainfall and soils liu et al 2018 wang et al 2021 importantly there is feedback between benthic microorganisms and environmental factors variation in environmental variables such as nutrients organic matter and oxygen content can shift both the diversity and the composition of microbial communities yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a in turn these physicochemical properties can be affected by microbial communities because of their significant role in mediating biogeochemical cycles zhang et al 2019b key feedback combined with strong interspecies interactions can increase the resilience of certain regimes and thus may trigger alternative stable states amor et al 2020 gonze et al 2017 scheffer et al 2001 however to our knowledge no studies have examined whether alternative stable states exist in river benthic microbiota therefore it is necessary to evaluate the presence of alternative microbiota states in river sediments and identify key environmental factors and strongly interacting species sis in order to understand mechanisms behind the degradation of river ecological health and identify the most effective strategies for river restoration over the past decades there have been many studies investigating catastrophic shifts in freshwater pagaling et al 2017 scheffer et al 1993 and marine ling et al 2015 petraitis and dudgeon 2004 aquatic ecosystems a catastrophic shift is a sudden obvious alteration of both the structure and function of ecosystems shifting the original state towards an alternative stable state scheffer et al 2009 2001 these states are inherently contrasting and the occurrence of sharp boundaries between them is clear in statistics these boundaries appear as jumps in time series and multimodality of frequency distributions in spatial data scheffer and carpenter 2003 moi et al 2020 identified a floating plant dominated state as an alternative stable state to a submerged plant dominated state using sudden variation in a time series describing macrophyte cover using pond microcosms pagaling et al 2017 found a multimodality of community composition in two alternative stable states dominated by different microorganisms it should be noted that testing for jumps requires extensive time series data and multimodality can only provide indirect evidence for alternative stable states therefore identifying alternative microbiota states remains a fundamental challenge lahti et al 2014 proposed an analytical framework to provide comprehensive evidence for bistable species i e species with two alternative stable states without the requirement of a long time series in their framework the prerequisite of bistability is bimodal frequency distribution of species abundance the key state variable in spatial data multiple short time series are further needed to show the temporal dynamics of key state variables subsequent studies have pointed out that coordinates generated using principal coordinates analysis pcoa to describe microbial community composition can also be used as a key state variable adler and holliger 2020 costea et al 2018 van de guchte et al 2020 expanding the application of the lahti et al 2014 framework to detect the existence of alternative states of microbiota therefore approaches to investigate alternative microbiota states in river benthic environment from field data may be well developed to date this approach has been exclusively used to investigate the human microbiome and no study has yet reported its application in microbial communities in river ecosystems given the vast differences between the human body and river ecosystems there remains a significant knowledge gap in identifying alternative microbiota states relating to river health in the present study we aim to answer the following questions i do alternative stable states of microbiota exist in river sediments if so ii what is the relationship between them and environmental stress environmental stress here mainly refers to nutrient contamination as nutrient contamination occurs in high concentration within the nanjing reach of yangtze river low dissolved oxygen concentration is not included because its role in shaping benthic microorganisms of urban rivers is less important than that of nutrients especially nitrogen compounds li et al 2017 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a 2019b iii what are the differences e g in community diversity network properties and taxa characteristics between alternative microbiota states to answer these questions next generation 16s rrna gene sequencing was used to describe benthic microbiota various multivariate statistical methods were applied to test for the existence of alternative stable states to assess the impact of physicochemical factors on their existence and to explore differences in microbiome diversity composition and taxonomic characterization among the different regimes considering the importance of microbial communities in providing ecosystem services the results of this study can provide useful insights toward improving not only microbial diversity but also ecosystem function in rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sample collection this study was conducted along 97 km of the nanjing reach of the yangtze river with approx 200 km total shoreline and average channel width of approx 1230 m and average water depth of approx 15 m the yangtze river is well known globally and is under considerable anthropogenic stress which has resulted in sharp decreases in the abundance of riparian vegetation and aquatic macrophytes recently a yangtze river protection campaign has been comprehensively implemented in an effort to improve the health of this large river considering the geographic location and economic development of nanjing city conservation of this reach of the river has been a priority in the nanjing reach the yangtze receives water from its tributaries which are located in urban areas and are polluted by municipal sewage and industrial wastewater thus threatening the ecological health of the main stream spatial heterogeneity is an important trigger of alternative stable states eklof et al 2020 sundstrom et al 2017 and can be detected using adequate spatial samples faust et al 2015 the severity of pollution at different sites within the nanjing reach of the yangtze river varies and this is predicted to increase spatial heterogeneity and thus the likelihood of detecting alternative stable states therefore fifty one sampling sites were established along the tributaries and main stream of the nanjing reach of the yangtze river fig 1 ten sampling sections with three sampling sites in each section were established in the main stream and one sampling site was established in each tributary 21 tributaries in total totaling 51 sampling sites sampling occurred in april and september 2019 in order to investigate temporal variation in microbial communities so a total of 102 samples were collected each river bed sediment sample was collected using a grab sampler xdb0201 changzhou pun sen electronic instrument factory changzhou china and subsequently mixed for homogenization sediment samples were sealed in sample bags placed in an ice box and immediately shipped to the laboratory each sample was aliquoted into two parts one was stored at 80 c for later microbial dna extraction and one was sieved through a 150 μm sieve stored at 20 c and freeze dried for later physicochemical analysis 2 2 environmental parameters analysis the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen nh 4 n nitrate nitrogen no 3 n and nitrite nitrogen no 2 n in sediments were measured using a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach company loveland colorado usa after extraction in potassium chloride solution 1 mol l sediment total phosphorus tp and total organic carbon toc were determined using the national standard methods hj 634 2012 and hj 658 2013 respectively li et al 2020 wu et al 2019 the comprehensive sediment quality identification csqi index was used to describe the environmental stress at each sampling site this index increases with the decreasing degree of environmental stress the csqi index is calculated based on five physicochemical variables nh 4 n no 3 n no 2 n tp and toc we used a min max normalization method to unify scores jain et al 2005 the minimum values of these variables can indicate the best sediment quality so data normalization was as follow 1 c s q i i c max c i c max c min where ci is the observed value of variable i i nh 4 n no 3 n no 2 n tp and toc cmax is the maximum value of variable i and cmin is the minimum value of variable i the final csqi was the sum of the scores of all of the variables 2 c s q i c s q i nh 4 n c s q i nh 3 n c s q i nh 2 n c s q i tp c s q i toc 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing analysis total dna was extracted and purified from 0 3 g of sediment sample using the fast soil dna kit according to the manufacturer s instructions samples were examined for dna integrity in agarose gels by electrophoresis and then stored at 20 c until amplification and sequencing pcr amplification and illumina hiseq sequencing were conducted at shanghai biozeron co ltd shanghai china the v3 v4 regions of the 16s rrna gene was targeted to amplify microbial sequences using primer pairs 341f cctaygggrbgcascag and 806r ggactacnngggtatctaat the pcr protocol was as follows 95 c for 5 min to denature dna 27 cycles at 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s 72 c for 45 s and a final extension of 10 min at 72 c sequences were trimmed and aligned using the silva reference alignment database after quality checking qiime v 1 9 1 was used to analyze and filter the remaining sequencing reads the 16s rrna sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using the uclust method based on a 97 similarity cut off sequences were taxonomically assigned by comparison to the silva 128 database quast et al 2013 2 4 statistical analysis pcoa of the microbial composition bray curtis dissimilarity was conducted using the vegan and ape packages in r v4 0 2 https www r project org bimodal distribution and graph colouration were determined according to the results from mclust v5 4 7 scrucca et al 2016 the bimodality coefficient and the tipping point dividing two alternative stable states were calculated in the microbiome r package the relationship between microbial community and physicochemical factors was tested using the mantel test in r and the redundancy analysis rda in canoco 5 significant physicochemical factors correlated with microbial community were identified using the mantel test mantel 1967 and these factors were input into the rda for visualization the α diversity indices including shannon chao simpson and evenness indices were calculated using the vegan package and the difference of a diversity between two microbiota states was examined using the wilcoxon test in r otu co occurrence matrices were obtained by spearman s correlation analysis in r specifically orders with occurrence in at least 25 of samples and at least 10 counts in each cluster were determined to calculate spearman s rank correlation coefficients ρ pairwise in addition significant p value 0 05 and strong ρ 0 6 correlations between orders were further selected gephi software http gephi github io was used to visualize resulting networks and calculate relevant topological properties such as number of nodes average degree and modularity the significantly different taxa in each alternative microbiota stat were determined using the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse program segata et al 2011 this analysis was performed online at http huttenhowersph harvard edu galaxy and taxa with significantly different abundances were identified by employing the factorial kruskal wallis rank sum test α 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of alternative microbiota states pcoa of the microbiome composition was conducted to illustrate dissimilarities between different sediment samples the results showed two microbial communities separated along the first pcoa axis using combined data from april and september fig 2 a a closer examination revealed that the microbiome in the tributaries and the main stream belonged to two different community types in the april survey fig 2b interestingly these microbial communities became similar in september which may be because september is the wet season as large scale precipitation events can increase microbial similarity by reducing environmental heterogeneity in order to further examine these two microbial communities pcoa1 coordinates which can explain more variation than pcoa2 coordinates were used as indicators of microbiota state van de guchte et al 2020 a high bimodality coefficient fig 2c d revealed that the frequency distribution of microbiota status was bimodal and implied the existence of two alternative microbiota states with a tipping point of 0 16 between the community types r package microbiome notably the tipping point for microbiota states in the april samples was the same as that in the merged samples fig 2 suggesting that the number of samples analyzed was sufficient to detect alternative states faust et al 2015 because bimodality alone is insufficient to identify bistability the temporal dynamics of the states were further examined sampling sites closer to the tipping point had larger temporal variation in microbial community composition figs 2d s1 temporal dynamic is a proxy of stability such that intermediate microbiota status with large temporal deviation is unstable lahti et al 2014 this observation shows that two contrasting states are stable and divided by an unstable state at the intermediate thus alternative microbiota states exist in this ecosystem lahti et al 2014 in order to better distinguish between these two microbiota states we refer to the microbial community type with low values of pcoa1 coordinates as microbiota state a and the microbial community type with relatively high values of pcoa1 coordinates as microbiota state b 3 2 alternative microbiota state occurrence is related to environmental stress it has been reported that different tributaries of the nanjing reach of the yangtze river have suffered from different levels of pollution and the water quality of the main stream is better than that of the tributaries bureau 2019 additionally the sediment quality of the main stream is likely to be higher than that of the tributaries and this was confirmed in this study using the csqi index fig 3 a table s1 this may be the case for three reasons first the hydrology of the tributaries is different from that of the main stream in the yangtze river both river discharge and flow velocity of the tributaries are less than those of the main stream xiong et al 2013 leading to relatively more pollutants deposited in sediment in the tributaries second the yangtze river protection campaign prioritizes the main stream yang and xu 2020 and has led to improvement of environmental quality there third the tributaries are located in urban areas and many of them were canalized with hard bottoms wan and wang 2021 by contrast the main stream is a natural river with natural sediments thus having relatively high environmental capacity consequently the tributaries are in a more polluted state than is the main stream importantly the csqi index between sampling sites in state a and state b also showed significant difference p 8 20e 11 these observations combined with results in fig 2b illustrate the importance of environmental stress in driving bimodality in microbial communities the relationship between microbial status and environmental stress was therefore examined the results of this analysis showed that lower csqi scores worse sediment quality were mostly associated with microbiota state a and all microbial communities were in state a when the csqi index was less than 3 7 fig 3b the inverse is true for higher csqi scores better sediment quality that are mainly associated with microbiota state b and almost all microbial communities were in state b when the csqi index was larger than 4 7 it should be noted that the microbiota state can be either a or b when the csqi index is between 3 7 and 4 7 confirming the existence of two alternative microbiota states and confirming that environmental stress is an important driver scheffer et al 2001 van de guchte et al 2020 the importance of environmental stress as a driver of alternative microbiota states is also indicated by seasonal changes in microbial communities at tributary sampling sites most tributary microbial communities showed little seasonal change between april and september which is attributed to high levels of environmental stress in these habitats fig 2b fig s2b in contrast several tributary microbial communities showed large seasonal changes because the environmental quality of their habitats has been largely improved from april to september and the microbiota state therefore shifted toward microbiota state b attractively most microbial communities in the main stream that have high environmental quality have not experienced a regime shift while their seasonal changes were greater than those of microbial communities in tributaries fig 2b fig s2a this observation is likely the result of river characteristics and sampling point selection river water is flowing and plentiful rainfall increases the fluidity of rivers grill et al 2019 lynch et al 2019 making their microbial communities homogeneous as a result differences between microbial communities sampled along the main stream fig 1 decrease from april the normal water period to september the wet period presenting greater seasonal changes compared to the microbial communities in the tributaries the mantel test and rda were performed to further examine the correlation between microbial communities and environmental factors the mantel test indicated that nh 4 n p 0 001 and no 3 n p 0 009 concentrations were significantly correlated with the microbial communities these factors were selected to analyze using rda and the results indicated that nh 4 n concentration had a stronger influence on the composition of microbial communities than did no 3 n concentration fig 3c furthermore the angles between almost all communities in microbiota state a and nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations were 90 indicating positive relationships conversely the relationships between these environmental variables and many communities in microbiota state b were negative further examination also revealed relatively low concentrations of nh 4 n and no 3 n in the habitat of communities in state b habitat b and their relatively high concentrations in the habitat of communities in state a habitat a fig s3 these results directly link environmental stress particularly high nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations to alternative microbiota states and illustrate the significant role of environmental stress in generating these two states 3 3 diversity and network properties of alternative microbiota states in order to assess the differentiation of microbial community properties in the two alternative microbiota states α diversity indices between microbiota states a and b were compared the results revealed that microbiota state b was characterized by a slightly reduced simpson index and strongly increased shannon chao and evenness indices fig s4 all a diversity estimators of microbiome exhibited statistically significant discrimination p 0 01 between these two regimes based on the analyses of the wilcoxon test fig s4 suggesting that communities in microbiota state b were of high diversity and richness as all indices showed a markedly increasing trend of α diversity from state a to state b therefore microbiota state a was characterized by low α diversity which may be attributed to the negative effect of high environmental stress on microbial communities in addition to the α diversity a network analysis was used to differentiate among microbial community properties in the two microbiota states in greater detail regionally abundant orders those present in 25 of samples in each microbiota state were selected to construct co occurrence networks fig 4 301 nodes were identified to depict significantly robust interactions between nodes in microbiota state a and 292 nodes were identified to depict significantly robust interactions between nodes in microbiota state b topological characteristics showed that the network of state b network b contained fewer nodes but more edges than did the network of state a network a indicating a larger number of co occurrences in network b table 1 in addition the average degree density average clustering coefficient and average path length presented increasing trends from network a to network b implying the co occurrence pattern in microbiota state a was inferior to that in microbiota state b surprisingly the modularity in network a was slightly higher than in network b which may be the result of a higher proportion of significant interactions among certain species in the module these analyses show that the microbial community properties of two alternative microbiota states were distinguishable briefly α diversity and co occurrence pattern in microbiota state b were superior than those in microbiota state a possibly due to the unfavorable sediment quality identified in habitat a it has been reported that adverse physicochemical conditions induced by anthropogenic disturbance can suppress microbiome α diversity liao et al 2020 and co occurrence wu et al 2019 the relatively high modularity observed in network a may imply that different modules were tightly linked and thus strengthened the robustness of this network lurgi et al 2019 which will increase the resilience of state a considering the low sediment quality in habitat a this high modularity is supposed to impede the efficacy of restoration measures 3 4 composition and taxonomic characterization of alternative microbiota states microbial composition was then investigated in order to understand the differences in dominant taxa between alternative microbiota states the results indicated that proteobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi nitrospirae bacteroidetes actinobacteria firmicutes and verrucomicrobia were the dominant phyla in both state a and state b fig s5 among these phyla nitrospirae and firmicutes were important in nitrogen transformation which may explain the significance of nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations in affecting microbial community composition zhang et al 2019b in addition state a harbors abundant gemmatimonadetes and latescibacteria while state b harbors abundant spirochaetae and aminicenantes lefse analysis was used to further identify taxa that differed greatly between these two regimes using a logarithmic lda score of 3 7 as a threshold fig 5 according to the lefse analysis proteobacteria including the order desulfobacterales firmicutes including the order clostridiales and bacteroidetes including the order bacteroidales were the most abundant taxa in microbiota state a desulfobacterales is a sulfate reducing bacterium positively correlated with nh 4 n concentration gao et al 2017 clostridiales and bacteroidales are major fecal indicators found in black odorous rivers with extremely low oxygen content because they lack aerobic respiration and can therefore only thrive in anaerobic sediment hu et al 2017 their enrichment in habitat a rather than in habitat b demonstrated the degraded environmental quality of habitat a nitrospirae including the order nitrospirales gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria and ws3 were the most abundant taxa in state b nitrospirales is capable of ammonia oxidation kuypers et al 2018 and therefore contributes to the low nh 4 n concentration in habitat b in addition the enrichment of nitrospirales in habitat b rather than in habitat a has demonstrated the high environmental quality of habitat b because nitrospirales thrive in aerobic conditions and oxygen content is an important indicator of river ecological health wu et al 2019 by linking the results of lefse analysis to the network analysis three significantly differential taxa including clostridiales nitrospirales and myxococcales were found to have high hub scores top 50 in 301 taxa in network a taxa with high hub scores are believed to be ecologically relevant and are considered critical actors in their co occurrence network zamkovaya et al 2020 this observation was reminiscent of sis and the presence of a positive circuit which are two important elements triggering multi stability gonze et al 2017 microbiota state a thus can probably resist catastrophic shift to microbiota state b due to their resilience strengthened by negative correlation e g competition and inhibition between clostridiales and nitrospirales or myxococcales and positive interaction e g mutualism between nitrospirales and myxococcales fig s6 this resilience may make recovery measures in habitat a difficult in addition syntrophobacterales and rhizobiales were also found to have high hub scores top 50 in 292 taxa in network b while their interspecies interactions were too weak to incorporate them into the sis pearson s r 0 25 as a result the resilience of network b is likely low relative to network a which is the same as the speculation in section 3 3 under such conditions conservation of habitat b is necessary to prevent its catastrophic transition 3 5 implications for the restoration of river ecosystems benthic environments harbor abundant microbial communities that serve as an important and integrative indicator of river ecosystem health with the increase of anthropogenic disturbance on river ecosystems remediation has become indispensable this study provides a deeper understanding of how microbial communities respond to environmental stress by verifying the existence of two alternative microbiota states in river sediments the results imply that communities in microbiota state b will have high diversity if environmental conditions are favorable 3 7 csqi index however if pollution markedly reduces environmental quality the microbiota state will shift to microbiota state a with markedly decreased diversity fig 6 once a catastrophic shift happens the recovery of both structure and function of river benthic ecosystems will be more difficult due to the hysteresis effect presenting a huge challenge to management agencies fig 6 in addition theory predicts that catastrophic shifts will start in areas where ecosystems are closest to environmental thresholds and then gradually spread to the downstream eklof et al 2020 hilt et al 2011 in order to prevent the occurrence and spread of catastrophic shifts in a river ecosystem specific attention should be paid to conditions at the location closest to the environmental threshold csqi 3 7 or 4 7 specifically suitable environmental conditions csqi 3 7 or even 4 7 should be kept in order to maintain the high diversity of microbiota this finding provides ecologically meaningful perspective for not only the improvement of the physicochemical environment but also the efficient conservation of biological diversity many studies have demonstrated that strong interspecies interactions and feedback between biotic and abiotic elements are essential to the resilience of ecosystems gonze et al 2017 kadowaki et al 2018 scheffer et al 2001 therefore it is suggested to restore ecosystems by strengthening the resilience of the desired state or by eroding the resilience of the unwanted state ling et al 2015 in this study microbiota state a was characterized by abundant clostridiales while microbiota state b was characterized by abundant nitrospirales and myxococcales and their strong interactions likely maintain the stability of state a in addition nh 4 n and no 3 n are important environmental factors driving alternative microbiota states it may be plausible then to recover the ecological health of habitat a in two ways by increasing nitrospirales and myxococcales abundance or decreasing the negative effect of clostridiales on other two taxa or by improving environmental quality through decreasing the concentrations of nh 4 n and no 3 n consequently the results obtained here reflect the effectiveness of the theory of alternative stable states in guiding ecological restoration and provide new insight into river ecological restoration by taking key feedback and interspecies interactions into consideration 4 conclusions in summary this study provided the first formal field proof for the existence of alternative microbiota states in river benthic environments and environmental stress mainly nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations is believed to be an important driver of change diversity composition and taxonomic characterization of microbial communities differed notably between the two alternative microbiota states notably the degraded microbiota state will shift to the alternative healthier stable state accompanied by a strong increase in biodiversity as well as co occurrence pattern if environmental quality is favorable the study into interspecies interactions revealed several ecologically key taxa including clostridiales nitrospirales and myxococcales that play a critical role in maintaining the stability of microbiota state a given that our sampling area covered the nanjing reach of the yangtze river and the sampling points used were sufficient to detect bistability this study provides a new insight into effective river remediation that focuses not only on the improvement of environmental quality but also on the management of biological elements in addition planktonic communities also contribute significantly to river ecosystem service and function therefore further effort should be taken to explore whether there are alternative microbiota states in river planktonic communities in order to better understand the responses of microbial communities to environmental stress and better implement effective river restoration measures declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

because of its huge spatial heterogeneity and varying degrees of pollution bimodal distributions combined with temporal variations of microbiota status provided direct evidence of bistability by showing the instability at the intermediate in addition environmental stress particularly concentrations of nh 4 n and no 3 n was identified as an important driver of alternative microbiota states from the perspectives of the behavior of bistable ecosystems comparison of α diversity indices and network properties between two alternative microbiota states revealed that the diversity and co occurrence pattern of microbial communities will be high if they are settled in favorable environments i e comprehensive sediment quality identification index 3 7 key taxa including clostridiales nitrospirales and myxococcales were discerned by combining lefse and network analysis and their strong interspecies interactions were believed to be an important factor in triggering alternative microbiota states this study suggests alternative stable states theory should be considered in river remediation to better understand the response of river ecosystems to environmental stress and the effect of hysteresis benefiting the implementation of effective monitoring and restoration strategies in a river of urban area graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords river sediments alternative stable states theory hysteresis microbial communities environmental stress effective river restoration 1 introduction rivers are considered a valuable freshwater resource globally while rapid industrial development and increased human population have caused significant quantities of pollutants entering into water bodies impairing river ecology and making river remediation efforts indispensable best 2018 in order to making effective river remediation strategies various studies have been conducted on the recovery of degraded river ecosystems anderson et al 2012 best 2018 heisler et al 2008 however it has been found that traditional remediation measures which aim to improve environmental physicochemical conditions to their original levels are insufficient to restore regional biodiversity and thus cause repeated deterioration of river environmental quality with associated high costs in terms of time and money liu et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 under such conditions alternative methods under the guidance of ecological theory are urgently required to halt deterioration recently alternative stable states theory has raised great scientific interest as it can explain sudden catastrophic shifts in ecosystems e g a shift from a macrophyte dominated clear water state towards a phytoplankton dominated turbid water state in shallow lakes scheffer et al 2001 1993 in addition this theory provides an instructive insight into the restoration of species diversity which has been considered a key of ecosystem stability and multifunctionality scheffer et al 2001 soliveres et al 2016 worm and duffy 2003 therefore it is necessary to identify whether alternative stable states theory can serve the restoration of river ecosystems in rivers microbes play an important role in both providing ecosystem services and influencing ecosystem functions zhang et al 2019a given that aquatic macrophytes and invertebrates have extremely low biomass in polluted rivers li et al 2017 wu et al 2017 benthic microorganisms are probably the first to recover from environmental stress due to their extreme sensitivity to environmental conditions their high diversity and their growth rate wu et al 2019 it should be noted that benthic communities contribute largely to the overall bacterial diversity in river ecosystems liu et al 2018 wang et al 2021 in addition their detection using high throughput sequencing is relatively more reliable than planktonic microorganisms detection in rivers because river water contains dna and biodiversity information from not only water collected at a particular sampling site but also upstream rainfall and soils liu et al 2018 wang et al 2021 importantly there is feedback between benthic microorganisms and environmental factors variation in environmental variables such as nutrients organic matter and oxygen content can shift both the diversity and the composition of microbial communities yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a in turn these physicochemical properties can be affected by microbial communities because of their significant role in mediating biogeochemical cycles zhang et al 2019b key feedback combined with strong interspecies interactions can increase the resilience of certain regimes and thus may trigger alternative stable states amor et al 2020 gonze et al 2017 scheffer et al 2001 however to our knowledge no studies have examined whether alternative stable states exist in river benthic microbiota therefore it is necessary to evaluate the presence of alternative microbiota states in river sediments and identify key environmental factors and strongly interacting species sis in order to understand mechanisms behind the degradation of river ecological health and identify the most effective strategies for river restoration over the past decades there have been many studies investigating catastrophic shifts in freshwater pagaling et al 2017 scheffer et al 1993 and marine ling et al 2015 petraitis and dudgeon 2004 aquatic ecosystems a catastrophic shift is a sudden obvious alteration of both the structure and function of ecosystems shifting the original state towards an alternative stable state scheffer et al 2009 2001 these states are inherently contrasting and the occurrence of sharp boundaries between them is clear in statistics these boundaries appear as jumps in time series and multimodality of frequency distributions in spatial data scheffer and carpenter 2003 moi et al 2020 identified a floating plant dominated state as an alternative stable state to a submerged plant dominated state using sudden variation in a time series describing macrophyte cover using pond microcosms pagaling et al 2017 found a multimodality of community composition in two alternative stable states dominated by different microorganisms it should be noted that testing for jumps requires extensive time series data and multimodality can only provide indirect evidence for alternative stable states therefore identifying alternative microbiota states remains a fundamental challenge lahti et al 2014 proposed an analytical framework to provide comprehensive evidence for bistable species i e species with two alternative stable states without the requirement of a long time series in their framework the prerequisite of bistability is bimodal frequency distribution of species abundance the key state variable in spatial data multiple short time series are further needed to show the temporal dynamics of key state variables subsequent studies have pointed out that coordinates generated using principal coordinates analysis pcoa to describe microbial community composition can also be used as a key state variable adler and holliger 2020 costea et al 2018 van de guchte et al 2020 expanding the application of the lahti et al 2014 framework to detect the existence of alternative states of microbiota therefore approaches to investigate alternative microbiota states in river benthic environment from field data may be well developed to date this approach has been exclusively used to investigate the human microbiome and no study has yet reported its application in microbial communities in river ecosystems given the vast differences between the human body and river ecosystems there remains a significant knowledge gap in identifying alternative microbiota states relating to river health in the present study we aim to answer the following questions i do alternative stable states of microbiota exist in river sediments if so ii what is the relationship between them and environmental stress environmental stress here mainly refers to nutrient contamination as nutrient contamination occurs in high concentration within the nanjing reach of yangtze river low dissolved oxygen concentration is not included because its role in shaping benthic microorganisms of urban rivers is less important than that of nutrients especially nitrogen compounds li et al 2017 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a 2019b iii what are the differences e g in community diversity network properties and taxa characteristics between alternative microbiota states to answer these questions next generation 16s rrna gene sequencing was used to describe benthic microbiota various multivariate statistical methods were applied to test for the existence of alternative stable states to assess the impact of physicochemical factors on their existence and to explore differences in microbiome diversity composition and taxonomic characterization among the different regimes considering the importance of microbial communities in providing ecosystem services the results of this study can provide useful insights toward improving not only microbial diversity but also ecosystem function in rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sample collection this study was conducted along 97 km of the nanjing reach of the yangtze river with approx 200 km total shoreline and average channel width of approx 1230 m and average water depth of approx 15 m the yangtze river is well known globally and is under considerable anthropogenic stress which has resulted in sharp decreases in the abundance of riparian vegetation and aquatic macrophytes recently a yangtze river protection campaign has been comprehensively implemented in an effort to improve the health of this large river considering the geographic location and economic development of nanjing city conservation of this reach of the river has been a priority in the nanjing reach the yangtze receives water from its tributaries which are located in urban areas and are polluted by municipal sewage and industrial wastewater thus threatening the ecological health of the main stream spatial heterogeneity is an important trigger of alternative stable states eklof et al 2020 sundstrom et al 2017 and can be detected using adequate spatial samples faust et al 2015 the severity of pollution at different sites within the nanjing reach of the yangtze river varies and this is predicted to increase spatial heterogeneity and thus the likelihood of detecting alternative stable states therefore fifty one sampling sites were established along the tributaries and main stream of the nanjing reach of the yangtze river fig 1 ten sampling sections with three sampling sites in each section were established in the main stream and one sampling site was established in each tributary 21 tributaries in total totaling 51 sampling sites sampling occurred in april and september 2019 in order to investigate temporal variation in microbial communities so a total of 102 samples were collected each river bed sediment sample was collected using a grab sampler xdb0201 changzhou pun sen electronic instrument factory changzhou china and subsequently mixed for homogenization sediment samples were sealed in sample bags placed in an ice box and immediately shipped to the laboratory each sample was aliquoted into two parts one was stored at 80 c for later microbial dna extraction and one was sieved through a 150 μm sieve stored at 20 c and freeze dried for later physicochemical analysis 2 2 environmental parameters analysis the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen nh 4 n nitrate nitrogen no 3 n and nitrite nitrogen no 2 n in sediments were measured using a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach company loveland colorado usa after extraction in potassium chloride solution 1 mol l sediment total phosphorus tp and total organic carbon toc were determined using the national standard methods hj 634 2012 and hj 658 2013 respectively li et al 2020 wu et al 2019 the comprehensive sediment quality identification csqi index was used to describe the environmental stress at each sampling site this index increases with the decreasing degree of environmental stress the csqi index is calculated based on five physicochemical variables nh 4 n no 3 n no 2 n tp and toc we used a min max normalization method to unify scores jain et al 2005 the minimum values of these variables can indicate the best sediment quality so data normalization was as follow 1 c s q i i c max c i c max c min where ci is the observed value of variable i i nh 4 n no 3 n no 2 n tp and toc cmax is the maximum value of variable i and cmin is the minimum value of variable i the final csqi was the sum of the scores of all of the variables 2 c s q i c s q i nh 4 n c s q i nh 3 n c s q i nh 2 n c s q i tp c s q i toc 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing analysis total dna was extracted and purified from 0 3 g of sediment sample using the fast soil dna kit according to the manufacturer s instructions samples were examined for dna integrity in agarose gels by electrophoresis and then stored at 20 c until amplification and sequencing pcr amplification and illumina hiseq sequencing were conducted at shanghai biozeron co ltd shanghai china the v3 v4 regions of the 16s rrna gene was targeted to amplify microbial sequences using primer pairs 341f cctaygggrbgcascag and 806r ggactacnngggtatctaat the pcr protocol was as follows 95 c for 5 min to denature dna 27 cycles at 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s 72 c for 45 s and a final extension of 10 min at 72 c sequences were trimmed and aligned using the silva reference alignment database after quality checking qiime v 1 9 1 was used to analyze and filter the remaining sequencing reads the 16s rrna sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using the uclust method based on a 97 similarity cut off sequences were taxonomically assigned by comparison to the silva 128 database quast et al 2013 2 4 statistical analysis pcoa of the microbial composition bray curtis dissimilarity was conducted using the vegan and ape packages in r v4 0 2 https www r project org bimodal distribution and graph colouration were determined according to the results from mclust v5 4 7 scrucca et al 2016 the bimodality coefficient and the tipping point dividing two alternative stable states were calculated in the microbiome r package the relationship between microbial community and physicochemical factors was tested using the mantel test in r and the redundancy analysis rda in canoco 5 significant physicochemical factors correlated with microbial community were identified using the mantel test mantel 1967 and these factors were input into the rda for visualization the α diversity indices including shannon chao simpson and evenness indices were calculated using the vegan package and the difference of a diversity between two microbiota states was examined using the wilcoxon test in r otu co occurrence matrices were obtained by spearman s correlation analysis in r specifically orders with occurrence in at least 25 of samples and at least 10 counts in each cluster were determined to calculate spearman s rank correlation coefficients ρ pairwise in addition significant p value 0 05 and strong ρ 0 6 correlations between orders were further selected gephi software http gephi github io was used to visualize resulting networks and calculate relevant topological properties such as number of nodes average degree and modularity the significantly different taxa in each alternative microbiota stat were determined using the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse program segata et al 2011 this analysis was performed online at http huttenhowersph harvard edu galaxy and taxa with significantly different abundances were identified by employing the factorial kruskal wallis rank sum test α 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of alternative microbiota states pcoa of the microbiome composition was conducted to illustrate dissimilarities between different sediment samples the results showed two microbial communities separated along the first pcoa axis using combined data from april and september fig 2 a a closer examination revealed that the microbiome in the tributaries and the main stream belonged to two different community types in the april survey fig 2b interestingly these microbial communities became similar in september which may be because september is the wet season as large scale precipitation events can increase microbial similarity by reducing environmental heterogeneity in order to further examine these two microbial communities pcoa1 coordinates which can explain more variation than pcoa2 coordinates were used as indicators of microbiota state van de guchte et al 2020 a high bimodality coefficient fig 2c d revealed that the frequency distribution of microbiota status was bimodal and implied the existence of two alternative microbiota states with a tipping point of 0 16 between the community types r package microbiome notably the tipping point for microbiota states in the april samples was the same as that in the merged samples fig 2 suggesting that the number of samples analyzed was sufficient to detect alternative states faust et al 2015 because bimodality alone is insufficient to identify bistability the temporal dynamics of the states were further examined sampling sites closer to the tipping point had larger temporal variation in microbial community composition figs 2d s1 temporal dynamic is a proxy of stability such that intermediate microbiota status with large temporal deviation is unstable lahti et al 2014 this observation shows that two contrasting states are stable and divided by an unstable state at the intermediate thus alternative microbiota states exist in this ecosystem lahti et al 2014 in order to better distinguish between these two microbiota states we refer to the microbial community type with low values of pcoa1 coordinates as microbiota state a and the microbial community type with relatively high values of pcoa1 coordinates as microbiota state b 3 2 alternative microbiota state occurrence is related to environmental stress it has been reported that different tributaries of the nanjing reach of the yangtze river have suffered from different levels of pollution and the water quality of the main stream is better than that of the tributaries bureau 2019 additionally the sediment quality of the main stream is likely to be higher than that of the tributaries and this was confirmed in this study using the csqi index fig 3 a table s1 this may be the case for three reasons first the hydrology of the tributaries is different from that of the main stream in the yangtze river both river discharge and flow velocity of the tributaries are less than those of the main stream xiong et al 2013 leading to relatively more pollutants deposited in sediment in the tributaries second the yangtze river protection campaign prioritizes the main stream yang and xu 2020 and has led to improvement of environmental quality there third the tributaries are located in urban areas and many of them were canalized with hard bottoms wan and wang 2021 by contrast the main stream is a natural river with natural sediments thus having relatively high environmental capacity consequently the tributaries are in a more polluted state than is the main stream importantly the csqi index between sampling sites in state a and state b also showed significant difference p 8 20e 11 these observations combined with results in fig 2b illustrate the importance of environmental stress in driving bimodality in microbial communities the relationship between microbial status and environmental stress was therefore examined the results of this analysis showed that lower csqi scores worse sediment quality were mostly associated with microbiota state a and all microbial communities were in state a when the csqi index was less than 3 7 fig 3b the inverse is true for higher csqi scores better sediment quality that are mainly associated with microbiota state b and almost all microbial communities were in state b when the csqi index was larger than 4 7 it should be noted that the microbiota state can be either a or b when the csqi index is between 3 7 and 4 7 confirming the existence of two alternative microbiota states and confirming that environmental stress is an important driver scheffer et al 2001 van de guchte et al 2020 the importance of environmental stress as a driver of alternative microbiota states is also indicated by seasonal changes in microbial communities at tributary sampling sites most tributary microbial communities showed little seasonal change between april and september which is attributed to high levels of environmental stress in these habitats fig 2b fig s2b in contrast several tributary microbial communities showed large seasonal changes because the environmental quality of their habitats has been largely improved from april to september and the microbiota state therefore shifted toward microbiota state b attractively most microbial communities in the main stream that have high environmental quality have not experienced a regime shift while their seasonal changes were greater than those of microbial communities in tributaries fig 2b fig s2a this observation is likely the result of river characteristics and sampling point selection river water is flowing and plentiful rainfall increases the fluidity of rivers grill et al 2019 lynch et al 2019 making their microbial communities homogeneous as a result differences between microbial communities sampled along the main stream fig 1 decrease from april the normal water period to september the wet period presenting greater seasonal changes compared to the microbial communities in the tributaries the mantel test and rda were performed to further examine the correlation between microbial communities and environmental factors the mantel test indicated that nh 4 n p 0 001 and no 3 n p 0 009 concentrations were significantly correlated with the microbial communities these factors were selected to analyze using rda and the results indicated that nh 4 n concentration had a stronger influence on the composition of microbial communities than did no 3 n concentration fig 3c furthermore the angles between almost all communities in microbiota state a and nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations were 90 indicating positive relationships conversely the relationships between these environmental variables and many communities in microbiota state b were negative further examination also revealed relatively low concentrations of nh 4 n and no 3 n in the habitat of communities in state b habitat b and their relatively high concentrations in the habitat of communities in state a habitat a fig s3 these results directly link environmental stress particularly high nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations to alternative microbiota states and illustrate the significant role of environmental stress in generating these two states 3 3 diversity and network properties of alternative microbiota states in order to assess the differentiation of microbial community properties in the two alternative microbiota states α diversity indices between microbiota states a and b were compared the results revealed that microbiota state b was characterized by a slightly reduced simpson index and strongly increased shannon chao and evenness indices fig s4 all a diversity estimators of microbiome exhibited statistically significant discrimination p 0 01 between these two regimes based on the analyses of the wilcoxon test fig s4 suggesting that communities in microbiota state b were of high diversity and richness as all indices showed a markedly increasing trend of α diversity from state a to state b therefore microbiota state a was characterized by low α diversity which may be attributed to the negative effect of high environmental stress on microbial communities in addition to the α diversity a network analysis was used to differentiate among microbial community properties in the two microbiota states in greater detail regionally abundant orders those present in 25 of samples in each microbiota state were selected to construct co occurrence networks fig 4 301 nodes were identified to depict significantly robust interactions between nodes in microbiota state a and 292 nodes were identified to depict significantly robust interactions between nodes in microbiota state b topological characteristics showed that the network of state b network b contained fewer nodes but more edges than did the network of state a network a indicating a larger number of co occurrences in network b table 1 in addition the average degree density average clustering coefficient and average path length presented increasing trends from network a to network b implying the co occurrence pattern in microbiota state a was inferior to that in microbiota state b surprisingly the modularity in network a was slightly higher than in network b which may be the result of a higher proportion of significant interactions among certain species in the module these analyses show that the microbial community properties of two alternative microbiota states were distinguishable briefly α diversity and co occurrence pattern in microbiota state b were superior than those in microbiota state a possibly due to the unfavorable sediment quality identified in habitat a it has been reported that adverse physicochemical conditions induced by anthropogenic disturbance can suppress microbiome α diversity liao et al 2020 and co occurrence wu et al 2019 the relatively high modularity observed in network a may imply that different modules were tightly linked and thus strengthened the robustness of this network lurgi et al 2019 which will increase the resilience of state a considering the low sediment quality in habitat a this high modularity is supposed to impede the efficacy of restoration measures 3 4 composition and taxonomic characterization of alternative microbiota states microbial composition was then investigated in order to understand the differences in dominant taxa between alternative microbiota states the results indicated that proteobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi nitrospirae bacteroidetes actinobacteria firmicutes and verrucomicrobia were the dominant phyla in both state a and state b fig s5 among these phyla nitrospirae and firmicutes were important in nitrogen transformation which may explain the significance of nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations in affecting microbial community composition zhang et al 2019b in addition state a harbors abundant gemmatimonadetes and latescibacteria while state b harbors abundant spirochaetae and aminicenantes lefse analysis was used to further identify taxa that differed greatly between these two regimes using a logarithmic lda score of 3 7 as a threshold fig 5 according to the lefse analysis proteobacteria including the order desulfobacterales firmicutes including the order clostridiales and bacteroidetes including the order bacteroidales were the most abundant taxa in microbiota state a desulfobacterales is a sulfate reducing bacterium positively correlated with nh 4 n concentration gao et al 2017 clostridiales and bacteroidales are major fecal indicators found in black odorous rivers with extremely low oxygen content because they lack aerobic respiration and can therefore only thrive in anaerobic sediment hu et al 2017 their enrichment in habitat a rather than in habitat b demonstrated the degraded environmental quality of habitat a nitrospirae including the order nitrospirales gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria and ws3 were the most abundant taxa in state b nitrospirales is capable of ammonia oxidation kuypers et al 2018 and therefore contributes to the low nh 4 n concentration in habitat b in addition the enrichment of nitrospirales in habitat b rather than in habitat a has demonstrated the high environmental quality of habitat b because nitrospirales thrive in aerobic conditions and oxygen content is an important indicator of river ecological health wu et al 2019 by linking the results of lefse analysis to the network analysis three significantly differential taxa including clostridiales nitrospirales and myxococcales were found to have high hub scores top 50 in 301 taxa in network a taxa with high hub scores are believed to be ecologically relevant and are considered critical actors in their co occurrence network zamkovaya et al 2020 this observation was reminiscent of sis and the presence of a positive circuit which are two important elements triggering multi stability gonze et al 2017 microbiota state a thus can probably resist catastrophic shift to microbiota state b due to their resilience strengthened by negative correlation e g competition and inhibition between clostridiales and nitrospirales or myxococcales and positive interaction e g mutualism between nitrospirales and myxococcales fig s6 this resilience may make recovery measures in habitat a difficult in addition syntrophobacterales and rhizobiales were also found to have high hub scores top 50 in 292 taxa in network b while their interspecies interactions were too weak to incorporate them into the sis pearson s r 0 25 as a result the resilience of network b is likely low relative to network a which is the same as the speculation in section 3 3 under such conditions conservation of habitat b is necessary to prevent its catastrophic transition 3 5 implications for the restoration of river ecosystems benthic environments harbor abundant microbial communities that serve as an important and integrative indicator of river ecosystem health with the increase of anthropogenic disturbance on river ecosystems remediation has become indispensable this study provides a deeper understanding of how microbial communities respond to environmental stress by verifying the existence of two alternative microbiota states in river sediments the results imply that communities in microbiota state b will have high diversity if environmental conditions are favorable 3 7 csqi index however if pollution markedly reduces environmental quality the microbiota state will shift to microbiota state a with markedly decreased diversity fig 6 once a catastrophic shift happens the recovery of both structure and function of river benthic ecosystems will be more difficult due to the hysteresis effect presenting a huge challenge to management agencies fig 6 in addition theory predicts that catastrophic shifts will start in areas where ecosystems are closest to environmental thresholds and then gradually spread to the downstream eklof et al 2020 hilt et al 2011 in order to prevent the occurrence and spread of catastrophic shifts in a river ecosystem specific attention should be paid to conditions at the location closest to the environmental threshold csqi 3 7 or 4 7 specifically suitable environmental conditions csqi 3 7 or even 4 7 should be kept in order to maintain the high diversity of microbiota this finding provides ecologically meaningful perspective for not only the improvement of the physicochemical environment but also the efficient conservation of biological diversity many studies have demonstrated that strong interspecies interactions and feedback between biotic and abiotic elements are essential to the resilience of ecosystems gonze et al 2017 kadowaki et al 2018 scheffer et al 2001 therefore it is suggested to restore ecosystems by strengthening the resilience of the desired state or by eroding the resilience of the unwanted state ling et al 2015 in this study microbiota state a was characterized by abundant clostridiales while microbiota state b was characterized by abundant nitrospirales and myxococcales and their strong interactions likely maintain the stability of state a in addition nh 4 n and no 3 n are important environmental factors driving alternative microbiota states it may be plausible then to recover the ecological health of habitat a in two ways by increasing nitrospirales and myxococcales abundance or decreasing the negative effect of clostridiales on other two taxa or by improving environmental quality through decreasing the concentrations of nh 4 n and no 3 n consequently the results obtained here reflect the effectiveness of the theory of alternative stable states in guiding ecological restoration and provide new insight into river ecological restoration by taking key feedback and interspecies interactions into consideration 4 conclusions in summary this study provided the first formal field proof for the existence of alternative microbiota states in river benthic environments and environmental stress mainly nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations is believed to be an important driver of change diversity composition and taxonomic characterization of microbial communities differed notably between the two alternative microbiota states notably the degraded microbiota state will shift to the alternative healthier stable state accompanied by a strong increase in biodiversity as well as co occurrence pattern if environmental quality is favorable the study into interspecies interactions revealed several ecologically key taxa including clostridiales nitrospirales and myxococcales that play a critical role in maintaining the stability of microbiota state a given that our sampling area covered the nanjing reach of the yangtze river and the sampling points used were sufficient to detect bistability this study provides a new insight into effective river remediation that focuses not only on the improvement of environmental quality but also on the management of biological elements in addition planktonic communities also contribute significantly to river ecosystem service and function therefore further effort should be taken to explore whether there are alternative microbiota states in river planktonic communities in order to better understand the responses of microbial communities to environmental stress and better implement effective river restoration measures declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
