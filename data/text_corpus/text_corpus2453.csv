12265,a water and soil quality baseline study was carried out across the 4500 km2 vientiane plain in lao pdr eight water quality and nine soil parameters were analysed using field kits at 95 sites in march 2015 elevated electrical conductivity and chloride were apparent at two sites due to geogenic leaching from the marine rock salt present in some areas groundwater was acidic in most locations nitrate and faecal contamination were also observed from nitrogenous fertilizers diffuse and from leaky sewage pits localised respectively soil quality is neither nutrient deficient nor does it pose a threat to plant growth where groundwater is used for drinking removal of bacterial contamination by simple filtration or boiling is sufficient in the absence of a functional monitoring network in the vientiane plain periodic surveys of this kind should be performed the results should be made widely available to the relevant government departments and other stakeholders for better management of the land and water resources graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater total dissolved solids chloride faecal contamination nitrate laos 1 introduction groundwater is generally a safe and reliable source of drinking water in many developing nations particularly in rural areas the maintenance and protection of groundwater quality are thus given high importance and also studied widely the lao people s democratic republic lao pdr or simply laos is a small southeast asian country of almost 7 million people with high per capita water resources 53 747 m3 capita yr fao 2016 lao watersheds contribute to 35 of the mekong river flow unep 2001 this has led to a significant number of hydropower project developments along with hydropower agriculture and mining form the three major economic sectors driving the country despite the abundant water resource availability drinking water supply through piped connections is available only to 86 of the urban and 69 of the rural areas who unicef 2015 rural areas thus depend on groundwater as an important water resource though groundwater is less susceptible to pollution than surface water the local geology lack of proper sanitation and other factors can affect the water quality most studies on water quality in laos are restricted to reports on environmental projects implemented and status reports jica 1993 unep 2001 adb 2010 in recent times few detailed studies on groundwater quality have focused on heavy metals chanpiwat et al 2011 2014 and on distinguishing salt affected groundwater from freshwater aquifers using geophysical methods olowokudejo 2007 perttu et al 2011a 2011b bacterial contamination of streams in northern laos ribolzi et al 2011 has raised concerns over the possibility of similar contamination in groundwater major processes controlling the groundwater quality at a village level and potential threat to human health was also studied brindha et al 2017 quality of bottled water derived from groundwater supplied in vientiane capital was reported by xayyavong and babel 2010 a key disadvantage in understanding water quality issues in this region is that many studies have not been documented several reports and manuscripts are in the lao language and inaccessible by scientists around the world also a systematic monitoring of the water quality at regular intervals is not carried out world bank 2007 this status in knowledge sharing data availability and interpretation has created a gap in general awareness and scientific advancement in laos establishment of a regular monitoring program is not just restricted to the lack of awareness but also due to lack of analytical facilities ribolzi et al 2011 cost and time bound constraints etc recognising the importance of water quality standards for drinking water groundwater surface water and soil quality have been developed by the water resources and environment administration laos wrea 2009 this study was carried out in one of the most productive agricultural areas of laos the vientiane plain background information was not sufficient to choose the priority pollutants except for arsenic chanpiwat et al 2011 2014 and total dissolved solids tds perttu et al 2011a 2011b soil quality was also included in this study as it can influence the water quality through the infiltration of pollutants from the soil zone keeping these factors in mind this study was carried out as a baseline survey of the water and soil quality conditions in the vientiane plain to know the present status and add on to the current knowledge on these environmental components in the region this study is also designed to demonstrate the use of field kits as a cost effective method to determine the presence of pollutants and the suitability of groundwater and soil for drinking and irrigation purposes respectively 2 materials and methods water and soil samples were collected from 95 locations fig 1 in march 2015 from the vientiane plain table 1 care was taken to make sure that the samples were well distributed and covered as much of the area as possible only the western part which is a protected zone with restricted entry was excluded sampling wells were chosen so that they were accessible by road for future investigations both open and bore wells were sampled and only those that were regularly used were selected water level was measured with a water level recorder and elevation from which the measurement was made was noted using a global positioning system gps bore wells equipped with pumps were pumped for about 10 min until the electrical conductivity ec is stabilized and the samples were collected in open wells samples were collected using a depth sampler ec tds and ph were measured in the field using digital portable meters eutech pcstestr 35 which was calibrated beforehand soil samples were collected close to the well locations 5 m using a soil corer the surficial topsoil layer typically 1 cm thick was removed and samples were collected over a depth interval of 2 15 cm soil samples were mixed thoroughly before the analysis samples were analysed in vientiane capital using water and soil field kits procured from transchem agritech limited india http www transchem in water samples were analysed for hardness chloride arsenic nitrate iron fluoride and faecal coliforms soil samples were analysed for ph organic carbon calcium magnesium potassium phosphorous sulphur nitrate nitrogen and ammoniacal nitrogen few samples were analysed in duplicates to ensure consistent results similar field tests have been adopted for the identification of tube wells contaminated with arsenic in order to avoid the water for domestic use van geen et al 2005 jakariya et al 2007 such kits have also been suggested by health organisations for determining the water suitability to avoid water borne diseases who 2006 laos has proposed maximum allowable limits based on those of developed countries for key physicochemical parameters but does not cover a wide range of potential pollutants wrea 2009 for parameters where guidelines have not been proposed by wrea the world health organisation who and the united states environmental protection agency us epa guidelines are used in this study as reference for determining the suitability of water 3 study area description the vientiane plain is located in the central part of laos and includes territory within two provinces table 1 it is a major lowland plain extending over the downstream part of the larger nam ngum sub basin the mekong river forms the southern boundary of the plain western and eastern parts of the plain are surrounded by hills covered by forests ranging up to 1600 m perttu et al 2011a rainfall received ranges between 1300 and 3700 mm year world bank 2007 with an average of 1780 mm in the vientiane plain perttu et al 2011a most of the rainfall is experienced in the four month wet season i e july october while rest of the year is dry season pavelic et al 2014 average temperature ranges between 24 and 34 c during the summer months march may and winter temperature drops as low as 16 c wmo 2016 the vientiane plain is located at the northern part of the khorat plateau and it underwent marine inflow during the cretaceous period the thangon formation with high contents of salt as salt beds are found in the south east of the plain perttu et al 2011a 2011b the depths of open wells ranged from 2 5 to 12 5 m and bore wells were 30 m hills on the northern and western parts of the plain had groundwater levels of up to 9 m bgl post monsoon which is the deepest recorded in the area fig 2 and was in line with the study by jica 1993 shallow water levels were recorded in the central and southern parts less is known about the groundwater flow systems in the plain groundwater potential is poor in the sandstones of the hilly areas and water is present only in the fractures but the central part of the plain is filled with alluvium and has good potential viossanges et al 2018 hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined aquifers in the northwest part of the vientiane plain varies from10 6 to 10 5 m s jica 1993 rainfall is the major factor that influences inter annual groundwater level fluctuations landuse include irrigation lands built up areas forests and water bodies 4 results and discussion 4 1 water quality most of the groundwater was acidic and only a few samples were slightly alkaline fig 3 maximum permissible ph range in drinking water is 6 5 9 2 wrea 2009 and only 15 of the villages were within this range acidic water ph below 6 5 is corrosive causing leaching of metals from piped water supply and is disagreeable in taste though health issues due to direct consumption of acidic water is not reported as the human body is capable of adjusting the acidic nature of drinking water it increases chances of heavy metal contaminant exposure that leads to other diseases who 2007 acidic ph was also reported earlier from tube wells in vientiane province brindha et al 2017 chanpiwat et al 2011 all the samples except two had ec within the suitable level of 1000 µs cm wrea 2009 fig 3 high ec values of 2590 and 520 000 µs cm was recorded in the south donekoy village sisattanak sub province and central part bone village thoulakhom sub province of the plain refer to fig 1 for sub province boundary and fig 3 for sample locations saline groundwater below fresh water layer due to the salt bearing thangon formation was reported by perttu et al 2011b the bone village sample from the thangon formation is also located near a salt factory which has been in operation for more than 50 years geological leaching of salts from the thangon formation located at shallow depth in some areas has led to high salinity and undesirable taste similar problem due to pumping from deep wells in the thangon formation with chloride concentrations above 6000 mg l was reported by perttu et al 2011b the sample from donekoy village was from an open well used for household irrigation and does not fall under the thangon formation more detailed analysis is needed to confirm the exact source in this location others have reported ec up to 47 µs cm in vientiane province olowokudejo 2007 and maximum of 10 070 µs cm were reported in deep wells up to 60 m of xaythani district indicating the source from thangon formation takenaka et al 2012 such variation with ec was not observed in this study but ph was more neutral in deeper tube wells than shallow open wells groundwater largely belongs to fresh water type with tds below 1000 mg l except for donekoy and bone villages water was brackish 1000 10 000 mg l and unsuitable for drinking but can be used for irrigation in donekoy while it was brine 100 000 and unfit for drinking and irrigation in bone village freeze and cherry 1979 hardness of water is mainly due to its calcium and magnesium content most of the villages 79 had soft water 75 mg l and 14 had moderate hardness 75 150 mg l sawyer and mccarty 1978 hard water was found in 6 of the villages with hardness ranging from 150 to 300 mg l bone village with the salinity issue was the only sample to have hardness of above 300 mg l it is possible that the hardness is well above 300 mg l but due to the limitation of the field kit exact levels could not be determined the permissible limit for chloride is 300 mg l wrea 2009 and except for donekoy and bone villages all other villages had chloride values within the limit salts from the thangon formation is the source for chloride in bone village it is uncertain for the source of high chloride levels in donekoy it could be by the geology or fertilizers or in combination with other sources other studies have reported chloride up to 47 2 mg l in the vientiane province olowokudejo 2007 permissible limits for arsenic in drinking water is 0 05 mg l and all groundwater samples were within limits except for one sample fig 3 iron was within maximum desirable limits of 1 mg l for drinking arsenic occurs in high concentration in sulphide minerals that also contain iron pyrite hence arsenic and iron can occur as co contaminants at many places rowland et al 2008 chanpiwat et al 2011 such as across large tracts of bangladesh however this is not the case in laos and high arsenic levels did not coincide with the iron contents in groundwater at many places iron levels were below detection limits also a strong spatial relation between iron and ph with arsenic was not found fig 3 iron rich copper deposits are found in the north west but bedrock containing arsenic does not occur in this area laterite in sandstones that are rich in iron but not arsenic can be their source in groundwater chanpiwat et al 2011 also reported arsenic and iron below guideline levels and acidic groundwater in vientiane province acidic ph and reducing groundwater conditions in alluvial and deltaic areas of south and southeast asia are known to release arsenic from the sediments along the mekong river in southern laos cambodia and vietnam fredericks 2004 rosenboom 2004 chanpiwat et al 2011 however correlation of arsenic with ph iron and well depth did not show such trends in the study area few villages located along the mekong river had low arsenic and the samples that exceed the limit are located within 2 km of the river other sources for arsenic include arsenical pesticides and phosphate fertilizers chowdhury and rahman 2008 the role of these pesticides as possible sources cannot be confirmed without further study permissible levels for fluoride range from 0 5 to 1 5 mg l who 1993 fluoride above 1 5 mg l causes dental fluorosis except for one sample fluoride was below 0 5 mg l in groundwater except for two samples the nitrate in groundwater was below the permissible limit of 45 mg l wrea 2009 but these high nitrate locations do not correlate with the locations of high ec fig 3 local agricultural practices can be the source for nitrates in groundwater as two samples exceeding limits had shallow water levels takenaka et al 2012 have reported nitrate up to 30 mg l due to agricultural sources in xaythani district contamination due to faecal coliforms was noticed in seven locations fengthong et al 2002 reported that 60 of the households that depend on open wells as water source suffer from diarrhea and related water borne diseases groundwater is less susceptible to microbial pollution than surface water as the soil zone acts as a natural filter and the main source for coliforms in groundwater is from sewage contamination wastewater disposal networks though present in urban parts these practices are lacking in rural areas as the villages with contamination are spread across the plain local pollution i e leaching of sewage from septic tanks and mixing with shallow groundwater could be the likely source surface storage of manure from livestock and application of these for farming practices also results in microbial contamination of groundwater in the absence of no significant spatial pattern between the measured parameters in groundwater it is considered that local conditions largely control the occurrence of these ions 4 2 soil quality soil ph affects the nutrient availability to plants and thus determines the type of crops that can be grown in the vientiane plain soil ph varied from 5 to 7 5 with only three areas having neutral ph and two areas having basic soil fig 4 majority of the villages had acidic soil similar to the ph of groundwater optimum ph range of soil is from 5 5 to 8 but some crops survive beyond this range too considered as secondary nutrients calcium to magnesium ratios differ depending on soil type in plants they are essential for protein and chlorophyll synthesis respectively though calcium deficiency is rarely reported inadequate magnesium can cause loss of plant colour with soil ph increase the calcium and magnesium availability to crops also increases contrary to this notion higher calcium and magnesium levels were found in acidic soils fig 4 high soil magnesium recorded in two cases had medium calcium levels spatial variation shows that low to high contents are distributed throughout the plain and does not pose an issue comparing with the ec and hardness in groundwater bone village having the highest ec and hardness had high calcium in soil but magnesium was low sulphate was very high in the study area except for two locations 20 30 kg acre mostly sulphur comes from organic matter and the next possible source is fertilizer sulphur plays an active role in plant protein synthesis and excessive application through fertilisers will decrease the soil ph thus presence of acidic soil in the region explains the high soil sulphur content common fertilizers with sulphur are gypsum calcium sulphate dihydrate and ammonium sulphate comparison with calcium and ammoniacal nitrogen in soil showed that high sulphur in soil was associated with low ammonium and also with different range of calcium fig 4 this insignificant spatial variation among these ions indicates that the source of sulphate can be natural organic carbon in soil determines the overall health based on physical properties major source of this is decomposition of organic matter similar to the source for sulphur however this is not reflected from the spatial variation fig 4 where most of the area had low organic carbon which is contrary to that of sulphur this also indicates that high sulphate may not only have arisen due to the organic matter but also due to soil rich in sulphate potassium is considered as a primary macro nutrient essential for plant growth it is adequately present in soil except in seven samples high potassium 120 180 kg acre is present mostly in the northern and north western parts of the study area phosphates could be analysed only in 65 samples of which nearly half the samples had low contents 7 kg acre nitrogen is a vital nutrient in almost all reactions in plants and is largely applied as fertilizers while nitrate nitrogen varied from very low to up to 20 kg acre ammoniacal nitrogen is below 5 kg acre throughout the plain it is noticed that most areas having above 14 kg acre of phosphate have potassium above 120 kg acre fig 3 but this could not be associated vice versa nor such relationship was observed by these ions with nitrate nitrogen this depends on the composition of fertilizers used and assimilation by plants samples with nitrate in groundwater above 45 mg l two locations in fig 3 had high nitrate in soil too 15 20 kg acre this wasn t the case in areas where soils had high nitrate i e not all areas with high soil nitrate showed high nitrate in groundwater four soil samples with high nitrate in soil also had nitrate at levels below detection in groundwater ammoniacal nitrogen in soil did not compare with the bacterial presence from sewage contamination in groundwater as the measured soil contents are for top soil and nitrogen fixation by microbes can be the major source for ammoniacal nitrogen in soil also negative correlation of ammonium with sulphate rules out the possibility of their presence from common fertilizer source such as ammonium sulphate and further supports that ammonium in soil is due to nitrogen fixation process similar to the comparison of faecal coliforms with nitrate in groundwater they do not correlate with soil nitrate indicating that localised practices in an area is responsible for the presence of these parameters overall soil quality does not pose a threat to plant growth in the plain nor is the soil deficient in nutrients 5 conclusions and recommendations high ec and chloride were recorded at two locations most likely due to geogenic sources of salt arsenic iron and fluoride were within drinking water limits while nitrate and faecal contamination due to fertilizers and sewage systems respectively were observed groundwater was largely acidic and prolonged use of this water for irrigation may impact the soil quality the soil was also acidic but had adequate macro nutrients based on this study it is proposed that the minimum suite of parameters to be regularly monitored in groundwater across the vientiane plain include ph ec faecal coliforms and nitrate detailed analysis of groundwater from the bone village is required to understand the extent and seriousness of the condition soil ph should also be monitored regularly to avoid further acidification though field kits come with a range of limitations such as the accuracy level detection range and detection limit it can still be used as a screening tool such as in the present study where other monitoring data is unavailable the relatively good quality of the groundwater indicates that advanced methods are not needed for treating groundwater before drinking and bacterial contamination can be managed by simple filters or by boiling the water before use responsible ministries ministry of health ministry of public works and transport ministry of natural resources and environment for monitoring the country s water quality can use the water quality field kits for health based assessment of drinking water quality and proceed for detailed testing when a potential pollutant is noticed beyond baseline levels department of irrigation can adopt this inexpensive method for rapid assessment of soil salinity and to advice farmers on the type of crops to grow district and provincial offices in relevant agencies should be provided with similar kits to test and obtain immediate results a database needs to be developed to ensure that the monitored data is continuously recorded for future reference it is noticed that all ions are present in much low concentrations than the standard desirable limits for drinking water the presence of a certain amount of these ions in drinking water is essential for the human body previously it was reported that the bottled water sample also has low concentration of most ions this implies that the amount of nutrients normally required by the human body is usually not met from drinking source including groundwater used for drinking and hence this has to be supplemented with diet nutrient deficiency can lead to several ailments and in extreme cases malnourishment especially in children but this is another area of research that needs a thorough analysis of the amount and quality of food intake health conditions etc and is beyond the scope of the present study the government can ensure that the bottled water is not just free of pollutants but also meet the necessary requirement of nutrients for human health as per the drinking water quality in covered container guidelines of wrea this study showcases the use of inexpensive techniques for water and soil quality assessment over large areas which can be adopted by government departments in developing

well depth did not show such trends in the study area few villages located along the mekong river had low arsenic and the samples that exceed the limit are located within 2 km of the river other sources for arsenic include arsenical pesticides and phosphate fertilizers chowdhury and rahman 2008 the role of these pesticides as possible sources cannot be confirmed without further study permissible levels for fluoride range from 0 5 to 1 5 mg l who 1993 fluoride above 1 5 mg l causes dental fluorosis except for one sample fluoride was below 0 5 mg l in groundwater except for two samples the nitrate in groundwater was below the permissible limit of 45 mg l wrea 2009 but these high nitrate locations do not correlate with the locations of high ec fig 3 local agricultural practices can be the source for nitrates in groundwater as two samples exceeding limits had shallow water levels takenaka et al 2012 have reported nitrate up to 30 mg l due to agricultural sources in xaythani district contamination due to faecal coliforms was noticed in seven locations fengthong et al 2002 reported that 60 of the households that depend on open wells as water source suffer from diarrhea and related water borne diseases groundwater is less susceptible to microbial pollution than surface water as the soil zone acts as a natural filter and the main source for coliforms in groundwater is from sewage contamination wastewater disposal networks though present in urban parts these practices are lacking in rural areas as the villages with contamination are spread across the plain local pollution i e leaching of sewage from septic tanks and mixing with shallow groundwater could be the likely source surface storage of manure from livestock and application of these for farming practices also results in microbial contamination of groundwater in the absence of no significant spatial pattern between the measured parameters in groundwater it is considered that local conditions largely control the occurrence of these ions 4 2 soil quality soil ph affects the nutrient availability to plants and thus determines the type of crops that can be grown in the vientiane plain soil ph varied from 5 to 7 5 with only three areas having neutral ph and two areas having basic soil fig 4 majority of the villages had acidic soil similar to the ph of groundwater optimum ph range of soil is from 5 5 to 8 but some crops survive beyond this range too considered as secondary nutrients calcium to magnesium ratios differ depending on soil type in plants they are essential for protein and chlorophyll synthesis respectively though calcium deficiency is rarely reported inadequate magnesium can cause loss of plant colour with soil ph increase the calcium and magnesium availability to crops also increases contrary to this notion higher calcium and magnesium levels were found in acidic soils fig 4 high soil magnesium recorded in two cases had medium calcium levels spatial variation shows that low to high contents are distributed throughout the plain and does not pose an issue comparing with the ec and hardness in groundwater bone village having the highest ec and hardness had high calcium in soil but magnesium was low sulphate was very high in the study area except for two locations 20 30 kg acre mostly sulphur comes from organic matter and the next possible source is fertilizer sulphur plays an active role in plant protein synthesis and excessive application through fertilisers will decrease the soil ph thus presence of acidic soil in the region explains the high soil sulphur content common fertilizers with sulphur are gypsum calcium sulphate dihydrate and ammonium sulphate comparison with calcium and ammoniacal nitrogen in soil showed that high sulphur in soil was associated with low ammonium and also with different range of calcium fig 4 this insignificant spatial variation among these ions indicates that the source of sulphate can be natural organic carbon in soil determines the overall health based on physical properties major source of this is decomposition of organic matter similar to the source for sulphur however this is not reflected from the spatial variation fig 4 where most of the area had low organic carbon which is contrary to that of sulphur this also indicates that high sulphate may not only have arisen due to the organic matter but also due to soil rich in sulphate potassium is considered as a primary macro nutrient essential for plant growth it is adequately present in soil except in seven samples high potassium 120 180 kg acre is present mostly in the northern and north western parts of the study area phosphates could be analysed only in 65 samples of which nearly half the samples had low contents 7 kg acre nitrogen is a vital nutrient in almost all reactions in plants and is largely applied as fertilizers while nitrate nitrogen varied from very low to up to 20 kg acre ammoniacal nitrogen is below 5 kg acre throughout the plain it is noticed that most areas having above 14 kg acre of phosphate have potassium above 120 kg acre fig 3 but this could not be associated vice versa nor such relationship was observed by these ions with nitrate nitrogen this depends on the composition of fertilizers used and assimilation by plants samples with nitrate in groundwater above 45 mg l two locations in fig 3 had high nitrate in soil too 15 20 kg acre this wasn t the case in areas where soils had high nitrate i e not all areas with high soil nitrate showed high nitrate in groundwater four soil samples with high nitrate in soil also had nitrate at levels below detection in groundwater ammoniacal nitrogen in soil did not compare with the bacterial presence from sewage contamination in groundwater as the measured soil contents are for top soil and nitrogen fixation by microbes can be the major source for ammoniacal nitrogen in soil also negative correlation of ammonium with sulphate rules out the possibility of their presence from common fertilizer source such as ammonium sulphate and further supports that ammonium in soil is due to nitrogen fixation process similar to the comparison of faecal coliforms with nitrate in groundwater they do not correlate with soil nitrate indicating that localised practices in an area is responsible for the presence of these parameters overall soil quality does not pose a threat to plant growth in the plain nor is the soil deficient in nutrients 5 conclusions and recommendations high ec and chloride were recorded at two locations most likely due to geogenic sources of salt arsenic iron and fluoride were within drinking water limits while nitrate and faecal contamination due to fertilizers and sewage systems respectively were observed groundwater was largely acidic and prolonged use of this water for irrigation may impact the soil quality the soil was also acidic but had adequate macro nutrients based on this study it is proposed that the minimum suite of parameters to be regularly monitored in groundwater across the vientiane plain include ph ec faecal coliforms and nitrate detailed analysis of groundwater from the bone village is required to understand the extent and seriousness of the condition soil ph should also be monitored regularly to avoid further acidification though field kits come with a range of limitations such as the accuracy level detection range and detection limit it can still be used as a screening tool such as in the present study where other monitoring data is unavailable the relatively good quality of the groundwater indicates that advanced methods are not needed for treating groundwater before drinking and bacterial contamination can be managed by simple filters or by boiling the water before use responsible ministries ministry of health ministry of public works and transport ministry of natural resources and environment for monitoring the country s water quality can use the water quality field kits for health based assessment of drinking water quality and proceed for detailed testing when a potential pollutant is noticed beyond baseline levels department of irrigation can adopt this inexpensive method for rapid assessment of soil salinity and to advice farmers on the type of crops to grow district and provincial offices in relevant agencies should be provided with similar kits to test and obtain immediate results a database needs to be developed to ensure that the monitored data is continuously recorded for future reference it is noticed that all ions are present in much low concentrations than the standard desirable limits for drinking water the presence of a certain amount of these ions in drinking water is essential for the human body previously it was reported that the bottled water sample also has low concentration of most ions this implies that the amount of nutrients normally required by the human body is usually not met from drinking source including groundwater used for drinking and hence this has to be supplemented with diet nutrient deficiency can lead to several ailments and in extreme cases malnourishment especially in children but this is another area of research that needs a thorough analysis of the amount and quality of food intake health conditions etc and is beyond the scope of the present study the government can ensure that the bottled water is not just free of pollutants but also meet the necessary requirement of nutrients for human health as per the drinking water quality in covered

12266,groundwater recharge and flow conditions were assessed in the upper crocodile river basin johannesburg south africa this study revealed high elevation recharge from rainfall that is depleted in stable isotopes of water molecule δ18o and δ2h occurring prior to extreme evaporation the effective recharge occurs from rainfall of varying moisture source and humidity conditions the δ13c value in groundwater indicates both open and closed system carbon evolution open system was observed in shale andesite and granitic gneiss aquifers indicating that soil co2 is a dominant source of carbon in bicarbonate enriched δ13c observed in malmani dolomite aquifers deduced the presence of carbonate dissolution which indicates a closed system carbon evolution mixing of water from open and closed systems or evolution from closed to open system is also observed in groundwater samples that had intermediate δ13c values particularly groundwater samples that are positioned at the periphery of the basement complex granitic gneiss near the malmani dolomite aquifers the integrated mean annual recharge estimates obtained from bfs for the ucrb is 6 7 while the distributed point recharge estimates in the malmani dolomite obtained from application of wtf on 43 individual boreholes ranged between 2 5 and 39 with an average of 15 as a percentage of map a comparison between estimated recharge and groundwater abstractions conducted for each sub catchment revealed that there is an excess of groundwater recharge over groundwater use in most sub catchments the cmb point recharge estimates obtained from the albert farm spring and the malmani dolomite springs are 2 5 and 27 8 of map respectively the low cmb recharge estimates in the shale and quartzite has been attributed to possible anthropogenic chloride sources such as leakage of chlorinated potable water in the pipelines of the city of johannesburg which elevate chloride concentrations in groundwater graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater recharge stable isotopes of 18o 2h and 13c open carbon evolution closed carbon evolution johannesburg 1 introduction in a region dominated by the semi arid arid climate groundwater is usually the driving force behind economic development and the main source of water supply as the local surface water bodies are usually ephemeral scanlon et al 2006 manghi et al 2009 healy 2010 rivard et al 2014 abiye 2016 the progressively changing climate setting characterised by low rainfall and high temperatures leads to reduced terrestrial moisture engelbrecht et al 2015 assaf 2017 this condition has invoked more groundwater dependence in south africa which already has 60 90 groundwater dependence braune and xu 2008 the city of johannesburg which is the economic hub of south africa is supported by inter basin surface water supply due to its water scarce nature department of water affairs and forestry s a 2008 however groundwater also plays a role in the socioeconomic development of the johannesburg area which is characterised as a semiarid climate abiye et al 2018 the highly intensive farming industrial and rural domestic activities in the area tend to rely more on groundwater abstractions from aquifers made of weathered and fractured crystalline rocks basement granites and meta sedimentary rocks of low productivity and the high yielding karstified meta dolomites barnard 2000 for groundwater to remain available as a sustainable source of water for economic development there has to be a significant recharge to groundwater maliva and missimer 2012 in an event that the utilization of groundwater exceeds the recharge amount the available groundwater resources may be depleted and therefore fail to act as a source of water this means that during assessment of groundwater recharge in an aquifer that contributes to socioeconomic development a balance must be established between the estimated groundwater recharge and groundwater usage in the aquifer in order to establish the sustainability of the water source there are however several factors that contribute to recharge process and subsequent flow of groundwater to a designated aquifer from which abstraction is done therefore equally important to the estimation of groundwater recharge in an area is the attempt to further understand the recharge mechanism groundwater fate and flow dynamics it has been reported that streams in the west rand region and shallow groundwater in the malmani dolomite aquifer have been polluted by acid mine drainage from the abandoned gold mines department of water affairs and forestry s a 2008 abiye et al 2015 also the surface water courses that drain the city of johannesburg are reported to be polluted due to constant discharge of partly treated waste water from the city since surface water resources are sources of focused recharge scanlon et al 2002 polluted surface water resources may also be affecting groundwater quality so over and above the mere assessment of recharge estimates it is important to understand where recharge occurs how does it occur and what are the dynamics and conditions that govern its flow path from the recharge area to the designated aquifer this therefore calls for a need to assess recharge and groundwater flow dynamics in the johannesburg area which is located in the upper crocodile river basin ucrb south africa due to their conservative nature stable isotopes of water molecules δ18o δ2h are suitable for understanding the recharge processes and predominant sources clark and fritz 1997 moreover stable isotopes have been confirmed useful in the assessment of water resources in south ern africa as documented in abiye 2013a specifically abiye 2013b successfully assessed the groundwater and surface water interaction dynamics in the upper crocodile river basin using stable isotopes stable isotopes of water molecule have also been successfully used in various other studies to assess groundwater recharge nkotagu 1996 abiye 2011 abiye et al 2011 ayadi et al 2018 the stable carbon isotopes δ13c are also suitable for assessing groundwater flow path because various carbon sources i e biomass soil carbon dioxide and carbonate rocks have distinct δ13c signatures clark and fritz 1997 marfia et al 2004 appelo and postma 2005 the δ13c in groundwater therefore resembles the δ13c signature of the dissolved carbon source and fractionations among the carbonate species in the solution appelo and postma 2005 this makes the use of δ13c in groundwater suitable for tracing groundwater flow path despite the complex recharge processes and groundwater flow patterns it has also been applied in various studies for the similar purpose of groundwater flow conditions marfia et al 2004 applications of the conventional chloride mass balance cmb groundwater and surface water hydrograph methods for groundwater recharge estimations have also been proven useful in southern africa xu and beekman 2003 in this study groundwater recharge and flow dynamics are assessed in the upper crocodile river basin which is mainly underlain by the crystalline aquifers of the basement complex meta sedimentary aquifers of the witwatersrand supergroup and the karst aquifers of the malmani dolomite chloride mass balance method water table fluctuation and baseflow separation methods are applied to estimate recharge while the environmental tracer methods are applied to understand the recharge process and the fate of groundwater in the ucrb aquifers 2 description of study area the ucrb has a surface area of 4107 km2 and extends with a northward general slope to hartbeespoort dam at about 85 km from the city of johannesburg which is located at the southern end of the catchment fig 1 it is characterised by a semiarid climate with highly variable rainfall with a mean annual precipitation map of about 700 mm year abiye 2011 the available surface water resources in the catchment are mainly polluted due to disposal of partly treated waste water and industrial discharge into the surface water system which renders surface water unsuitable for most uses this is mostly observed in hartbeespoort dam which is a depository of all return flows from johannesburg fig 1 dower 2003 department of water affairs and forestry s a 2008 the ucrb catchment is made up of eight sub catchments a21a to a21h that are identified as water management areas in south africa fig 1 the geology of the upper crocodile river basin is predominantly defined by the three major stratigraphic units which are the basement complex the witwatersrand supergroup and the transvaal supergroup rocks with a younging direction towards the north barnard 2000 johnson et al 2006 basement complex is represented predominantly by the weathered and fractured archaean halfway house granitic bodies of similar age that differ slightly in their composition granitic granodioritic gneissose or migmatitic barnard 2000 the basement complex is overlain by the witwatersrand supergroup which is represented by the government hospital hill and central rand which are mainly made of quartzite and shale forming the southern boundary of the ucrb fig 1 the quartzite is vividly highly weathered and fractured having low yielding springs such as the albert farm spring fig 1 emerging at the base of government quartzites and acting as sources of small streams in the catchment the northern part of the study area is covered by the transvaal supergroup that includes the black reef and malmani formations of the chuniespoort group which are represented by quartzite and dolomites overlying the chuniespoort group is the pretoria group which is represented by the following formations shown in fig 1 timeball hill hekpoort strubenkop daspoort silverton and magaliesberg formations these formations are made of shale alternating with quartzites interbedded basaltic andesitic lava and subordinate conglomerate which have all undergone low grade metamorphism eriksson and clendenin 1990 johnson et al 2006 the ucrb is characterised by four types of aquifers which are intergranular aquifers made of unconsolidated alluvial sands and gravel fractured crystalline aquifers associated with fractures fissures and joints of the granitic gneiss and quartzites karstic aquifers in the dolomites and intergranular and fractured aquifers that consist of a combination of hydraulically connected intergranular aquifers at the top and fractured aquifers at the bottom barnard 2000 abiye 2011 abiye et al 2011 2015 the aquifers are classified as hard rock aquifers with a modest groundwater productivity whereas meta dolomites with dissolution cavities yield large quantities of groundwater witthüser and holland 2008 abiye et al 2011 the abundant fractures and cavities in the meta dolomites could act as good recharge zones which eventually generate high yielding springs that are associated with dykes and tectonic depressions abiye et al 2015 the high yields of about 30 l s and 140 l s for nash farm and nouklip springs from the malmani dolomite have been reported by hobbs 2011 the malmani dolomite outcrop cuts across the ucrb in the east west direction fig 1 and can therefore easily allow groundwater movement across the water divide into the neighbouring catchments through the dissolution cavities and tectonic lineaments abiye et al 2011 the intensively fractured quartzite outcrops of the witwatersrand supergroup that form the southern boundary of the ucrb may also provide a suitable media for vertical recharge on the catchment boundary abiye et al 2011 groundwater recharge in the johannesburg area was assessed and reported as 27 1 by abiye 2016 through baseflow separation method bfs abiye 2016 strongly expressed the need for deduction of waste water volumes from the estimated baseflow in order to come to a reliable recharge estimate 3 materials and methods the mechanisms through which recharge predominantly occurs were assessed using stable isotopes of water molecule δ18o δ2h while the subsequent groundwater flow path dynamics were further investigated using stable carbon isotopes δ13c chloride mass balance was applied at the albert farm spring and malmani dolomite springs to estimate recharge in the quartzite aquifer using water table fluctuation method groundwater recharge was estimated in the malmani dolomite aquifer across the ucrb while baseflow separation method was applied in the seven sub catchments to estimate annual baseflow as a proxy for groundwater recharge the cmb and wtf represented the point recharge estimates into the specific aquifer types while the bfs gave an integrated recharge estimate which is spatially distributed to the sub catchments healy 2010 fig 2 shows the locations of boreholes spring sampling points and surface water discharge stations where the recharge methods were applied 3 1 environmental stable isotopes δ 18o δ 2h and δ13c the johannesburg local meteoric water line jlmwl of δ 2 h 6 7δ 18 o 10 was constructed from rainfall events that were sampled for three years at two stations one at the university of the witwatersrand and another at montgomery park in johannesburg south africa fig 2 the samples were collected with a 10 ml glass bottle immediately after rainfall to avoid sample evaporation samples were also collected for environmental isotope analysis from four malmani dolomite springs and twelve privately owned boreholes across the ucrb between february and april 2017 while the albert farm spring in johannesburg was sampled for stable isotope analysis on monthly basis from june 2016 to may 2017 stable isotopes of 18o and 2h were analysed at the university of the witwatersrand south africa using the liquid water isotope analyser model 45 ep the precision for the machine is approximately 1 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o in liquid water samples of up to 1000 mg l dissolved salt concentration the analysis was done against five standards of different known isotopic signatures a plot of groundwater samples versus the jlmwl was then used to understand the source and mechanism of recharge the deuterium excess d excess in groundwater samples was computed from the jlmwl and then used to infer the moisture source and humidity properties of the recharge rainfall clark and fritz 1997 froehlich et al 2002 using a plot of δ18o versus d excess groundwater samples were collected from twelve boreholes two dolomitic springs and albert farm spring for stable carbon isotopes δ13c analysis in april 2017 albert farm spring was also sampled in january 2018 the field sampling procedure involved filling the 30 l drum with sample water followed by addition of carbonate free naoh to raise the ph to alkaline and addition of a dash of phenolphthalein as a ph indicator bacl2 was then added from which ba 2 would react with the co 3 2 in solution to precipitate barium carbonate baco3 the baco3 precipitate was then separated from the supernatant and stored in 500 ml bottles for laboratory analysis the analysis was done using a hewlett packard tricarb liquid scintillation spectrometer at ithemba laboratories in johannesburg south africa 3 2 chloride mass balance chloride samples were collected from rainfall events and albert farm spring and four malmani dolomite springs in a 10 ml glass bottle the chloride analysis was done at the university of the witwatersrand using a colorimetric method with an analyser that has a 0 5 mg l detection limit 3 3 water table fluctuation groundwater recharge was estimated from 43 boreholes that tap the malmani dolomite aquifer which are in the sub catchments a21a a21d and a21f fig 2 the data represented monthly water level time series for the period between 1993 and 1996 obtained from the national groundwater database eq 1 was then used to estimate recharge from the water level change with time and specific yield that represents the water table fluctuation method rasmussen and andreasen 1959 healy and cook 2002 the specific yield values were obtained from eslin and kriel 1968 who carried out a water balance study for the karst aquifer that was being dewatered for mining purposes in the far west rand johannesburg south africa from this study it was observed that the specific yield values decreased with increasing depth from 9 1 to 1 3 as shown on table 1 1 r δ h δ t s y where sy is specific yield and δ h is change in water level in mm and δ t is the fluctuation period a specific yield value was then used in eq 1 for each of the 43 ucrb boreholes depending on their range of water level fluctuation depth 3 4 baseflow separation baseflow separation bfs method was applied in the seven sub catchments a21a to a21g to understand the spatial variability of recharge within the ucrb the river discharge data was obtained from the department of water and sanitation dws while climate data were gathered from the south african weather services and dws the a21h sub catchment was omitted because of hartbeespoort dam controlled exit flows fig 2 which could result in erroneous estimations of baseflow stream discharge from the upstream sub catchments were also deducted so that a computation can be done using only the stream flow components runoff and baseflow generated within the specific sub catchment of interest the bfs results obtained from the sub catchments gave recharge estimates that are integrated over a larger space the less integrated estimates were also obtained from the smaller sub units of the sub catchments at the upstream of the discharge stations and waste water disposal locations as shown on fig 2 waste water discharged into the stream was subtracted from the estimated baseflow the waste water discharge data were obtained from the johannesburg water authority and dws computation of recharge was then conducted by dividing baseflow m3 yr with the area of the sub catchment m2 to obtain recharge m yr usually mm yr the annual rainfall mm yr for the corresponding years was used to compute recharge as a percentage of rainfall for the benefit of water use planning purposes in the catchment a percentage of groundwater use to recharge estimate was also determined to assess the sustainability of groundwater resource groundwater use data was obtained as licensed volumes from dws according to healy 2010 baseflow estimate is given as a proxy for recharge based on the following assumptions 1 all groundwater that recharges in the catchment ultimately discharges to a stream 2 stream flow at dry low flows constitutes groundwater discharge 3 computation of recharge with baseflow m3 yr as a fraction of catchment area m2 to yield recharge m yr is done with the assumption that the area of the aquifer that contributes to groundwater recharge is identical to the surface drainage area rutledge 1998 misrepresentation of the aquifer properties in light of the above assumptions leads to erroneous recharge estimates in this study bfs was applied using an excel based program called timeplot which is based on the single parameter digital filter method nathan and mcmahon 1990 baseflow calculation using the single parameter digital filter is done as follows 2 b k α b k 1 1 α 2 y k y k 1 where b k and b k 1 are baseflow at time steps k and k 1 respectively α is a dimensionless filter parameter y k and y k 1 are total streamflow at the time steps k and k 1 respectively eq 2 is applied on condition that b k y k the single parameter digital filter method uses a filter parameter represented in eq 2 as α to separate the high frequency flows associated with surface runoff from the low frequency flows associated with baseflow the value used for filter parameter in this study is 0 995 as confirmed suitable for south african baseflow by smakhtin and watkins 1997 abiye 2016 applied bfs in the ucrb and observed that the values obtained were over estimated due to sewage return flows discharged into the streams and therefore recommended its deduction for accurate results in this study the authors deducted waste water from the measured computed baseflow 4 results and discussions 4 1 environmental stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h table 1 presents stable isotope results for groundwater sampled from different boreholes and dolomitic springs in april 2017 the table also shows monthly stable isotope data for albert farm spring monitored over 12 months the d excess computed from the jlmwl for each sample is also shown albert farm isotope monthly time series ranges from 6 01 to 2 86 for δ 18o and from 21 6 to 12 3 for δ 2h with d excess ranging from 4 7 to 18 7 for the review period a variable isotopic signature is observed from the ucrb groundwater samples table 2 the most depleted samples are represented by the malmani dolomite springs and borehole bh16 while the most enriched sample is borehole bh19 which is underlain by the quartzite and shale of the hospital hill shale and government quartzite barnard 2000 as shown on fig 1 fig 3 shows the stable isotope plot of the groundwater samples with respect to the johannesburg local meteoric water line jlmwl pretoria local meteoric water line plmwl and the global meteoric water line gmwl the dolomitic springs and borehole bh16 are extremely depleted and positioned at the lower left portion of the plot borehole bh19 is the most enriched and positioned at the top right portion of the plot borehole bh19 is located at the elevated southern boundary of the ucrb while borehole bh16 which is at the low elevation near the hartbeespoort dam fig 1 shows a high depletion fig 3 also shows the monthly samples for albert farm spring to display the variable isotope signature over an annual cycle fig 4 shows δ18o plotted against d excess of groundwater to assess the role of moisture source and humidity conditions during condensation of precipitation the position of groundwater samples along the jlmwl fig 4 shows recharge that occurred rapidly prior to extreme evaporation the fractured nature of rocks in the ucrb fig 5 could be the one responsible for the rapid recharge from rainfall this confirms what was said by abiye et al 2011 that the intensively fractured quartzite outcrops of the witwatersrand supergroup provide a suitable condition for vertical recharge from precipitation on the catchment boundary based on the depleted nature of groundwater samples on fig 3 possibilities of focused recharge from surface water resources are not observed the monthly data for stable isotope signature of albert farm spring shows a variable behaviour that tends to maintain a regression line close to the jlmwl as shown on fig 3 since stable isotopes reveal recharge occurring prior to extreme evaporation into the aquifer that feeds the albert farm spring then the varying d excess observed in fig 5 could indicate recharge that occurred as a result of rainfall events of different moisture source and condensation conditions temperature or humidity all of which are potentially due to varying seasonal or climatic setting naturally stable isotope signatures in precipitation vary based on the moisture source condensation temperature humidity etc so the same varying signature is reflected in monthly albert farm spring samples recharge into this aquifer is deduced to occurs preferentially through the fractures followed by piston groundwater flow of different recharge events a depletion and position along the jlmwl that is observed in dolomitic springs could be a result of rapid recharge through the fractures and cavities this possibly occurs via rapid infiltration of rainfall into groundwater thereby avoiding exposure to extreme evaporation hence close isotopic similarity with rainfall the depletion shows the possibility of recharge at higher altitude from rainfall that is depleted in heavy isotopes due to altitude effect or colder climate this suggests that recharge into the malmani dolomites might be occurring elsewhere at higher altitude and flowing through the dissolution cavities to discharge at the springs this could agree well with what was stated by abiye et al 2011 that groundwater in dolomitic aquifers can easily flow across the water divides through the dissolution cavities the depleted nature could also indicate groundwater that recharged from a rainfall event with low humidity in the vapour during condensation or recharge from cold temperature rainfall or heavy rainfall on a d excess plot the dolomitic springs are positioned towards the low d excess relative to other groundwater samples this condition indicates regional circulation from relatively high humidity moisture and their relative proximity to one another indicates that they are recharge from a similar recharge episode the stable isotope time series of albert farm spring represents a single sample location but shows temporal variability which almost covers the entire range of other groundwater samples on a δ18o and δ2h plot fig 3 having established that recharge in the ucrb occurs prior to extreme evaporation recharge water was not isotopically altered during recharge then groundwater resembles the isotopic signature of effective rainfall which is also variable due to moisture source and climatic settings the different isotopic signatures observed in groundwater samples could be a reflection of different recharge episodes rather than a spatial distribution of recharge mechanisms recharge rates and groundwater flow velocities vary in different lithologies therefore even though all other groundwater samples were collected at more or less the same period february to april 2017 they most likely represented different recharge episodes of different isotopic signature this may also explain why borehole bh16 1220mamsl at the low elevation is more depleted than borehole bh19 1728mamsl at the high elevation 4 2 stable carbon isotope δ13c table 3 shows the stable carbon δ13c data for groundwater samples the table also presents the lithostratigraphy of the underlying aquifer for each borehole the δ13c values range from the most depleted borehole bh16 with 17 35 which is underlain by silverton shale and daspoort andesite of the pretoria group on the other hand the most enriched sample is the nash farm spring sp2 which is hosted in the malmani dolomite aquifer with 5 64 generally all the malmani dolomite samples are represented by enriched values i e borehole bh23 nash farm spring and nouklip spring all other lithostratigraphic units seem to show intermediate values with various magnitudes of depletion and enrichment despite the intensive agricultural activities in the ucrb the majority of land is uncultivated and consists of grasses and shrub vegetation cover this type of vegetation predominantly follows c3 photosynthesis clark and fritz 1997 kohn 2010 the dic evolution in groundwater of the ucrb is therefore assumed to be influenced by co2 from c3 vegetation which has an average δ13c value of 26 as reported by marfia et al 2004 and kohn 2010 in a fully open system the δ13c of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic in groundwater is only controlled by the hydrolysis of soil co2 marfia et al 2004 the co2 from c3 plants initiates carbon evolution with the value of approximately 26 of δ13c marfia et al 2004 appelo and postma 2005 the hydrolysis process enriches δ13cdic of infiltrating water with approximately 9 appelo and postma 2005 so that δ13c in an open system with c3 vegetation landcover would have an approximate value of 17 marfia et al 2004 in a closed system soil co2 and dissolution of carbonates equally control the δ13c in groundwater such that dissolution leads to more positive δ13c values clark and fritz 1997 this is because carbonate rocks are richer in heavy carbon isotopes with approximate values of 0 marfia et al 2004 appelo and postma 2005 the final δ13c value of groundwater in a closed system therefore depends on the δ13c value before closure of the system to soil co2 and the extent of carbonate dissolution this usually leads to a value of approximately 13 in closed system marfia et al 2004 appelo and postma 2005 however in a case that dissolution of dolomite occurs in the closed groundwater aquifer more positive values of δ13c are also observed marfia et al 2004 therefore the depleted groundwater samples such as boreholes bh16 bh24 and bh26 from the silverton shale and daspoort andesite bh25 from the granitic gneiss of the basement complex borehole bh19 and albert farm spring from the government quartzite hospital hill shale indicate open system condition deducing that the source of dic is soil co2 the malmani dolomite samples which include borehole bh23 nash farm spring and nouklip spring are the most enriched possibly due to carbonate dissolution that occurs in the aquifer under closed system conditions marfia et al 2004 the contribution of bicarbonate from dolomite induces enriched δ13c in groundwater within the malmani dolomite aquifer the deduced system agrees well with the expected behaviour of the dolomite aquifers barnard 2000 reported this about the hydrochemistry of the malmani dolomite as infiltrating rainwater containing weak carbonic acid h2co3 percolates through the dolomitic terrain along the planes of weakness such as faults fractures and joints it causes dissolution of dolomite and increases bicarbonate concentration in groundwater as shown by the following chemical reaction 3caco 3 2mgco 3 5h 2 co 3 3ca hco 3 2 2mg hco 3 2 dolomite carbonic acid calcium bicarbonate magnesium bicarbonate groundwater samples that show intermediate values of δ13c 13 25 to 11 58 such as boreholes bh22 bh28 bh29 and bh30 suggest evolution from closed system condition to open system due to carbonate dissolution or mixing of open system water and water that has undergone closed system carbonate dissolution along its flow path particularly borehole bh30 which is positioned at the periphery of the basement complex granitic gneiss near the malmani dolomite aquifers borehole bh16 and the malmani dolomite springs both showed extreme depletion in stable isotopes of water molecule δ18o and δ2h which indicated possibilities of recharge from the isotopically similar rainfall however a distinction that is observed in the stable carbon isotopes δ13c indicate the differences in groundwater flow conditions and aquifer media 4 3 chloride mass balance method table 4 below shows chloride concentrations in the albert farm spring sampled from july 2018 to march 2018 the table also shows malmani dolomite springs sampled in april 2009 by abiye et al 2011 chloride in johannesburg rainfall sampled in july and november 2017 is also presented the table also shows the computed recharge as a percentage of mean annual precipitation of 700 mm abiye 2011 for the ucrb the average recharge obtained in the albert farm is 2 5 while the malmani dolomite springs gave 27 8 the presented chloride concentrations in rainfall consist of only two rainfall events from summer and winter season which may not be representative of the long term average chloride value in johannesburg rainfall the chloride concentrations in rainfall were below the detection limit of the colorimetric instrument 0 5 mg l therefore the computed recharge estimates for the quartzite aquifer may represent the maximum recharge values 4 4 water table fluctuation groundwater levels in different boreholes fluctuated at variable magnitude and timing of response to rainfall as shown on fig 6 the water level in boreholes 036353a 36350 and 37772 showed the least fluctuations for the period with water level changes not exceeding 3 m boreholes 36008 and 36349 showed a significant fluctuation of maximum 20 m observed in borehole 36349 each of the boreholes however show that there is a response to rainfall which is a requirement for the application of water table fluctuation method healy and cook 2002 the varying nature of groundwater level response in different boreholes could suggest different recharge paths which are attributed to the makeup of the recharge area rather than the depth of water table seeing that the borehole water levels are within the same depth ranges fig 6 a to c rapid responses could be attributed to recharge occurring through preferential flow possibly via sinkholes and fractures while a more delayed increase could be attributed to a less permeable recharge area for the 43 boreholes considered for this study where wtf was applied the mean annual recharge mar ranged between 2 5 17 5 mm yr and 39 270 mm yr with the average as 15 104 mm yr for the malmani dolomite aquifer fig 6 d shows that there is a relationship between rainfall amount and recharge annual precipitation varies throughout the study period with a minimum of 413 5 mm in 1992 and a maximum of 1061 8 mm for the year 1996 the temporal and spatial variability of groundwater recharge are observed in that recharge amount increases with precipitation while it also varies spatially among the sub catchments through the review period 4 5 baseflow separation the recharge estimates obtained from baseflow separation method are shown on table 5 recharge is given as a fraction of mean annual precipitation map column 7 and annual groundwater use as a fraction of recharge volume column 10 recharge estimates as a fraction of map range from 3 32 in a21c sub catchment to 22 07 in a21g sub catchment a21g sub catchment has the smallest surface area yet it has the highest recharge estimate compared to the other sub catchments of the ucrb a21a sub catchment and a21g sub catchment are underlain predominantly by similar geology malmani dolomites as shown by fig 1 despite the vast difference in recharge estimates i e 22 07 in a21g sub catchment and 5 5 in a21a catchment table 5 also shows the average recharge estimates for the area as 6 67 which is obtained as weighted fractions of sub catchment areas to the total area a21g sub catchment with 22 baseflow hosts the high yielding dolomitic springs including the nash farm and nouklip which yield 30l s and 140l s respectively hobbs 2011 this could explain the observed high baseflow abiye et al 2011 stated that the transvaal dolomites allow movement of groundwater across the water divide through the dissolution cavities the high yielding springs in the a21g sub catchment could be a result of inter basin movement of groundwater from the south west resulting to increased baseflow in a21g sub catchment a21a sub catchment which is underlain by dolomites is positioned on the head waters of the dolomitic aquifer s eastern limb and therefore no significant contribution of inter basin groundwater movement is expected from the eastern catchments outside of the ucrb hence low baseflow in a21a catchment 5 48 compared to a21g sub catchment in the same lithology land cover is mostly impermeable in a21a sub catchment due to urban development and therefore enhances more runoff than recharge the reason for low base flow in a21a sub catchment could also be that a21a sub catchment is a recharge point which undertakes deeper circulation to discharge in the a21b sub catchment at lower elevation hence a higher baseflow of 8 5 in a21b sub catchment a21c sub catchment which hosts the city of johannesburg is covered with impermeable surfaces leading to low recharge value of 3 32 low baseflow in a21c sub catchment can also be attributed to its underlying geology which is crystalline hard granitic gneiss with low hydraulic properties a21e sub catchment which is completely underlain by hard rocks such as quartzite granitic gneiss and dunite has high recharge value of 14 9 the more site specific estimates determined from sub units that are upstream of wastewater discharge stations gave a lower estimate of 9 9 in a sub unit within a21e sub catchment this is quite lower than the initial 14 9 from the entire a21e sub catchment downstream of the sewage discharge stations similarly 7 2 was obtained in the sub unit within a21c sub catchment where the initially 3 32 was obtained apart from the fact that the sub units may be presenting recharge estimates at the sub unit level the different recharge estimates may also be a result of inaccurate values of the data on wastewater discharge leading to erroneous baseflow values in order to get estimates that are less integrated in space baseflow was assessed in smaller sub units upstream of the waste water discharge stations in a21c sub catchment and a21e sub catchment fig 2 a21c sub catchment which had an estimate of 5 5 now had 7 2 in its sub unit a21e sub catchment had 14 9 recharge while the smaller sub unit gave a recharge value of 9 9 over the same period compared to the bfs groundwater recharge value of 27 1 where abiye 2016 recommended deduction of waste water a lower value of average of 6 7 is obtained in this study where wastewater volumes are deducted groundwater use as a fraction of annual recharge ranges from 2 3 in a21g to 111 2 in a21b the estimates reveal that groundwater is underutilised in a21g while a21b is over abstracted the groundwater use volumes were however obtained from licensed groundwater abstraction volumes from the department of water and sanitation of south africa not actual abstracted volumes the data may be excluding some unlicensed groundwater abstractions and therefore pose uncertainties in the estimated values the assumptions on which bfs is applied are not all satisfied in the ucrb the assumption that the aquifer area is equal to catchment area may not apply in the a21g sub catchment the assumption that all low flows are baseflow is partially valid since the wastewater volume has been deducted from stream discharge the assumption that all recharge eventually discharges into a stream may not be valid however as an indication that the calculated baseflow only represents part of recharge the estimated values can be referred to as minimum recharge as proposed by pitman and vegter 2003 vegter 1995 compared recharge estimates from baseflow technique and other methods in various catchments in south africa and observed a 50 variance which was highest in smaller baseflow streams decreasing with increase in baseflow estimates 5 conclusions this study revealed that recharge in the ucrb predominantly occurs from rainfall prior to extreme evaporation possibly through the vertical fractures in the crystalline rocks and dissolution cavities of the malmani dolomite rocks in the karstic aquifer the stable isotope results indicated that effective recharge into the witwatersrand aquifers was derived from rainfall of different moisture source and humidity condition in the malmani dolomite aquifer recharge occurs at high elevation where the rainfall is depleted due to altitude effect prior to extreme evaporation while its lack of variation in stable isotopes and d excess suggests a similar recharge episode the δ13c value in groundwater indicates both open and closed system carbon evolution open system was observed mainly in shale and andesite of the pretoria group some groundwater samples from the granitic gneiss aquifers of the basement complex and some government quartzite and hospital shale samples indicating that soil co2 is a dominant source of carbon enriched δ13c observed in malmani dolomite aquifers deduced the predominant source of dissolved carbon as carbonate dissolution and therefore deduced that carbon evolution in malmani dolomite aquifers occurs under closed system conditions the possibilities of evolution from open to closed system conditions were also observed in groundwater samples that showed intermediate values of δ13c 13 25 to 11 58 this was also attributed to a possibility of mixing with water that has undergone closed system carbonate dissolution along its flow path particularly borehole samples that are positioned at the periphery of the basement complex granitic gneiss near the malmani dolomite aquifers the estimated mean annual recharge for the ucrb is 6 7 obtained from baseflow separation method as a percentage of map this value has been referred to as a minimum recharge amount because not all diffuse recharge in a catchment discharges to a stream network as baseflow so the estimated value only represents a portion that discharge into the stream network point recharge estimates obtained through water table fluctuation method from a distribution of boreholes in the malmani dolomite ranged between 2 5 and 39 with an average of 15 of map there are possibilities of groundwater over abstraction in the sub catchment a21a and a21b where groundwater use percentage is high these groundwater use percentages have to be properly considered in the allocations of groundwater use licenses to avoid over abstraction of groundwater a point recharge estimates obtained through cmb in the hospital hill shale and government quartzite of the witwatersrand supergroup is 2 5 while 27 8 is observed in the malmani dolomites the low cmb recharge estimates in the witwatersrand supergroup could be a result of elevated chloride values from other chloride sources such as leakage of chlorinated potable water

12266,groundwater recharge and flow conditions were assessed in the upper crocodile river basin johannesburg south africa this study revealed high elevation recharge from rainfall that is depleted in stable isotopes of water molecule δ18o and δ2h occurring prior to extreme evaporation the effective recharge occurs from rainfall of varying moisture source and humidity conditions the δ13c value in groundwater indicates both open and closed system carbon evolution open system was observed in shale andesite and granitic gneiss aquifers indicating that soil co2 is a dominant source of carbon in bicarbonate enriched δ13c observed in malmani dolomite aquifers deduced the presence of carbonate dissolution which indicates a closed system carbon evolution mixing of water from open and closed systems or evolution from closed to open system is also observed in groundwater samples that had intermediate δ13c values particularly groundwater samples that are positioned at the periphery of the basement complex granitic gneiss near the malmani dolomite aquifers the integrated mean annual recharge estimates obtained from bfs for the ucrb is 6 7 while the distributed point recharge estimates in the malmani dolomite obtained from application of wtf on 43 individual boreholes ranged between 2 5 and 39 with an average of 15 as a percentage of map a comparison between estimated recharge and groundwater abstractions conducted for each sub catchment revealed that there is an excess of groundwater recharge over groundwater use in most sub catchments the cmb point recharge estimates obtained from the albert farm spring and the malmani dolomite springs are 2 5 and 27 8 of map respectively the low cmb recharge estimates in the shale and quartzite has been attributed to possible anthropogenic chloride sources such as leakage of chlorinated potable water in the pipelines of the city of johannesburg which elevate chloride concentrations in groundwater graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater recharge stable isotopes of 18o 2h and 13c open carbon evolution closed carbon evolution johannesburg 1 introduction in a region dominated by the semi arid arid climate groundwater is usually the driving force behind economic development and the main source of water supply as the local surface water bodies are usually ephemeral scanlon et al 2006 manghi et al 2009 healy 2010 rivard et al 2014 abiye 2016 the progressively changing climate setting characterised by low rainfall and high temperatures leads to reduced terrestrial moisture engelbrecht et al 2015 assaf 2017 this condition has invoked more groundwater dependence in south africa which already has 60 90 groundwater dependence braune and xu 2008 the city of johannesburg which is the economic hub of south africa is supported by inter basin surface water supply due to its water scarce nature department of water affairs and forestry s a 2008 however groundwater also plays a role in the socioeconomic development of the johannesburg area which is characterised as a semiarid climate abiye et al 2018 the highly intensive farming industrial and rural domestic activities in the area tend to rely more on groundwater abstractions from aquifers made of weathered and fractured crystalline rocks basement granites and meta sedimentary rocks of low productivity and the high yielding karstified meta dolomites barnard 2000 for groundwater to remain available as a sustainable source of water for economic development there has to be a significant recharge to groundwater maliva and missimer 2012 in an event that the utilization of groundwater exceeds the recharge amount the available groundwater resources may be depleted and therefore fail to act as a source of water this means that during assessment of groundwater recharge in an aquifer that contributes to socioeconomic development a balance must be established between the estimated groundwater recharge and groundwater usage in the aquifer in order to establish the sustainability of the water source there are however several factors that contribute to recharge process and subsequent flow of groundwater to a designated aquifer from which abstraction is done therefore equally important to the estimation of groundwater recharge in an area is the attempt to further understand the recharge mechanism groundwater fate and flow dynamics it has been reported that streams in the west rand region and shallow groundwater in the malmani dolomite aquifer have been polluted by acid mine drainage from the abandoned gold mines department of water affairs and forestry s a 2008 abiye et al 2015 also the surface water courses that drain the city of johannesburg are reported to be polluted due to constant discharge of partly treated waste water from the city since surface water resources are sources of focused recharge scanlon et al 2002 polluted surface water resources may also be affecting groundwater quality so over and above the mere assessment of recharge estimates it is important to understand where recharge occurs how does it occur and what are the dynamics and conditions that govern its flow path from the recharge area to the designated aquifer this therefore calls for a need to assess recharge and groundwater flow dynamics in the johannesburg area which is located in the upper crocodile river basin ucrb south africa due to their conservative nature stable isotopes of water molecules δ18o δ2h are suitable for understanding the recharge processes and predominant sources clark and fritz 1997 moreover stable isotopes have been confirmed useful in the assessment of water resources in south ern africa as documented in abiye 2013a specifically abiye 2013b successfully assessed the groundwater and surface water interaction dynamics in the upper crocodile river basin using stable isotopes stable isotopes of water molecule have also been successfully used in various other studies to assess groundwater recharge nkotagu 1996 abiye 2011 abiye et al 2011 ayadi et al 2018 the stable carbon isotopes δ13c are also suitable for assessing groundwater flow path because various carbon sources i e biomass soil carbon dioxide and carbonate rocks have distinct δ13c signatures clark and fritz 1997 marfia et al 2004 appelo and postma 2005 the δ13c in groundwater therefore resembles the δ13c signature of the dissolved carbon source and fractionations among the carbonate species in the solution appelo and postma 2005 this makes the use of δ13c in groundwater suitable for tracing groundwater flow path despite the complex recharge processes and groundwater flow patterns it has also been applied in various studies for the similar purpose of groundwater flow conditions marfia et al 2004 applications of the conventional chloride mass balance cmb groundwater and surface water hydrograph methods for groundwater recharge estimations have also been proven useful in southern africa xu and beekman 2003 in this study groundwater recharge and flow dynamics are assessed in the upper crocodile river basin which is mainly underlain by the crystalline aquifers of the basement complex meta sedimentary aquifers of the witwatersrand supergroup and the karst aquifers of the malmani dolomite chloride mass balance method water table fluctuation and baseflow separation methods are applied to estimate recharge while the environmental tracer methods are applied to understand the recharge process and the fate of groundwater in the ucrb aquifers 2 description of study area the ucrb has a surface area of 4107 km2 and extends with a northward general slope to hartbeespoort dam at about 85 km from the city of johannesburg which is located at the southern end of the catchment fig 1 it is characterised by a semiarid climate with highly variable rainfall with a mean annual precipitation map of about 700 mm year abiye 2011 the available surface water resources in the catchment are mainly polluted due to disposal of partly treated waste water and industrial discharge into the surface water system which renders surface water unsuitable for most uses this is mostly observed in hartbeespoort dam which is a depository of all return flows from johannesburg fig 1 dower 2003 department of water affairs and forestry s a 2008 the ucrb catchment is made up of eight sub catchments a21a to a21h that are identified as water management areas in south africa fig 1 the geology of the upper crocodile river basin is predominantly defined by the three major stratigraphic units which are the basement complex the witwatersrand supergroup and the transvaal supergroup rocks with a younging direction towards the north barnard 2000 johnson et al 2006 basement complex is represented predominantly by the weathered and fractured archaean halfway house granitic bodies of similar age that differ slightly in their composition granitic granodioritic gneissose or migmatitic barnard 2000 the basement complex is overlain by the witwatersrand supergroup which is represented by the government hospital hill and central rand which are mainly made of quartzite and shale forming the southern boundary of the ucrb fig 1 the quartzite is vividly highly weathered and fractured having low yielding springs such as the albert farm spring fig 1 emerging at the base of government quartzites and acting as sources of small streams in the catchment the northern part of the study area is covered by the transvaal supergroup that includes the black reef and malmani formations of the chuniespoort group which are represented by quartzite and dolomites overlying the chuniespoort group is the pretoria group which is represented by the following formations shown in fig 1 timeball hill hekpoort strubenkop daspoort silverton and magaliesberg formations these formations are made of shale alternating with quartzites interbedded basaltic andesitic lava and subordinate conglomerate which have all undergone low grade metamorphism eriksson and clendenin 1990 johnson et al 2006 the ucrb is characterised by four types of aquifers which are intergranular aquifers made of unconsolidated alluvial sands and gravel fractured crystalline aquifers associated with fractures fissures and joints of the granitic gneiss and quartzites karstic aquifers in the dolomites and intergranular and fractured aquifers that consist of a combination of hydraulically connected intergranular aquifers at the top and fractured aquifers at the bottom barnard 2000 abiye 2011 abiye et al 2011 2015 the aquifers are classified as hard rock aquifers with a modest groundwater productivity whereas meta dolomites with dissolution cavities yield large quantities of groundwater witthüser and holland 2008 abiye et al 2011 the abundant fractures and cavities in the meta dolomites could act as good recharge zones which eventually generate high yielding springs that are associated with dykes and tectonic depressions abiye et al 2015 the high yields of about 30 l s and 140 l s for nash farm and nouklip springs from the malmani dolomite have been reported by hobbs 2011 the malmani dolomite outcrop cuts across the ucrb in the east west direction fig 1 and can therefore easily allow groundwater movement across the water divide into the neighbouring catchments through the dissolution cavities and tectonic lineaments abiye et al 2011 the intensively fractured quartzite outcrops of the witwatersrand supergroup that form the southern boundary of the ucrb may also provide a suitable media for vertical recharge on the catchment boundary abiye et al 2011 groundwater recharge in the johannesburg area was assessed and reported as 27 1 by abiye 2016 through baseflow separation method bfs abiye 2016 strongly expressed the need for deduction of waste water volumes from the estimated baseflow in order to come to a reliable recharge estimate 3 materials and methods the mechanisms through which recharge predominantly occurs were assessed using stable isotopes of water molecule δ18o δ2h while the subsequent groundwater flow path dynamics were further investigated using stable carbon isotopes δ13c chloride mass balance was applied at the albert farm spring and malmani dolomite springs to estimate recharge in the quartzite aquifer using water table fluctuation method groundwater recharge was estimated in the malmani dolomite aquifer across the ucrb while baseflow separation method was applied in the seven sub catchments to estimate annual baseflow as a proxy for groundwater recharge the cmb and wtf represented the point recharge estimates into the specific aquifer types while the bfs gave an integrated recharge estimate which is spatially distributed to the sub catchments healy 2010 fig 2 shows the locations of boreholes spring sampling points and surface water discharge stations where the recharge methods were applied 3 1 environmental stable isotopes δ 18o δ 2h and δ13c the johannesburg local meteoric water line jlmwl of δ 2 h 6 7δ 18 o 10 was constructed from rainfall events that were sampled for three years at two stations one at the university of the witwatersrand and another at montgomery park in johannesburg south africa fig 2 the samples were collected with a 10 ml glass bottle immediately after rainfall to avoid sample evaporation samples were also collected for environmental isotope analysis from four malmani dolomite springs and twelve privately owned boreholes across the ucrb between february and april 2017 while the albert farm spring in johannesburg was sampled for stable isotope analysis on monthly basis from june 2016 to may 2017 stable isotopes of 18o and 2h were analysed at the university of the witwatersrand south africa using the liquid water isotope analyser model 45 ep the precision for the machine is approximately 1 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o in liquid water samples of up to 1000 mg l dissolved salt concentration the analysis was done against five standards of different known isotopic signatures a plot of groundwater samples versus the jlmwl was then used to understand the source and mechanism of recharge the deuterium excess d excess in groundwater samples was computed from the jlmwl and then used to infer the moisture source and humidity properties of the recharge rainfall clark and fritz 1997 froehlich et al 2002 using a plot of δ18o versus d excess groundwater samples were collected from twelve boreholes two dolomitic springs and albert farm spring for stable carbon isotopes δ13c analysis in april 2017 albert farm spring was also sampled in january 2018 the field sampling procedure involved filling the 30 l drum with sample water followed by addition of carbonate free naoh to raise the ph to alkaline and addition of a dash of phenolphthalein as a ph indicator bacl2 was then added from which ba 2 would react with the co 3 2 in solution to precipitate barium carbonate baco3 the baco3 precipitate was then separated from the supernatant and stored in 500 ml bottles for laboratory analysis the analysis was done using a hewlett packard tricarb liquid scintillation spectrometer at ithemba laboratories in johannesburg south africa 3 2 chloride mass balance chloride samples were collected from rainfall events and albert farm spring and four malmani dolomite springs in a 10 ml glass bottle the chloride analysis was done at the university of the witwatersrand using a colorimetric method with an analyser that has a 0 5 mg l detection limit 3 3 water table fluctuation groundwater recharge was estimated from 43 boreholes that tap the malmani dolomite aquifer which are in the sub catchments a21a a21d and a21f fig 2 the data represented monthly water level time series for the period between 1993 and 1996 obtained from the national groundwater database eq 1 was then used to estimate recharge from the water level change with time and specific yield that represents the water table fluctuation method rasmussen and andreasen 1959 healy and cook 2002 the specific yield values were obtained from eslin and kriel 1968 who carried out a water balance study for the karst aquifer that was being dewatered for mining purposes in the far west rand johannesburg south africa from this study it was observed that the specific yield values decreased with increasing depth from 9 1 to 1 3 as shown on table 1 1 r δ h δ t s y where sy is specific yield and δ h is change in water level in mm and δ t is the fluctuation period a specific yield value was then used in eq 1 for each of the 43 ucrb boreholes depending on their range of water level fluctuation depth 3 4 baseflow separation baseflow separation bfs method was applied in the seven sub catchments a21a to a21g to understand the spatial variability of recharge within the ucrb the river discharge data was obtained from the department of water and sanitation dws while climate data were gathered from the south african weather services and dws the a21h sub catchment was omitted because of hartbeespoort dam controlled exit flows fig 2 which could result in erroneous estimations of baseflow stream discharge from the upstream sub catchments were also deducted so that a computation can be done using only the stream flow components runoff and baseflow generated within the specific sub catchment of interest the bfs results obtained from the sub catchments gave recharge estimates that are integrated over a larger space the less integrated estimates were also obtained from the smaller sub units of the sub catchments at the upstream of the discharge stations and waste water disposal locations as shown on fig 2 waste water discharged into the stream was subtracted from the estimated baseflow the waste water discharge data were obtained from the johannesburg water authority and dws computation of recharge was then conducted by dividing baseflow m3 yr with the area of the sub catchment m2 to obtain recharge m yr usually mm yr the annual rainfall mm yr for the corresponding years was used to compute recharge as a percentage of rainfall for the benefit of water use planning purposes in the catchment a percentage of groundwater use to recharge estimate was also determined to assess the sustainability of groundwater resource groundwater use data was obtained as licensed volumes from dws according to healy 2010 baseflow estimate is given as a proxy for recharge based on the following assumptions 1 all groundwater that recharges in the catchment ultimately discharges to a stream 2 stream flow at dry low flows constitutes groundwater discharge 3 computation of recharge with baseflow m3 yr as a fraction of catchment area m2 to yield recharge m yr is done with the assumption that the area of the aquifer that contributes to groundwater recharge is identical to the surface drainage area rutledge 1998 misrepresentation of the aquifer properties in light of the above assumptions leads to erroneous recharge estimates in this study bfs was applied using an excel based program called timeplot which is based on the single parameter digital filter method nathan and mcmahon 1990 baseflow calculation using the single parameter digital filter is done as follows 2 b k α b k 1 1 α 2 y k y k 1 where b k and b k 1 are baseflow at time steps k and k 1 respectively α is a dimensionless filter parameter y k and y k 1 are total streamflow at the time steps k and k 1 respectively eq 2 is applied on condition that b k y k the single parameter digital filter method uses a filter parameter represented in eq 2 as α to separate the high frequency flows associated with surface runoff from the low frequency flows associated with baseflow the value used for filter parameter in this study is 0 995 as confirmed suitable for south african baseflow by smakhtin and watkins 1997 abiye 2016 applied bfs in the ucrb and observed that the values obtained were over estimated due to sewage return flows discharged into the streams and therefore recommended its deduction for accurate results in this study the authors deducted waste water from the measured computed baseflow 4 results and discussions 4 1 environmental stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h table 1 presents stable isotope results for groundwater sampled from different boreholes and dolomitic springs in april 2017 the table also shows monthly stable isotope data for albert farm spring monitored over 12 months the d excess computed from the jlmwl for each sample is also shown albert farm isotope monthly time series ranges from 6 01 to 2 86 for δ 18o and from 21 6 to 12 3 for δ 2h with d excess ranging from 4 7 to 18 7 for the review period a variable isotopic signature is observed from the ucrb groundwater samples table 2 the most depleted samples are represented by the malmani dolomite springs and borehole bh16 while the most enriched sample is borehole bh19 which is underlain by the quartzite and shale of the hospital hill shale and government quartzite barnard 2000 as shown on fig 1 fig 3 shows the stable isotope plot of the groundwater samples with respect to the johannesburg local meteoric water line jlmwl pretoria local meteoric water line plmwl and the global meteoric water line gmwl the dolomitic springs and borehole bh16 are extremely depleted and positioned at the lower left portion of the plot borehole bh19 is the most enriched and positioned at the top right portion of the plot borehole bh19 is located at the elevated southern boundary of the ucrb while borehole bh16 which is at the low elevation near the hartbeespoort dam fig 1 shows a high depletion fig 3 also shows the monthly samples for albert farm spring to display the variable isotope signature over an annual cycle fig 4 shows δ18o plotted against d excess of groundwater to assess the role of moisture source and humidity conditions during condensation of precipitation the position of groundwater samples along the jlmwl fig 4 shows recharge that occurred rapidly prior to extreme evaporation the fractured nature of rocks in the ucrb fig 5 could be the one responsible for the rapid recharge from rainfall this confirms what was said by abiye et al 2011 that the intensively fractured quartzite outcrops of the witwatersrand supergroup provide a suitable condition for vertical recharge from precipitation on the catchment boundary based on the depleted nature of groundwater samples on fig 3 possibilities of focused recharge from surface water resources are not observed the monthly data for stable isotope signature of albert farm spring shows a variable behaviour that tends to maintain a regression line close to the jlmwl as shown on fig 3 since stable isotopes reveal recharge occurring prior to extreme evaporation into the aquifer that feeds the albert farm spring then the varying d excess observed in fig 5 could indicate recharge that occurred as a result of rainfall events of different moisture source and condensation conditions temperature or humidity all of which are potentially due to varying seasonal or climatic setting naturally stable isotope signatures in precipitation vary based on the moisture source condensation temperature humidity etc so the same varying signature is reflected in monthly albert farm spring samples recharge into this aquifer is deduced to occurs preferentially through the fractures followed by piston groundwater flow of different recharge events a depletion and position along the jlmwl that is observed in dolomitic springs could be a result of rapid recharge through the fractures and cavities this possibly occurs via rapid infiltration of rainfall into groundwater thereby avoiding exposure to extreme evaporation hence close isotopic similarity with rainfall the depletion shows the possibility of recharge at higher altitude from rainfall that is depleted in heavy isotopes due to altitude effect or colder climate this suggests that recharge into the malmani dolomites might be occurring elsewhere at higher altitude and flowing through the dissolution cavities to discharge at the springs this could agree well with what was stated by abiye et al 2011 that groundwater in dolomitic aquifers can easily flow across the water divides through the dissolution cavities the depleted nature could also indicate groundwater that recharged from a rainfall event with low humidity in the vapour during condensation or recharge from cold temperature rainfall or heavy rainfall on a d excess plot the dolomitic springs are positioned towards the low d excess relative to other groundwater samples this condition indicates regional circulation from relatively high humidity moisture and their relative proximity to one another indicates that they are recharge from a similar recharge episode the stable isotope time series of albert farm spring represents a single sample location but shows temporal variability which almost covers the entire range of other groundwater samples on a δ18o and δ2h plot fig 3 having established that recharge in the ucrb occurs prior to extreme evaporation recharge water was not isotopically altered during recharge then groundwater resembles the isotopic signature of effective rainfall which is also variable due to moisture source and climatic settings the different isotopic signatures observed in groundwater samples could be a reflection of different recharge episodes rather than a spatial distribution of recharge mechanisms recharge rates and groundwater flow velocities vary in different lithologies therefore even though all other groundwater samples were collected at more or less the same period february to april 2017 they most likely represented different recharge episodes of different isotopic signature this may also explain why borehole bh16 1220mamsl at the low elevation is more depleted than borehole bh19 1728mamsl at the high elevation 4 2 stable carbon isotope δ13c table 3 shows the stable carbon δ13c data for groundwater samples the table also presents the lithostratigraphy of the underlying aquifer for each borehole the δ13c values range from the most depleted borehole bh16 with 17 35 which is underlain by silverton shale and daspoort andesite of the pretoria group on the other hand the most enriched sample is the nash farm spring sp2 which is hosted in the malmani dolomite aquifer with 5 64 generally all the malmani dolomite samples are represented by enriched values i e borehole bh23 nash farm spring and nouklip spring all other lithostratigraphic units seem to show intermediate values with various magnitudes of depletion and enrichment despite the intensive agricultural activities in the ucrb the majority of land is uncultivated and consists of grasses and shrub vegetation cover this type of vegetation predominantly follows c3 photosynthesis clark and fritz 1997 kohn 2010 the dic evolution in groundwater of the ucrb is therefore assumed to be influenced by co2 from c3 vegetation which has an average δ13c value of 26 as reported by marfia et al 2004 and kohn 2010 in a fully open system the δ13c of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic in groundwater is only controlled by the hydrolysis of soil co2 marfia et al 2004 the co2 from c3 plants initiates carbon evolution with the value of approximately 26 of δ13c marfia et al 2004 appelo and postma 2005 the hydrolysis process enriches δ13cdic of infiltrating water with approximately 9 appelo and postma 2005 so that δ13c in an open system with c3 vegetation landcover would have an approximate value of 17 marfia et al 2004 in a closed system soil co2 and dissolution of carbonates equally control the δ13c in groundwater such that dissolution leads to more positive δ13c values clark and fritz 1997 this is because carbonate rocks are richer in heavy carbon isotopes with approximate values of 0 marfia et al 2004 appelo and postma 2005 the final δ13c value of groundwater in a closed system therefore depends on the δ13c value before closure of the system to soil co2 and the extent of carbonate dissolution this usually leads to a value of approximately 13 in closed system marfia et al 2004 appelo and postma 2005 however in a case that dissolution of dolomite occurs in the closed groundwater aquifer more positive values of δ13c are also observed marfia et al 2004 therefore the depleted groundwater samples such as boreholes bh16 bh24 and bh26 from the silverton shale and daspoort andesite bh25 from the granitic gneiss of the basement complex borehole bh19 and albert farm spring from the government quartzite hospital hill shale indicate open system condition deducing that the source of dic is soil co2 the malmani dolomite samples which include borehole bh23 nash farm spring and nouklip spring are the most enriched possibly due to carbonate dissolution that occurs in the aquifer under closed system conditions marfia et al 2004 the contribution of bicarbonate from dolomite induces enriched δ13c in groundwater within the malmani dolomite aquifer the deduced system agrees well with the expected behaviour of the dolomite aquifers barnard 2000 reported this about the hydrochemistry of the malmani dolomite as infiltrating rainwater containing weak carbonic acid h2co3 percolates through the dolomitic terrain along the planes of weakness such as faults fractures and joints it causes dissolution of dolomite and increases bicarbonate concentration in groundwater as shown by the following chemical reaction 3caco 3 2mgco 3 5h 2 co 3 3ca hco 3 2 2mg hco 3 2 dolomite carbonic acid calcium bicarbonate magnesium bicarbonate groundwater samples that show intermediate values of δ13c 13 25 to 11 58 such as boreholes bh22 bh28 bh29 and bh30 suggest evolution from closed system condition to open system due to carbonate dissolution or mixing of open system water and water that has undergone closed system carbonate dissolution along its flow path particularly borehole bh30 which is positioned at the periphery of the basement complex granitic gneiss near the malmani dolomite aquifers borehole bh16 and the malmani dolomite springs both showed extreme depletion in stable isotopes of water molecule δ18o and δ2h which indicated possibilities of recharge from the isotopically similar rainfall however a distinction that is observed in the stable carbon isotopes δ13c indicate the differences in groundwater flow conditions and aquifer media 4 3 chloride mass balance method table 4 below shows chloride concentrations in the albert farm spring sampled from july 2018 to march 2018 the table also shows malmani dolomite springs sampled in april 2009 by abiye et al 2011 chloride in johannesburg rainfall sampled in july and november 2017 is also presented the table also shows the computed recharge as a percentage of mean annual precipitation of 700 mm abiye 2011 for the ucrb the average recharge obtained in the albert farm is 2 5 while the malmani dolomite springs gave 27 8 the presented chloride concentrations in rainfall consist of only two rainfall events from summer and winter season which may not be representative of the long term average chloride value in johannesburg rainfall the chloride concentrations in rainfall were below the detection limit of the colorimetric instrument 0 5 mg l therefore the computed recharge estimates for the quartzite aquifer may represent the maximum recharge values 4 4 water table fluctuation groundwater levels in different boreholes fluctuated at variable magnitude and timing of response to rainfall as shown on fig 6 the water level in boreholes 036353a 36350 and 37772 showed the least fluctuations for the period with water level changes not exceeding 3 m boreholes 36008 and 36349 showed a significant fluctuation of maximum 20 m observed in borehole 36349 each of the boreholes however show that there is a response to rainfall which is a requirement for the application of water table fluctuation method healy and cook 2002 the varying nature of groundwater level response in different boreholes could suggest different recharge paths which are attributed to the makeup of the recharge area rather than the depth of water table seeing that the borehole water levels are within the same depth ranges fig 6 a to c rapid responses could be attributed to recharge occurring through preferential flow possibly via sinkholes and fractures while a more delayed increase could be attributed to a less permeable recharge area for the 43 boreholes considered for this study where wtf was applied the mean annual recharge mar ranged between 2 5 17 5 mm yr and 39 270 mm yr with the average as 15 104 mm yr for the malmani dolomite aquifer fig 6 d shows that there is a relationship between rainfall amount and recharge annual precipitation varies throughout the study period with a minimum of 413 5 mm in 1992 and a maximum of 1061 8 mm for the year 1996 the temporal and spatial variability of groundwater recharge are observed in that recharge amount increases with precipitation while it also varies spatially among the sub catchments through the review period 4 5 baseflow separation the recharge estimates obtained from baseflow separation method are shown on table 5 recharge is given as a fraction of mean annual precipitation map column 7 and annual groundwater use as a fraction of recharge volume column 10 recharge estimates as a fraction of map range from 3 32 in a21c sub catchment to 22 07 in a21g sub catchment a21g sub catchment has the smallest surface area yet it has the highest recharge estimate compared to the other sub catchments of the ucrb a21a sub catchment and a21g sub catchment are underlain predominantly by similar geology malmani dolomites as shown by fig 1 despite the vast difference in recharge estimates i e 22 07 in a21g sub catchment and 5 5 in a21a catchment table 5 also shows the average recharge estimates for the area as 6 67 which is obtained as weighted fractions of sub catchment areas to the total area a21g sub catchment with 22 baseflow hosts the high yielding dolomitic springs including the nash farm and nouklip which yield 30l s and 140l s respectively hobbs 2011 this could explain the observed high baseflow abiye et al 2011 stated that the transvaal dolomites allow movement of groundwater across the water divide through the dissolution cavities the high yielding springs in the a21g sub catchment could be a result of inter basin movement of groundwater from the south west resulting to increased baseflow in a21g sub catchment a21a sub catchment which is underlain by dolomites is positioned on the head waters of the dolomitic aquifer s eastern limb and therefore no significant contribution of inter basin groundwater movement is expected from the eastern catchments outside of the ucrb hence low baseflow in a21a catchment 5 48 compared to a21g sub catchment in the same lithology land cover is mostly impermeable in a21a sub catchment due to urban development and therefore enhances more runoff than recharge the reason for low base flow in a21a sub catchment could also be that a21a sub catchment is a recharge point which undertakes deeper circulation to discharge in the a21b sub catchment at lower elevation hence a higher baseflow of 8 5 in a21b sub catchment a21c sub catchment which hosts the city of johannesburg is covered with impermeable surfaces leading to low recharge value of 3 32 low baseflow in a21c sub catchment can also be attributed to its underlying geology which is crystalline hard granitic gneiss with low hydraulic properties a21e sub catchment which is completely underlain by hard rocks such as quartzite granitic gneiss and dunite has high recharge value of 14 9 the more site specific estimates determined from sub units that are upstream of wastewater discharge stations gave a lower estimate of 9 9 in a sub unit within a21e sub catchment this is quite lower than the initial 14 9 from the entire a21e sub catchment downstream of the sewage discharge stations similarly 7 2 was obtained in the sub unit within a21c sub catchment where the initially 3 32 was obtained apart from the fact that the sub units may be presenting recharge estimates at the sub unit level the different recharge estimates may also be a result of inaccurate values of the data on wastewater discharge leading to erroneous baseflow values in order to get estimates that are less integrated in space baseflow was assessed in smaller sub units upstream of the waste water discharge stations in a21c sub catchment and a21e sub catchment fig 2 a21c sub catchment which had an estimate of 5 5 now had 7 2 in its sub unit a21e sub catchment had 14 9 recharge while the smaller sub unit gave a recharge value of 9 9 over the same period compared to the bfs groundwater recharge value of 27 1 where abiye 2016 recommended deduction of waste water a lower value of average of 6 7 is obtained in this study where wastewater volumes are deducted groundwater use as a fraction of annual recharge ranges from 2 3 in a21g to 111 2 in a21b the estimates reveal that groundwater is underutilised in a21g while a21b is over abstracted the groundwater use volumes were however obtained from licensed groundwater abstraction volumes from the department of water and sanitation of south africa not actual abstracted volumes the data may be excluding some unlicensed groundwater abstractions and therefore pose uncertainties in the estimated values the assumptions on which bfs is applied are not all satisfied in the ucrb the assumption that the aquifer area is equal to catchment area may not apply in the a21g sub catchment the assumption that all low flows are baseflow is partially valid since the wastewater volume has been deducted from stream discharge the assumption that all recharge eventually discharges into a stream may not be valid however as an indication that the calculated baseflow only represents part of recharge the estimated values can be referred to as minimum recharge as proposed by pitman and vegter 2003 vegter 1995 compared recharge estimates from baseflow technique and other methods in various catchments in south africa and observed a 50 variance which was highest in smaller baseflow streams decreasing with increase in baseflow estimates 5 conclusions this study revealed that recharge in the ucrb predominantly occurs from rainfall prior to extreme evaporation possibly through the vertical fractures in the crystalline rocks and dissolution cavities of the malmani dolomite rocks in the karstic aquifer the stable isotope results indicated that effective recharge into the witwatersrand aquifers was derived from rainfall of different moisture source and humidity condition in the malmani dolomite aquifer recharge occurs at high elevation where the rainfall is depleted due to altitude effect prior to extreme evaporation while its lack of variation in stable isotopes and d excess suggests a similar recharge episode the δ13c value in groundwater indicates both open and closed system carbon evolution open system was observed mainly in shale and andesite of the pretoria group some groundwater samples from the granitic gneiss aquifers of the basement complex and some government quartzite and hospital shale samples indicating that soil co2 is a dominant source of carbon enriched δ13c observed in malmani dolomite aquifers deduced the predominant source of dissolved carbon as carbonate dissolution and therefore deduced that carbon evolution in malmani dolomite aquifers occurs under closed system conditions the possibilities of evolution from open to closed system conditions were also observed in groundwater samples that showed intermediate values of δ13c 13 25 to 11 58 this was also attributed to a possibility of mixing with water that has undergone closed system carbonate dissolution along its flow path particularly borehole samples that are positioned at the periphery of the basement complex granitic gneiss near the malmani dolomite aquifers the estimated mean annual recharge for the ucrb is 6 7 obtained from baseflow separation method as a percentage of map this value has been referred to as a minimum recharge amount because not all diffuse recharge in a catchment discharges to a stream network as baseflow so the estimated value only represents a portion that discharge into the stream network point recharge estimates obtained through water table fluctuation method from a distribution of boreholes in the malmani dolomite ranged between 2 5 and 39 with an average of 15 of map there are possibilities of groundwater over abstraction in the sub catchment a21a and a21b where groundwater use percentage is high these groundwater use percentages have to be properly considered in the allocations of groundwater use licenses to avoid over abstraction of groundwater a point recharge estimates obtained through cmb in the hospital hill shale and government quartzite of the witwatersrand supergroup is 2 5 while 27 8 is observed in the malmani dolomites the low cmb recharge estimates in the witwatersrand supergroup could be a result of elevated chloride values from other chloride sources such as leakage of chlorinated potable water

human beings recently the universal need for fresh water has increased more rapidly than the past however as reported by the analysis the directly accessible fresh water to human beings are only occupies about 0 007 of all water on the earth which makes the shortage of clean water in worldwide waste water discharge from domestic industrial or agricultural sources encompasses a wide range of contaminants and has drawn major concern worldwide since they adversely affect the quality of water and its improper disposal which further exacerbates the water crisis these contaminants are having major threat for human health food security and access to safe drinking water a large number of research efforts have been made towards the advancement of techniques and methods for the production of clean water that can support the healthy development of our societies the membrane filtration technology is a simple and efficient method used to remove the organic and inorganic pollutants from contaminated water for membrane designing the polymer composites particularly polyvinyl chloride pvc polystyrene polyvinyl alcohol polypyrrole polyaniline polycarbazole polythiophene and their derivatives analogues have been widely applied in wastewater purification due to their unique binding ability cong et al 2013 fan et al 2013 however despite much progress challenging issues still exist in polymer composite based materials such as low adsorption capacity poor recyclability high cost and difficulties in porosity nowadays the organic inorganic composite or fused materials are mainly focusing the novel or innovative research due to the combined characteristics of used materials into a single solid with attractive properties the important characteristics of polymers are their exclusive electrical optical mechanical and photoelectrical properties beside this pvc is one of the most applicable polymer that has been used in many research fields like material biological environmental and medical sciences to make the composite of pvc there was the addition of np took place which indicated that the prepared membrane shows the characteristics of both used materials this pvc np composite material was prepared by a homogeneous mixing of organic pvc and inorganic np compounds in a specific ratio of percentages pvc np synthesized composite membrane with their high surface active sites to volume ratio and controlled pore size distribution has a high sorption capability and high sorption efficiency compared to conventional polymers and polymer based composite materials qiao et al 2007 rao et al 2007 these composite membranes show very attractive applications in many fields especially in heterogeneous catalysis desalination adsorption fuel cells energy savings and chemo biosensors hence such composite is chosen because of their combined specific advantages of both the partners and display enhanced purification response in absorption as well as adsorption processes huang et al 2014 simultaneously this can also be used in many other important technologies like electro dialysis membrane electrolysis electro deionization etc pvc np composite material may also have wide range of applications in environmental science food industry water filtration industrial waste medical military defence fields and can also prominently used as catalysts optoelectronic devices optical limiter sensors nanoelectronics photochemical degradations ion exchangers and porous membranes musameh et al 2002 wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 2010a 2010b ma et al 2010 x l zhang et al 2010 z zhang et al 2010 khan and paquiza 2011 pvc np composite membrane easily transforms the ions molecules and heavy metals due to their charged characteristic the electrochemical characterization of composite membranes depends on some of the physical parameters like ion exchange capacity water content nature membrane thickness ionic transportation thermal plus chemical stabilities etc this study requires the mathematical equations for which the response can be determined theoretically through which it indicated a basic line for the interpretation of calculated data some theoretical approaches like teorell meyer and sievers tms altug and hair kobatake et al nagasawa and co workers etc normally used to calculate the fixed charge density of composite membrane in this experimental analysis the charge density which leads the central parameter of membrane application has been theoretically calculated by tms equation by this the other important parameters of membrane have also been calculate very easily this tms equation is based on donnan equilibrium and nernst planck consideration the ion transportation across the membrane by electrolyte solution system has been studied by many authors at different time interval beg et al 1979 chou and tanioka 1998 khan 2011 arsalan and khan 2013 the surface charge density of membrane decided their performances according to their characteristics which was determined by observed and calculated potential values of salt solutions the other parameters of membrane like transport number mobility ratio and charge effectiveness have also been calculated by using observed potential data 2 experimental 2 1 materials reagents and instrumentations electrolyte solutions of unequal concentrations like kcl nacl and licl are required to make the stock solutions pvc granules of 200 mesh size is used as polymer 0 2 m na3po4 and nicl2 aqueous solutions of 99 90 purity are required to make np precipitated material all the used chemicals and reagents must be of analytical grade and double distilled water is used to prepare the solutions ftir spectroscopic analysis was done by the interspec 2020 ftir spectrometer xrd analysis was also done by miniflex ii x ray diffractometer through cukα radiation the tg dta has been done by shimadzu dtg 60h through providing the nitrogen atmosphere by using 20 c min 1 of a heating rate from the range of 25 800 c the dielectric property and impedance measurement have been performed by using agilent 4284a lcr meter from the range of 75 khz to 5 mhz frequency the potential observation through membrane was done by digital potentiometer electronic india 118 2 2 preparation of np material np inorganic material was prepared by sol gel technique it has synthesized by mixing of the 0 2 m na3po4 solution with same concentration of nicl3 solutions the mixing of metallic chloride with metal phosphate solution gives a strong precipitation into the bottom of flask then a constant stirring of solution till 1 2 h has been done until both the compounds get totally mixed with each other after that the solution has filtered out with the help of whatman filter paper and it is necessary that before filtering process it must be checked that the solution has a neutral ph range the precipitated material should be washed nearly 4 5 times by double distilled water to remove the free electrolytes and ions which was present in solution lastly the filtered material has been dried by putting into an oven till 2 3 h by maintaining 100 c temperature beg and matin 2002 2 3 design the pvc np composite membrane to make organic inorganic pvc np composite membrane the synthesized np material should be homogenously mixed with pvc powder in 1 1 ratio of percentages the mixing of pvc binder with np materials was done very cautiously by pestle and mortar until both the materials get totally mixed with each other then the mixed composite material was transferred into a special cast die which is having 2 45 cm diameter then the die has been transferred to place into an advanced oven for 1 2 h by maintaining 100 c temperature to equilibrate the reaction mixture of materials lastly the material turns to good membrane fabrication by putting the die into a pressure device of sl 89 uk through applying 5 t of pressure the 1 1 ratio of pvc and np materials is indicated very good morphological and mechanical stability of membrane if ratio of both the materials is exceeded or decreases the prepared membrane cannot show the appropriate stability and functions at last the stable membrane is going to inspect the microscopic and electrochemical examination to see the physicochemical and electrochemical applications of membrane siddiqi et al 1977 arfin et al 2012 2 4 observation of membrane potential the potential observation of used strong electrolyte solutions was done by the above discussed electronic india 118 potentiometer in this observation the synthesized charged membrane was incubated at the center of a two chambered glass cell having the cavity of 35 ml capacity each to introduce the electrolyte solutions and saturated calomel electrodes sce by putting the glass setup into magnetic stirrer it indicated the ions are moving from the chamber of high to low concentration which results to show potential values on instrument due to the nature of charged membrane it is appearing that the cations or anions of solutions like k na li and clˉ are affecting the potentiometric response m m a khan 2013 m r khan 2013 the rough diagrammatic representation of electrochemical setup is shown by fig 1 2 5 determination of water percentage the water percentage of membrane has determined by using the following equation w a t e r p e r c e n t a g e w w e t w d r y w d r y 100 where wwet is weight of swollen membrane that obtained by soaking into water for 4 5 h and wdry is the weight of dry membrane the porosity of membrane has been calculated by following equation p o r o s i t y w w w d a l ρ w 100 where a area of membrane l thickness the membrane and ρw density of water 2 6 diameter thickness and swelling of membrane by screw gauze apparatus through making the average thickness of 4 5th replicates the diameter thickness and swelling of membrane has been calculated easily the swelling can also measured by taking the difference between average thickness that equilibrated in 1 m nacl solution and dry membrane arfin 2011 2 7 dielectric properties of composite membrane the dielectric and impedance property of the composite sample has been done by the circular pallets which coated with silver paste on adjacent faces through which there is formed a parallel plate capacitor geometry which analyses the values of z θ and cp by these recorded data various dielectric parameters have been calculated easily the dielectric loss has been calculated by the formula tan δ 1 tanθ where tanδ is dielectric loss tangent which is proportional to the loss of energy from applied field and this energy is dissipated as heat and therefore denoted as dielectric loss arsalan and rafiuddin 2015 real and imaginary part of impedance has been calculated by the formula z z cos θ a n d z z sin θ 2 8 antibacterial activity of membrane the antibacterial activity of pvc np composite membrane has been done in vitro condition through using disc diffusion method it has been done against two gram positive and gram negative bacteria like staphylococcus aureus mssa 22 bacillus subtilis atcc 6051 and escherichia coli k12 pseudomonas aeruginosa mtcc 2488 respectively in this analysis the discs of 5 mm diameter were prepared from whatman filter paper and have sterilized by dry heat at 140 c for at least 1 2 h and have been placed in a nutrient agar medium the plates were supplied in an incubator for 24 h by maintaining 37 c and after passing time the inhibition zone has been measured the screening was performed for 114 4 mg ml concentration of tested material and antibiotic disc whereas tetracycline 30 mg disc was used to control it the nutrient broth of logarithmically serial took place by two fold diluted amount of tested material it controls by inoculated within the range of 107 108 cfu ml while the highest dilution are required to capture the growth of bacteria to spread on agar plates each one has 0 1 ml volume diameter zone and the number of colony forming units cfu has counted after passing 24 h ishrat 2012 3 tms theory tms method is commonly used to evaluate the fixed charge density of composite membrane this approach has several important points and postulate which are illustrated as according tms method there must be an equilibrium development at all the solution and membrane interfaces which have the proper similarity with donnan equilibrium the important postulates are described as a the water transference from either side of the membrane may ignored b the ionic charge movement as well as the concentration of fixed charges are constant throughout the membrane system c charge density is totally independent on the present salt concentration of solution additional assumptions are also the activity coefficient of salt is similar in both the solution and membrane phases the activities of salt concentration can only be agreed through donnan potential either by using the nernst planck or henderson equation teorell 1935 arfin 2009 4 result and discussion sem and edx images are shown in fig 2 which was done by the model leo 435vp sem through an accelerating voltage of 30 kv is indicated the morphology of composite membrane it shows that mixing of both the used materials was done uniformly through pestle and mortar therefore it illustrated that this membrane has very plain surface means that there is no any visible breakage or cracks are found on the surface of membrane which helps to easy transportation of charged species edx image gives the percentage information of various elements in organic inorganic composite materials therefore the sem analysis stated that pvc has excellent binding nature with np inorganic materials jabeen 2009 fig 3 indicated the ftir spectrum of only np and pvc based np composite material that shows the presence of phosphate po4 3 and hydroxyl oh groups in sample in pvc based np composite material there are broad peaks at the range from 1500 to 1600 cm 1 and at about 3400 cm 1 are assigned to oh bending and stretching vibrations respectively whereas the peak at about 700 800 cm 1 assigned the characteristic vibrational mode of polymeric mx po4 y confirming their integrity in the final product the peak shows at the range of 1000 1500 cm 1 is arises due to the stretching vibration of phosphate group arsalan 2014 fig 4 shows the xrd image of pvc based np composite material which indicated very intense peak at the range of 20 30 two theta degree values and many other small and less intense peaks are also found at the range of 20 70 value the peak resemblance at 2θ degree value indicated that pvc based np composite materials have strong crystalline property d543 95 1998 tga analysis of pvc based np composite materials are represented by fig 5 which shows the weight loss of composite materials by increasing the temperature it shows the weight loss of only np and pvc based np composite materials the np material indicated two times weight loss of 14 39 and 27 07 consecutively at different temperature ranges while the pvc based np material shows only one time weight loss approximately 21 02 between the temperatures of 50 500 c therefore it is stated that the composite membrane has endothermic nature which means that has high hydrophilic nature and can easily absorb moisture from surrounding atmosphere canas et al 2002 fig 6 indicating the dielectric constant of pvc based np composite material which shows variation according to the frequency means that the material shows frequency dependent behavior the dielectric constant is decreased by increasing frequency firstly it has haphazardly decreases and then move to a constant nature the dielectric loss also shows complementary results with respect to dielectric constant that also indicated that the dielectric loss is directly proportional to dielectric constant another graph also shows that the real part of impedance indicated strong frequency dependent behavior at very low frequency and the value of z zcosθ have increases quickly at high frequency it shows frequency independent behavior means that it shows constant nature which can calculate by above formula the graph of imaginary part of impedance z zsinθ for the composite also shows the frequency dependent behavior means that it increases quickly at zero frequency or slightly more than that but again at high frequency it behave constant nature arsalan and rafiuddin 2014a 2014b two gram positive two gram negative bacteria and a diploid fungus were used to analyze the activity in the concentration range from 200 to 800 mg ml tetracycline drug was used as a standard for the comparison of bacterial result and examined data which is present in table 1 so it is clear that pvc based np material has extraordinary inhibitory effect against the growth of bacterial strains by this analysis it is clear that the material of composite membrane has appropriate evidence of activity against different types of bacteria and fungus so it is clear that the pvc based np composite material can used as a potent antibacterial and antifungal agent the membrane which is incubated in acidic basic and alkaline medium shows appropriate chemical stability and durability which means it may loses their shape and structure after passing more time into harsh ph solutions these morphological changes were seen after passing 12 24 36 48 and lastly 60 h it indicated that membrane has been exhaustive in above harsh solution after passing more time or by increasing the concentration of solution the diameter porosity water content percentage and swelling of membrane is clearly represented by table 2 jabeen and rafiuddin 2010 the membrane has created ionic potentials due to the inter phase present between two unequal concentration of solutions the experimental potential data shows the selectivity of ions which is more flourish in high concentration range over dilute one which indicated the behavior of membrane either cations or anions in this experimental observation anions did not influence the potentiometer respond by fig 7 it shows positive potential order which means that the potential has increases by decreasing the concentration of solutions and it follows nernst equation so it is clear that both the membranes have perfectly cations selective nature which means membrane has negative charge m m a khan 2013 m r khan 2013 in ordinary membrane electrochemical property is the difference of permeability for co ions counter ions and neutral molecules but in charged membrane it produces adsorption and absorption process charges are generated potential which is totally depends on the porosity of membrane if pores are broad lot of charges are required to generate appropriate potential while in narrow one little quantity produces appropriate potential values the thermodynamically effective fixed charge density which depends on the initial stages of material preparation and their nature has been evaluated after completing the ionic transportation is represented by fig 8 the coinciding point in graphs gives the value of charge density which always show d 1 and follows kcl nacl licl order the above order of charge density is due to the size of above used electrolyte solutions siddiqi et al 1971 the electrochemical setup has indicated two donnan potentials at the two solutions and membrane interfaces while membrane arises diffusion potential due to unequal concentration of solutions so there is an equilibrium development arises at both solution and membrane interfaces which has similarity with donnan equilibrium it is resulting that there should be an internal salt diffusion potential which represented by henderson equation and leads to planck expression tms method is more applicable in high concentrated solutions and it is described

human beings recently the universal need for fresh water has increased more rapidly than the past however as reported by the analysis the directly accessible fresh water to human beings are only occupies about 0 007 of all water on the earth which makes the shortage of clean water in worldwide waste water discharge from domestic industrial or agricultural sources encompasses a wide range of contaminants and has drawn major concern worldwide since they adversely affect the quality of water and its improper disposal which further exacerbates the water crisis these contaminants are having major threat for human health food security and access to safe drinking water a large number of research efforts have been made towards the advancement of techniques and methods for the production of clean water that can support the healthy development of our societies the membrane filtration technology is a simple and efficient method used to remove the organic and inorganic pollutants from contaminated water for membrane designing the polymer composites particularly polyvinyl chloride pvc polystyrene polyvinyl alcohol polypyrrole polyaniline polycarbazole polythiophene and their derivatives analogues have been widely applied in wastewater purification due to their unique binding ability cong et al 2013 fan et al 2013 however despite much progress challenging issues still exist in polymer composite based materials such as low adsorption capacity poor recyclability high cost and difficulties in porosity nowadays the organic inorganic composite or fused materials are mainly focusing the novel or innovative research due to the combined characteristics of used materials into a single solid with attractive properties the important characteristics of polymers are their exclusive electrical optical mechanical and photoelectrical properties beside this pvc is one of the most applicable polymer that has been used in many research fields like material biological

optoelectronic devices optical limiter sensors nanoelectronics photochemical degradations ion exchangers and porous membranes musameh et al 2002 wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 2010a 2010b ma et al 2010 x l zhang et al 2010 z zhang et al 2010 khan and paquiza 2011 pvc np composite membrane easily transforms the ions molecules and heavy metals due to their charged characteristic the electrochemical characterization of composite membranes depends on some of the physical parameters like ion exchange capacity water content nature membrane thickness ionic transportation thermal plus chemical stabilities etc this study requires the mathematical equations for which the response can be determined theoretically through which it indicated a basic line for the interpretation of calculated data some theoretical approaches like teorell meyer and sievers tms altug and hair kobatake et al nagasawa and co workers etc normally used to calculate the fixed charge density of

electrolyte solution system has been studied by many authors at different time interval beg et al 1979 chou and tanioka 1998 khan 2011 arsalan and khan 2013 the surface charge density of membrane decided their performances according to their characteristics which was determined by observed and calculated potential values of salt solutions the other parameters of membrane like transport number mobility ratio and charge effectiveness have also been calculated by using observed potential data 2 experimental 2 1 materials reagents and instrumentations electrolyte solutions of unequal concentrations like kcl nacl and licl are required to make the stock solutions pvc granules of 200 mesh size is used as polymer 0 2 m na3po4 and nicl2 aqueous solutions of 99 90 purity are required to make np precipitated material all the used chemicals and reagents must be of analytical grade and double distilled water is used to prepare the solutions ftir spectroscopic analysis was done by the interspec 2020 ftir spectrometer xrd analysis was also done by miniflex ii x ray diffractometer through cukα radiation the tg dta has been done by shimadzu dtg 60h through providing the nitrogen atmosphere by using 20 c min 1 of a heating rate from the range of 25 800 c the dielectric property and impedance measurement have been performed by using agilent 4284a lcr meter from the range of 75 khz to 5 mhz frequency the potential observation through membrane was done by digital potentiometer electronic india 118 2 2 preparation of np material np inorganic material was prepared by sol gel technique it has synthesized by mixing of the 0 2 m na3po4 solution with same concentration of nicl3 solutions the mixing of metallic chloride with metal phosphate solution gives a strong precipitation into the bottom of flask then a constant stirring of solution till 1 2 h has been done until both the compounds get totally mixed with each other after that the solution has filtered out with the help of whatman filter paper and it is necessary that before filtering process it must be checked that the solution has a neutral ph range the precipitated material should be washed nearly 4 5 times by double distilled water to remove the free electrolytes and ions which was present in solution lastly the filtered material has been dried by putting into an oven till 2 3 h by maintaining 100 c temperature beg and matin 2002 2 3 design the pvc np composite membrane to make organic inorganic pvc np composite membrane the synthesized np material should be homogenously mixed with pvc powder in 1 1 ratio of percentages the mixing of pvc binder with np materials was done very cautiously by pestle and mortar until both the materials get totally mixed with each other then the mixed composite material was transferred into a special cast die which is having 2 45 cm diameter then the die has been transferred to place into an advanced oven for 1 2 h by maintaining 100 c temperature to equilibrate the reaction mixture of materials lastly the material turns to good membrane fabrication by putting the die into a pressure device of sl 89 uk through applying 5 t of pressure the 1 1 ratio of pvc and np materials is indicated very good morphological and mechanical stability of membrane if ratio of both the materials is exceeded or decreases the prepared membrane cannot show the appropriate stability and functions at last the stable membrane is going to inspect the microscopic and electrochemical examination to see the physicochemical and electrochemical applications of membrane siddiqi et al 1977 arfin et al 2012 2 4 observation of membrane potential the potential observation of used strong electrolyte solutions was done by the above discussed electronic india 118 potentiometer in this observation the synthesized charged membrane was incubated at the center of a two chambered glass cell having the cavity of 35 ml capacity each to introduce the electrolyte solutions and saturated calomel electrodes sce by putting the glass setup into magnetic stirrer it indicated the ions are moving from the chamber of high to low concentration which results to show potential values on instrument due to the nature of charged membrane it is appearing that the cations or anions of solutions like k na li and clˉ are affecting the potentiometric response m m a khan 2013 m r khan 2013 the rough diagrammatic representation of electrochemical setup is shown by fig 1 2 5 determination of water percentage the water percentage of membrane has determined by using the following equation w a t e r p e r c e n t a g e w w e t w d r y w d r y 100 where wwet is weight of swollen membrane that obtained by soaking into water for 4 5 h and wdry is the weight of dry membrane the porosity of membrane has been calculated by following equation p o r o s i t y w w w d a l ρ w 100 where a area of membrane l thickness the membrane and ρw density of water 2 6 diameter thickness and swelling of membrane by screw gauze apparatus through making the average thickness of 4 5th replicates the diameter thickness and swelling of membrane has been calculated easily the swelling can also measured by taking the difference between average thickness that equilibrated in 1 m nacl solution and dry membrane arfin 2011 2 7 dielectric properties of composite membrane the dielectric and impedance property of the composite sample has been done by the circular pallets which coated with silver paste on adjacent faces through which there is formed a parallel plate capacitor geometry which analyses the values of z θ and cp by these recorded data various dielectric parameters have been calculated easily the dielectric loss has been calculated by the formula tan δ 1 tanθ where tanδ is dielectric loss tangent which is proportional to the loss of energy from applied field and this energy is dissipated as heat and therefore denoted as dielectric loss arsalan and rafiuddin 2015 real and imaginary part of impedance has been calculated by the formula z z cos θ a n d z z sin θ 2 8 antibacterial activity of membrane the antibacterial activity of pvc np composite membrane has been done in vitro condition through using disc diffusion method it has been done against two gram positive and gram negative bacteria like staphylococcus aureus mssa 22 bacillus subtilis atcc 6051 and escherichia coli k12 pseudomonas aeruginosa mtcc 2488 respectively in this analysis the discs of 5 mm diameter were prepared from whatman filter paper and have sterilized by dry heat at 140 c for at least 1 2 h and have been placed in a nutrient agar medium the plates were supplied in an incubator for 24 h by maintaining 37 c and after passing time the inhibition zone has been measured the screening was performed for 114 4 mg ml concentration of tested material and antibiotic disc whereas tetracycline 30 mg disc was used to control it the nutrient broth of logarithmically serial took place by two fold diluted amount of tested material it controls by inoculated within the range of 107 108 cfu ml while the highest dilution are required to capture the growth of bacteria to spread on agar plates each one has 0 1 ml volume diameter zone and the number of colony forming units cfu has counted after passing 24 h ishrat 2012 3 tms theory tms method is commonly used to evaluate the fixed charge density of composite membrane this approach has several important points and postulate which are illustrated as according tms method there must be an equilibrium development at all the solution and membrane interfaces which have the proper similarity with donnan equilibrium the important postulates are described as a the water transference from either side of the membrane may ignored b the ionic charge movement as well as the concentration of fixed charges are constant throughout the membrane system c charge density is totally independent on the present salt concentration of solution additional assumptions are also the activity coefficient of salt is similar in both the solution and membrane phases the activities of salt concentration can only be agreed through donnan potential either by using the nernst planck or henderson equation teorell 1935 arfin 2009 4 result and discussion sem and edx images are shown in fig 2 which was done by the model leo 435vp sem through an accelerating voltage of 30 kv is indicated the morphology of composite membrane it shows that mixing of both the used materials was done uniformly through pestle and mortar therefore it illustrated that this membrane has very plain surface means that there is no any visible breakage or cracks are found on the surface of membrane which helps to easy transportation of charged species edx image gives the percentage information of various elements in organic inorganic composite materials therefore the sem analysis stated that pvc has excellent binding nature with np inorganic materials jabeen 2009 fig 3 indicated the ftir spectrum of only np and pvc based np composite material that shows the presence of phosphate po4 3 and hydroxyl oh groups in sample in pvc based np composite material there are broad peaks at the range from 1500 to 1600 cm 1 and at about 3400 cm 1 are assigned to oh bending and stretching vibrations respectively whereas the peak at about 700 800 cm 1 assigned the characteristic vibrational mode of polymeric mx po4 y confirming their integrity in the final product the peak shows at the range of 1000 1500 cm 1 is arises due to the stretching vibration of phosphate group arsalan 2014 fig 4 shows the xrd image of pvc based np composite material which indicated very intense peak at the range of 20 30 two theta degree values and many other small and less intense peaks are also found at the range of 20 70 value the peak resemblance at 2θ degree value indicated that pvc based np composite materials have strong crystalline property d543 95 1998 tga analysis of pvc based np composite materials are represented by fig 5 which shows the weight loss of composite materials by increasing the temperature it shows the weight loss of only np and pvc based np composite materials the np material indicated two times weight loss of 14 39 and 27 07 consecutively at different temperature ranges while the pvc based np material shows only one time weight loss approximately 21 02 between the temperatures of 50 500 c therefore it is stated that the composite membrane has endothermic nature which means that has high hydrophilic nature and can easily absorb moisture from surrounding atmosphere canas et al 2002 fig 6 indicating the dielectric constant of pvc based np composite material which shows variation according to the frequency means that the material shows frequency dependent behavior the dielectric constant is decreased by increasing frequency firstly it has haphazardly decreases and then move to a constant nature the dielectric loss also shows complementary results with respect to dielectric constant that also indicated that the dielectric loss is directly proportional to dielectric constant another graph also shows that the real part of impedance indicated strong frequency dependent behavior at very low frequency and the value of z zcosθ have increases quickly at high frequency it shows frequency independent behavior means that it shows constant nature which can calculate by above formula the graph of imaginary part of impedance z zsinθ for the composite also shows the frequency dependent behavior means that it increases quickly at zero frequency or slightly more than that but again at high frequency it behave constant nature arsalan and rafiuddin 2014a 2014b two gram positive two gram negative bacteria and a diploid fungus were used to analyze the activity in the concentration range from 200 to 800 mg ml tetracycline drug was used as a standard for the comparison of bacterial result and examined data which is present in table 1 so it is clear that pvc based np material has extraordinary inhibitory effect against the growth of bacterial strains by this analysis it is clear that the material of composite membrane has appropriate evidence of activity against different types of bacteria and fungus so it is clear that the pvc based np composite material can used as a potent antibacterial and antifungal agent the membrane which is incubated in acidic basic and alkaline medium shows appropriate chemical stability and durability which means it may loses their shape and structure after passing more time into harsh ph solutions these morphological changes were seen after passing 12 24 36 48 and lastly 60 h it indicated that membrane has been exhaustive in above harsh solution after passing more time or by increasing the concentration of solution the diameter porosity water content percentage and swelling of membrane is clearly represented by table 2 jabeen and rafiuddin 2010 the membrane has created ionic potentials due to the inter phase present between two unequal concentration of solutions the experimental potential data shows the selectivity of ions which is more flourish in high concentration range over dilute one which indicated the behavior of membrane either cations or anions in this experimental observation anions did not influence the potentiometer respond by fig 7 it shows positive potential order which means that the potential has increases by decreasing the concentration of solutions and it follows nernst equation so it is clear that both the membranes have perfectly cations selective nature which means membrane has negative charge m m a khan 2013 m r khan 2013 in ordinary membrane electrochemical property is the difference of permeability for co ions counter ions and neutral molecules but in charged membrane it produces adsorption and absorption process charges are generated potential which is totally depends on the porosity of membrane if pores are broad lot of charges are required to generate appropriate potential while in narrow one little quantity produces appropriate potential values the thermodynamically effective fixed charge density which depends on the initial stages of material preparation and their nature has been evaluated after completing the ionic transportation is represented by fig 8 the coinciding point in graphs gives the value of charge density which always show d 1 and follows kcl nacl licl order the above order of charge density is due to the size of above used electrolyte solutions siddiqi et al 1971 the electrochemical setup has indicated two donnan potentials at the two solutions and membrane interfaces while membrane arises diffusion potential due to unequal concentration of solutions so there is an equilibrium development arises at both solution and membrane interfaces which has similarity with donnan equilibrium it is resulting that there should be an internal salt diffusion potential which represented by henderson equation and leads to planck expression tms method is more applicable in high concentrated solutions and it is described as follows ishrat 2012 1 δ ψ m 59 2 log c 2 c 1 4 c 1 2 d 2 d 4 c 2 2 d 2 d u log 4 c 2 2 d 2 d u 4 c 1 2 d 2 d u where u u v u v where uˉ and vˉ are the mobility of cations and anions respectively c 1 and c 2 are solution concentration of chamber 1 and 2 and d is charge density of membrane eq 1 can also expressed by the sum of donnan potential δψ don and diffusion potential δψ diff 2 δ m e δ ψ d o n δ d i f f 3 δ ψ d o n rt v k f ln γ 2 c 2 c 1 γ 1 c 1 c 2 f r and t have their standard values γ 1 and γ 2 are mean ionic activity coefficients and c 1 c 2 are the cation concentration in both the

here k is distribution coefficient and expressed as 6 k c i c i c i c i d c i and c i are the ith ion concentration in membrane and external solutions the diffusion potential is represented as follows 7 δ ψ diff rt v k f ω 1 ω 1 ln ω 1 c 2 v x v k d ω 1 c 1 v x v k d here ω u v is the mobility ratio of cation to anion so the total membrane potential is obtained by the addition of δψdon and δψdiff 8 ψ m e rt v k f ln γ 2 c 2 c 1 γ 1 c 1 c 2 rt v k f ω 1 ω 1 ln ω 1 c 2 v x v k d ω 1 c 1 v x v k d 9 ψ m rt f t t ln c 2 c 1 where 10 t t u v the values of t and ω are obtained by eqs 9 and 10 the equation parameters like γ 1 γ 2 c 1 c 2 ω v x v k and γ have the usual charted values it is clear that the higher transport number follows the high mobility ratio of ions which increases by decreasing the concentration solutions the transport number and ionic mobility ratio has follows the licl nacl kcl order which is represented by figs 9 and 10 respectively the distribution coefficient of ionic solutions also decreases by increasing the concentration of solutions and it is represented by fig 11 the very important charge density has calculated by the help of eqs 3 and 7 and it is presented in table 3 arsalan and rafiuddin 2014a 2014b 5 conclusion pvc based np composite membrane shows appropriate mechanical stability due to good polymer interaction with inorganic material the

the spot specific nddi value does not show spatial variability of nddi hence arcgis was used for interpolation of nddi point data 2 5 geo data bases development the no3 digital database was developed which consists of different matrixes of spatial and attribute data laboratory based results and the nddi map of no3 the digital database was developed in arcgis the arcgis offers structured data management access and answer different queries depending on the data stored in it and also allows spatial analysis arcgis running on normal configuration pc was used for all spatial analysis and gps etrex legend hcx with 15 m accuracy was used for collection of x and y co ordinates of each point in the present study 2 6 geostatistical analysis geostatistical referred to statistics of the earth kriging is an advanced geostatistical procedure that generates an estimated surface from a scattered set of points with z values kriging is based on statistical models that include autocorrelation that is the statistical relationships among the measured points kriging approach of interpolation between sampled locations was found best for this study jacintha et al 2016 it gives better results and has less bias in predictions therefore it is a best linear unbiased estimator blue it is due to interpolated or kriged values that are computed from equations that reduces the variance of estimated value rawat et al 2012b 2012d kriging also presents the possibility of estimation of the interpolation error of values of regionalized variable at limited initial measurements kriging has been widely applied in hydro sciences and it is suitable as an estimation method to assess diffuse pollution because kriging algorithm smooth variability giving a more continuous pattern better adjusts to diffuse pollution reality 3 statistical analysis the samples of post pre monsoon and nddi were pre processed using microsoft office excel 2010 descriptive statistics namely mean standard error median mode standard deviation σ sample variance kurtosis skewness range minimum and maximum were estimated pearson correlation coefficient is a basic and popular statistical tool to show the degree of dependency of one variable on other it measures and establishes the relationship between two variables and distinguishes the relevant hydro chemical facies pebesma and kwaadsteniet 1997 4 results 4 1 statistical results descriptive statistics of no3 concentration of 2005 2013 and nddi from 2005 2013 results are presented in table 1a b and table 2 respectively the nitrate in groundwater of study area varies from 1 to 24 0 38 1 28 1 22 0 25 1 32 1 40 1 31 and 2 5 29 mg l in 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively during pre monsoon and 0 39 0 39 0 37 0 31 0 21 1 41 1 27 7 and 0 05 34 mg l in 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively during post monsoon season table 1a b revealed that pre to post monsoon decreasing to increasing pattern except during 2009 0 25 increase pre 2010 0 21 decrease post 2011 1 40 raise pre and 2012 1 27 67 reduce post monsoon this pattern shows no3 is increasing each year after rainfall that is no3 leaching from different sources process is dominate in particular well in study area the analysis of pre post monsoon average mean value of no3 from table 1a b there is not any regular pattern found between pre post monsoon no3 during study period 2005 2013 from table 1a b average value positional average median and mode of no3 were random mean median and mode values are showing variation during pre and post monsoon data series 2005 2013 standard deviation value is also not constant thus the values of no3 are not close to each other for any year of study period during any year of study period 2003 2013 always positive skewness therefore no3 is toward the symmetrical curve nature while randomness in kurtosis suggests that the curve platykurtic in nature table 2 represents a descriptive statistics results of nddi of study area for period 2006 2013 almost every years mean are small and few fluctuation in nddi reveal that nddi values during study period are far from each other in range of 1 0 to 1 0 while higher 0 56 and lower 0 35 standard deviation value are found during 2010 and 2011 respectively in study area highest value of no3 concentrations are 41 and 40 mg l during pre post monsoon of year 2011 while year 2013 nddi value was not high it reveal that index value of particular well is more dependent on post monsoon no3 concentration of 2013 year 4 1 1 correlation analysis tables 3a b 4 is respectively pre post monsoon and nddi correlation coefficient matrix table 3a b shows the degree of a linear association between any two years no3 concentration as measured by the simple correlation coefficient r the correlation among no3 of pre and post monsoon seasons of years has shown approximately an analogous trend strong to good correlations among different years no3 parameters have been observed as no3 of 2006 with no3 of 2005 by 0 68 r no3 of 2007 with no3 of 2006 by 0 64 no3 of 2010 with no3 of 2007 and 2008 r 0 68 and 0 59 respectively no3 concentration of 2011 with no3 of 2007 2008 and 2010 r 0 81 0 56 and 0 59 respectively no3 of 2012 with no3 of 2006 2007 2008 2010 and 2011 r 0 57 0 73 0 63 0 71 and 0 77 respectively and no3 concentration of 2013 with no3 of 2011 and 2012 r 0 59 and 0 76 respectively table 3a indicating that no3 of particular year s pre monsoon can be represented in term of other year s no3 concentration of pre monsoon similarly in case of correlation matrix of no3 for post monsoon no3 concentration of 2010 is highly correlated with no3 concentration during post monsoon of 2006 2008 and 2009 with high value r 0 69 0 72 and 0 61 respectively it deciphers 2010 concentration of no3 in study area can be predicted through 2006 2008 and 2009 value of no3 on the same ways concentration of no3 during 2012 can be predicted in term of no3 value of 2008 because of strong relationship 0 72 is exist between them table 4 represents correlation coefficient matrix for each year s nddi value of forty four sampling points in study area during year 2006 2013 table 4 revealed that after applying nddi method over pre and post monsoon no3 parameters all correlation among different year s concentration of no3 parameters are broken therefore nddi is showed only individual not group point s no3 characteristic of particular well of study period 4 2 graphical analysis graphical analysis at point level reveals various types of pattern for each year no3 nddi fig 2 from table 5 and fig 2a it is clear that during year 2006 well no 14 22 31 and 36 were under absolute accretion class due to more concentration of no3 on post monsoon while well no 27 was under absolute dilution class that is dilution of no3 during year 2005 according to fig 3 during 2005 20 5 27 3 36 4 and 15 9 of total number of well 44 comes under absolute dilution toward dilution toward accretion and absolute accretion class respectively fig 2a reveals that during 2006 concentration of no3 in post monsoon were much in well no 9 10 28 and 42 and these well comes under absolute accretion class on the basic of no3 nddi while well no 27 shows absolute dilution condition out of 44 wells 15 34 13 29 6 12 27 3 and 4 9 1 wells come under absolute dilution toward dilution toward accretion and absolute accretion class respectively fig 3 during 2007 well no 34 and 41 just cross toward accretion limit and jump into absolute accretion class with index value of 0 63 and 0 60 respectively fig 2a whereas well no 36 is found under max dilution class absolute dilution fig 3 reveals that total 21 47 7 maximum no well comes under toward dilution and 29 6 comes under toward accretion class during 2007 no well exist in absolute accretion class because of less rainfall during 2007 from fig 2a only well no 14 was found under absolute accretion class with nddi value 0 94 1 0 max concentration of no3 except it all well were found under toward accretion toward dilution and absolute dilution classes during year 2008 fig 3 also shows a good destitution of wells no under different nddi class for no3 concentration during 2008 year 2009 shows no3 concentration were in slow down mode because index values destitution among forty four wells were dilution dominant it means 70 5 of wells come under absolute dilution and toward dilution class remaining percent of wells come under toward accretion and absolute accretion condition fig 2b according to fig 2 three wells wells no 17 18 and 19 were in neutral condition due to zero nddi value during 2009 while five wells 25 26 27 and 36 fig 3 were found absolute dilution mode due to 1 0 nddi value fig 2b reveals that during 2010 nddi values of all well fluctuated between 0 5 to 0 5 except well no 1 reports absolute dilution 13 absolute dilution and 15 toward accretion fig 3 clearly shows destitution of nddi as 20 5 36 4 and 31 8 among absolute dilution toward dilution and toward accretion respectively while 11 4 wells come under absolute accretion class during 2011 nddi values of no3 concentration of forty four wells were existing between 0 5 to 0 5 fig 2b excepting well no 18 31 39 and 41 these points or wells jumped into absolute accretion limit with small increment 0 25 0 25 0 21 and 0 16 respectively from toward accretion limit 0 0 5 fig 3 quantifies forty four wells as 20 5 9 36 4 16 31 8 14 and 11 4 5 percent under absolute dilution toward dilution toward accretion and absolute accretion classes respectively fig 2b reveals that during 2012 concentration of no3 in pre monsoon were high for all well that is why during year 2012 nddi values are fluctuated among 0 5 to 1 0 only well no 25 crosses the 0 5 limit with small increment of 0 1 according to fig 3 out of 44 wells 7 15 9 18 40 9 18 40 9 and 1 2 3 wells exit under absolute dilution toward dilution toward accretion and absolute accretion classes respectively fig 4 reveals that on an average study area during study period was existing under neutral nddi 0 and toward dilution nddi 0 to 0 5 class therefore before use of groundwater from wells for drinking purpose some degree of treatment is required 4 3 index mapping and interpretation the nddi value of nitrate no3 concentration of forty four wells for year 2005 2006 are interpolated and nddi mapping of no3 concentration in groundwater was prepared fig 5a the nddi mapping clearly indicates that most of the area within toward accretion limits 0 to 0 5 for no3 concentration in groundwater according to fig 5a destitution of dark yellow color toward accretion 0 to 0 5 part area in study area is largest in comparison of other color blue absolute dilution light green toward dilution and red absolute accretion patches expansion of toward accretion area was more in east to south in comparison of east to west second largest area in term of nddi values in study area belong to light green toward accretion 0 5 to 0 from the spatial distribution map of nddi of nitrate concentration in groundwater we can see that the highest and lowest nddi values are not effetely distribution over study during interpolation because of number of well in absolute accretion and absolute dilution class were 7 in which 4 were perfectly containing 1 0 and 9 in which three well containing 1 0 respectively so interpolation of these classes having two limitation 1 less no of points and 2 rang of numeric value of these point were less or not much variability in numeric value of these points that is why interpolation of toward dilution and toward accretion category were good from fig 5a it is clear that before using of groundwater for drinking purpose a degree of treatment is required the map of nddi of no3 concentration in groundwater for the year 2006 2007 was prepared after interpolating forty four points under consideration fig 5b the maximum nddi of no3 concentration value reported was 1 0 absolute accretion class and these locations are around settlement well no 28 42 and 10 therefore settlement area is source of no3 and agricultural land well no 9 therefore fertilizer is source of no3 almost all lower values as blue color patches 1 0 to 0 5 of nddi values are located at the edge and surrounded by some sparse forest so no anthropocentric actives and wetlands so no anthropocentric actives only possibility of good quality of water seepages fig 5b reveal that larger part area of study area comes under light green class or second category of in during 2006 2007 from comparison of fig 5a and b it is clear that during 2006 2007 dilution process was more dominating that is why most of third category toward accretion 0 0 0 5 of nddi of year 2005 2006 converted into second category during 2006 2007 because of good amount of rainfall from july 2006 to january 2007 the mean maximum and minimum values of nddi of no3 concentration in the year 2006 2007 were 0 19 class toward accretion 0 63 well no 34 class toward accretion table 5 and 1 0 well no 36 class absolute accretion table 5 respectively fig 4 the nddi map of no3 concentration of year 2007 2008 was prepared by interpolating the data under consideration fig 5c this figure shows that blue color patches 1 0 to 0 5 are reduces and changing in position also in comparison of year 2006 2007 this period also some part of third category groundwater converted into second category over all this period 2007 2008 most of study area exists under second class or light green patches according nddi mapping fig 5d clearly indicates that all classes blue light green light yellow and red color patches of nddi during 2008 2009 were increasing mode with respect to year 2007 2008 pattern of all classes this period expansion of third category is more in direction of north east in compassion of all other direction the mean maximum and minimum value of nddi of no3 concentration in the year 2008 2009 were 0 09 0 94 and 1 0 respectively fig 4 the nddi based mapping of no3 concentration in groundwater for the year 2009 2010 fig 5e is indicating special area of light yellow color patches become more than the previous period 2008 2009 from comparison of fig 5d and e dilution effected can be easily observed at lower part of study area during 2009 2010 third and fourth category toward accretion and absolute accretion of nddi is vanish with respect to 2008 2009 as per nddi mapping dilution process is also happening with second class because blue patches area is increased with respect to fig 5d but this process is limited within few well therefore its effect is not coming during interpolation operation from fig 4 mean value of nddi of no3 concentration in the year 2009 2010 was 0 11 toward dilution most part of study area groundwater moves toward dilution condition during 2009 2010 the nddi mapping of no3 concentration in groundwater for the year 2009 2010 fig 5f is revealing entirely different pattern of nddi with respect to 2006 2007 2007 2008 2008 2009 and 2009 2010 but this year 2010 2011 special area point of views nddi mapping is almost similar to nddi mapping of year 2005 2006 most of the second class of study area converts into third category toward accretion light yellow color patches of nddi with respect to previous year except 2005 2006 fig 5f indicates this year transportations leaching of no3 pollution were more from agriculture lands settlements and unknown point of source of no3 pollution due to good rainfall event during jun 2010 to january 2011 this period in study area arslan 2012 pointed out that such type of changes may rise due to special weather conditions during particular period nddi based no3 contamination map of study area fig 5g shows maximum and minimum nddi ranges from 1 and 1 respectively table 5 most parts of the study area present toward accretion and toward dilution vulnerability fig 5g the absolute dilution vulnerable areas occur in the north eastern upper left part and some upper right part whereas the toward accretion vulnerability area is located along the west to south side fig 5g during this period 2011 2012 all most absolute dilution class area converted in to special extend of toward accretion class and some special area of toward accretion also converted into absolute accretion class that s why red color patches area increased with respect of previous year nddi index map of year 2011 2012 shows only increment on absolute dilution class with respect to previous period 2010 2011 fig 5h also reveals that the direction of toward accretion category changes from previous year 4 4 discussion kanchipuram district is mostly covered by spread settlement urban and rural area the agricultural fields are continuously irrigated uses of chemical fertilizers release nitrate which leached to groundwater and poses serious threats to local inhabitants singh et al 2015 similar to our result kaown et al 2007 also identified same no3 pollution problem in groundwater of study area and found major reason behind high no3 leaching from agricultural dominate areas of study area korea nas and berktay 2006 found cemetery is also major sources are as point sources of nitrates at city of konya turkey in the same manner in our study area urbanization settlement are growing very fast after 2008 thus no3 concentration increase in our study area singh et al 2015 untreated wastewater from rural area and animal manure from rural area also cause of nitrate pollution in groundwater resources of study area gautam et al 2013 industrialization also plays a crucial role http www kanchi tn nic in industries html to elevate concentration of nitrates in groundwater fang and ding 2010 zarabi and jalali 2012 the distribution of no3 in groundwater is controlled by source availability thickness and composition of the vadose zone precipitation irrigation groundwater flow aquifer heterogeneity dissolved oxygen concentrations and electron donor availability and dispersion distribution availability and enrichment of nitrate in the groundwater is mainly controlled by environmental temperature and precipitation anthropogenic and co factors higher average temperature results in lower nitrate contamination possibly due to increased evapotranspiration wick et al 2012 higher average precipitation results in dilution of nitrate in soil consequently reducing nitrate concentration in the groundwater wick et al 2012 hence rainfall has significant role in controlling the lateral and vertical distribution of nitrate in the groundwater indirect contamination can come from leaking sewage systems fertilizer or manure spreading and pesticide spraying since nitrate nitrogen is very mobile in soil leaking septic systems or spreading manure or fertilizers at rates that exceed crop uptake of nitrogen can result in groundwater contamination over time there is a need of proper use and disposal of pesticides and fertilizers the shallow groundwater is more affected by the nitrate pollution hence to protect the groundwater from nitrate pollution many measures needs to be adopted the better sewage system control the practices of putting the sewage waste without proper disposal water wells should be located away from possible potential nitrate pollution sources regular monitoring and appraisal of well water that are located near livestock operations for microorganisms nitrate total dissolved salts and ph 5 conclusions the study focused on development of statistical index nddi particular to nitrate ion for kanchipuram district of tamil nadu india the result from index technique showed spot specific enrichment absolute dilution toward dilution toward accretion and absolute accretion in no3 concentration in groundwater of study area during study period year 2006 2013 results clearly indicated seasonal variation and deterioration of groundwater in the study area is mutual effect of pre and post monsoon no3 concentration in groundwater this statistical index is a robust index for analyzing no3 pollution in groundwater as spatial distribution in seasons the advantage of nddi is capability of conversion of parameter concentration among 1 to 1 now using nddi method we can compare any water system ground as well as surface of any region acknowledgements the first author express his sincere thanks to k santhanam former joint director geology water resources division public work department chennai india

12268,nitrate pollution is a serious groundwater problem a statistical index called normalized difference dispersal index nddi and nonparametric spatial statistical model have been used for appraisal of groundwater samples the groundwater monitoring data of period 2005 2013 of kanchipuram district of state tamil nadu country india has been used in this study maximum nddi value enrichment is exhibited by no3 1 0 at many locations in studied period and it shows absolute accretion increment of no3 and at few locations no3 1 0 shows its absolute dilution decrement of no3 mean index values of no3 are 0 01 0 20 0 19 0 09 0 11 0 00 0 04 and 0 17 respectively in year 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 in order to quantify the site specific variations through index map of no3 a environmentally sensitive species was generated by arcgis ver 10 statistical index based mapping is an appraisal method for evaluation and comparative assessment of no3 ion at different sites the elevated index values shows that the sampling locations are not safe for consumptive use this statistical index has potential to identify the ion specific risk zones graphical abstract fx1 keywords

threats like nitrate pollution strebel et al 1989 thorburn et al 2004 almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 burow et al 2010 singh et al 2012 2013a nitrate forms in the soil when nitrogen combines with the oxygen atmospheric nitrogen gas is the main source of all nitrates the process of nitrogen fixation by leguminous plants converts inorganic nitrogen into organic nitrogen biotic processes convert nitrogen to ammonia whereas abiotic processes convert nitrogen to nitrate no3 non point sources through processes of leaching of chemical fertilizers and animal manure septic and sewage discharges etc are generally responsible for nitrate in groundwater nitrification and denitrification process have also influenced distribution of nitrate in groundwater the majority of shallow aquifer of india is contaminated by nitrate gautam et al 2016 the world is facing the high loads of nitrate over last many decades primarily due to diffuse source of pollution including livestock and waste crop and chemical fertilizers used for improving the crops yield and land use change green et al 2008 srivastava et al 2013 velthof et al 2014 singh et al 2015 gautam et al 2015 nemčić jurec and jazbec 2017a researchers are concerned with these high trends of nitrate in drinking water and it is linked to different types of cancer and methemoglobinemia or blue baby syndrome almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 green et al 2008 in india people largely depend on the groundwater for drinking and irrigation singh et al 2015 hence it is a real danger for end users who are exposed to high nitrate concentration as recommended by world health organization as 50 mg l specific location based big data analysis needs a platform like geographical information system gis it is essential for any water quality management efforts to represent water quality parameters for a given study area at thematic level nobre et al 2007 singh et al 2013b 2013a rawat and singh 2018 rawat et al 2018 the population rise and high

agricultural and sewage disposal kaown et al 2007 nemčić jurec et al 2013 these hot spot locations must be identified with accuracy and precision and gis provide a facility to asses those hot spots on the map nitrate behavior in groundwater is fixed by many complex relations with air water hydrological parameters soil and topography factors gis is a powerful tool for relating land use soil types topography and hydrological parameters together in a single and meaningful platform singh et al 2013a rawat and singh 2018 rawat et al 2018 in numerous groundwater research works researchers have used gis platform to identify components of the landscape affecting nitrate destitution for example research work of nas and berktay 2006 they identify many parameters that contribute rise of nitrate concentration in study area turkey the factors are namely closeness rainfall topography sewage system hydrodynamic nature of water table and input of chemical fertilizers nemčić jurec et al 2013 nemčić jurec and jazbec 2017a these all parameters can be represented in a gis environment with statistical tests within the gis platform chemicals have eco toxicological impacts on humans and

nitrate in groundwater of kanchipuram district of tamil nadu india work envisages computation of nitrate based statistical index as nddi for quantitative and qualitative assessment of groundwater and preparation of nitrate distribution map for the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area kanchipuram district of state tamil nadu country india 11 00 to 12 00 north latitudes and 77 28 to 78 50 east longitudes the district is situated in north east coast of state tamil nadu and on the bank of the vegavathi river the vegavathi river is a tributary of the palar river fig 1a the land around study area is flat and aspect of slope is towards the south and east with average elevation is 83 2 m above mean sea level further in east it is bound by bay of bengal people of the region depend on agriculture with 47 of population engaged in doing agriculture the dominating crop is paddy groundnut sugarcane cereals millets and pulses are few other major crops grown in the region clay is dominating soil with some loam and sand the forest area is about 23 586 hectare ha north east and south west monsoon are the major contributor of rain with 54 and 36 the total annual rainfall average annual rainfall of the district is 1213 3 mm rawat et al 2017b 2 2 data sets and sources the groundwater samples were collected from wells and the laboratory analysis was performed by chennai water metro board and central ground water board cgwb in both pre and post monsoon seasons the chennai water board and central ground water board have monitored forty four wells from may 2005 pre monsoon sampling activity was repeated during january 2006 post monsoon and this monitoring process is continuing in practice as a regular routine work but we have obtained data of time period 2005 2013 the analyses of samples were carried out as per the procedure laid down in american public health association guideline american public health association apha 1996 global positioning system a hand held device was used for collection of co ordinates etrex legend hcx with 15 m accuracy of all sampling locations fig 1a most of the monitoring wells are situated near the agricultural class whereas few wells are near to village and town the field information such as land use land cover practices near the wells use of water depth of wells types of pumps were also recorded most of the farmers of the study area use mono block and submersible pumps for irrigation 2 3 satellite derived rainfall datasets daily rainfall of area from 2004 to 2013 was generated through processing of noaa satellite data by adopting the methodology of rawat and tripathi 2016a rawat et al 2016b 2012c 2012a daily rainfall datasets have been converted into monthly datasets using simple sum method of each rainfall value of the current month fig 1b 2 4 normalized difference dispersal index pre and post monsoon no3 concentrations in groundwater samples were integrated into the vulnerability of nddi for the potential risk the degree of spatio temporal variability has been achieved through net difference map post monsoon pre monsoon the enrichment and dilution at spot of chemical component was normalized and quantified by applying in method rawat et al 2017a the formula of statistical index is given in eq 1 1 n d d i c o n c e n t r a t i o n o f n i t r a t e p o s t m o n s o o n p r e m o n s o o n c o

the spot specific nddi value does not show spatial variability of nddi hence arcgis was used for interpolation of nddi point data 2 5 geo data bases development the no3 digital database was developed which consists of different matrixes of spatial and attribute data laboratory based results and the nddi map of no3 the digital database was developed in arcgis the arcgis offers structured data management access and answer different queries depending on the data stored in it and also allows spatial analysis arcgis running on normal configuration pc was used for all spatial analysis and gps etrex legend hcx with 15 m accuracy was used for collection of x and y co ordinates of each point in the present study 2 6 geostatistical analysis geostatistical referred to statistics of the earth kriging is an advanced geostatistical procedure that generates an estimated surface from a scattered set of points with z values kriging is based on statistical models that include autocorrelation that is the statistical relationships among the measured points kriging approach of interpolation between sampled locations was found best for this study jacintha et al 2016 it gives better results and has less bias in predictions therefore it is a best linear unbiased estimator blue it is due to interpolated or kriged values that are computed from equations that reduces the variance of estimated value rawat et al 2012b 2012d kriging also presents the possibility of estimation of the interpolation error of values of regionalized variable at limited initial measurements kriging has been widely applied in hydro sciences and it is suitable as an estimation method to assess diffuse pollution because kriging algorithm smooth variability giving a more continuous pattern better adjusts to diffuse pollution reality 3 statistical analysis the samples of post pre monsoon and nddi were pre processed using microsoft office excel 2010 descriptive statistics namely mean standard

of study area varies from 1 to 24 0 38 1 28 1 22 0 25 1 32 1 40 1 31 and 2 5 29 mg l in 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively during pre monsoon and 0 39 0 39 0 37 0 31 0 21 1 41 1 27 7 and 0 05 34 mg l in 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively during post monsoon season table 1a b revealed that pre to post monsoon decreasing to increasing pattern except during 2009 0 25 increase pre 2010 0 21 decrease post 2011 1 40 raise pre and 2012 1 27 67 reduce post monsoon this pattern shows no3 is increasing each year after rainfall that is no3 leaching from different sources process is dominate in particular well in study area the analysis of pre post monsoon average mean value of no3 from table 1a b there is not any regular pattern found between pre post monsoon no3 during study period 2005 2013 from table 1a b average value positional average median and mode of no3 were random mean median and mode values are showing variation during pre and post monsoon data series 2005 2013 standard deviation value is also not constant thus the values of no3 are not close to each other for any year of study period during any year of study period 2003 2013 always positive skewness therefore no3 is toward the symmetrical curve nature while randomness in kurtosis suggests that the curve platykurtic in nature table 2 represents a descriptive statistics results of nddi of study area for period 2006 2013 almost every years mean are small and few fluctuation in nddi reveal that nddi values during study period are far from each other in range of 1 0 to 1 0 while higher 0 56 and lower 0 35 standard deviation value are found during 2010 and 2011 respectively in study area highest value of no3 concentrations are 41 and 40 mg l during pre post monsoon of year 2011 while year 2013 nddi value was not high it reveal that index value of particular well is more dependent on post monsoon no3 concentration of 2013 year 4 1 1 correlation analysis tables 3a b 4 is respectively pre post monsoon and nddi correlation coefficient matrix table 3a b shows the degree of a linear association between any two years no3 concentration as measured by the simple correlation coefficient r the correlation among no3 of pre and post monsoon seasons of years has shown approximately an analogous trend strong to good correlations among different years no3 parameters have been observed as no3 of 2006 with no3 of 2005 by 0 68 r no3 of 2007 with no3 of 2006 by 0 64 no3 of 2010 with no3 of 2007 and 2008 r 0 68 and 0 59 respectively no3 concentration of 2011 with no3 of 2007 2008 and 2010 r 0 81 0 56 and 0 59 respectively no3 of 2012 with no3 of 2006 2007 2008 2010 and 2011 r 0 57 0 73 0 63 0 71 and 0 77 respectively and no3 concentration of 2013 with no3 of 2011 and 2012 r 0 59 and 0 76 respectively table 3a indicating that no3 of particular year s pre monsoon can be represented in term of other year s no3 concentration of pre monsoon similarly in case of correlation matrix of no3 for post monsoon no3 concentration of 2010 is highly correlated with no3 concentration during post monsoon of 2006 2008 and 2009 with high value r 0 69 0 72 and 0 61 respectively it deciphers 2010 concentration of no3 in study area can be predicted through 2006 2008 and 2009 value of no3 on the same ways concentration of no3 during 2012 can be predicted in term of no3 value of 2008 because of strong relationship 0 72 is exist between them table 4 represents correlation coefficient matrix for each year s nddi value of forty four sampling points in study area during year 2006 2013 table 4 revealed that after applying nddi method over pre and post monsoon no3 parameters all correlation among different year s concentration of no3 parameters are broken therefore nddi is showed only individual not group point s no3 characteristic of particular well of study period 4 2 graphical analysis graphical analysis at point level reveals various types of pattern for each year no3 nddi fig 2 from table 5 and fig 2a it is clear that during year 2006 well no 14 22 31 and 36 were under absolute accretion class due to more concentration of no3 on post monsoon while well no 27 was under absolute dilution class that is dilution of no3 during year 2005 according to fig 3 during 2005 20 5 27 3 36 4 and 15 9 of total number of well 44 comes under absolute dilution toward dilution toward accretion and absolute accretion class respectively fig 2a reveals that during 2006 concentration of no3 in post monsoon were much in well no 9 10 28 and 42 and these well comes under absolute accretion class on the basic of no3 nddi while well no 27 shows absolute dilution condition out of 44 wells 15 34 13 29 6 12 27 3 and 4 9 1 wells come under absolute dilution toward dilution toward accretion and absolute accretion class respectively fig 3 during 2007 well no 34 and 41 just cross toward accretion limit and jump into absolute accretion class with index value of 0 63 and 0 60 respectively fig 2a whereas well no 36 is found under max dilution class absolute dilution fig 3 reveals that total 21 47 7 maximum no well comes under toward dilution and 29 6 comes under toward accretion class during 2007 no well exist in absolute accretion class because of less rainfall during 2007 from fig 2a only well no 14 was found under absolute accretion class with nddi value 0 94 1 0 max concentration of no3 except it all well were found under toward accretion toward dilution and absolute dilution classes during year 2008 fig 3 also shows a good destitution of wells no under different nddi class for no3 concentration during 2008 year 2009 shows no3 concentration were in slow down mode because index values destitution among forty four wells were dilution dominant it means 70 5 of wells come under absolute dilution and toward dilution class remaining percent of wells come under toward accretion and absolute accretion condition fig 2b according to fig 2 three wells wells no 17 18 and 19 were in neutral condition due to zero nddi value during 2009 while five wells 25 26 27 and 36 fig 3 were found absolute dilution mode due to 1 0 nddi value fig 2b reveals that during 2010 nddi values of all well fluctuated between 0 5 to 0 5 except well no 1 reports absolute dilution 13 absolute dilution and 15 toward accretion fig 3 clearly shows destitution of nddi as 20 5 36 4 and 31 8 among absolute dilution toward dilution and toward accretion respectively while 11 4 wells come under absolute accretion class during 2011 nddi values of no3 concentration of forty four wells were existing between 0 5 to 0 5 fig 2b excepting well no 18 31 39 and 41 these points or wells jumped into absolute accretion limit with small increment 0 25 0 25 0 21 and 0 16 respectively from toward accretion limit 0 0 5 fig 3 quantifies forty four wells as 20 5 9 36 4 16 31 8 14 and 11 4 5 percent under absolute dilution toward dilution toward accretion and absolute accretion classes respectively fig 2b reveals that during 2012 concentration of no3 in pre monsoon were high for all well that is why during year 2012 nddi values are fluctuated among 0 5 to 1 0 only well no 25 crosses the 0 5 limit with small increment of 0 1 according to fig 3 out of 44 wells 7 15 9 18 40 9 18 40 9 and 1 2 3 wells exit under absolute dilution toward dilution toward accretion and absolute accretion classes respectively fig 4 reveals that on an average study area during study period was existing under neutral nddi 0 and toward dilution nddi 0 to 0 5 class therefore before use of groundwater from wells for drinking purpose some degree of treatment is required 4 3 index mapping and interpretation the nddi value of nitrate no3 concentration of forty four wells for year 2005 2006 are interpolated and nddi mapping of no3 concentration in groundwater was prepared fig 5a the nddi mapping clearly indicates that most of the area within toward accretion limits 0 to 0 5 for no3 concentration in groundwater according to fig 5a destitution of dark yellow color toward accretion 0 to 0 5 part area in study area is largest in comparison of other color blue absolute dilution light green toward dilution and red absolute accretion patches expansion of toward accretion area was more in east to south in comparison of east to west second largest area in term of nddi values in study area belong to light green toward accretion 0 5 to 0 from the spatial distribution map of nddi of nitrate concentration in groundwater we can see that the highest and lowest nddi values are not effetely distribution over study during interpolation because of number of well in absolute accretion and absolute dilution class were 7 in which 4 were perfectly containing 1 0 and 9 in which three well containing 1 0 respectively so interpolation of these classes having two limitation 1 less no of points and 2 rang of numeric value of these point were less or not much variability in numeric value of these points that is why interpolation of toward dilution and toward accretion category were good from fig 5a it is clear that before using of groundwater for drinking purpose a degree of treatment is required the map of nddi of no3 concentration in groundwater for the year 2006 2007 was prepared after interpolating forty four points under consideration fig 5b the maximum nddi of no3 concentration value reported was 1 0 absolute accretion class and these locations are around settlement well no 28 42 and 10 therefore settlement area is source of no3 and agricultural land well no 9 therefore fertilizer is source of no3 almost all lower values as blue color patches 1 0 to 0 5 of nddi values are located at the edge and surrounded by some sparse forest so no anthropocentric actives and wetlands so no anthropocentric actives only possibility of good quality of water seepages fig 5b reveal that larger part area of study area comes under light green class or second category of in during 2006 2007 from comparison of fig 5a and b it is clear that during 2006 2007 dilution process was more dominating that is why most of third category toward accretion 0 0 0 5 of nddi of year 2005 2006 converted into second category during 2006 2007 because of good amount of rainfall from july 2006 to january 2007 the mean maximum and minimum values of nddi of no3 concentration in the year 2006 2007 were 0 19 class toward accretion 0 63 well no 34 class toward accretion table 5 and 1 0 well no 36 class absolute accretion table 5 respectively fig 4 the nddi map of no3 concentration of year 2007 2008 was prepared by interpolating the data under consideration fig 5c this figure shows that blue color patches 1 0 to 0 5 are reduces and changing in position also in comparison of year 2006 2007 this period also some part of third category groundwater converted into second category over all this period 2007 2008 most of study area exists under second class or light green patches according nddi mapping fig 5d clearly indicates that all classes blue light green light yellow and red color patches of nddi during 2008 2009 were increasing mode with respect to year 2007 2008 pattern of all classes this period expansion of third category is more in direction of north east in compassion of all other direction the mean maximum and minimum value of nddi of no3 concentration in the year 2008 2009 were 0 09 0 94 and 1 0 respectively fig 4 the nddi based mapping of no3 concentration in groundwater for the year 2009 2010 fig 5e is indicating special area of light yellow color patches become more than the previous period 2008 2009 from comparison of fig 5d and e dilution effected can be easily observed at lower part of study area during 2009 2010 third and fourth category toward accretion and absolute accretion of nddi is vanish with respect to 2008 2009 as per nddi mapping dilution process is also happening with second class because blue patches area is increased with respect to fig 5d but this process is limited within few well therefore its effect is not coming during interpolation operation from fig 4 mean value of nddi of no3 concentration in the year 2009 2010 was 0 11 toward dilution most part of study area groundwater moves toward dilution condition during 2009 2010 the nddi mapping of no3 concentration in groundwater for the year 2009 2010 fig 5f is revealing entirely different pattern of nddi with respect to 2006 2007 2007 2008 2008 2009 and 2009 2010 but this year 2010 2011 special area point of views nddi mapping is almost similar to nddi mapping of year 2005 2006 most of the second class of study area converts into third category toward accretion light yellow color patches of nddi with respect to previous year except 2005 2006 fig 5f indicates this year transportations leaching of no3 pollution were more from agriculture lands settlements and unknown point of source of no3 pollution due to good rainfall event during jun 2010 to january 2011 this period in study area arslan 2012 pointed out that such type of changes may rise due to special weather conditions during particular period nddi based no3 contamination map of study area fig 5g shows maximum and minimum nddi ranges from 1 and 1 respectively table 5 most parts of the study area present toward accretion and toward dilution vulnerability fig 5g the absolute dilution vulnerable areas occur in the north eastern upper left part and some upper right part whereas the toward accretion vulnerability area is located along the west to south side fig 5g during this period 2011 2012 all most absolute dilution class area converted in to special extend of toward accretion class and some special area of toward accretion also converted into absolute accretion class that s why red color patches area increased with respect of previous year nddi index map of year 2011 2012 shows only increment on absolute dilution class with respect to previous period 2010 2011 fig 5h also reveals that the direction of toward accretion category changes from previous year 4 4 discussion kanchipuram district is mostly covered by spread settlement urban and rural area the agricultural fields are continuously irrigated uses of chemical fertilizers release nitrate which leached to groundwater and poses serious threats to local inhabitants singh et al 2015 similar to our result kaown et al 2007 also identified same no3 pollution problem in groundwater of study area and found major reason behind high no3 leaching from agricultural dominate areas of study area korea nas and berktay 2006 found cemetery is also major sources are as point sources of nitrates at city of konya turkey in the same manner in our study area urbanization settlement are growing very fast after 2008 thus no3 concentration increase in our study area singh et al 2015 untreated wastewater from rural area and animal manure from rural area also cause of nitrate pollution in groundwater resources of study area gautam et al 2013 industrialization also plays a crucial role http www kanchi tn nic in industries html to elevate concentration of nitrates in groundwater fang and ding 2010 zarabi and jalali 2012 the distribution of no3 in groundwater is controlled by source availability thickness and composition of the vadose zone precipitation irrigation groundwater flow aquifer heterogeneity dissolved oxygen concentrations and electron donor availability and dispersion distribution availability and enrichment of nitrate in the groundwater is mainly controlled by environmental temperature and precipitation anthropogenic and co factors higher average temperature results in lower nitrate contamination possibly due to increased evapotranspiration wick et al 2012 higher average precipitation results in dilution of nitrate in soil consequently reducing nitrate concentration in the groundwater wick et al 2012 hence rainfall has significant role in controlling the lateral and vertical distribution of nitrate in the groundwater indirect contamination can come from leaking sewage systems fertilizer or manure spreading and pesticide spraying since nitrate nitrogen is very mobile in soil leaking septic systems or spreading manure or fertilizers at rates that exceed crop uptake of nitrogen can result in groundwater contamination over time there is a need of proper use and disposal of pesticides and fertilizers the shallow groundwater is more affected by the nitrate pollution hence to protect the groundwater from nitrate pollution many measures needs to be adopted the better sewage system control the practices of putting the sewage waste without proper disposal water wells should be located away from possible potential nitrate pollution sources regular monitoring and appraisal of well water that are located near livestock operations for microorganisms nitrate total dissolved salts and ph 5 conclusions the study focused on development of statistical index nddi particular to nitrate ion for kanchipuram district of tamil nadu india the result from index technique showed spot specific enrichment absolute dilution toward dilution toward accretion and absolute accretion in no3 concentration in groundwater of study area during study period year 2006 2013 results clearly indicated seasonal variation and deterioration of groundwater in the study area is mutual effect of pre and post monsoon no3 concentration in groundwater this statistical index is a robust index for analyzing no3 pollution in groundwater as spatial distribution in seasons the advantage of nddi is capability of conversion of parameter concentration among 1 to 1 now using nddi method we can compare any water system ground as well as surface of any region acknowledgements the first author express his sincere thanks to k santhanam former joint director geology water resources division public work department chennai india

12269,nowadays a spotlight on the direct manipulation of water from the geothermal fields is laid for manifold applications this manuscript discusses the utilization of water produced from geothermal wells for irrigation and industrial purposes in order to identify the suitability of the water for the above mentioned uses various hydrochemical parameters were evaluated samples were collected from three geothermal well sites from unai village a prominent geothermal field situated in navsari district gujarat india the hydrochemistry of the samples collected from hot spring depth 30 45 m was studied and samples were examined by calculating different parameters the complete study was done individually for both industrial and irrigational uses of geothermal water the mean surface temperature of the water is 55 c and average ph of the sample studied is 8 12 the key water quality indices wqi such as langelier saturation index lsi ryznar stability index rsi puckorius scaling index psi and larson skold index ls were examined for industrial utilization and the key indices like sodium absorption ratio sar sodium percentage sp kelly ratio kr residual sodium carbonate rsc and permeability index pi were examined for irrigational utilization of geothermal water lsi and rsi values show that carbonate and bicarbonate concentration is in the desirable range however ls 15 09 13 54 is very high which indicates higher cl content high value of indices such as sar kr and sp points out the increased concentration of na in the water sample the results of this study would help the end users to identify the necessary water treatments before utilizing the water for industrial and irrigation purposes in the study area graphical abstract fx1 abbreviations lsi langelier saturation

are greatly influenced by the contaminants that are produced due to urbanization and industrialization and some natural factors like leaching of soil temperature etc shah and mistry 2013 human activities are kept in mind along with the increasing groundwater extraction for protection and sustainable operation of groundwater water stability indices have been developed for irrigation and industrial applications deshommes et al 2010 mesdaghinia et al 2015 masters et al 2015 mirzabeygi et al 2016 water quality for irrigation refers to its suitability for agricultural use the concentration and composition of dissolved constituents in water can be determined to know its quality for irrigation use quality of water is an important consideration in any appraisal of salinity or alkalinity conditions in an irrigated area the suitability of groundwater for irrigation use was evaluated by determination of the electrical conductivity ec and calculation of sodium absorption ratio sar kelly s ratio kr residual sodium carbonate rsc soluble sodium percentage ssp and permeability index pi kumar et al 2014 for instance langelier saturation index lsi that is the difference between ph and ph of calcium carbonate saturation widely used as a scale prediction tool langelier 1936 lsi has been considered as a worthwhile network monitoring parameter especially when caco3 used as a protective layer ryznar developed similar index with a modification in the langelier index formula ryznar 1944 puckorius scaling index psi predicts the maximum quantity of sediments formed in the equilibrium based on buffer capacity davil et al 2009 in addition larson skold index ls determines the tendency of water to corrosion of the steel and cast iron pipes the proposed irrigational and industrial indices will prove very helpful to the irrigation and industrial water managers field engineers and decision makers in monitoring assessment and control of the irrigation and industrial water singh et al 2018 in a developing country like india agriculture is the foremost economic activity for earning ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare 2016 agriculture in india depends on water and water quality depends on atmosphere soil rock weathering pollutants depth of water table and many more the concentrations of salts like na ca2 mg2 and hco3 in water also reflects the water quality these salts are present in a different ratio in water and hence it influences the growth of a crop datta and dayal 2000 lindhjem 2007 dhembare 2012 talukder et al 1998 in the future there is more probability of utilizing geothermal water geothermal energy is used in various applications such as electricity generation greenhouse and district heating industrial processes and balneology baba 2015 so it is important to maintain the quality and quantity of the geothermal water for agricultural application plant growth is influenced by chemical constituents of irrigation water directly through toxicity or indirectly through alteration in nutrients supply ayers and westcot 1985 various water quality indices like ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds sodium absorption ratio sar kelly s ratio kr sodium percentage sp residual sodium carbonate rsc and permeability index pi are calculated to define whether the geothermal water can be used for agricultural purpose or not kai chun et al 2016 khan and rehman 2017 carried out evaluation of water quality index wqi in liaquatabad town of karachi district located in pakistan total 31 samples were collected and the main aim of the research work was to utilize the groundwater for drinking irrigational and industrial purpose it was found that the value of tds measured with ec meter was very high the ph ranged from 7 1 to 8 0 which is under the limit of who guideline most of the wells contain more concentration of ions like ca2 mg2 hco3 cl etc which deteriorates the quality of groundwater the water quality index values depict that the groundwater of liaquatabad can be utilized for irrigational and industrial purposes but is inadequate for drinking purpose sirajudeen et al 2013 and dohare et al 2014 also evaluated the wqi of groundwater from ampikapuram area in tiruchirappalli district of tamil nadu ph electrical conductivity tds hardness cod bod cl no3 and mg2 were evaluated and the water quality index of the samples were found in the range of 244 383 8 based on the studies it was concluded that the groundwater abstracted from the area can be utilized for various purposes but only if it is pre treated first water s stability can be concluded on the basis of whether dissolution or precipitation of minerals takes place if the minerals get dissolved in water then it is known to be corrosive while if the minerals get precipitated scale formation takes place and hence it is known to be of scaling nature the reduction of temperature and pressure during production lowers the solubility and causes prodigious precipitation known as scaling literally tens of different types of scales have been reported depending upon the reservoir temperature and utilization processes baba et al 2015 some of the metals that can be dissolved are ca mg pb and cu out of which lead and copper are harmful to plumbing a film of minerals is deposited on the pipe if scaling waters are used this prohibits corrosion of metallic surfaces the most significant water is the one with slightly scaling as too much scaling can cause the decrease in efficiency and tubal obstruction of the industrial equipment by increasing the overall cost qasim et al 2000 the deposition is due to the presence of calcium carbonate magnesium carbonate calcium sulphate and magnesium chloride fereshteh et al 2014 this equipment should be inert to the scaling water that is passed through transportation structures as all the parameters are equally important in water quality analysis the change in even a single parameter can alter the corrosiveness or scaling awwa 1971 the appearance of scale deposition and corrosion may lead to the secondary pollution of water increased energy consumption of water transportation and decrease working life of pipeline network fang 2004 thus becomes necessary to estimate the water quality index of the water samples obtained from the study area in gujarat india based on the concentration of various ions like ca2 mg2 na k hco3 co2 f cl and so4 2 various corrosion and scaling indices like langelier saturation index lsi ryznar stability index rsi puckorius or practical scaling index psi and larson skold ls are of much importance to categorize the stability of the water samples obtained from the site the hydrochemical and geological studies are of much importance during the analysis of water quality index as it traces the relationship between chemical aspects and type of water and the geology of that area the properties of water are mainly dependent on the geological bodies by which it flows during the flow a variety of contaminants dissolve with it and some particulates flow with water through several processes that include weathering decaying of organisms leaching of soil etc nagaraju et al 2014 such processes largely depend on the hydrochemistry and biological factors further the geology and hydrology of the area depends on the topography land composition temperature of the environment microbes present in the soil and several other factors such as application field of geothermal water storage materials etc the main aim of the study is to raise the potential of the geothermal water in order to utilize that water for sustainable development of the location in various fields like irrigation and several industrial applications 2 study area the study area unai is situated in the vansda taluka that belongs to navsari district of gujarat state in india sahajpal et al 2015 the total area of the taluka is around 20 290 ha the coordinates of the locations are 20 85 n 73 33 e 20 85 n 73 33 e 20 85 n 73 33 e figs 1 and 2 the general topography of the study area is 96 m above from the sea level the routine climates of the district are sub tropical with maximum daily temperatures from 30 c to 37 c and minimum daily temperatures from 14 c to 26 c soil types generally range from black clayey to loamy soil having an average of 1 m thickness of the layer below subsurface the texture of the soil found in midland area and the coastal plain is found to be different there are two types of hydrogeological units on the basis of geological formation of the area namely deccan traps and alluvium deccan trap is primarily characterized by highly weathered regolith capping underlain by highly fractured and columnar jointed rocky units which has the potential of significant groundwater storage alluvium contains porous formations and hence the quantity of groundwater storage is clearly dependent on the porosity of the formations 3 sampling and methodology samples were collected from the 3 different locations from the village table 1 the standard sampling methods were used giggenbach and goguel 1989 there were three samples collected from each water source raw untreated sample for determination of ph and conductivity filtered untreated sample for determining anionic concentrations an acidified sample with hno3 reduced to ph 2 for determination of cationic concentrations sharma 2013 samples from the three geothermal wells in the unai region were collected after purging out for 15 min purging was done in order to prevent the water from changes like temperature escape or dissolution of different gases oxidation biological activity precipitation of metals reactions with well casing etc which may result into the alteration of composition koterba et al 1995 the parameter such as temperature electric conductivity ec and ph were measured in the field immediately after sampling using a multi parameter series meter preservation of samples was critical in order to reduce the rate of any biological or chemical reactions after collecting the samples these were evaluated in the laboratory where all the chemical tests were carried out in order to obtain concentration values shah et al 2015 2017 2018a 2018b sircar et al 2015 standard apha methods were used to determine the concentration of chloride sulphate fluoride calcium magnesium hco3 boron arsenic iron magnesium silica lead and nickel apha 2012 inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms has been used for the analysis of strontium cesium rubidium and barium to determine the sodium and potassium content flame photometric and edta method was used armijo 2012 the limits of detection for all the instruments are 1 μ l to 1 mg l analytical precision for major ions was within 1 for all water samples ion balance errors ibe were 10 and most of them were 5 calculation of subsurface temperature is an important application of surface water geochemical analysis geothermometry is an exploration technique which can help us to predict temperature of the geothermal system and monitor temperature change in the reservoir during production powell and cumming 2010 wishart 2015 geothermometry can also help to understand the chemical state of recharging water as a result of the effect of temperature and pressure bruhn et al 2011 in this study solute geo thermometers such as silica and cations were used to estimate the temperature of the geothermal reservoir following equations were used based on their applicability a fournier

pi were calculated to check if the obtained geothermal water can be utilized for irrigational purposes shah et al 2018a 2018b corrosion irrigation water quality indices and saturation indices and equation for categorizing the stability of the water used in the study are summarized in table 2 4 results and discussions various hydrochemical parameters of the samples collected from three distinct locations and their mean and standard deviation are as represented in the table 3 4 1 hydrochemical facies the hydrochemical evolution of spring water can be understood by plotting the major cations and anions in the piper tri linear diagram piper 1994 explained the classifications the type of water on the basis of its interaction with rock and aquifer minerals it has two separate trilinear plots of cations and anions respectively showing relative concentration of each other the diamond plot at the center is blended of two trilinear plots on two side of the diamond different quadrants of diamond show the different type of water on the basis of dominance in ion concentration as shown in fig 3 from the analysis of samples of water from unai it was found that two samples plot in na cl water field while one sampling indicating in ca so4 dominated water the change in ionic composition of samples might be result of two different water source temperature dependent dissolution precipitation of ions in their flow path mixing of surface water with underground aquifer or contamination by saline water or cement pollution as water is found rich in calcium sulphate todd 1980 sakram et al 2013 here u1 has a relatively higher concentration of ca and hco3 co3 2 and lower concentrations of na and cl as compared to that of u2 and u3 fig 4 so the temperature of later two might be higher than u1 as with increasing temperature co2 is liberated and so caco3 gets precipitated resulting in lesser ca2 and co3 2 hco3 concentration in u2 and u3 moreover with increasing temperature dissolution of nacl increases higher na and cl in u2 and u3 as shown by piper diagram also indicate the higher temperature as compared to sample 1 thus the temperature of u2 and u3 might be higher than that of u1 but there are many more factors playing role in altering quality of groundwater so various other interpretation can be drawn by calculating different indices and should be integrated to get the conclusion 4 2 geothermometry calculation estimation of reservoir temperature using hydrochemical facies is one of the most widely used techniques for reservoir temperature estimation analysis of temperature is done with the help of various mineral in the water sample whose equilibrium constant is dependent on temperature and pressure but the effect of temperature on the dissolution of mineral is much greater than that of pressure powell and cumming 2010 wishart 2015 not only temperature and pressure but the effect of reaction of one species reaction may affect another geothermometry can also help to understand the chemical state of recharging water as a result of the effect of temperature and pressure bruhn et al 2011 for the thermal waters of unai hot springs the ratio of hco3 cl is less than unity therefore it can be deduced that these thermal waters are fast ascending to the surface and are not mixed or only partially mixed with near surface groundwater giggenbach 1988 hence these thermal springs are the best candidates for the estimation of reservoir temperatures using chemical geothermometers based on the physiochemical parameters available for the thermal waters we have used silica and cation geothermometry table 4 shows the estimated reservoir temperature range of 65 82 c from silica geothermometry while cation geothermometry gives temperature range of 125 217 c both silica and cation geothermometers are showing the different value of reservoir temperature it could be due to the precipitation of silica from the thermal water during ascending to the surface or while lowering of the water temperature the reactions involving k na equilibrate at high temperature and do not adjust quickly to the physical environment at the shallow depths thus gives the over estimation of the reservoir temperature while reactions involving k mg equilibrate at low temperature giggenbach 1988 combined both na k and k mg thermometers and gave na k mg ternary diagram for estimating the reservoir temperature thus for a more accurate estimation of reservoir temperature thermal water of the study area was plotted in the na k mg ternary diagram fig 4 according to this diagram fig 4 the thermal water samples plot on the immature water field indicating re equilibrium mixing dilution or dissolution of minerals which are associated with cations to be the governing processes for this system na k mg ternary diagram was proposed by giggenbach 1988 it is the most widely used cation geo thermometry plot a ternary plot combining the sodium potassium na k geo thermometers with the potassium magnesium k mg geo thermometer this ternary diagram is used to determine the reservoir temperature and to recognize waters which have attained equilibrium with host lithology u1 u2 and u3 all fall near to the mg vertex indicating that the waters are partially equilibrated or mixed u1 and u2 lie below the immature water curve indicating an initial dissolution of minerals before equilibrium sets in water from well u3 lies in the partial equilibrated region suggesting that dissolution of minerals has taken place or the equilibrium reactions have set in but equilibrium has not been reached or the collected sample is a mixture of water that has reached equilibrium with a diluted unequilibrated water such as cold groundwater u1 and u2 are immature water suggesting that geo thermometry cannot be applied to this water study of sample from u3 gives a temperature of 60 80 c indicating that the field may qualify to be a low temperature geothermal system fig 4 4 3 hydrodynamic model of the study area the current theoretical comprehension of hydrodynamics in aqueous systems is presented in fig 5 this model has been developed based on the geophysical geochemical and surface temperature data the following paragraph illustrates the conceptual fluid flow model postulated for the present study level of fluid is regulated by the fluid flow model and the level is indicated by filling and emptying of water in the reservoir geothermal water may ascends from the geothermal reservoir and emerges at the surface as hot springs may cool on the way by conduction boiling or mixing with shallow groundwater or by any combination of this process the deep and shallow regions are linked with fault system vertical faults are found in the geology of the area at higher depth the rock resistivity increases and at shallow depth the fluid occurs in two stages or vapor dominated reservoir also the meteoric water moves downwards through faults or intrusive bodies to higher temperature region due to this downward movement of meteoric water the geothermal system is nourished to finish the fluid flow circle niaraq et al 2017 after this the heat and chemical exchange takes place and meteoric water is transfigured to high temperature nacl rich parent geothermal fluid which has two components namely meteoric water and magmatic fluid this fluid finally moves upwards to the earth surface designed as hot springs this upward movement is regulated by pressure and density differences kiryukhin et al 2003 4 4 suitability for industry water is the basic necessity for any industrial processes geothermal water which is available at higher temperature can be used directly for the processes but we need to check as water often experience corrosion or scaling several indices are calculated to judge the reliability of the water on scaling and corrosion problems 4 4 1 ph the table 3 shown here presents the value of ph ranging from 7 86 to 8 38 according to the bureau of indian standard bis 201 2724 4251 6582etc 1991 the desirable limit of ph is 8 2 out of the samples collected sample 1 has the ph value slightly greater than the desirable limit while the other two samples fall within the sensible limit of the bis standard and are able to be used in the industry for distinct motives 4 4 2 sulphate the sulphate ion is the second most occurring ion in the hard water after bicarbonate the origin of the sulphate ion can be natural or it can occur from municipal and industrial discharges one of the main reasons regarding the problems caused by sulphate ion is that it possesses the potential to form strong acids that result in the change of ph for industrial units such as sugar production and concrete manufacturing the sulphate ion concentration ought to be minimized below 20 mg l desirable limit of the sulphate ion as stated by bis 201 2724 4251 6582etc 1991 is 250 mg l from the table 3 it is clearly observed that the samples are in the range of the desirable limit 4 4 3 fluoride fluoride ion contains fluorine element the most reactive non metallic element the chief complication in using fluoride compounds is that it causes corrosion of piping and other water treatment equipment nollet 2000 the desired limit of the fluoride ion for industrial usage as given by bis 201 2724 4251 6582etc 1991 is 1 mg l the table 3 depicts that none of the samples fall under this limit as the content is very high one of the reasons for such high values can be the leaching of soil hence to utilize the water for industrial purpose the water needs to be pre treated 4 4 4 chloride chlorides are the salts that are produced from the combination of chlorine gas with metal e g sodium chloride nacl magnesium chloride mgcl2 etc like fluorides chloride ions also corrode the materials it also has an impact on the taste of food products jagadeesh et al 2012 the limit of the chloride concentration is set to 200 mg l however all the samples collected possess very high content of chloride excess chloride content is likely to increase corrosion rate of steel and aluminium solution to this can be use of copper galvanized steel and cast iron pipes attributing their property to high resistance to salt water corrosion but exposure over time can still cause damage thus before planning the strategies for exploitation of groundwater at unai for industrial purpose care for controlling tds especially na and cl ions has to be taken into account shah et al 2018a 2018b 4 4 5 langelier saturation index lsi langelier saturation index langelier 1936 is associated with the conditions at which water and calcium carbonate are in equilibrium it is the calculation of solution s ability to dissolve or precipitate calcium carbonate and it is employed as an indicator of the corrosiveness and its saturation with respect to calcium carbonate langelier 1936 lsi is related to the accumulation of calcium carbonate film or scale this accumulation can be harmful as it insulates pipes process equipment and other components of the system from coming in relation with water water cycle manual 1999 the values of lsi are observed as 1 64 0 06 and 0 56 respectively for sample 1 sample 2 and sample 3 table 5 it can be said from the values that the water of sample 1 is very poor as the value of lsi is 0 the water of sample 2 and sample 3 has a very good quality as compared to that of sample 1 hence it can be concluded that the samples collected are super saturated with respect to carbonate as a result of which sample 1 may form thick layer of scale while sample 2 and sample 3 may form an eggshell like film of caco3 which behaves as an inhibitor film for corrosion of any metal use in the process equipment awatif et al 2014 4 4 6 ryznar stability index rsi ryznar stability index can sustain greater protection against corrosion and is also able to sustain higher ca hardness levels and higher ph levels rsi acts as the scale thickness monitoring index as the ca hardness reaches its maximum value the scale formation initiates which prevents the equipment from corrosion but this scale formation may result in the lower efficiency of the equipment the rsi values of the three samples are 5 10 7 74 and 7 01 respectively table 5 it can be concluded that for sample 1 the scale will be easily formed and corrosion will not take place in the equipment hadi 2010 but the efficiency of the equipment is reduced however in case of sample 2 and sample 3 the value of rsi is greater than 7 represents that calcium carbonate formation will not lead a protective corrosion inhibitor film alsaqqar et al 2014 4 4 7 puckorius or practical scaling index psi puckorius or practical scaling index psi additionally calibrates the relation between saturation state and scale formation by consolidating an estimate of buffering capacity of the water into the index puckorius 1983 a high calcite saturation level is observed if the water has high calcium concentration but less alkalinity and buffering capacity the calcium precipitated due to low buffering capacity results in the rapid decrease in ph there is a probability that the water may have high tendency to form scale due to driving force but the scale formed is of very less quantity the calculation of psi and lsi is almost equal except that in psi equilibrium ph is used instead of actual system ph the psi values of our collected samples are 6 69 9 60 and 8 90 respectively table 5 scale dissolving water activity is represented by psi value greater than 6 values of sample 2 and 3 have higher psi value which depicts the non scale forming activity and water is deficient in ions which are responsible for scale formation this result is in accordance with the rsi value 4 4 8 larson skold index ls larson skold index ls details about the corrosiveness of water towards mild steel the aggressiveness of cooling water containing sufficient buffering capacity and alkalinity is due to the increase in chloride and sulphate their presence also leads to the interference in the film formation the calculation of ls will not give correct results for the water possessing very high and very low alkalinity larson and skold 1958 the ls values of the collected samples are 2 95 15 09 and 13 54 respectively table 5 from the guidelines it can be interpreted that for all the samples the corrosion rates will be extremely high and there will not be any film formation very high value of ls and sulphate concentration being in permissible limits indicates that the chlorine content of the samples is way beyond the desirable limits alsaqqar et al 2014 hence by using such water the efficiency of the equipment used in the process decreases haritash et al 2016 4 5 suitability for irrigation india is an agricultural country it contributes to 15 18 of gdp of india in agriculture water is the foremost necessity for plant growth the plant growth is based on the quality of the water and concentration of different ions present so for utilization of water produced from geothermal well quality check is necessary different agricultural indices are calculated to find the suitability 4 5 1 ph this parameter of water has a noteworthy impact on the reactions and other parameters of the soil and water and hence on the plant growth the desirable range of ph is between 6 0 and 8 5to utilize it for irrigation ayers and westcot 1985 if the water is not in the desirable range and then it has to be first treated to take it for the irrigational use the ph of the collected samples is 8 38 7 86 and 8 12 table 3 all the samples have ph within the desirable range hence the water collected from the study area is reliable for irrigation purpose 4 5 2 electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds are the two important interlinked parameters for water quality index in irrigation tds is the measurement of the dissolved salts in water and the effect of dissolved salts on soil and crops ec is a measure of the degree in which water conducts electricity the ec of the collected samples are 1475 1840 and 1662 ds m respectively and the tds values are 998 1190 and 1114 ppm table 3 reddy 2013 the united states salinity laboratory provides the guideline for categorizing groundwater on ec and tds basis it is concluded that all the samples have very high salinity hazard which may cause serious damage to the plants therefore this water can t be used for irrigation purpose unless it is treated by appropriate processes lokesh and singh 2015 4 5 3 sodium absorption ratio sar an important water quality parameter known as sodium absorption ratio sar is used in the supervision of sodium affected soils it is the only parameter by which the appropriateness of water in irrigation is ascertained sappa et al 2014 water having higher sar is considered to be less suitable for irrigation as it leads to the long term detriment todd and mays 2005 the sar of the samples collected from the study area is 3 27 9 94 and 11 01 respectively table 6 sample 1 is the best sample from sar perspective but as its value is more than 3 regular soil tests have to be carried out however the sar of sample 2 and sample 3 are very high so by using such water for consecutive years ca and mg in the soil will be replaced by sodium ayers and westcot 1994 shaki and adeloye 2006 this leads to the decrease in infiltration permeability stable aggregates of soil and loss of soil structure richards 1954 thus it can be concluded that sodium ion concentration is high in sample 2 and 3 and needs to be decreased before utilization shah and mistry 2013 4 5 4 residual sodium carbonate rsc residual sodium carbonate rsc index of the water describes the alkalinity hazard for the soil the ca and mg precipitate if the concentration of carbonates and bicarbonates is more than that of ca and mg mirza et al 2017 this gives rise to the increase in sodium proportion in water in the form of sodium carbonate and this increase can be indicated by residual sodium carbonate rsc rsc indices of the given samples are 6 61 3 33 and 2 78 respectively table 6 negative value of rsc shows that carbonate and bicarbonate concentration is relatively low which also can be confirmed by the results of rsi and psi shah and mistry 2013 water from all the samples fall under 1st category so the water can be used for irrigation purpose on the basis of rsc index michael 1992 if the value of rsc is 2 5 meq l na adsorption takes place 4 5 5 kelly ratio kr and sodium percentage sp kelly and wilcox explained the hazardous impact of na on water quality for irrigation purpose by describing the terms kelly s ratio kr and sodium percentage sp kelly 1951 1963 shah and mistry 2013 the kr values of the samples are computed as 0 78 3 51 and 4 01 respectively table 6 the desirable range of kr is less than 1 kelly 1940 kelly index value 1 represents that concentration of the sodium should be nearly equal to the summation of calcium and magnesium making a perfect balance sample 1 has relatively low sodium concentration but sample 2 and sample 3 have high sodium ion content hence water of sample 1 can be used for irrigation purpose while that of sample 2 and sample 3 are not suitable for irrigation the sp values of the samples are 44 91 78 27 and 80 66 respectively table 6 wilcox diagram is used to govern the viability of the water that has to be used for irrigation purpose it is a plot of ec versus na wilcox 1948 from the given wilcox plot fig 6 it can be said that the sample 1 is safe for irrigation as its value is less than 50 while as the values of sp of sample 2 and sample 3 are more than 50 they can t be used in irrigation wilcox 1948 continuous irrigation with such water may result in the accumulation of na compared to divalent ions and this may lead to some adverse effects on soil like deterioration and also influences the sustainability of crop production in long term darwisha et al 2011 4 5 6 permeability index pi after a long term use of irrigation water soil permeability is drastically affected by na ca mg and bicarbonate contents present in the water doneen 1964 doneen s criterion to compute the quality of groundwater is given by permeability index and doneen s plot fig 7 doneen s plot is used to check the category under which the water sample falls it is a graph of permeability index versus total concentration of ion doneen 1964 the values of pi of the samples are 52 90 82 40 and 84 91 meq l table 6 according to the pre decided criteria fig 7 sample 2 and sample 3 fall under class 1 category 75 permeability and sample 1 fall under class 2 category 25 75 permeability no samples are observed to fall under class 3 category 25 permeability handa 1969 hence the water of sample 2 and sample 3 is considered to be appropriate for irrigation 5 conclusion water quality analysis is helpful in assessment and management of water quality for various direct and indirect geothermal applications the present investigation represents the first of its type undertaken on the unai geothermal region gujarat the case study provides valuable insight into the status of overall suitability of the unai geothermal water based on various water quality parameters after evaluating different parameters and indices for water quality it can be concluded that water may cause many problems when used for industrial and irrigational purpose however it can be used for various direct application purposes such as greenhouse fish farming crop cultivation and milk pasteurization lsi and rsi indices for the water sample from u2 sample 2 and u3 sample 3 reveals that they would form a thin scale layer which will help in corrosion protection thus they are better as compared to sample 1 sample 1 requires pre treatment before utilization due to the presence of high alkalinity fluoride and chloride content were way beyond the desirable limits as prescribed by bis standard ls showed that all the samples were incompatible because of imprudent chloride content so for industrial utilization purpose chloride and fluoride removal is very essential as they are the main cause of corrosion indices such as sar and rsc demonstrated that water collected from site is safe for the utilization in various irrigational purposes ssp and kr showed extremely high values which concludes that na concentration is very high which has also been the cause of high tds and conductivity hence for utilization of this water for irrigational purpose na concentration is compulsory to decrease thus the overall conclusion is that for the safe and relevant utilization of geothermal water ca2 ion concentration needs to be decreased slightly but cl f and na concentrations needs to be highly decreased however if the geothermal water undergoes pre treatment by appropriate methods then the geothermal water can be better used for direct and indirect applications acknowledgements the authors are grateful to school of petroleum

12269,nowadays a spotlight on the direct manipulation of water from the geothermal fields is laid for manifold applications this manuscript discusses the utilization of water produced from geothermal wells for irrigation and industrial purposes in order to identify the suitability of the water for the above mentioned uses various hydrochemical parameters were evaluated samples were collected from three geothermal well sites from unai village a prominent geothermal field situated in navsari district gujarat india the hydrochemistry of the samples collected from hot spring depth 30 45 m was studied and samples were examined by calculating different parameters the complete study was done individually for both industrial and irrigational uses of geothermal water the mean surface temperature of the water is 55 c and average ph of the sample studied is 8 12 the key water quality indices wqi such as langelier saturation index lsi ryznar stability index rsi puckorius scaling index psi and larson skold index ls were examined for industrial utilization and the key indices like sodium absorption ratio sar sodium percentage sp kelly ratio kr residual sodium carbonate rsc and permeability index pi were examined for irrigational utilization of geothermal water lsi and rsi values show that carbonate and bicarbonate concentration is in the desirable range however ls 15 09 13 54 is very high which indicates higher cl content high value of indices such as sar kr and sp points out the increased concentration of na in the water sample the results of this study would help the end users to identify the necessary water treatments before utilizing the water for industrial and irrigation purposes in the study area graphical abstract fx1 abbreviations lsi langelier saturation

are greatly influenced by the contaminants that are produced due to urbanization and industrialization and some natural factors like leaching of soil temperature etc shah and mistry 2013 human activities are kept in mind along with the increasing groundwater extraction for protection and sustainable operation of groundwater water stability indices have been developed for irrigation and industrial applications deshommes et al 2010 mesdaghinia et al 2015 masters et al 2015 mirzabeygi et al 2016 water quality for irrigation refers to its suitability for agricultural use the concentration and composition of dissolved constituents in water can be determined to know its quality for irrigation use quality of water is an important consideration in any appraisal of salinity or alkalinity conditions in an irrigated area the suitability of groundwater for irrigation use was evaluated by determination of the electrical conductivity ec and calculation of sodium absorption ratio sar kelly s ratio kr residual sodium carbonate rsc soluble sodium percentage ssp and permeability index pi kumar et al 2014 for instance langelier saturation index lsi that is the difference between ph and ph of calcium carbonate saturation widely used as a scale prediction tool langelier 1936 lsi has been considered as a worthwhile network monitoring parameter especially when caco3 used as a protective layer ryznar developed similar index with a modification in the langelier index formula ryznar 1944 puckorius scaling index psi predicts the maximum quantity of sediments formed in the equilibrium based on buffer capacity davil et al 2009 in addition larson skold index ls determines the tendency of water to corrosion of the steel and cast iron pipes the proposed irrigational and industrial indices will prove very helpful to the irrigation and industrial water managers field engineers and decision makers in monitoring assessment and control of the irrigation and industrial water singh et al 2018 in a developing country like india agriculture is the foremost economic activity for earning ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare 2016 agriculture in india depends on water and water quality depends on atmosphere soil rock weathering pollutants depth of water table and many more the concentrations of salts like na ca2 mg2 and hco3 in water also reflects the water quality these salts are present in a different ratio in water and hence it influences the growth of a crop datta and dayal 2000 lindhjem 2007 dhembare 2012 talukder et al 1998 in the future there is more probability of utilizing geothermal water geothermal energy is used in various applications such as electricity generation greenhouse and district heating industrial processes and balneology baba 2015 so it is important to maintain the quality and quantity of the geothermal water for agricultural application plant growth is influenced by chemical constituents of irrigation water directly through toxicity or indirectly through alteration in nutrients supply ayers and westcot 1985 various water quality indices like ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds sodium absorption ratio sar kelly s ratio kr sodium percentage sp residual sodium carbonate rsc and permeability index pi are calculated to define whether the geothermal water can be used for agricultural purpose or not kai chun et al 2016 khan and rehman 2017 carried out evaluation of water quality index wqi in liaquatabad town of karachi district located in pakistan total 31 samples were collected and the main aim of the research work was to utilize the groundwater for drinking irrigational and industrial purpose it was found that the value of tds measured with ec meter was very high the ph ranged from 7 1 to 8 0 which is under the limit of who guideline most of the wells contain more concentration of ions like ca2 mg2 hco3 cl etc which deteriorates the quality of groundwater the water quality index values depict that the groundwater of liaquatabad can be utilized for irrigational and industrial purposes but is inadequate for drinking purpose sirajudeen et al 2013 and dohare et al 2014 also evaluated the wqi of groundwater from ampikapuram area in tiruchirappalli district of tamil nadu ph electrical conductivity tds hardness cod bod cl no3 and mg2 were evaluated and the water quality index of the samples were found in the range of 244 383 8 based on the studies it was concluded that the groundwater abstracted from the area can be utilized for various purposes but only if it is pre treated first water s stability can be concluded on the basis of whether dissolution or precipitation of minerals takes place if the minerals get dissolved in water then it is known to be corrosive while if the minerals get precipitated scale formation takes place and hence it is known to be of scaling nature the reduction of temperature and pressure during production lowers the solubility and causes prodigious precipitation known as scaling literally tens of different types of scales have been reported depending upon the reservoir temperature and utilization processes baba et al 2015 some of the metals that can be dissolved are ca mg pb and cu out of which lead and copper are harmful to plumbing a film of minerals is deposited on the pipe if scaling waters are used this prohibits corrosion of metallic surfaces the most significant water is the one with slightly scaling as too much scaling can cause the decrease in efficiency and tubal obstruction of the industrial equipment by increasing the overall cost qasim et al 2000 the deposition is due to the presence of calcium carbonate magnesium carbonate calcium sulphate and magnesium chloride fereshteh et al 2014 this equipment should be inert to the scaling water that is passed through transportation structures as all the parameters are equally important in water quality analysis the change in even a single parameter can alter the corrosiveness or scaling awwa 1971 the appearance of scale deposition and corrosion may lead to the secondary pollution of water increased energy consumption of water transportation and decrease working life of pipeline network fang 2004 thus becomes necessary to estimate the water quality index of the water samples obtained from the study area in gujarat india based on the concentration of various ions like ca2 mg2 na k hco3 co2 f cl and so4 2 various corrosion and scaling indices like langelier saturation index lsi ryznar stability index rsi puckorius or practical scaling index psi and larson skold ls are of much importance to categorize the stability of the water samples obtained from the site the hydrochemical and geological studies are of much importance during the analysis of water quality index as it traces the relationship between chemical aspects and type of water and the geology of that area the properties of water are mainly dependent on the geological bodies by which it flows during the flow a variety of contaminants dissolve with it and some particulates flow with water through several processes that include weathering decaying of organisms leaching of soil etc nagaraju et al 2014 such processes largely depend on the hydrochemistry and biological factors further the geology and hydrology of the area depends on the topography land composition temperature of the environment microbes present in the soil and several other factors such as application field of geothermal water storage materials etc the main aim of the study is to raise the potential of the geothermal water in order to utilize that water for sustainable development of the location in various fields like irrigation and several industrial applications 2 study area the study area unai is situated in the vansda taluka that belongs to navsari district of gujarat state in india sahajpal et al 2015 the total area of the taluka is around 20 290 ha the coordinates of the locations are 20 85 n 73 33 e 20 85 n 73 33 e 20 85 n 73 33 e figs 1 and 2 the general topography of the study area is 96 m above from the sea level the routine climates of the district are sub tropical with maximum daily temperatures from 30 c to 37 c and minimum daily temperatures from 14 c to 26 c soil types generally range from black clayey to loamy soil having an average of 1 m thickness of the layer below subsurface the texture of the soil found in midland area and the coastal plain is found to be different there are two types of hydrogeological units on the basis of geological formation of the area namely deccan traps and alluvium deccan trap is primarily characterized by highly weathered regolith capping underlain by highly fractured and columnar jointed rocky units which has the potential of significant groundwater storage alluvium contains porous formations and hence the quantity of groundwater storage is clearly dependent on the porosity of the formations 3 sampling and methodology samples were collected from the 3 different locations from the village table 1 the standard sampling methods were used giggenbach and goguel 1989 there were three samples collected from each water source raw untreated sample for determination of ph and conductivity filtered untreated sample for determining anionic concentrations an acidified sample with hno3 reduced to ph 2 for determination of cationic concentrations sharma 2013 samples from the three geothermal wells in the unai region were collected after purging out for 15 min purging was done in order to prevent the water from changes like temperature escape or dissolution of different gases oxidation biological activity precipitation of metals reactions with well casing etc which may result into the alteration of composition koterba et al 1995 the parameter such as temperature electric conductivity ec and ph were measured in the field immediately after sampling using a multi parameter series meter preservation of samples was critical in order to reduce the rate of any biological or chemical reactions after collecting the samples these were evaluated in the laboratory where all the chemical tests were carried out in order to obtain concentration values shah et al 2015 2017 2018a 2018b sircar et al 2015 standard apha methods were used to determine the concentration of chloride sulphate fluoride calcium magnesium hco3 boron arsenic iron magnesium silica lead and nickel apha 2012 inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms has been used for the analysis of strontium cesium rubidium and barium to determine the sodium and potassium content flame photometric and edta method was used armijo 2012 the limits of detection for all the instruments are 1 μ l to 1 mg l analytical precision for major ions was within 1 for all water samples ion balance errors ibe were 10 and most of them were 5 calculation of subsurface temperature is an important application of surface water geochemical analysis geothermometry is an exploration technique which can help us to predict temperature of the geothermal system and monitor temperature change in the reservoir during production powell and cumming 2010 wishart 2015 geothermometry can also help to understand the chemical state of recharging water as a result of the effect of temperature and pressure bruhn et al 2011 in this study solute geo thermometers such as silica and cations were used to estimate the temperature of the geothermal reservoir following equations were used based on their applicability a fournier

pi were calculated to check if the obtained geothermal water can be utilized for irrigational purposes shah et al 2018a 2018b corrosion irrigation water quality indices and saturation indices and equation for categorizing the stability of the water used in the study are summarized in table 2 4 results and discussions various hydrochemical parameters of the samples collected from three distinct locations and their mean and standard deviation are as represented in the table 3 4 1 hydrochemical facies the hydrochemical evolution of spring water can be understood by plotting the major cations and anions in the piper tri linear diagram piper 1994 explained the classifications the type of water on the basis of its interaction with rock and aquifer minerals it has two separate trilinear plots of cations and anions respectively showing relative concentration of each other the diamond plot at the center is blended of two trilinear plots on two side of the diamond different quadrants of diamond show the different type of water on the basis of dominance in ion concentration as shown in fig 3 from the analysis of samples of water from unai it was found that two samples plot in na cl water field while one sampling indicating in ca so4 dominated water the change in ionic composition of samples might be result of two different water source temperature dependent dissolution precipitation of ions in their flow path mixing of surface water with underground aquifer or contamination by saline water or cement pollution as water is found rich in calcium sulphate todd 1980 sakram et al 2013 here u1 has a relatively higher concentration of ca and hco3 co3 2 and lower concentrations of na and cl as compared to that of u2 and u3 fig 4 so the temperature of later two might be higher than u1 as with increasing temperature co2 is liberated and so caco3 gets precipitated resulting in lesser ca2 and co3 2 hco3 concentration in u2 and u3 moreover with increasing temperature dissolution of nacl increases higher na and cl in u2 and u3 as shown by piper diagram also indicate the higher temperature as compared to sample 1 thus the temperature of u2 and u3 might be higher than that of u1 but there are many more factors playing role in altering quality of groundwater so various other interpretation can be drawn by calculating different indices and should be integrated to get the conclusion 4 2 geothermometry calculation estimation of reservoir temperature using hydrochemical facies is one of the most widely used techniques for reservoir temperature estimation analysis of temperature is done with the help of various mineral in the water sample whose equilibrium constant is dependent on temperature and pressure but the effect of temperature on the dissolution of mineral is much greater than that of pressure powell and cumming 2010 wishart 2015 not only temperature and pressure but the effect of reaction of one species reaction may affect another geothermometry can also help to understand the chemical state of recharging water as a result of the effect of temperature and pressure bruhn et al 2011 for the thermal waters of unai hot springs the ratio of hco3 cl is less than unity therefore it can be deduced that these thermal waters are fast ascending to the surface and are not mixed or only partially mixed with near surface groundwater giggenbach 1988 hence these thermal springs are the best candidates for the estimation of reservoir temperatures using chemical geothermometers based on the physiochemical parameters available for the thermal waters we have used silica and cation geothermometry table 4 shows the estimated reservoir temperature range of 65 82 c from silica geothermometry while cation geothermometry gives temperature range of 125 217 c both silica and cation geothermometers are showing the different value of reservoir temperature it could be due to the precipitation of silica from the thermal water during ascending to the surface or while lowering of the water temperature the reactions involving k na equilibrate at high temperature and do not adjust quickly to the physical environment at the shallow depths thus gives the over estimation of the reservoir temperature while reactions involving k mg equilibrate at low temperature giggenbach 1988 combined both na k and k mg thermometers and gave na k mg ternary diagram for estimating the reservoir temperature thus for a more accurate estimation of reservoir temperature thermal water of the study area was plotted in the na k mg ternary diagram fig 4 according to this diagram fig 4 the thermal water samples plot on the immature water field indicating re equilibrium mixing dilution or dissolution of minerals which are associated with cations to be the governing processes for this system na k mg ternary diagram was proposed by giggenbach 1988 it is the most widely used cation geo thermometry plot a ternary plot combining the sodium potassium na k geo thermometers with the potassium magnesium k mg geo thermometer this ternary diagram is used to determine the reservoir temperature and to recognize waters which have attained equilibrium with host lithology u1 u2 and u3 all fall near to the mg vertex indicating that the waters are partially equilibrated or mixed u1 and u2 lie below the immature water curve indicating an initial dissolution of minerals before equilibrium sets in water from well u3 lies in the partial equilibrated region suggesting that dissolution of minerals has taken place or the equilibrium reactions have set in but equilibrium has not been reached or the collected sample is a mixture of water that has reached equilibrium with a diluted unequilibrated water such as cold groundwater u1 and u2 are immature water suggesting that geo thermometry cannot be applied to this water study of sample from u3 gives a temperature of 60 80 c indicating that the field may qualify to be a low temperature geothermal system fig 4 4 3 hydrodynamic model of the study area the current theoretical comprehension of hydrodynamics in aqueous systems is presented in fig 5 this model has been developed based on the geophysical geochemical and surface temperature data the following paragraph illustrates the conceptual fluid flow model postulated for the present study level of fluid is regulated by the fluid flow model and the level is indicated by filling and emptying of water in the reservoir geothermal water may ascends from the geothermal reservoir and emerges at the surface as hot springs may cool on the way by conduction boiling or mixing with shallow groundwater or by any combination of this process the deep and shallow regions are linked with fault system vertical faults are found in the geology of the area at higher depth the rock resistivity increases and at shallow depth the fluid occurs in two stages or vapor dominated reservoir also the meteoric water moves downwards through faults or intrusive bodies to higher temperature region due to this downward movement of meteoric water the geothermal system is nourished to finish the fluid flow circle niaraq et al 2017 after this the heat and chemical exchange takes place and meteoric water is transfigured to high temperature nacl rich parent geothermal fluid which has two components namely meteoric water and magmatic fluid this fluid finally moves upwards to the earth surface designed as hot springs this upward movement is regulated by pressure and density differences kiryukhin et al 2003 4 4 suitability for industry water is the basic necessity for any industrial processes geothermal water which is available at higher temperature can be used directly for the processes but we need to check as water often experience corrosion or scaling several indices are calculated to judge the reliability of the water on scaling and corrosion problems 4 4 1 ph the table 3 shown here presents the value of ph ranging from 7 86 to 8 38 according to the bureau of indian standard bis 201 2724 4251 6582etc 1991 the desirable limit of ph is 8 2 out of the samples collected sample 1 has the ph value slightly greater than the desirable limit while the other two samples fall within the sensible limit of the bis standard and are able to be used in the industry for distinct motives 4 4 2 sulphate the sulphate ion is the second most occurring ion in the hard water after bicarbonate the origin of the sulphate ion can be natural or it can occur from municipal and industrial discharges one of the main reasons regarding the problems caused by sulphate ion is that it possesses the potential to form strong acids that result in the change of ph for industrial units such as sugar production and concrete manufacturing the sulphate ion concentration ought to be minimized below 20 mg l desirable limit of the sulphate ion as stated by bis 201 2724 4251 6582etc 1991 is 250 mg l from the table 3 it is clearly observed that the samples are in the range of the desirable limit 4 4 3 fluoride fluoride ion contains fluorine element the most reactive non metallic element the chief complication in using fluoride compounds is that it causes corrosion of piping and other water treatment equipment nollet 2000 the desired limit of the fluoride ion for industrial usage as given by bis 201 2724 4251 6582etc 1991 is 1 mg l the table 3 depicts that none of the samples fall under this limit as the content is very high one of the reasons for such high values can be the leaching of soil hence to utilize the water for industrial purpose the water needs to be pre treated 4 4 4 chloride chlorides are the salts that are produced from the combination of chlorine gas with metal e g sodium chloride nacl magnesium chloride mgcl2 etc like fluorides chloride ions also corrode the materials it also has an impact on the taste of food products jagadeesh et al 2012 the limit of the chloride concentration is set to 200 mg l however all the samples collected possess very high content of chloride excess chloride content is likely to increase corrosion rate of steel and aluminium solution to this can be use of copper galvanized steel and cast iron pipes attributing their property to high resistance to salt water corrosion but exposure over time can still cause damage thus before planning the strategies for exploitation of groundwater at unai for industrial purpose care for controlling tds especially na and cl ions has to be taken into account shah et al 2018a 2018b 4 4 5 langelier saturation index lsi langelier saturation index langelier 1936 is associated with the conditions at which water and calcium carbonate are in equilibrium it is the calculation of solution s ability to dissolve or precipitate calcium carbonate and it is employed as an indicator of the corrosiveness and its saturation with respect to calcium carbonate langelier 1936 lsi is related to the accumulation of calcium carbonate film or scale this accumulation can be harmful as it insulates pipes process equipment and other components of the system from coming in relation with water water cycle manual 1999 the values of lsi are observed as 1 64 0 06 and 0 56 respectively for sample 1 sample 2 and sample 3 table 5 it can be said from the values that the water of sample 1 is very poor as the value of lsi is 0 the water of sample 2 and sample 3 has a very good quality as compared to that of sample 1 hence it can be concluded that the samples collected are super saturated with respect to carbonate as a result of which sample 1 may form thick layer of scale while sample 2 and sample 3 may form an eggshell like film of caco3 which behaves as an inhibitor film for corrosion of any metal use in the process equipment awatif et al 2014 4 4 6 ryznar stability index rsi ryznar stability index can sustain greater protection against corrosion and is also able to sustain higher ca hardness levels and higher ph levels rsi acts as the scale thickness monitoring index as the ca hardness reaches its maximum value the scale formation initiates which prevents the equipment from corrosion but this scale formation may result in the lower efficiency of the equipment the rsi values of the three samples are 5 10 7 74 and 7 01 respectively table 5 it can be concluded that for sample 1 the scale will be easily formed and corrosion will not take place in the equipment hadi 2010 but the efficiency of the equipment is reduced however in case of sample 2 and sample 3 the value of rsi is greater than 7 represents that calcium carbonate formation will not lead a protective corrosion inhibitor film alsaqqar et al 2014 4 4 7 puckorius or practical scaling index psi puckorius or practical scaling index psi additionally calibrates the relation between saturation state and scale formation by consolidating an estimate of buffering capacity of the water into the index puckorius 1983 a high calcite saturation level is observed if the water has high calcium concentration but less alkalinity and buffering capacity the calcium precipitated due to low buffering capacity results in the rapid decrease in ph there is a probability that the water may have high tendency to form scale due to driving force but the scale formed is of very less quantity the calculation of psi and lsi is almost equal except that in psi equilibrium ph is used instead of actual system ph the psi values of our collected samples are 6 69 9 60 and 8 90 respectively table 5 scale dissolving water activity is represented by psi value greater than 6 values of sample 2 and 3 have higher psi value which depicts the non scale forming activity and water is deficient in ions which are responsible for scale formation this result is in accordance with the rsi value 4 4 8 larson skold index ls larson skold index ls details about the corrosiveness of water towards mild steel the aggressiveness of cooling water containing sufficient buffering capacity and alkalinity is due to the increase in chloride and sulphate their presence also leads to the interference in the film formation the calculation of ls will not give correct results for the water possessing very high and very low alkalinity larson and skold 1958 the ls values of the collected samples are 2 95 15 09 and 13 54 respectively table 5 from the guidelines it can be interpreted that for all the samples the corrosion rates will be extremely high and there will not be any film formation very high value of ls and sulphate concentration being in permissible limits indicates that the chlorine content of the samples is way beyond the desirable limits alsaqqar et al 2014 hence by using such water the efficiency of the equipment used in the process decreases haritash et al 2016 4 5 suitability for irrigation india is an agricultural country it contributes to 15 18 of gdp of india in agriculture water is the foremost necessity for plant growth the plant growth is based on the quality of the water and concentration of different ions present so for utilization of water produced from geothermal well quality check is necessary different agricultural indices are calculated to find the suitability 4 5 1 ph this parameter of water has a noteworthy impact on the reactions and other parameters of the soil and water and hence on the plant growth the desirable range of ph is between 6 0 and 8 5to utilize it for irrigation ayers and westcot 1985 if the water is not in the desirable range and then it has to be first treated to take it for the irrigational use the ph of the collected samples is 8 38 7 86 and 8 12 table 3 all the samples have ph within the desirable range hence the water collected from the study area is reliable for irrigation purpose 4 5 2 electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds are the two important interlinked parameters for water quality index in irrigation tds is the measurement of the dissolved salts in water and the effect of dissolved salts on soil and crops ec is a measure of the degree in which water conducts electricity the ec of the collected samples are 1475 1840 and 1662 ds m respectively and the tds values are 998 1190 and 1114 ppm table 3 reddy 2013 the united states salinity laboratory provides the guideline for categorizing groundwater on ec and tds basis it is concluded that all the samples have very high salinity hazard which may cause serious damage to the plants therefore this water can t be used for irrigation purpose unless it is treated by appropriate processes lokesh and singh 2015 4 5 3 sodium absorption ratio sar an important water quality parameter known as sodium absorption ratio sar is used in the supervision of sodium affected soils it is the only parameter by which the appropriateness of water in irrigation is ascertained sappa et al 2014 water having higher sar is considered to be less suitable for irrigation as it leads to the long term detriment todd and mays 2005 the sar of the samples collected from the study area is 3 27 9 94 and 11 01 respectively table 6 sample 1 is the best sample from sar perspective but as its value is more than 3 regular soil tests have to be carried out however the sar of sample 2 and sample 3 are very high so by using such water for consecutive years ca and mg in the soil will be replaced by sodium ayers and westcot 1994 shaki and adeloye 2006 this leads to the decrease in infiltration permeability stable aggregates of soil and loss of soil structure richards 1954 thus it can be concluded that sodium ion concentration is high in sample 2 and 3 and needs to be decreased before utilization shah and mistry 2013 4 5 4 residual sodium carbonate rsc residual sodium carbonate rsc index of the water describes the alkalinity hazard for the soil the ca and mg precipitate if the concentration of carbonates and bicarbonates is more than that of ca and mg mirza et al 2017 this gives rise to the increase in sodium proportion in water in the form of sodium carbonate and this increase can be indicated by residual sodium carbonate rsc rsc indices of the given samples are 6 61 3 33 and 2 78 respectively table 6 negative value of rsc shows that carbonate and bicarbonate concentration is relatively low which also can be confirmed by the results of rsi and psi shah and mistry 2013 water from all the samples fall under 1st category so the water can be used for irrigation purpose on the basis of rsc index michael 1992 if the value of rsc is 2 5 meq l na adsorption takes place 4 5 5 kelly ratio kr and sodium percentage sp kelly and wilcox explained the hazardous impact of na on water quality for irrigation purpose by describing the terms kelly s ratio kr and sodium percentage sp kelly 1951 1963 shah and mistry 2013 the kr values of the samples are computed as 0 78 3 51 and 4 01 respectively table 6 the desirable range of kr is less than 1 kelly 1940 kelly index value 1 represents that concentration of the sodium should be nearly equal to the summation of calcium and magnesium making a perfect balance sample 1 has relatively low sodium concentration but sample 2 and sample 3 have high sodium ion content hence water of sample 1 can be used for irrigation purpose while that of sample 2 and sample 3 are not suitable for irrigation the sp values of the samples are 44 91 78 27 and 80 66 respectively table 6 wilcox diagram is used to govern the viability of the water that has to be used for irrigation purpose it is a plot of ec versus na wilcox 1948 from the given wilcox plot fig 6 it can be said that the sample 1 is safe for irrigation as its value is less than 50 while as the values of sp of sample 2 and sample 3 are more than 50 they can t be used in irrigation wilcox 1948 continuous irrigation with such water may result in the accumulation of na compared to divalent ions and this may lead to some adverse effects on soil like deterioration and also influences the sustainability of crop production in long term darwisha et al 2011 4 5 6 permeability index pi after a long term use of irrigation water soil permeability is drastically affected by na ca mg and bicarbonate contents present in the water doneen 1964 doneen s criterion to compute the quality of groundwater is given by permeability index and doneen s plot fig 7 doneen s plot is used to check the category under which the water sample falls it is a graph of permeability index versus total concentration of ion doneen 1964 the values of pi of the samples are 52 90 82 40 and 84 91 meq l table 6 according to the pre decided criteria fig 7 sample 2 and sample 3 fall under class 1 category 75 permeability and sample 1 fall under class 2 category 25 75 permeability no samples are observed to fall under class 3 category 25 permeability handa 1969 hence the water of sample 2 and sample 3 is considered to be appropriate for irrigation 5 conclusion water quality analysis is helpful in assessment and management of water quality for various direct and indirect geothermal applications the present investigation represents the first of its type undertaken on the unai geothermal region gujarat the case study provides valuable insight into the status of overall suitability of the unai geothermal water based on various water quality parameters after evaluating different parameters and indices for water quality it can be concluded that water may cause many problems when used for industrial and irrigational purpose however it can be used for various direct application purposes such as greenhouse fish farming crop cultivation and milk pasteurization lsi and rsi indices for the water sample from u2 sample 2 and u3 sample 3 reveals that they would form a thin scale layer which will help in corrosion protection thus they are better as compared to sample 1 sample 1 requires pre treatment before utilization due to the presence of high alkalinity fluoride and chloride content were way beyond the desirable limits as prescribed by bis standard ls showed that all the samples were incompatible because of imprudent chloride content so for industrial utilization purpose chloride and fluoride removal is very essential as they are the main cause of corrosion indices such as sar and rsc demonstrated that water collected from site is safe for the utilization in various irrigational purposes ssp and kr showed extremely high values which concludes that na concentration is very high which has also been the cause of high tds and conductivity hence for utilization of this water for irrigational purpose na concentration is compulsory to decrease thus the overall conclusion is that for the safe and relevant utilization of geothermal water ca2 ion concentration needs to be decreased slightly but cl f and na concentrations needs to be highly decreased however if the geothermal water undergoes pre treatment by appropriate methods then the geothermal water can be better used for direct and indirect applications acknowledgements the authors are grateful to school of petroleum
