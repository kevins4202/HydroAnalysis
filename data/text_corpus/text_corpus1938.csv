9690,crop models have been used for investigating crop responses to environmental stresses for decades the study objectives were to i calibrate and validate a simple crop model hybrid maize using in situ measured data from sixteen uniquely managed treatments as part of the university of nebraska lincoln testing ag performance solutions taps program in north platte ne and ii carry out sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation using a multi parameter optimization approach sixteen arable mark 1 sensors and thirty two mark 2 sensors arable labs inc san francisco ca collecting hourly and daily weather and crop information in 2019 and 2020 respectively were installed in the taps subsurface drip irrigation experimental plots which were planted with maize and subjected to different irrigation and nitrogen practices hybrid maize was used for simulating maize yield on the sixteen treatments in 2019 and 2020 sensitivity analysis showed that initial light use efficiency lue potential kernel filling rate g5 potential number of kernels per ear g2 growth respiration coefficient of grain grg empirical parameter determining the relative contribution of a soil layer to water uptake slw and maximum photosynthetic rate mpr were the most sensitive parameters to yield a novel multi parameter optimization mpo approach based on kriging was used for calibrating these six parameters and the best parameter sets which were later used for model validation calibration results showed that there seemed to be strong linear relationships between total water received wr and some of the parameters by using each year s mpo averages of the six parameters instead of default values me mae rmse urmse and nrmse were all reduced by about 69 66 60 27 and 61 respectively for validation treatments the advantage of using in situ sensors coupled with the suitability of the calibrated model for simulating maize yield under different irrigation management will make the model more useful in future field scale research with focus on developing decision support tools for in season crop management and yield forecasts keywords yield prediction irrigation hybrid maize multi parameter estimation in situ sensors 1 introduction the ability to do in season real time prediction monitoring and management of the growing crop is important for sustainable and profitable maize zea mays l production adeyemi et al 2017 liu et al 2018 gao et al 2017 crop models use simplified representations of physical processes to simulate crop growth and development as a function of soil weather and crop management variables kim et al 2012 although dynamic and process based crop models have been widely used as decision support tools for crop management in terms of water and nutrient application and for simulating yield at field level many of the model parameters are not directly measured this is because it is often difficult to determine their values due to the inherent spatio temporal variability in natural processes data measurement errors and cost of measurement bogena et al 2010 panda et al 2010 varella et al 2010 launay and guérif 2003 irmak et al 2001 ferreyra et al 2006 batchelor et al 2002 gabrielle et al 2002 tremblay and wallach 2004 as a result crop modeling is often based on information or data that are not representative of the case of interest which can lead to over or under predictions the goal of research for better accuracy of crop models has mostly been tied to the ability of models to simulate complex soil plant and weather processes while less emphasis has been placed on the representativeness of input data e g weather soil that vary spatially and temporally miguez et al 2012 hastings et al 2009 this could be because representativeness is a moot point given producers do not usually adopt site specific sensor platforms due to cost and time related issues most producers do not see an economic need for installing in situ sensors in their fields for example according to the united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda nass irrigation and water management survey from 2018 only 11 9 of farmers who irrigate used soil moisture sensors to schedule irrigation while 2 3 used plant moisture sensors usda nass 2018 however there is a great need for producers to make more accurate decisions in the field to save input costs and maximize profits when it comes to developing decision support systems using near real space or near real time data or a combination of both depends largely on the purposes for processing the data in the first instance in many cases crop growth and yield simulation involve processing long term historical and archived data and space distance from weather station to area of interest or time is not so critical conversely accurate in season decisions need to be made in the field using in situ sensors and within a short time to be of value in this paper we define near real space time data as the data from in situ i e near real space sensors with collection interval and processing time in minutes or few hours instead of seconds i e near real time precise and localized information is highly valuable in scheduling and executing agricultural management practices such as irrigation and applications of fertilizers and pesticides egea et al 2017 yadav et al 2010 nansen et al 2015 faiçal et al 2014 kim et al 2000 however while soil spatial variability is most likely known by farmers this is less so with weather variables which can greatly vary in space and time most notably rainfall rodriguez and mejia 1974 whereas soil variability sampling may only be required ranging from every year to every ten years depending on the nutrient crop type crop rotation and soil texture warncke 2013 ferguson and hergert 2000 daily or hourly weather data is required in crop modeling to track and predict growth dynamics from planting to maturity chaulagain et al 2020 ramos et al 2017 togliatti et al 2017 and the daily or hourly values of weather variables are usually based on averages e g relative humidity wind speed solar radiation mean air temperature and accumulation e g rainfall for example evapotranspiration et is one of the major components in soil plant atmosphere continuum spac that requires accurate tracking due to its vital role in determining crop water consumption and requirement in irrigated agriculture althoff et al 2019 djaman et al 2018 ji et al 2017 irmak et al 2005 the accuracy of tracking crop et with a reference et method during a growing season is dependent on the robustness of the reference et model used and the proper use of crop coefficients with the reference et model moreover et model robustness is a function of the type of model whether radiation based temperature based or a combination of both and the temporal resolution at which the input variables are measured e g from monthly values for hargreaves method to daily values for priestly taylor method and to half hourly values for eddy covariance technique liu et al 2017 although having accurate weather information is extremely important in crop modeling and yield forecasting this is not easily accessible and most times users of crop models depend on data collected from weather stations that can be many kilometers away from areas of interest the distance and terrain between a weather station and a field can affect the representation of the weather inputs used in simulating crop yield of the field peña quiñones et al 2019 prakash et al 2019 dai et al 2017 girons lopez et al 2015 mishra 2013 piyush et al 2012 for instance rainfall can be localized and the microclimate of a field which is a local set of atmospheric conditions e g rainfall temperature humidity wind and turbulence heat balance and evaporation may slightly or substantially differ from those at a nearby weather station remote sensing has the potential to provide many input data for crop modeling and satellite based sensing seems to be the only realistic solution for a decision support system for maize production due to its large spatial coverage coupled with thin profit margins and declining on farm incomes mo et al 2005 dente et al 2008 liang and qin 2008 however weather and soil data collected via satellites have some problems coarse spatial scale they are hundreds of meters across rather than tens of meters and large time intervals between earth passes and sometimes ill timed cloud cover gao et al 2015 thus the fusion of satellite data weather stations and in situ sensors holds the key to the future of agriculture both in terms of better yield simulation accuracy and management aid luo et al 2018 in order to lay a good foundation for using fused data in crop modeling there is need to test and validate the robustness of in situ internet of things iot sensors that can handle real time continuous visibility and in field crop monitoring since we decided to use local in situ data instead of satellite or weather station data in a crop model arable mark sensors arable labs inc san francisco ca were selected because they combine hourly and daily weather data as well as plant measurements about 40 agro climatic variables which are all remotely available mark 2 is an upgrade of mark 1 for this study the hybrid maize model v2016 yang et al 2004 2016 was chosen because it is simple fast and uses relatively fewer input data in comparison to other process based crop models such as the agricultural production systems simulator apsim holzworth et al 2014 erosion productivity impact calculator epic williams 1995 and decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat hoogenboom et al 2010 although hybrid maize model assumes optimal nutrient supply without allowing the assessment of different options for nutrient management it has been widely used in maize crop modeling studies and results have shown that it has reliable performance in simulating maize yield at a field scale grassini et al 2009 2011 yang et al 2013 gibson et al 2017 specifically in the united states corn belt nevertheless it is important to analyze the sensitivity of the model parameters and also calibrate and validate them for an area of interest in order to reduce uncertainty in simulation varella et al 2010 wallach et al 2001 in our study combining the simplicity and reliability of the hybrid maize model with the near real space time precision of in situ arable mark sensors was hypothesized to be an advantage for reducing yield simulation errors associated with dynamic atmospheric and crop processes this is because having multiple arable marks in a field allows the capture of spatial variability within a field which is at a higher spatial and temporal resolution than coarse satellite data therefore the aim of this study was to use in situ sensors and measured data from sixteen uniquely managed treatments to 1 identify the most sensitive model parameters using a novel parameter estimation approach and 2 quantify the dependence of model parameters on seasonal water input i e precipitation plus irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments different combinations of irrigation and nitrogen n fertilizer application rates were examined in sixteen maize treatments in 2019 and 2020 at the university of nebraska lincoln west central research extension and education center wcrec in north platte nebraska latitude 41 09º n longitude 100 77º w elevation 863 m a s l the experimental treatments were uniquely managed by various growers different for both years as part of the university of nebraska lincoln testing ag performance solutions taps program henceforth referred to as unltaps the unltaps program hosts farm management competitions where growers compete in the production and marketing of a crop with contestants evaluated on yield input use efficiency profitability etc each team was provided three plots i e three replicates of one treatment and within a randomized complete block experimental design at wcrec fig 1 each plot was 4 5 m wide 6 rows by 49 m long in a north south orientation for both 2019 and 2020 same experimental layout and blocks were used but with different randomization of the plots the soil is a well drained cozad silt loam with a ph of 7 9 and a bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 for 0 20 cm soil depth on average organic matter content available phosphorus and available potassium contents of 0 20 cm soil depth were 3 7 292 mg kg 1 and 633 mg kg 1 with standard deviations of 0 3 67 mg kg 1 and 63 mg kg 1 respectively in 2019 the cultivar planted was pioneer 1197amt comparative relative maturity crm 111 days the plots were sown on may 13 2019 and may 1 2020 at 5 cm depth row spacing of 76 cm and at a population of 84 000 seeds ha 1 a subsurface drip irrigation sdi system was used to water and fertigate the plots where each treatment was individually controlled and monitored the sdi system consists of rivulis d5000 pc driplines installed every 76 cm at a depth of 33 cm each producer team scheduled their irrigation and was allowed to apply up to 12 7 mm per event four times a week each producer team was also allowed to select the amount of pre plant and or in season via side dress and or fertigation n fertilizer in the form of urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 for both 2019 and 2020 all treatments and competitions received a baseline 46 8 l ha 1 of starter fertilizer 10 34 0 at the time of planting this was available in all competitions and was applied using a double coulter liquid applicator at 2 54 cm depth and a distance of 12 7 cm on both sides of the planted row side dress n fertilizer was available for contestants and was applied at the ground surface neighboring each crop row using 360 y drop 360 yield center morton il fertigation was applied through the sdi system directly into the contestants plots from a calibration tube using a constant rate injection pump maximum application of n was limited to a total of 202 kg ha 1 for pre plant 202 kg ha 1 for side dress and 34 kg ha 1 for each fertigation event pre plant side dress v4 v6 and four fertigation events v9 v12 vt r1 and r2 were available to the participants the control treatment for 2019 received no irrigation and no n fertilizer while that of 2020 received a season total of 171 kg ha of n fertilizer as the unltaps research was conducted as part of the taps farm management competition there was a restriction to their experimental protocol as such the taps team decided to change the control plot protocol by including n fertilizer in 2020 however this change in control treatment protocol did not affect the research objectives and results of our study the total irrigation amount of water irrigation plus precipitation and n fertilizer applied across contestants are reported in table 1 weeds pests and diseases were managed uniformly for the entire field this field provided a dataset including both a high level of monitoring and a large number of treatments reflecting producer practices 2 2 data and measurements one in situ iot sensor arable mark 1 was installed in one replicate of all the sixteen treatments block a in 2019 while two arable mark 2 sensors were installed in each replicate in 2020 all the sensors were installed at a height of 1 8 m above ground level and later moved from 1 8 m to 4 9 m after the crops reached 0 9 m height these sensors provided hourly weather and crop data throughout the growing season the weather and crop dataset includes air temperature atmospheric pressure precipitation photosynthetically active radiation par global solar radiation relative humidity leaf ground temperature seven spectrometer data bands 1 7 and chlorophyll content hourly and sub hourly data were analyzed checked for consistency and aggregated or re processed to daily weather input data for the hybrid maize model the weather and crop data were collected at a high level of accuracy thus providing an opportunity to test the overall performance of hybrid maize model at plot scale using in situ sensor data missing data between 0 and 2 of daily weather data in a sensor was filled with the combined averages of remaining sensors with data while missing data across all sensors 12 of daily weather data during the season were filled with linear regressions of combined averages of sensors and the north platte 3sw beta awdn station nebraska mesonet nem https mesonet unl edu which is 0 5 km from the unltaps plots missing daily precipitation data for 2019 and 2020 across all sixteen treatments was filled using precipitation data from nem daily reference et data for both 2019 and 2020 which is an input for hybrid maize was also used from this weather station at harvest four rows per treatment were harvested for yield estimation table 1 all yields are reported at 15 5 moisture content 2 3 hybrid maize model configuration as stated the aim of this study was to use hybrid maize model with its minimum requirements for crop and field management input to simulate yield on sixteen treatments with different irrigation managements over two growing seasons using weather data from in situ sensors the specific intention was to explore whether biases would emerge and if these biases could be reduced by a simple correction required input data included daily weather data minimum and maximum air temperature ºc solar radiation mj m 2 relative humidity precipitation mm and reference et mm planting date hybrid maturity i e total gdd to silking and maturity plant population as well as irrigation dates and amount and soil texture and bulk density 2 4 calibration and validation in order to improve the predictive performance of our hybrid maize model we split the sixteen treatments for each year into calibration and validation datasets although different combinations of irrigation and total n were applied to the treatments at the discretion of the contestants splitting was done based only on the total irrigation applied this is because initial regression analyses of the influence of both total water received wr and total n applied showed that wr received alone accounted for 69 of the total yield variation while total n alone accounted for only 1 fig 2 for each growing season the sixteen treatments were divided into calibration 50 and validation 50 treatments using exemplar based agglomerative clustering brusco et al 2019 with wr and yield as inputs similarity for each cluster was based on the negative squared euclidean distance of the inputs and the shared value was 20 quantile of the input similarities calibration treatments were randomly selected from each cluster based on cluster sizes to ensure that the ranges of wr were covered it is worth noting that using treatments with similar ranges of wr for calibration and validation would help minimize the effects of data discrepancies due to different irrigation and precipitation depths as well as yield values 2 5 model sensitivity analysis fourteen model parameters were chosen for sensitivity analysis using both one at a time oat sensitivity and global sensitivity analysis gsa for comparison purposes sensitivity analysis was conducted using the weather data of the control plot s2 in 2019 since its wr and yield 536 mm and 14 2 mg ha respectively are closest to the overall averages of wr and yield 500 mm and 14 8 mg ha respectively for combined 2019 and 2020 seasons for oat the model parameters were tested with changes prescribed at 5 10 15 and 20 of the default values the slope of the relative percentage change of simulated yield versus the percentage change of parameter value was used to assess the sensitivity of the model to these parameters the larger the slope the more sensitive the yield was to that parameter for gsa the top eight parameters with the largest slopes were selected in order to further identify and prioritize the most influential parameters by considering their sensitivities across the whole input space two gsa approaches were used forward stepwise selection multiple linear regression and variance based sobol method for forward stepwise gsa which is based on linear regression 100 random sets of the eight top parameters with 30 limits of variation from default model values were first generated hybrid maize model was then run with these 100 sets of eight parameters and the yield values were recorded forward stepwise selection was later used to select model parameters in decreasing order of relative importance based on their akaike information criterion aic values and starting with the most influential parameter till the stepwise selection procedure was terminated aic is based on penalty in order to balance the goodness of fit of a model and the number of input parameters the terminating step indicated that adding extra parameters would not increase model performance since sobol gsa could handle nonlinear responses and estimate the effect of interactions in non additive systems the monte carlo estimation of sobol indices based on sobol et al 2007 and saltelli et al 2010 was also used to estimate the total sobol gsa indices for hybrid maize model parameters the sobol2007 function in sensitivity package https cran r project org web packages sensitivity was implemented in r r development core team 2007 using 10 000 simulations 2 6 multi parameter optimization and model calibration based on the number of the most sensitive parameters selected and the order of selection during sensitivity analysis hybrid maize model was then calibrated using a novel multi parameter optimization mpo technique hybrid maize model currently does not have a built in or standalone multi parameter calibration tool therefore in order to produce and analyze results of tens of thousands of yield simulations all at once in a multi dimensional multi parameter space we developed an mpo based on kriging using steps of pairwise combinations of the most sensitive parameters and yield kriging was used in surfer 16 software golden software llc with the wave model variogram although the use of kriging as a spatial gridding method has been proven useful and popular in many geoscience fields our study was the first to our knowledge to use this geostatistical technique for mpo and parameter calibration in a crop modeling study surfer 16 uses a highly optimized algorithm for calculating the node maize yield in our case values the wave model variogram component in surfer was chosen for kriging because it provided the best yield grids with the best cross validation results the following steps were later used for creating and evaluating the yield grids for every calibration treatment in 2019 and 2020 step 1 selection of the first two most sensitive parameters step 2 creation of input data for gridding by running hybrid maize 49 times with different combinations of the two parameters in step 1 while keeping other sensitive parameters at default values the resulting yield values from these 49 simulations and their corresponding input parameter pairs were considered as new observations for kriging interpolation step 3 creation of the yield grid using wave hole effect variogram model component for each pair of sensitive parameters based on grid spacing the yield grid had 8900 nodes i e 8900 yield values which was equivalent to running hybrid maize model 8900 times step 4 cross validation to check the accuracy of the interpolation at the 49 input nodes based on the variogram model step 5 selection of a small random subset n 30 of kriged yield nodes on the interpolated grid to compare the overall accuracy of the kriging process with actual hybrid maize model yield simulations the selected thirty kriged yield values and their corresponding parameter pair values from the grid were compared with yields simulated with hybrid maize using the same thirty pairs of parameters as inputs in order to assess how well the kriged yield values compared to hybrid maize predicted yield values this number n 30 represented a threshold above which the sample size i e number of nodes was no longer considered small statistically we ensured that none of the selected thirty nodes was a subset of the initial 49 input or new observations values it is noteworthy to state here that for any given pair of sensitive model parameters from step 1 above there is an uncertainty in parameter calibration i e selecting the overall best pair of parameters from the 8900 pairs due to equifinality of models this is because there exist various combinations of these two parameters i e equal pathways which could give the exact observed maize yield i e finality for any given experimental plot or treatment although there are other types and sources of uncertainty in any scientific modeling beside model parameters e g model inputs model structure performance metrics initial and boundary conditions and internal fluxes however our study only focused on model parameters therefore to reduce the uncertainty due to equifinality of models and also to avoid overfitting the models we developed an mpo methodology to minimize the difference between simulated and observed yields based on a specified set of constraints that a pair of parameters had to satisfy mathematically the mpo is expressed as arg min a b y sim y obs subject to 0 92 y obs y sim 1 08 y obs a 0 85 a def 1 15 a def b 0 85 b def 1 15 b def where the optimal input parameter argument represents the a b pair or pairs that minimizes or minimize the value of the objective function y sim y obs with the added constraints y sim is the simulated yield in mg ha 1 y obs is the observed yield in kg ha 1 a and b are the optimized model parameters a def and b def are the default model parameters the first mpo constraint that the simulated yields lie in the interval between 8 of the observed yield was based on the fact that only four rows per treatment were harvested for both yield and moisture content estimation since scaling the yield estimates from the harvested areas to the full plot areas or a typical center pivot area of 50 ha would introduce some uncertainties to yield estimation we therefore assumed that the true yield values would lie between 8 of the observed yield in addition the constraints that a and b values lie in the interval between 15 of default values a def and b def were based on the premise that the default values in the hybrid maize model had already been calibrated and validated across a wide range of environments in the corn belt in the united states liu et al 2015 yang et al 2004 grassini et al 2009 hence there was no need to allow the parameters to go beyond the upper and lower limits of their constraints the a b pairs if there existed more than one pair after sensitivity analysis that minimized the value of the objective function based on the constraints were averaged for each calibration treatment these average a b values for each of the 16 calibration treatments eight calibration treatments per year were also averaged and used as new default parameter values to calibrate the next two most sensitive parameters by repeating all the previous five steps this was done until all the sensitive pairs of parameters had been used in gridding and mpo model validation was carried out by transferring both the single non seasonal re calibrated parameter set combined and aggregated for both years and the two seasonal re calibrated parameter sets separate sets for 2019 and 2020 to the 16 validation treatments 2 7 model performance and assessment previous studies have used different statistics to assess and compare the performance of crop model results with observed yield franz et al 2020 liu et al 2015 in our study the performance of different re calibrated parameters in hybrid maize model was compared to the default parameters using five evaluation statistics including mean error me mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse unbiased root mean square error urmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse 1 me 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 4 urmse 1 n i 1 n p i bias o i 2 5 nrmse rmse sd obs 6 sd obs 1 n i 1 n o i o i 2 where n is the number of crop yield data points in the validation dataset o i and p i are the observed and predicted crop yield of the i th data point respectively sd obs is the standard deviation of the observations and o i is the mean of observations 3 results and discussions 3 1 comparison of weather data fig 3 shows that there were strong similarities between the meteorological data from both unltaps sensors and nem weather station in 2020 however for 2019 which was a wetter year see precipitation graph in fig 3 there were marked differences in the observed solar radiation and relative humidity at the nem weather station and the unltaps study site it is important to state here that we did not expect the nem and the unltaps sensors to totally agree most especially because the microclimates of the nem weather station and our unltaps experimental site are different in 2019 and 2020 due to differences in soil types crop cover localized effect of precipitation nem and unltaps are 0 5 km apart and the irrigation treatments applied at unltaps study site also our comparison between nem and unltaps weather data fig 3 does not imply that unltaps sensors are better than nem sensors in terms of accuracy rather it lends support to the argument that using in situ weather information as model inputs could lead to lower modeling errors especially in a wet year like 2019 little differences in precipitation relative humidity and its derivative vapor pressure deficit could add up to large errors in reference evapotranspiration calculations as well as in actual evapotranspiration calculations in hybrid maize model which is based on daily soil moisture balance for 2019 with more than double of the precipitation in 2020 536 mm and 229 mm respectively and possibly more cloud cover the difference between nem and unltaps solar radiation measurements could possibly be due to the reason that both nem and unltaps pyranometers might not have the same response and calibration over the waveband for solar radiation at the ground level nem pyranometer uses a silicon photovoltaic li cor sensor and as stated by unsworth 2005 this type of pyranometer detects only a small fraction of the spectral range and so should be used only in unobstructed global radiation i e not for diffuse or reflected radiation unless they are specifically recalibrated for such measurements against a thermopile pyranometer since the aim of our study was to use in situ sensors and measured data from sixteen uniquely managed treatments per growing season therefore based on the aforementioned reason for the divergence of 2019 solar radiation data coupled with the fact the data driven models developed by arable labs inc are supported by a global network of 30 calibration validation sites that cover twelve climatic zones and ensure accurate reliable data we used the solar radiation data from mark 1 2019 and mark 2 2020 in our study the relative humidity graph for 2019 shows that above 75 intercept of the 2019 trendline and 1 1 line nem had higher relative humidity and below 75 nem had lower values this could be due to variability of microclimate including factors such as air and soil temperature regimes evapotranspiration and soil moisture at the two locations owing to the reason that 2019 growing season was a lot wetter and colder than 2020 season and that the nem station was located on mowed rainfed grass 0 5 km from the irrigated unltaps plots relative humidity would tend to be higher over irrigated plots than rainfed grass on arid days during dry periods but more similar otherwise it is worthy to add that differences in sensor response and or calibration could be present as well with respect to precipitation the 2019 growing season received more than two times of the precipitation in 2020 the total precipitation during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons were 536 mm and 229 mm respectively as shown in fig 3 there were stronger similarities between the cumulative precipitation for both unltaps and nem station in the drier 2020 season when compared to 2019 which was a much wetter season since precipitation measured at unltaps by both mark 1 used in 2019 and mark 2 used in 2020 is detected through an acoustic disdrometer in comparison to the nem rain gauge which uses a tipping bucket the greater divergence in wetter 2019 season could probably be attributed mostly to the response and calibration between the nem rain gauge and the older mark 1 sensors mark 2 is an upgrade angulo martinez et al 2018 tokay 2013 wmo 2009 moreover since the distance between the unltaps treatments and nem station is about 0 5 km the spatial variability of precipitation more pronounced in wetter 2019 season than 2020 could also have contributed significantly to the differences in cumulative precipitation between unltaps and nem fig 3 this spatial variability is highly dependent on the type of precipitation event emmanuel et al 2012 some studies have shown that there could be up to 100 variability between rain gauges within 0 5 km of each other jensen and pedersen 2005 while others have demonstrated up to 26 or more variability between rain gauges within 250 m of each other pedersen et al 2010 3 2 clustering results fig 4 shows the results from exemplar based agglomerative clustering the total water received and yield were the two clustering inputs in fig 4 top each color corresponds to a cluster and the prototypical data point exemplar of each cluster is marked by a box while all cluster members are connected to their exemplars with lines results show that there were only two clusters for both years in the similarity matrices on fig 4 bottom the treatments are clustered based on pairwise negative euclidean distances a euclidean distance is the length of a straight line joining two points or treatments and it is calculated by using the pythagorean theorem based on the cartesian coordinates of the points a negative euclidean distance of indicates absolute dissimilarity while a treatment pair is considered to be more similar if the negative euclidean distance is closer to zero for any treatment pair a lighter color e g light yellow indicates high similarity while a darker color e g red indicates low similarity in general due to higher precipitation in 2019 the euclidean distances were almost ten times smaller than those of drier 2020 season which had more yield variability in 2019 highly irrigated treatments 8 and 9 had the least similarity to treatment 2 which was the control treatment likewise treatment 16 in 2020 had the least similarity with respect to treatment 11 control treatment based on the clustering results in fig 4 the calibration and validation treatments for both 2019 and 2020 were selected from each cluster as shown in table 2 bigger clusters had more treatments selected in order to split the sixteen treatments into two similar sets for both 2019 and 2020 owing to the reason that total water received explained about 69 of yield variation fig 2 we ensured that treatments with the lowest and highest total irrigation amounts were evenly distributed between the calibration and validation sets this resulted in similar sets which covered the full range of wr in both years to compare the calibration and validation sets the minimums means maximums and standard deviations of wr and yield were calculated as shown in table 2 in 2019 the standard deviations for wr for both calibration and validation sets were 40 mm and 39 mm respectively while the standard deviations for yield for both calibration and validation sets were 1 0 mg ha and 0 8 mg ha respectively in 2020 the standard deviations for wr for both calibration and validation sets were 98 mm and 94 mm respectively while the standard deviations for yield for both calibration and validation sets were 2 7 mg ha as shown in table 2 only one treatment s16 in drier 2020 season received more wr 603 mm than the control treatment s2 in 2019 3 3 sensitivity analysis of model parameters table 3 shows the results of the oat and gsa based on the sensitivity slopes the oat approach showed that the initial light use efficiency lue the potential kernel filling rate g5 and the potential number of kernels per ear g2 all had slope values above 0 50 in decreasing order of sensitivity these three parameters were followed by growth respiration coefficient of grain grg the empirical parameter determining the relative contribution of a soil layer to water uptake slw and maximum photosynthetic rate mpr with slopes of 0 26 0 19 and 0 13 respectively based on a sensitivity analysis of the hybrid maize model that was conducted using 17 year mean weather data for lincoln nebraska yang et al 2004 also observed that grain yields were most sensitive to changes in lue g5 and g2 all of which increased yield with increasing values results for stepwise gsa also showed similar order of importance when compared to oat with lue being the most sensitive parameter followed by g5 and g2 the only difference was that whereas the oat approach showed equal sensitivity for both g5 and g2 the gsa approach based on stepwise selection selected g5 before g2 starting with lue and terminating at mpr the stepwise gsa selected only six model parameters before termination with every successive parameter selection making the model better as shown by the decreasing aic values in table 3 since a lower aic value indicates a better model this implies that a model with only lue aic 51 24 as the sensitive parameter is not as good as a model with both lue and g5 aic 22 27 similarly a model with the six most sensitive parameters aic 47 69 is also better than a model with only five top parameters aic 43 47 the fact that the stepwise selection terminated after selecting the sixth parameter showed that adding extra parameters after the sixth parameter would not improve the model performance sobol gsa showed similar results to both stepwise gsa and oat although with a slight difference in the order of importance for slw and grg table 3 shows that the sobol total global sensitivity index for slw 0 07 is greater than that for grg 0 04 3 4 multi parameter optimization with kriging the yield nodes from kriging and their corresponding parameter pairs lue g 5 g 2 grg slw mpr were used for calibrating the model via mpo since the mpo was done it a pairwise and stepwise approach for the sake of visualization only the 3 d yield surfaces for the top four sensitive parameters lue g 5 and g 2 grg are shown in figs 5 and 6 for both 2019 and 2020 growing seasons in addition figs 5 and 6 only show four of the eight calibration treatments for each year in increasing wr and the treatments were selected to cover the range of wr it is worth noting that similar yield surfaces could be created for slw mpr pair using its 8900 yield nodes however for the sake of brevity and since slw and mpr had the least sensitivity the yield surfaces for this pair were not presented here as shown by the red contour lines in figs 5 and 6 there are many nodes or combinations of lue g 5 and g 2 grg pairs that can give the exact observed yield for any treatment in fact there are even more combinations that fall within the two black contour lines which are the 8 yield error margins the black squares show the simulated yields using the default parameters the white squares show the simulated yields using the local mpo parameters i e using the best parameters per treatment and the red squares show the simulated yields using the regional mpo parameters i e using combined 2 year averages of all local mpo parameters for the calibration treatments missing red and black contour lines in fig 6 are outside the boundaries of the yield surfaces irrespective of the parameter pair in consideration each yield surface shown in figs 5 and 6 is unique for each treatment however there appears to be similarities in shapes and yield distributions for the four 2019 wet year treatments in fig 5a and the two 2020 dry year highly irrigated treatments s6 and s13 in fig 5b this is also true for the yield surfaces in fig 6a and b it is worth noting that whereas the positions of the default and the regional parameter pairs are unchanged in the parameter space across all calibration treatments the position of the local mpo pair white square is shifting upwards i e both values increasing relative to default and regional pairs with increasing wr for lue g 5 pair based on the three mpo constraints there are no local mpo lue g 5 pairs for the water deficit calibration treatments s5 and s15 in 2020 since no node meets all the three constraints fig 5b using only the yield constraint without the parameter constraints would lead to model overfitting and overfitting the hybrid maize model for a water deficit treatment e g s5 and s15 in 2020 would result in new re calibrated parameter values that are too high and too far from the default parameter values in the model since all the default model parameters in hybrid maize had already been calibrated for the us corn belt this would lead to a wrong inference that water deficit in the drier 2020 growing season would lead to both higher lue and g5 i e the re calibrated lue and g5 for both s5 and s15 in fig 5b would lie in between their respective black curves and lower crop yield this is contrary to our expectation that water deficit should reduce lue g5 and crop yield lue refers to the gross assimilation at extremely low light intensity while rue refers to the rate of net biomass production per unit of intercepted light par of global radiation averaged over a season it is important to point out that although lue is often referred to as radiation use efficiency rue in some studies and they have the same unit they are different in relation to hybrid maize model lue for maize is 12 5 g co2 mj 1 par or 9 375 g ch2o mj 1 par whereas typical rue for maize is 3 8 g ch2o mj 1 par furthermore rue is affected by all factors that affect photosynthetic rate whereas lue is supposed to be very conservative due to the conservative nature of lue crop models that use lue approach e g hybrid maize world food studies simulation model wofost do not recommend changing its value unless there are valid justifications however similar to previous extensive studies on the effect of irrigation management on rue which observed that water deficit reduce rue and crop yield ullah et al 2019 cosentino et al 2014 2016 patanè and cosentino 2013 our results also suggest that lue i e gross assimilation could be higher than the default value and be dependent on the wr at different growth stages fig 7 according to arora and gajri 2000 reduction in gross assimilation is directly proportional to the degree of water stress the lue result for dry year 2020 fig 7 bottom left shows that low wr drought stress during the pre and post silking stages of corn could reduce lue and lower lue values could consequently lead to reduced photosynthetic rates which tend to have effect on corn grain yield for g5 and g2 which are both potentials and are highly correlated with wr see fig 5 and the r2 values for g5 and g2 in figs 7 and 8 previous studies have also shown that an increase in irrigation produced higher kernel number per ear moosavi 2012 lack et al 2008 ghadiri and majidian 2003 in a dry year low wr drought stress during grain fill could reduce g5 which could subsequently cause lightweight grains or kernel abortion while a drought free grain fill period can maximize the yield potential of a crop g2 is strongly affected by the growing environment and agronomic management thus low wr drought stress during the early to mid vegetative stages of corn in a dry year could affect potential ear size through a reduction in the g2 results shown in figs 6a and 8 indicate that there appears to be a strong but negative linear relationship between grg and wr in a wet growing season while there is no significant relationship between them in a very dry year with low wr values the negative relationship between grg and wr implies that if wr increases less g carbohydrate g ch2o would be lost during the conversion for accumulation of 1 g grain dry matter in other words the growth of 1 g grain dry matter would require less total carbohydrate with increasing wr since slw mpr was the least sensitive parameter pair there were no significant relationships between wr and both parameters with their pre silking and post silking r2 values less than 0 3 data not shown figs 7 and 8 show the linear relationships between wr during pre silking and post silking stages as well as during the full growing seasons in 2019 and 2020 and the local mpo parameter values for individual calibration treatments values for two water stressed treatments s5 and s15 in 2020 were filled with regression equations while the control treatment s11 was excluded because it was an outlier in terms of wr the differences in the intra season pre silking vs post silking and inter season 2019 vs 2020 slopes in figs 7 and 8 indicate that the four most sensitive parameters vary with wr only during post silking stage in a wet year while they vary based on wr during both pre silking and post silking stages in a dry year in addition slopes are steeper with larger parameter variations for 2020 dry year treatments than for 2019 treatments although the effect of wr seems to be strong only during the post silking stage in a wet year like 2019 this does not imply that lue is not important during pre silking lue is important for photosynthesis during both pre and post silking stages according to yang et al 2004 total biomass yield simulated by hybrid maize under growth conditions with minimal stress was most sensitive to changes in the lue the fact that pre silking data points are clustered together in fig 7 for wet year 2019 is related to the lack of wr variation 355 378 mm during this stage post silking in 2019 had more wr variation 182 289 mm and this variation helped reveal gentle slopes for lue g5 and g2 in 2019 when compared to the steeper slopes in drier 2020 furthermore figs 7 and 8 show that there is an overlap of wr between 182 and 215 mm during the post silking stages of both 2019 and 2020 that is the lowest post silking wr values 215 mm in the wet 2019 are similar in magnitudes to the highest post silking wr values 182 mm in dry 2020 it is interesting to find out that the effects of post silking wr on the four most sensitive parameters are similar for both years across this overlapping range of wr in general if the 2019 and 2020 results were to be combined for each parameter figures not shown in here one could picture some non linear relationships between post silking wr and the parameters in which the positive slopes along the lue g5 and g2 curves would decrease with increase in wr while the negative slopes along the grg curve would increase with increase in wr in general these hypothetical parameter versus wr curves with steeper slopes in low wr conditions and gentler slopes in high wr conditions for lue g5 and g2 could imply that after a period of drought stress plants affected by drought may tend to grow more rapidly than those not stressed 3 5 effect of different calibrations on yield simulation four calibration parameter sets were considered based on different combinations and aggregations of the six most sensitive parameters table 4 these four sets were then compared to the default parameters to determine the overall best parameter set sim 1 was based on default values lue 12 5 g co2 mj 1 par g5 8 7 mg kernel 1 day 1 g2 675 kernel ear 1 grg 0 490 g ch2o g 1 dry matter slw 3 0 and mpr 7 0 g co2 m 2 leaf hr 1 sim 2 was based on 2 year mpo averages of only lue g 5 pair for all 16 calibration treatments using calibrated pairs that satisfied mpo constraints for individual treatments lue 13 2 g co2 mj 1 par and g5 9 3 mg kernel 1 day 1 sim 3 was based on 2 year mpo averages of only lue g5 and g2 grg pairs for all 16 calibration treatments using calibrated pairs that satisfied mpo constraints for individual treatments lue 13 2 g co2 mj 1 par g5 9 3 mg kernel 1 day 1 g2 695 kernel ear 1 and grg 0 482 g ch2o g 1 dry matter sim 4 was based on 2 year mpo averages of only lue g5 g2 grg and slw mpr pairs for all 16 calibration treatments using calibrated pairs that satisfied mpo constraints for individual treatments lue 13 2 g co2 mj 1 par g5 9 3 mg kernel 1 day 1 g2 695 kernel ear 1 and grg 0 482 g ch2o g 1 dry matter slw 3 0 and mpr 7 2 g co2 m 2 leaf hr 1 sim 5 was similar to sim 4 except that each year s mpo averages of lue g5 g2 grg and slw mpr pairs were different for 2019 and 2020 in order to determine the best parameter set for hybrid maize model in this study the performance of the four different calibrations i e parameter sets or combinations were compared to the default values using mean error me mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse unbiased root mean square error urmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse table 4 shows the performance statistics for both calibration and validation treatments validation results showed that in general sim 2 significantly reduced the me mae rmse urmse and nrmse of using default parameters by 47 44 34 0 and 39 respectively while sim 3 reduced default errors by 63 56 46 7 and 50 respectively the performance of sim 4 was the same as sim 3 for all evaluation statistics except rmse which further decreased from 1 9 mg ha to 1 8 mg ha sim 5 was the overall best calibration when compared to the default with 69 66 60 27 and 61 reductions for me mae rmse urmse and nrmse respectively table 4 the fact that sim 3 and sim 4 were the same for both calibration and validation showed that the contributions of both slw and mpr to simulated yield were not as significant as those of lue g5 g2 and grg also the reason sim 5 performed better than s3 and sim 4 was because the mpo averages of lue g5 g2 grg and slw mpr pairs were different for 2019 and 2020 growing seasons this tends to support the notion that i a one parameter set fits all approach to model calibration may lead to higher simulation errors across different climates and wr ranges and ii overfitting for individual treatments without aggregation may increase model bias and simulation errors when transferring the overfitted parameters sets to the validation treatments a limitation of many crop yield modeling studies is that they usually attempt to calibrate their models based on single or multiple years of experiment and then validate the models on separate single or multiple years not included in the calibration process while this may be good for capturing the climatic variability across different growing seasons it could lead to overfitting or lack of generalization across different climatic and wr combinations especially if only two or three years of data were used our study attempted to overcome this limitation by aggregating the most sensitive parameters across different climatic wet 2019 versus dry 2020 and irrigation combinations 16 different irrigation treatments in both 2019 and 2020 based on an mpo approach which puts uncertainty limits on observed crop yield and also puts constraints on the deviations of the most sensitive parameters from default values since multiple climate both years and wr combinations were used in calibration and validation in our study parameter aggregations as in sim 2 up to sim 5 helped balance model accuracy and robustness it is worthy to note that a limitation of hybrid maize model is that it does not account for possible yield losses from factors such as poor soil quality water logging weed competition insects diseases lodging and other stresses although the hybrid maize model has been used and validated in many climatic and agronomic environments and conditions yang et al 2004 grassini et al 2009 some of the model s current assumptions used in our study where irrigation was the major yield determining factor may not be totally valid in cropping systems where nitrogen and other factors play key roles on crop growth and development nevertheless due to the reason that the default parameters in the model had already been well calibrated in the u s corn belt and they require minor re calibration for region specific purposes the simulation results can serve as a guide for further experimental research although our cultivar specific re calibrated model performed well for different irrigation treatments in two years with different seasonal precipitation totals 536 mm and 229 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively there is a need to carry out extra validation by applying the model to other maize cultivars in multiple locations during multiple years particularly when the model is being used for in season management rather than end of season yield estimation 4 summary and conclusions this study demonstrated the use of a new mpo approach coupled with near real space time information from multiple in situ sensors for improving maize yield simulations under different irrigation managements here we applied a relatively simple crop model hybrid maize in simulating yield responses under different water regimes at plot scale of all model parameters considered three sensitivity analyses showed that yield simulations were most sensitive to the initial light use efficiency lue potential number of kernels per ear g2 potential kernel filling rate g5 growth respiration coefficient of grain grg empirical parameter determining the relative contribution of a soil layer to water uptake slw and maximum photosynthetic rate mpr due to the minimal impact of nitrogen on yield in our study the results of our model calibration and validation were based on wr precipitation irrigation our initial results showed that using default parameters did not accurately simulate maize yield hence the need for re calibration we later improved the calibration and optimization of multiple parameters in the hybrid maize model by using a stepwise kriging method based on the parameter values which satisfied three mpo constraints in individual treatments aggregating the local parameters across two growing seasons improved the ability of the model to simulate yield in terms of smaller me rmse urmse and nrmse over a wide range of wr conditions the strong linear relationships observed between wr and the top four sensitive parameters suggest that using dynamic parameters appears to be a satisfactory way to improve model success this will be experimentally explored further to improve the process based structure of the model future studies will also focus on applying our mpo approach to multiple locations during multiple years particularly

9690,crop models have been used for investigating crop responses to environmental stresses for decades the study objectives were to i calibrate and validate a simple crop model hybrid maize using in situ measured data from sixteen uniquely managed treatments as part of the university of nebraska lincoln testing ag performance solutions taps program in north platte ne and ii carry out sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation using a multi parameter optimization approach sixteen arable mark 1 sensors and thirty two mark 2 sensors arable labs inc san francisco ca collecting hourly and daily weather and crop information in 2019 and 2020 respectively were installed in the taps subsurface drip irrigation experimental plots which were planted with maize and subjected to different irrigation and nitrogen practices hybrid maize was used for simulating maize yield on the sixteen treatments in 2019 and 2020 sensitivity analysis showed that initial light use efficiency lue potential kernel filling rate g5 potential number of kernels per ear g2 growth respiration coefficient of grain grg empirical parameter determining the relative contribution of a soil layer to water uptake slw and maximum photosynthetic rate mpr were the most sensitive parameters to yield a novel multi parameter optimization mpo approach based on kriging was used for calibrating these six parameters and the best parameter sets which were later used for model validation calibration results showed that there seemed to be strong linear relationships between total water received wr and some of the parameters by using each year s mpo averages of the six parameters instead of default values me mae rmse urmse and nrmse were all reduced by about 69 66 60 27 and 61 respectively for validation treatments the advantage of using in situ sensors coupled with the suitability of the calibrated model for simulating maize yield under different irrigation management will make the model more useful in future field scale research with focus on developing decision support tools for in season crop management and yield forecasts keywords yield prediction irrigation hybrid maize multi parameter estimation in situ sensors 1 introduction the ability to do in season real time prediction monitoring and management of the growing crop is important for sustainable and profitable maize zea mays l production adeyemi et al 2017 liu et al 2018 gao et al 2017 crop models use simplified representations of physical processes to simulate crop growth and development as a function of soil weather and crop management variables kim et al 2012 although dynamic and process based crop models have been widely used as decision support tools for crop management in terms of water and nutrient application and for simulating yield at field level many of the model parameters are not directly measured this is because it is often difficult to determine their values due to the inherent spatio temporal variability in natural processes data measurement errors and cost of measurement bogena et al 2010 panda et al 2010 varella et al 2010 launay and guérif 2003 irmak et al 2001 ferreyra et al 2006 batchelor et al 2002 gabrielle et al 2002 tremblay and wallach 2004 as a result crop modeling is often based on information or data that are not representative of the case of interest which can lead to over or under predictions the goal of research for better accuracy of crop models has mostly been tied to the ability of models to simulate complex soil plant and weather processes while less emphasis has been placed on the representativeness of input data e g weather soil that vary spatially and temporally miguez et al 2012 hastings et al 2009 this could be because representativeness is a moot point given producers do not usually adopt site specific sensor platforms due to cost and time related issues most producers do not see an economic need for installing in situ sensors in their fields for example according to the united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda nass irrigation and water management survey from 2018 only 11 9 of farmers who irrigate used soil moisture sensors to schedule irrigation while 2 3 used plant moisture sensors usda nass 2018 however there is a great need for producers to make more accurate decisions in the field to save input costs and maximize profits when it comes to developing decision support systems using near real space or near real time data or a combination of both depends largely on the purposes for processing the data in the first instance in many cases crop growth and yield simulation involve processing long term historical and archived data and space distance from weather station to area of interest or time is not so critical conversely accurate in season decisions need to be made in the field using in situ sensors and within a short time to be of value in this paper we define near real space time data as the data from in situ i e near real space sensors with collection interval and processing time in minutes or few hours instead of seconds i e near real time precise and localized information is highly valuable in scheduling and executing agricultural management practices such as irrigation and applications of fertilizers and pesticides egea et al 2017 yadav et al 2010 nansen et al 2015 faiçal et al 2014 kim et al 2000 however while soil spatial variability is most likely known by farmers this is less so with weather variables which can greatly vary in space and time most notably rainfall rodriguez and mejia 1974 whereas soil variability sampling may only be required ranging from every year to every ten years depending on the nutrient crop type crop rotation and soil texture warncke 2013 ferguson and hergert 2000 daily or hourly weather data is required in crop modeling to track and predict growth dynamics from planting to maturity chaulagain et al 2020 ramos et al 2017 togliatti et al 2017 and the daily or hourly values of weather variables are usually based on averages e g relative humidity wind speed solar radiation mean air temperature and accumulation e g rainfall for example evapotranspiration et is one of the major components in soil plant atmosphere continuum spac that requires accurate tracking due to its vital role in determining crop water consumption and requirement in irrigated agriculture althoff et al 2019 djaman et al 2018 ji et al 2017 irmak et al 2005 the accuracy of tracking crop et with a reference et method during a growing season is dependent on the robustness of the reference et model used and the proper use of crop coefficients with the reference et model moreover et model robustness is a function of the type of model whether radiation based temperature based or a combination of both and the temporal resolution at which the input variables are measured e g from monthly values for hargreaves method to daily values for priestly taylor method and to half hourly values for eddy covariance technique liu et al 2017 although having accurate weather information is extremely important in crop modeling and yield forecasting this is not easily accessible and most times users of crop models depend on data collected from weather stations that can be many kilometers away from areas of interest the distance and terrain between a weather station and a field can affect the representation of the weather inputs used in simulating crop yield of the field peña quiñones et al 2019 prakash et al 2019 dai et al 2017 girons lopez et al 2015 mishra 2013 piyush et al 2012 for instance rainfall can be localized and the microclimate of a field which is a local set of atmospheric conditions e g rainfall temperature humidity wind and turbulence heat balance and evaporation may slightly or substantially differ from those at a nearby weather station remote sensing has the potential to provide many input data for crop modeling and satellite based sensing seems to be the only realistic solution for a decision support system for maize production due to its large spatial coverage coupled with thin profit margins and declining on farm incomes mo et al 2005 dente et al 2008 liang and qin 2008 however weather and soil data collected via satellites have some problems coarse spatial scale they are hundreds of meters across rather than tens of meters and large time intervals between earth passes and sometimes ill timed cloud cover gao et al 2015 thus the fusion of satellite data weather stations and in situ sensors holds the key to the future of agriculture both in terms of better yield simulation accuracy and management aid luo et al 2018 in order to lay a good foundation for using fused data in crop modeling there is need to test and validate the robustness of in situ internet of things iot sensors that can handle real time continuous visibility and in field crop monitoring since we decided to use local in situ data instead of satellite or weather station data in a crop model arable mark sensors arable labs inc san francisco ca were selected because they combine hourly and daily weather data as well as plant measurements about 40 agro climatic variables which are all remotely available mark 2 is an upgrade of mark 1 for this study the hybrid maize model v2016 yang et al 2004 2016 was chosen because it is simple fast and uses relatively fewer input data in comparison to other process based crop models such as the agricultural production systems simulator apsim holzworth et al 2014 erosion productivity impact calculator epic williams 1995 and decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat hoogenboom et al 2010 although hybrid maize model assumes optimal nutrient supply without allowing the assessment of different options for nutrient management it has been widely used in maize crop modeling studies and results have shown that it has reliable performance in simulating maize yield at a field scale grassini et al 2009 2011 yang et al 2013 gibson et al 2017 specifically in the united states corn belt nevertheless it is important to analyze the sensitivity of the model parameters and also calibrate and validate them for an area of interest in order to reduce uncertainty in simulation varella et al 2010 wallach et al 2001 in our study combining the simplicity and reliability of the hybrid maize model with the near real space time precision of in situ arable mark sensors was hypothesized to be an advantage for reducing yield simulation errors associated with dynamic atmospheric and crop processes this is because having multiple arable marks in a field allows the capture of spatial variability within a field which is at a higher spatial and temporal resolution than coarse satellite data therefore the aim of this study was to use in situ sensors and measured data from sixteen uniquely managed treatments to 1 identify the most sensitive model parameters using a novel parameter estimation approach and 2 quantify the dependence of model parameters on seasonal water input i e precipitation plus irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments different combinations of irrigation and nitrogen n fertilizer application rates were examined in sixteen maize treatments in 2019 and 2020 at the university of nebraska lincoln west central research extension and education center wcrec in north platte nebraska latitude 41 09º n longitude 100 77º w elevation 863 m a s l the experimental treatments were uniquely managed by various growers different for both years as part of the university of nebraska lincoln testing ag performance solutions taps program henceforth referred to as unltaps the unltaps program hosts farm management competitions where growers compete in the production and marketing of a crop with contestants evaluated on yield input use efficiency profitability etc each team was provided three plots i e three replicates of one treatment and within a randomized complete block experimental design at wcrec fig 1 each plot was 4 5 m wide 6 rows by 49 m long in a north south orientation for both 2019 and 2020 same experimental layout and blocks were used but with different randomization of the plots the soil is a well drained cozad silt loam with a ph of 7 9 and a bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 for 0 20 cm soil depth on average organic matter content available phosphorus and available potassium contents of 0 20 cm soil depth were 3 7 292 mg kg 1 and 633 mg kg 1 with standard deviations of 0 3 67 mg kg 1

76 cm and at a population of 84 000 seeds ha 1 a subsurface drip irrigation sdi system was used to water and fertigate the plots where each treatment was individually controlled and monitored the sdi system consists of rivulis d5000 pc driplines installed every 76 cm at a depth of 33 cm each producer team scheduled their irrigation and was allowed to apply up to 12 7 mm per event four times a week each producer team was also allowed to select the amount of pre plant and or in season via side dress and or fertigation n fertilizer in the form of urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 for both 2019 and 2020 all treatments and competitions received a baseline 46 8 l ha 1 of starter fertilizer 10 34 0 at the time of planting this was available in all competitions and was applied using a double coulter liquid applicator at 2 54 cm depth and a distance of 12 7 cm on both sides of the planted row side dress n fertilizer was available for contestants and was applied at the ground surface neighboring each crop row using 360 y drop 360 yield center morton il fertigation was applied through the sdi system directly into the contestants plots from a calibration tube using a constant rate injection pump maximum application of n was limited to a total of 202 kg ha 1 for pre plant 202 kg ha 1 for side dress and 34 kg ha 1 for each fertigation event pre plant side dress v4 v6 and four fertigation events v9 v12 vt r1 and r2 were available to the participants the control treatment for 2019 received no irrigation and no n fertilizer while that of 2020 received a season total of 171 kg ha of n fertilizer as the unltaps research was conducted as part of the taps farm management competition there was a restriction to their experimental protocol as such the taps team decided to change the control plot protocol by including n fertilizer in 2020 however this change in control treatment protocol did not affect the research objectives and results of our study the total irrigation amount of water irrigation plus precipitation and n fertilizer applied across contestants are reported in table 1 weeds pests and diseases were managed uniformly for the entire field this field provided a dataset including both a high level of monitoring and a large number of treatments reflecting producer practices 2 2 data and measurements one in situ iot sensor arable mark 1 was installed in one replicate of all the sixteen treatments block a in 2019 while two arable mark 2 sensors were installed in each replicate in 2020 all the sensors were installed at a height of 1 8 m above ground level and later moved from 1 8 m to 4 9 m after the crops reached 0 9 m height these sensors provided hourly weather and crop data throughout the growing season the weather and crop dataset includes air temperature atmospheric pressure precipitation photosynthetically active radiation par global solar radiation relative humidity leaf ground temperature seven spectrometer data bands 1 7 and chlorophyll content hourly and sub hourly data were analyzed checked for consistency and aggregated or re processed to daily weather input data for the hybrid maize model the weather and crop data were collected at a high level of accuracy thus providing an opportunity to test the overall performance of hybrid maize model at plot scale using in situ sensor data missing data between 0 and 2 of

also used from this weather station at harvest four rows per treatment were harvested for yield estimation table 1 all yields are reported at 15 5 moisture content 2 3 hybrid maize model configuration as stated the aim of this study was to use hybrid maize model with its minimum requirements for crop and field management input to simulate yield on sixteen treatments with different irrigation managements over two growing seasons using weather data from in situ sensors the specific intention was to explore whether biases would emerge and if these biases could be reduced by a simple correction required input data included daily weather data minimum and maximum air temperature ºc solar radiation mj m 2 relative humidity precipitation mm and reference et mm planting date hybrid maturity i e total gdd to silking and maturity plant population as well as irrigation dates and amount and soil texture and bulk density 2 4 calibration and validation in order to improve the predictive performance of our hybrid maize model we split the sixteen treatments for each year into calibration and validation datasets although different combinations of irrigation and total n were applied to the treatments at the discretion of the contestants splitting was done based only on the total irrigation applied this is because initial regression analyses of the influence of both total water received wr and total n applied showed that wr received alone accounted for 69 of the total yield variation while total n alone accounted for only 1 fig 2 for each growing season the sixteen treatments were divided into calibration 50 and validation 50 treatments using exemplar based agglomerative clustering brusco et al 2019 with wr and yield as inputs similarity for each cluster was based on the negative squared euclidean distance of the inputs and the shared value was 20 quantile of the input similarities calibration treatments were randomly selected from each cluster based on cluster sizes to ensure that the ranges of wr were covered it is worth noting that using treatments with similar ranges of wr for calibration and validation would help minimize the effects of data discrepancies due to different irrigation and precipitation depths as well as yield values 2 5 model sensitivity analysis fourteen model parameters were chosen for sensitivity analysis using both one at a time oat sensitivity and global sensitivity analysis gsa for comparison purposes sensitivity analysis was conducted using the weather data of the control plot s2 in 2019 since its wr and yield 536 mm and 14 2 mg ha respectively are closest to the overall averages of wr and yield 500 mm and 14 8 mg ha respectively for combined 2019 and 2020 seasons for oat the model parameters were tested with changes prescribed at 5 10 15 and 20 of the default values the slope of the relative percentage change of simulated yield versus the percentage change of parameter value was used to assess the sensitivity of the model to these parameters the larger the slope the more sensitive the yield was to that parameter for gsa the top eight parameters with the largest slopes were selected in order to further identify and prioritize the most influential parameters by considering their sensitivities across the whole input space two gsa approaches were used forward stepwise selection multiple linear regression and variance based sobol method for forward stepwise gsa which is based on linear regression 100 random sets of the eight top parameters with 30 limits of variation from default model values were first generated hybrid maize model was then run with these 100 sets of eight parameters and the yield values were recorded forward stepwise selection was later used to select model parameters in decreasing order of relative importance based on their akaike information criterion aic values and starting with the most influential parameter till the stepwise selection procedure was terminated aic is based on penalty in order to balance the goodness of fit of a model and the number of input parameters the terminating step indicated that adding extra parameters would not increase model performance since sobol gsa could handle nonlinear responses and estimate the effect of interactions in non additive systems the monte carlo estimation of sobol indices based on sobol et al 2007 and saltelli et al 2010 was also used to estimate the total sobol gsa indices for hybrid maize model parameters the sobol2007 function in sensitivity package https cran r project org web packages sensitivity was implemented in r r development core team 2007 using 10 000 simulations 2 6 multi parameter optimization and model calibration based on the number of the most sensitive parameters selected and the order of selection during sensitivity analysis hybrid maize model was then calibrated using a novel multi parameter optimization mpo technique hybrid maize model currently does not have a built in or standalone multi parameter calibration tool therefore in order to produce and analyze results of tens of thousands of yield simulations all at once in a multi dimensional multi parameter space we developed an mpo based on kriging using steps of pairwise combinations of the most sensitive parameters and yield kriging was used in surfer 16 software golden software llc with the wave model variogram although the use of kriging as a spatial gridding method has been proven useful and popular in many geoscience fields our study was the first to our knowledge to use this geostatistical technique for mpo and parameter calibration in a crop modeling study surfer 16 uses a highly optimized algorithm for calculating the node maize yield in our case values the wave model variogram component in surfer was chosen for kriging because it provided the best yield grids with the best cross validation results the following steps were later used for creating and evaluating the yield grids for every calibration treatment in 2019 and 2020 step 1 selection of the first two most sensitive parameters step 2 creation of input data for gridding by running hybrid maize 49 times with different combinations of the two parameters in step 1 while keeping other sensitive parameters at default values the resulting yield values from these 49 simulations and their corresponding input parameter pairs were considered as new observations for kriging interpolation step 3 creation of the yield grid using wave hole effect variogram model component for each pair of sensitive parameters based on grid spacing the yield grid had 8900 nodes i e 8900 yield values which was equivalent to running hybrid maize model 8900 times step 4 cross validation to check the accuracy of the interpolation at the 49 input nodes based on the variogram model step 5 selection of a small random subset n 30 of kriged yield nodes on the interpolated grid to compare the overall accuracy of the kriging process with actual hybrid maize model yield simulations the selected thirty kriged yield values and their corresponding parameter pair values from the grid were compared with yields simulated with hybrid maize using the same thirty pairs of parameters as inputs in order to assess how well the kriged yield values compared to hybrid maize predicted yield values this number n 30 represented a threshold above which the sample size i e number of nodes was no longer considered small statistically we ensured that none of the selected thirty nodes was a subset of the initial 49 input or new observations values it is noteworthy to state here that for any given pair of sensitive model parameters from step 1 above there is an uncertainty in parameter calibration i e selecting the overall best pair of parameters from the 8900 pairs due to equifinality of models this is because there exist various combinations of these two parameters i e equal pathways which could give the exact observed maize yield i e finality for any given experimental plot or treatment although there are other types and sources of uncertainty in any scientific modeling beside model parameters e g model inputs model structure performance metrics initial and boundary conditions and internal fluxes however our study only focused on model parameters therefore to reduce the uncertainty due to equifinality of models and also to avoid overfitting the models we developed an mpo methodology to minimize the difference between simulated and observed yields based on a specified set of constraints that a pair of parameters had to satisfy mathematically the mpo is expressed as arg min a b y sim y obs subject to 0 92 y obs y sim 1 08 y obs a 0 85 a def 1 15 a def b 0 85 b def 1 15 b def where the optimal input parameter argument represents the a b pair or pairs that minimizes or minimize the value of the objective function y sim y obs with the added constraints y sim is the simulated yield in mg ha 1 y obs is the observed yield in kg ha 1 a and b are the optimized model parameters a def and b def are the default model parameters the first mpo constraint that the simulated yields lie in the interval between 8 of the observed yield was based on the fact that only four rows per treatment were harvested for both yield and moisture content estimation since scaling the yield estimates from the harvested areas to the full plot areas or a typical center pivot area of 50 ha would introduce some uncertainties to yield estimation we therefore assumed that the true yield values would lie between 8 of the observed yield in addition the constraints that a and b values lie in the interval between 15 of default values a def and b def were based on the premise that the default values in the hybrid maize model had already been calibrated and validated across a wide range of environments in the corn belt in the united states liu et al 2015 yang et al 2004 grassini et al 2009 hence there was no need to allow the parameters to go beyond the upper and lower limits of their constraints the a b pairs if there existed more than one pair after sensitivity analysis that minimized the value of the objective function based on the constraints were averaged for each calibration treatment these average a b values for each of the 16 calibration treatments eight calibration treatments per year were also averaged and used as new default parameter values to calibrate the next two most sensitive parameters by repeating all the previous five steps this was done until all the sensitive pairs of parameters had been used in gridding and mpo model validation was carried out by transferring both the single non seasonal re calibrated parameter set combined and aggregated for both years and the two seasonal re calibrated parameter sets separate sets for 2019 and 2020 to the 16 validation treatments 2 7 model performance and assessment previous studies have used different statistics to assess and compare the performance of crop model results with observed yield franz et al 2020 liu et al 2015 in our study the performance of different re calibrated parameters in hybrid maize model was compared to the default parameters using five evaluation statistics including mean error me mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse unbiased root mean square error urmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse 1 me 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 4 urmse 1 n i 1 n p i bias o i 2 5 nrmse rmse sd obs 6 sd obs 1 n i 1 n o i o i 2 where n is the number of crop yield data points in the validation dataset o i and p i are the observed and predicted crop yield of the i th data point respectively sd obs is the standard deviation of the observations and o i is the mean of observations 3 results and discussions 3 1 comparison of weather data fig 3 shows that there were strong similarities between the meteorological data from both unltaps sensors and nem weather station in 2020 however for 2019 which was a wetter year see precipitation graph in fig 3 there were marked differences in the observed solar radiation and relative humidity at the nem weather station and the unltaps study site it is important to state here that we did not expect the nem and the unltaps sensors to totally agree most especially because the microclimates of the nem weather station and our unltaps experimental site are different in 2019 and 2020 due to differences in soil types crop cover localized effect of precipitation nem and unltaps are 0 5 km apart and the irrigation treatments applied at unltaps study site also our comparison between nem and unltaps weather data fig 3 does not imply that unltaps sensors are better than nem sensors in terms of accuracy rather it lends support to the argument that using in situ weather information as model inputs could lead to lower modeling errors especially in a wet year like 2019 little differences in precipitation relative humidity and its derivative vapor pressure deficit could add up to large errors in reference evapotranspiration calculations as well as in actual evapotranspiration calculations in hybrid maize model which is based on daily soil moisture balance for 2019 with more than double of the precipitation in 2020 536 mm and 229 mm respectively and possibly more cloud cover the difference between nem and unltaps solar radiation measurements could possibly be due to the reason that both nem and unltaps pyranometers might not have the same response and calibration over the waveband for solar radiation at the ground level nem pyranometer uses a silicon photovoltaic li cor sensor and as stated by unsworth 2005 this type of pyranometer detects only a small fraction of the spectral range and so should be used only in unobstructed global radiation i e not for diffuse or reflected radiation unless they are specifically recalibrated for such measurements against a thermopile pyranometer since the aim of our study was to use in situ sensors and measured data from sixteen uniquely managed treatments per growing season therefore based on the aforementioned reason for the divergence of 2019 solar radiation data coupled with the fact the data driven models developed by arable labs inc are supported by a global network of 30 calibration validation sites that cover twelve climatic zones and ensure accurate reliable data we used the solar radiation data from mark 1 2019 and mark 2 2020 in our study the relative humidity graph for 2019 shows that above 75 intercept of the 2019 trendline and 1 1 line nem had higher relative humidity and below 75 nem had lower values this could be due to variability of microclimate including factors such as air and soil temperature regimes evapotranspiration and soil moisture at the two locations owing to the reason that 2019 growing season was a lot wetter and colder than 2020 season and that the nem station was located on mowed rainfed grass 0 5 km from the irrigated unltaps plots relative humidity would tend to be higher over irrigated plots than rainfed grass on arid days during dry periods but more similar otherwise it is worthy to add that differences in sensor response and or calibration could be present as well with respect to precipitation the 2019 growing season received more than two times of the precipitation in 2020 the total precipitation during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons were 536 mm and 229 mm respectively as shown in fig 3 there were stronger similarities between the cumulative precipitation for both unltaps and nem station in the drier 2020 season when compared to 2019 which was a much wetter season since precipitation measured at unltaps by both mark 1 used in 2019 and mark 2 used in 2020 is detected through an acoustic disdrometer in comparison to the nem rain gauge which uses a tipping bucket the greater divergence in wetter 2019 season could probably be attributed mostly to the response and calibration between the nem rain gauge and the older mark 1 sensors mark 2 is an upgrade angulo martinez et al 2018 tokay 2013 wmo 2009 moreover since the distance between the unltaps treatments and nem station is about 0 5 km the spatial variability of precipitation more pronounced in wetter 2019 season than 2020 could also have contributed significantly to the differences in cumulative precipitation between unltaps and nem fig 3 this spatial variability is highly dependent on the type of precipitation event emmanuel et al 2012 some studies have shown that there could be up to 100 variability between rain gauges within 0 5 km of each other jensen and pedersen 2005 while others have demonstrated up to 26 or more variability between rain gauges within 250 m of each other pedersen et al 2010 3 2 clustering results fig 4 shows the results from exemplar based agglomerative clustering the total water received and yield were the two clustering inputs in fig 4 top each color corresponds to a cluster and the prototypical data point exemplar of each cluster is marked by a box while all cluster members are connected to their exemplars with lines results show that there were only two clusters for both years in the similarity matrices on fig 4 bottom the treatments are clustered based on pairwise negative euclidean distances a euclidean distance is the length of a straight line joining two points or treatments and it is calculated by using the pythagorean theorem based on the cartesian coordinates of the points a negative euclidean distance of indicates absolute dissimilarity while a treatment pair is considered to be more similar if the negative euclidean distance is closer to zero for any treatment pair a lighter color e g light yellow indicates high similarity while a darker color e g red indicates low similarity in general due to higher precipitation in 2019 the euclidean distances were almost ten times smaller than those of drier 2020 season which had more yield variability in 2019 highly irrigated treatments 8 and 9 had the least similarity to treatment 2 which was the control treatment likewise treatment 16 in 2020 had the least similarity with respect to treatment 11 control treatment based on the clustering results in fig 4 the calibration and validation treatments for both 2019 and 2020 were selected from each cluster as shown in table 2 bigger clusters had more treatments selected in order to split the sixteen treatments into two similar sets for both 2019 and 2020 owing to the reason that total water received explained about 69 of yield variation fig 2 we ensured that treatments with the lowest and highest total irrigation amounts were evenly distributed between the calibration and validation sets this resulted in similar sets which covered the full range of wr in both years to compare the calibration and validation sets the minimums means maximums and standard deviations of wr and yield were calculated as shown in table 2 in 2019 the standard deviations for wr for both calibration and validation sets were 40 mm and 39 mm respectively while the standard deviations for yield for both calibration and validation sets were 1 0 mg ha and 0 8 mg ha respectively in 2020 the standard deviations for wr for both calibration and validation sets were 98 mm and 94 mm respectively while the standard deviations for yield for both calibration and validation sets were 2 7 mg ha as shown in table 2 only one treatment s16 in drier 2020 season received more wr 603 mm than the control treatment s2 in 2019 3 3 sensitivity analysis of model parameters table 3 shows the results of the oat and gsa based on the sensitivity slopes the oat approach showed that the initial light use efficiency lue the potential kernel filling rate g5 and the potential number of kernels per ear g2 all had slope values above 0 50 in decreasing order of sensitivity these three parameters were followed by growth respiration coefficient of grain grg the empirical parameter determining the relative contribution of a soil layer to water uptake slw and maximum photosynthetic rate mpr with slopes of 0 26 0 19 and 0 13 respectively based on a sensitivity analysis of the hybrid maize model that was conducted using 17 year mean weather data for lincoln nebraska yang et al 2004 also observed that grain yields were most sensitive to changes in lue g5 and g2 all of which increased yield with increasing values results for stepwise gsa also showed similar order of importance when compared to oat with lue being the most sensitive parameter followed by g5 and g2 the only difference was that whereas the oat approach showed equal sensitivity for both g5 and g2 the gsa approach based on stepwise selection selected g5 before g2 starting with lue and terminating at mpr the stepwise gsa selected only six model parameters before termination with every successive parameter selection making the model better as shown by the decreasing aic values in table 3 since a lower aic value indicates a better model this implies that a model with only lue aic 51 24 as the sensitive parameter is not as good as a model with both lue and g5 aic 22 27 similarly a model with the six most sensitive parameters aic 47 69 is also better than a model with only five top parameters aic 43 47 the fact that the stepwise selection terminated after selecting the sixth parameter showed that adding extra parameters after the sixth parameter would not improve the model performance sobol gsa showed similar results to both stepwise gsa and oat although with a slight difference in the order of importance for slw and grg table 3 shows that the sobol total global sensitivity index for slw 0 07 is greater than that for grg 0 04 3 4 multi parameter optimization with kriging the yield nodes from kriging and their corresponding parameter pairs lue g 5 g 2 grg slw mpr were used for calibrating the model via mpo since the mpo was done it a pairwise and stepwise approach for the sake of visualization only the 3 d yield surfaces for the top four sensitive parameters lue g 5 and g 2 grg are shown in figs 5 and 6 for both 2019 and 2020 growing seasons in addition figs 5 and 6 only show four of the eight calibration treatments for each year in increasing wr and the treatments were selected to cover the range of wr it is worth noting that similar yield surfaces could be created for slw mpr pair using its 8900 yield nodes however for the sake of brevity and since slw and mpr had the least sensitivity the yield surfaces for this pair were not presented here as shown by the red contour lines in figs 5 and 6 there are many nodes or combinations of lue g 5 and g 2 grg pairs that can give the exact observed yield for any treatment in fact there are even more combinations that fall within the two black contour lines which are the 8 yield error margins the black squares show the simulated yields using the default parameters the white squares show the simulated yields using the local mpo parameters i e using the best parameters per treatment and the red squares show the simulated yields using the regional mpo parameters i e using combined 2 year averages of all local mpo parameters for the calibration treatments missing red and black contour lines in fig 6 are outside the boundaries of the yield surfaces irrespective of the parameter pair in consideration each yield surface shown in figs 5 and 6 is unique for each treatment however there appears to be similarities in shapes and yield distributions for the four 2019 wet year treatments in fig 5a and the two 2020 dry year highly irrigated treatments s6 and s13 in fig 5b this is also true for the yield surfaces in fig 6a and b it is worth noting that whereas the positions of the default and the regional parameter pairs are unchanged in the parameter space across all calibration treatments the position of the local mpo pair white square is shifting upwards i e both values increasing relative to default and regional pairs with increasing wr for lue g 5 pair based on the three mpo constraints there are no local mpo lue g 5 pairs for the water deficit calibration treatments s5 and s15 in 2020 since no node meets all the three constraints fig 5b using only the yield constraint without the parameter constraints would lead to model overfitting and overfitting the hybrid maize model for a water deficit treatment e g s5 and s15 in 2020 would result in new re calibrated parameter values that are too high and too far from the default parameter values in the model since all the default model parameters in hybrid maize had already been calibrated for the us corn belt this would lead to a wrong inference that water deficit in the drier 2020 growing season would lead to both higher lue and g5 i e the re calibrated lue and g5 for both s5 and s15 in fig 5b would lie in between their respective black curves and lower crop yield this is contrary to our expectation that water deficit should reduce lue g5 and crop yield lue refers to the gross assimilation at extremely low light intensity while rue refers to the rate of net biomass production per unit of intercepted light par of global radiation averaged over a season it is important to point out that although lue is often referred to as radiation use efficiency rue in some studies and they have the same unit they are different in relation to hybrid maize model lue for maize is 12 5 g co2 mj 1 par or 9 375 g ch2o mj 1 par whereas typical rue for maize is 3 8 g ch2o mj 1 par furthermore rue is affected by all factors that affect photosynthetic rate whereas lue is supposed to be very conservative due to the conservative nature of lue crop models that use lue approach e g hybrid maize world food studies simulation model wofost do not recommend changing its value unless there are valid justifications however similar to previous extensive studies on the effect of irrigation management on rue which observed that water deficit reduce rue and crop yield ullah et al 2019 cosentino et al 2014 2016 patanè and cosentino 2013 our results also suggest that lue i e gross assimilation could be higher than the default value and be dependent on the wr at different growth stages fig 7 according to arora and gajri 2000 reduction in gross assimilation is directly proportional to the degree of water stress the lue result for dry year 2020 fig 7 bottom left shows that low wr drought stress during the pre and post silking stages of corn could reduce lue and lower lue values could consequently lead to reduced photosynthetic rates which tend to have effect on corn grain yield for g5 and g2 which are both potentials and are highly correlated with wr see fig 5 and the r2 values for g5 and g2 in figs 7 and 8 previous studies have also shown that an increase in irrigation produced higher kernel number per ear moosavi 2012 lack et al 2008 ghadiri and majidian 2003 in a dry year low wr drought stress during grain fill could reduce g5 which could subsequently cause lightweight grains or kernel abortion while a drought free grain fill period can maximize the yield potential of a crop g2 is strongly affected by the growing environment and agronomic management thus low wr drought stress during the early to mid vegetative stages of corn in a dry year could affect potential ear size through a reduction in the g2 results shown in figs 6a and 8 indicate that there appears to be a strong but negative linear relationship between grg and wr in a wet growing season while there is no significant relationship between them in a very dry year with low wr values the negative relationship between grg and wr implies that if wr increases less g carbohydrate g ch2o would be lost during the conversion for accumulation of 1 g grain dry matter in other words the growth of 1 g grain dry matter would require less total carbohydrate with increasing wr since slw mpr was the least sensitive parameter pair there were no significant relationships between wr and both parameters with their pre silking and post silking r2 values less than 0 3 data not shown figs 7 and 8 show the linear relationships between wr during pre silking and post silking stages as well as during the full growing seasons in 2019 and 2020 and the local mpo parameter values for individual calibration treatments values for two water stressed treatments s5 and s15 in 2020 were filled with regression equations while the control treatment s11 was excluded because it was an outlier in terms of wr the differences in the intra season pre silking vs post silking and inter season 2019 vs 2020 slopes in figs 7 and 8 indicate that the four most sensitive parameters vary with wr only during post silking stage in a wet year while they vary based on wr during both pre silking and post silking stages in a dry year in addition slopes are steeper with larger parameter variations for 2020 dry year treatments than for 2019 treatments although the effect of wr seems to be strong only during the post silking stage in a wet year like 2019 this does not imply that lue is not important during pre silking lue is important for photosynthesis during both pre and post silking stages according to yang et al 2004 total biomass yield simulated by hybrid maize under growth conditions with minimal stress was most sensitive to changes in the lue the fact that pre silking data points are clustered together in fig 7 for wet year 2019 is related to the lack of wr variation 355 378 mm during this stage post silking in 2019 had more wr variation 182 289 mm and this variation helped reveal gentle slopes for lue g5 and g2 in 2019 when compared to the steeper slopes in drier 2020 furthermore figs 7 and 8 show that there is an overlap of wr between 182 and 215 mm during the post silking stages of both 2019 and 2020 that is the lowest post silking wr values 215 mm in the wet 2019 are similar in magnitudes to the highest post silking wr values 182 mm in dry 2020 it is interesting to find out that the effects of post silking wr on the four most sensitive parameters are similar for both years across this overlapping range of wr in general if the 2019 and 2020 results were to be combined for each parameter figures not shown in here one could picture some non linear relationships between post silking wr and the parameters in which the positive slopes along the lue g5 and g2 curves would decrease with increase in wr while the negative slopes along the grg curve would increase with increase in wr in general these hypothetical parameter versus wr curves with steeper slopes in low wr conditions and gentler slopes in high wr conditions for lue g5 and g2 could imply that after a period of drought stress plants affected by drought may tend to grow more rapidly than those not stressed 3 5 effect of different calibrations on yield simulation four calibration parameter sets were considered based on different combinations and aggregations of the six most sensitive parameters table 4 these four sets were then compared to the default parameters to determine the overall best parameter set sim 1 was based on default values lue 12 5 g co2 mj 1 par g5 8 7 mg kernel 1 day 1 g2 675 kernel ear 1 grg 0 490 g ch2o g 1 dry matter slw 3 0 and mpr 7 0 g co2 m 2 leaf hr 1 sim 2 was based on 2 year mpo averages of only lue g 5 pair for all 16 calibration treatments using calibrated pairs that satisfied mpo constraints for individual treatments lue 13 2 g co2 mj 1 par and g5 9 3 mg kernel 1 day 1 sim 3 was based on 2 year mpo averages of only lue g5 and g2 grg pairs for all 16 calibration treatments using calibrated pairs that satisfied mpo constraints for individual treatments lue 13 2 g co2 mj 1 par g5 9 3 mg kernel 1 day 1 g2 695 kernel ear 1 and grg 0 482 g ch2o g 1 dry matter sim 4 was based on 2 year mpo averages of only lue g5 g2 grg and slw mpr pairs for all 16 calibration treatments using calibrated pairs that satisfied mpo constraints for individual treatments lue 13 2 g co2 mj 1 par g5 9 3 mg kernel 1 day 1 g2 695 kernel ear 1 and grg 0 482 g ch2o g 1 dry matter slw 3 0 and mpr 7 2 g co2 m 2 leaf hr 1 sim 5 was similar to sim 4 except that each year s mpo averages of lue g5 g2 grg and slw mpr pairs were different for 2019 and 2020 in order to determine the best parameter set for hybrid maize model in this study the performance of the four different calibrations i e parameter sets or combinations were compared to the default values using mean error me mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse unbiased root mean square error urmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse table 4 shows the performance statistics for both calibration and validation treatments validation results showed that in general sim 2 significantly reduced the me mae rmse urmse and nrmse of using default parameters by 47 44 34 0 and 39 respectively while sim 3 reduced default errors by 63 56 46 7 and 50 respectively the performance of sim 4 was the same as sim 3 for all evaluation statistics except rmse which further decreased from 1 9 mg ha to 1 8 mg ha sim 5 was the overall best calibration when compared to the default with 69 66 60 27 and 61 reductions for me mae rmse urmse and nrmse respectively table 4 the fact that sim 3 and sim 4 were the same for both calibration and validation showed that the contributions of both slw and mpr to simulated yield were not as significant as those of lue g5 g2 and grg also the reason sim 5 performed better than s3 and sim 4 was because the mpo averages of lue g5 g2 grg and slw mpr pairs were different for 2019 and 2020 growing seasons this tends to support the notion that i a one parameter set fits all approach to model calibration may lead to higher simulation errors across different climates and wr ranges and ii overfitting for individual treatments without aggregation may increase model bias and simulation errors when transferring the overfitted parameters sets to the validation treatments a limitation of many crop yield modeling studies is that they usually attempt to calibrate their models based on single or multiple years of experiment and then validate the models on separate single or multiple years not included in the calibration process while this may be good for capturing the climatic variability across different growing seasons it could lead to overfitting or lack of generalization across different climatic and wr combinations especially if only two or three years of data were used our study attempted to overcome this limitation by aggregating the most sensitive parameters across different climatic wet 2019 versus dry 2020 and irrigation combinations 16 different irrigation treatments in both 2019 and 2020 based on an mpo approach which puts uncertainty limits on observed crop yield and also puts constraints on the deviations of the most sensitive parameters from default values since multiple climate both years and wr combinations were used in calibration and validation in our study parameter aggregations as in sim 2 up to sim 5 helped balance model accuracy and robustness it is worthy to note that a limitation of hybrid maize model is that it does not account for possible yield losses from factors such as poor soil quality water logging weed competition insects diseases lodging and other stresses although the hybrid maize model has been used and validated in many climatic and agronomic environments and conditions yang et al 2004 grassini et al 2009 some of the model s current assumptions used in our study where irrigation was the major yield determining factor may not be totally valid in cropping systems where nitrogen and other factors play key roles on crop growth and development nevertheless due to the reason that the default parameters in the model had already been well calibrated in the u s corn belt and they require minor re calibration for region specific purposes the simulation results can serve as a guide for further experimental research although our cultivar specific re calibrated model performed well for different irrigation treatments in two years with different seasonal precipitation totals 536 mm and 229 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively there is a need to carry out extra validation by applying the model to other maize cultivars in multiple locations during multiple years particularly when the model is being used for in season management rather than end of season yield estimation 4 summary and conclusions this study demonstrated the use of a new mpo approach coupled with near real space time information from multiple in situ sensors for improving maize yield simulations under different irrigation managements here we applied a relatively simple crop model hybrid maize in simulating yield responses under different water regimes at plot scale of all model parameters considered three sensitivity analyses showed that yield simulations were most sensitive to the initial light use efficiency lue potential number of kernels per ear g2 potential kernel filling rate g5 growth respiration coefficient of grain grg empirical parameter determining the relative contribution of a soil layer to water uptake slw and maximum photosynthetic rate mpr due to the minimal impact of nitrogen on yield in our study the results of our model calibration and validation were based on wr precipitation irrigation our initial results showed that using default parameters did not accurately simulate maize yield hence the need for re calibration we later improved the calibration and optimization of multiple parameters in the hybrid maize model by using a stepwise kriging method based on the parameter values which satisfied three mpo constraints in individual treatments aggregating the local parameters across two growing seasons improved the ability of the model to simulate yield in terms of smaller me rmse urmse and nrmse over a wide range of wr conditions the strong linear relationships observed between wr and the top four sensitive parameters suggest that using dynamic parameters appears to be a satisfactory way to improve model success this will be experimentally explored further to improve the process based structure of the model future studies will also focus on applying our mpo approach to multiple locations during multiple years particularly

9691,current how to use limited water resources efficiently and improve agricultural water use efficiency has become one of the greatest challenges for global food security in this study multiple site years of carbon and water flux data across the major crops including maize winter wheat and soybean were used to quantify the variability in canopy scale transpiration t ecosystem scale evapotranspiration et as well as the associated water use efficiencies wuet and wueet on the basis of et partitioning the results indicated that the transpiration ratio t et as well as t and et exhibited an obvious single peak seasonal pattern across the typical croplands however at the early and late growing stages there existed large discrepancies in t and et owing to low vegetation coverage while t and et were very close during the peak period among them maize exhibited the largest t et by 0 50 0 12 followed by soybean of 0 43 0 08 and winter wheat of 0 38 0 09 respectively furthermore the coupling relationships between gross primary productivity gpp and water fluxes including t and et changed from linear to nonlinear the study also found that the variability in wuet and wueet were not consistent specifically wueet showed distinct seasonal characteristic whereas wuet kept constant as a plateau almost throughout the growth period which reflected the inherent physiological property controlled by plant stomata at the canopy scale among these crops maize exhibited the largest wuet and wueet 5 30 0 89 and 2 48 1 14 g c kg 1 h2o followed by winter wheat 4 97 1 52 and 2 35 0 64 g c kg 1 h2o and soybean 4 88 1 59 and 1 89 0 99 g c kg 1 h2o respectively keywords crop species transpiration evapotranspiration water use efficiency precision agriculture 1 introduction detection of impacts on agriculture caused by global climate change has increased substantially in the past decades which is critical for designing and evaluating climate mitigation and adaptation measures song et al 2021 with increasing global surface temperature terrestrial et generally increased and soil moisture reduced resulting in the available water resource more stressed in agricultural ecosystems and decreasing grain reserves seriously jiang 2009 liu et al 2016 ullah et al 2019 therefore the widespread rapid and intensifying climate change has threatened global food security as a result of global population increase and changing demand how to use limited water resources more efficiently and improve agricultural water use efficiency has become the focus of grain production wallace 2000 dietzel et al 2016 wang et al 2018 water use efficiency wue reflects the capacity of croplands to produce biomass through vegetation photosynthesis per unit of water consumption by plant t or ecosystem level et tang et al 2014 depending on different research scales cropland wue can be divided into three levels leaf canopy and ecosystem blum 2005 niu et al 2011 as an especially important determinant of crop productivity the variability in wue describes the tradeoff process between water loss and carbon sequestration lan et al 2021 specifically carbon uptake by plant photosynthesis was accompanied by water dissipation to regulate the water carbon balance between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere berry et al 2010 mu et al 2011 ito and inatomi 2012 all these carbon and water cycling processes are essentially vulnerable to the effect of environmental changes especially for the semi artificial cropland ecosystems scanlon and albertson 2004 xu et al 2018 in the field some farmers have to reduce water use and select drought resistant crops achieving water saving agriculture zhao et al 2017 the eddy covariance based flux towers can directly and continuously measure terrestrial carbon and water fluxes at site scale which provides a feasible way to monitor the key processes of et and wueet wueet gpp et of farmland ecosystems yu et al 2014 tang et al 2015 currently a few flux sites have been established at the main croplands including corn soybean and wheat such observations can be further processed to standardized gpp and et products zhou et al 2015 tang et al 2017 essentially water loss through et in agroecosystem was mainly comprised of plant t and soil evaporation e fisher et al 2008 maxwell and condon 2016 moreover t is recognized as the dominant component of et which is more related to vegetation growth and biomass accumulation schlesinger and jasechko 2014 cheng et al 2017 ren et al 2019 therefore it is especially important to improve the inherent wuet wuet gpp t at the canopy scale to alleviate the current water crisis for food security nevertheless direct measurement of the canopy t from cropland remained difficult and complicated scott et al 2017 effectively separating the components of et is a challenge in the field of hydrometeorology which even constrained the deep understanding of interactions between carbon and water cycles scanlon 2008 scanlon and kustas 2010 currently several methods including micro lysimeter sap flow stable isotope and eddy covariance techniques have been developed to measure soil evaporation e vegetation transpiration t and et wang et al 2010 xiao et al 2018 paul limoges et al 2020 however the micro lysimeter method neglected canopy interception evaporation leading to larger estimation of transpiration liu et al 2002 large uncertainty existed in the isotope method for et partitioning owing to a series of assumptions especially when soil evaporation was small this technique was not suitable for agricultural and forest ecosystems griffis 2013 good et al 2014 sap flow can continuously record stand level transpiration but it is difficult to scale up to large scales rafi et al 2019 nowadays the eddy covariance based flux data has been used for partitioning et with relatively accurate results but this method was not widely adopted since it required high frequency 10 20 hz data that is only available to tower owners baldocchi and ryu 2011 wagle et al 2020 a simple method using the widely available half hourly flux data would contribute to et partitioning for different ecosystems based on the concept of underlying water use efficiency uwue zhou et al 2018 developed a novel partitioning method which can estimate t et at various spatiotemporal scales and is simple to apply in practice jiang et al 2020 nelson et al 2020 since the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic globally jointly with the effects of natural disasters such as locust plague drought and flood worldwide the agricultural production is disturbed seriously which even endangers human survival monfreda et al 2008 as the world s major food crops maize is one of the most widely produced and consumed cereal crops followed by wheat and soybean is a high protein plant that people can prepare and eat in a variety of ways to deeply reveal the underlying processes and mechanisms of water and carbon cycles during grain production for improving agricultural water use efficiency we partitioned ecosystem level et based on the concept of underlying water use efficiency and continuous flux observations across the major crop sites the overall aims of this study were 1 to characterize the seasonal dynamics of t et for the maize wheat and soybean croplands as well as their differences during the growing period 2 to analyze the variability in site level gpp and water loss from the canopy t to ecosystem scale et as well as the carbon water coupling relationship 3 to have a better understanding of the carbon water interactions by means of wuet and wueet over crop species and 4 to reveal the underlying influencing factors controlling the transpiration ratio t et wuet and wueet among the three typical cropland ecosystems all these analyses are of great significance for understanding the processes of cropland evapotranspiration and sustainable use of water resources for global food security 2 methods and materials 2 1 description of the flux sites a total of 9 flux sites across three typical croplands soybean maize winter wheat were used for analysis in the study table 1 which can be accessed from the ameriflux chinaflux and european flux network the geographical locations of all sites were also showed in fig s1 the soybean flux sites are comprised of us br3 us ne3 and us bo1 the us br3 site is located in central iowa usa with hot and humid climate in summer and soybean was planted in the odd years john and tim 2016 the us bo1 site lies in the midwestern part of the usa illinois the field cultivated soybean in the even years with temperate continental climate tilden 2016 the us ne3 flux site is placed in the university of nebraska agricultural research and development center near mead nebraska usa this area has similar cropping management as us bo1 where soybean was planted in the even years besides both us ne3 and us bo1 sites rely on natural rainfall for irrigation suyker 2021 three flux sites of maize were used for analysis including cn daman us ne1 and cn yuc the cn daman site lies in the farmland of daman irrigation district in zhangye city gansu province china where has been observed since june 2012 the climate of the region can be characterized as temperate continental arid with abundant heat and light dry and little rain liu et al 2013 the us ne1 is an irrigated continuous maize site one of three experimental fields us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 located within 1 6 km of each other suyker 2021 the last corn site is cn yuc which is situated in the southwest of yucheng city shandong province china the area belongs to warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate with abundant supply of light heat and rainfall occurring in the same period generally winter wheat and summer corn are planted in yucheng station three winter wheat sites were comprised of cn yuc de seh and us arm detailed information about the cn yuc site has been described above the selhausen test site de seh belongs to the southern part of the lower rhine embayment and near the belgium boundary with temperate maritime climate schmidt et al 2012 wang et al 2018 this area is a rotation field and winter wheat was planted from october 2007 to october 2009 the us arm site with humid subtropical climate is situated in northern oklahoma usa in the field winter wheat corn soy and alfalfa have been planted in different years and we only used the winter wheat years for analysis lu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 2 2 flux data preprocessing for each flux site the eddy covariance system continuously records net ecosystem carbon exchange nee and latent heat le at a frequency of 10 hz meanwhile the meteorological data including solar radiation air temperature ta soil temperature moisture wind speed direction relative humidity rh and precipitation are measured at these cropland sites in addition to careful instrument maintenance and periodic calibration the standardized procedures require spike detection lag correction for h2o co2 relative to the vertical wind component density fluctuation correction wpl correction sonic virtual temperature correction and frequency response correction song et al 2016 liu and xu 2018 these 10 hz data were then processed into half hour products by the edire post processing software university of edinburgh edinburgh uk gap filling and flux partitioning by the nighttime based method were carried out with the r package by the max planck institute for biogeochemistry https www bgc jena mpg de bgi index php services reddyprocweb reichstein et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the half hourly gpp et and vpd data were used for et partitioning therefore the flux partition method proposed by reichstein et al 2005 was used to separate nee into the gpp and ecosystem respiration r e gpp was calculated as the sum of observed daytime nee and modeled r e inferred from night time nee the partitioning algorithm extrapolates night time values of r e into the daytime based on short term temperature sensitivity of r e the flow chart of data preprocessing can be seen in fig s2 then the measured latent heat le w m2 fluxes were derived to obtain water consumption et mm day by multiplying a factor of 0 035 which was converted by the formula et le λ λ represents amount of energy to evaporate per unit weight of water 2 454 000 j kg 1 tang et al 2014 wang et al 2018 at canopy or ecosystem scales vapor pressure deficit vpd is almost the same within a uniform environment and it can be calculated by ta and rh data from the flux site romero aranda et al 2006 in addition in order to partition et into e and t data screening and quality control were performed to select half hourly observations in accordance to the following criteria 1 the daylight gpp et and vpd data were used while defective entries were excluded 2 data from rainy days were excluded 3 sensible heat flux larger than 5 w m 2 and incoming shortwave radiation larger than 50 w m 2 were used to avoid stable boundary layer conditions 4 data were selected for each site during the growing season 5 8 day t et values were estimated at least 80 effective entries zhou et al 2016 li et al 2019 2 3 modis data preparation the normalized vegetation index ndvi has been widely used to describe the vegetation growth at different spatial and temporal scales pettorelli et al 2005 wardlow and egber 2008 in this study we used the mod09a1 product v6 over an 8 day interval to calculate time series ndvi https e4ftl01 cr usgs gov molt mod09a1 006 and then derive crop phenological information mod09a1 provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance of bands 1 7 at 500 m resolution corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gases aerosols and rayleigh scattering the near infrared band and red band were used to calculate ndvi gillies et al 1997 zhang et al 2006 the timesat program developed by department of earth and ecosystems sciences lund university was used to extract the phenological parameters including start of growing season sos end of growing season eos and length of the crop growing season due to noise of the clouds and atmosphere it is important to fit and reconstruct the time series ndvi data gu et al 2009 in this study we used the asymmetric gaussian function and a sliding window to obtain the valley and peak values of the ndvi curves cai et al 2017 furthermore sos and eos were defined as 20 of which multiplied by the amplitude of the left and right halves respectively using the dynamic threshold method fig 1 showed the process of extraction at the cn daman site in 2013 and the other sites were analyzed using the same method noteworthy sos of winter wheat was defined at the date when the wheat turned green after winter dormancy zhou et al 2013 guo et al 2016 leaf area index lai quantifies the amount of leaf area in an ecosystem and is a critical variable in processes such as photosynthesis evapotranspiration and precipitation interception alton 2016 the study used the mod15a2h lai v6 dataset at 8 day intervals to analyze the effect of vegetation status on the variability in t et at all cropland sites mod15a2h algorithm exploited the spectral information including modis red and near infrared surface retrieved reflectance and a radiative transfer equation generated based a look up table knyazikhin et al 1998 which has experienced substantial improvements till now fang et al 2019 2 4 process for partitioning et water consumptions from e t and et are essentially associated with non stomatal stomatal and stomatal non stomatal mixing behaviors respectively zhu et al 2015 drake et al 2017 t is controlled by stomatal regulation whereas e is only related to soil and environmental conditions the concept of wue includes ecosystem level wue wueet and canopy scale transpiration efficiency wuet wueet is defined as carbon uptake gpp per unit of water loss by et and wuet is defined as gpp per unit of water loss through t thus the ratio of wueet to wuet can be determined by t et wueet can be calculated directly from tower based flux observations which made t et crucial to derive wuet referring to the novel partitioning method developed by zhou et al 2018 this study also defined the uwuep and uwuea to represent the potential water use efficiency and apparent water use efficiency respectively here t et can be calculated by dividing uwuea to uwuep as follows 1 u w u e p g p p v p d t 2 u w u e a g p p v p d e t 3 t e t u w u e a u w u e p 4 t u w u e a u w u e p e t the uwuep and uwuea were estimated with all and 8 day period half hourly gpp vpd and et data at the cropland sites using the quantile regression and linear regression method respectively in addition the intercepts of both quantile and linear regressions were set to zero taking the site us ne3 as an example fig 2a the long term mean uwuep was estimated as the regression slope of the 95th quantile regression using all half hourly data from the site therefore the uwuep was 12 28 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o then the regression slope using half hourly data for a particular 8 day period was estimated to represent a typical 8 day uwuea value for the site as shown in fig 2b the value was 6 67 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o for doy 193 200 in 2008 so the ratio of t et was 0 54 for the 8 day period 2 5 statistical analysis two models including quantile regression and linear regression were used to derive the values of uwuep and uwuea by spss 26 0 chicago il usa respectively then we can acquire the seasonal variations in t et for each flux site to test the relationship between t et and lai across these typical croplands the regression model jointly with relevant coefficient of determination r 2 were used for evaluation r 2 indicated the overall explanatory ability of regression model in explaining the variability of t et data subsequently to reveal the differences in response mechanism of wuet and wueet to gpp t and et among different crops the pearson correlation coefficient r was performed generally a value of r close to 1 indicated a strong positive linear relationship as it passed the significance test 3 results 3 1 t et of typical croplands over 8 day period fig 3 illustrated the seasonal variations in t et across the typical cropland sites including soybean maize and winter wheat respectively as a proxy for the transpiration ratio t et exhibited a single peak curve over all these crops which was also well captured by the time series modis lai data at the soybean and maize sites t et nearly co varied with lai over an 8 day interval as the crops grew both t et and lai increased rapidly from the end of april reached the peaks in july of the year and then gradually decreased with leaf withering in autumn fig s3 owing to different agricultural planting systems the main growing period of winter wheat is the first half of next year after winter dormancy similar to the other crops the variability in t et also exhibited an obvious single peak pattern and climbed to the maximum around mid april therefore this study confirmed that t et varied consistently with lai across all cropland sites nevertheless the magnitudes of t et have contrasting heterogeneity because of differences in crop species climate zones and irrigation regimes especially for the cn yuc site winter wheat maize double cropping is an important rotation system in the north china plain which resulted in larger t et for both maize and winter wheat compared to other sites fig 4 despite of the same environment conditions between the us ne3 and us ne1 sites multi year mean t et of soybean was obviously lower than that of maize by 21 9 which proved that c4 crop has relatively higher t et value in comparison with c3 crop the low t et at the cn daman maize site can be ascribed to the effect of arid climate characteristic in this region overall multiple site years of flux data inferred that maize has the largest t et by 0 50 followed by soybean of 0 43 and winter wheat of 0 38 respectively 3 2 seasonal variations in gpp et and t of typical croplands dynamics of gpp et and t over an 8 day period for soybean maize and winter wheat croplands exhibited distinct seasonal trends fig 5 on the onset time when seeds of soybean and maize are sown in spring the photosynthetic activity of vegetation was weak subsequently gpp gradually increased with crop growth reached peak in summer approximately woy27 and decreased again as the crop matured in autumn however the seasonality of winter wheat was entirely different the gpp values were close to 0 g c m 2 d 1 during winter dormancy increased rapidly as the temperature rose in spring peaked in early may and then gradually decreased till the start of june us arm and cn yuc or july de seh despite of different magnitudes the variabilities in t and et at the three crops also showed similar seasonal patterns to gpp both et and t changed jointly with gpp meanwhile this study found that the maximum gpp of maize c4 crop was apparently larger than that of the other c3 crops 26 1 g c m 2 d 1 against 17 4 g c m 2 d 1 due to stronger carbon sequestration capacity in addition the results showed the largest gpp et and t values in maize crops for all sites with 8 96 2 17 g c m 2 d 1 3 03 0 35 and 1 70 0 27 mm d 1 followed by winter wheat 7 62 2 60 g c m 2 d 1 2 67 0 72 and 1 34 0 32 mm d 1 with the lowest values in soybean of 5 78 1 95 g c m 2 d 1 2 4 0 28 and 1 30 0 27 mm d 1 during the early and late stages of growing period owing to low vegetation coverage the water consumed by soil evaporation occupied a large proportion of et however as vegetation grew the water consumed by vegetation t gradually exceeded soil evaporation and became the main component of et then t and et were very close at the peak period with the relative difference of 15 6 11 8 the study also examined the pattern of the water carbon relationship at these cropland sites in fig 6 during the whole growing season for all sites 8 day gpp and t presented a strong positive linear correlation while 8 day gpp and et showed significant nonlinear relationship with r2 of 0 81 and 0 54 respectively generally the almost synchronous variation between gpp and et and between gpp and t as well as the primary control of canopy development and senescence induced a close water carbon coupling however gpp and t indicated a significant positive correlation than the nonlinear relationship of gpp and et due to the high et during early and late growing seasons fig 5 specially the c4 cropland maize had a maximum r2 with 0 84 followed by the c3 cropland including winter wheat 0 83 and soybean 0 80 3 3 comparison between wuet and wueet the variability in wuet and wueet at three typical croplands were shown in fig 7 which illustrated the water carbon relationships and variations from the canopy to ecosystem scale overall wueet at the soybean maize and winter wheat sites had significant seasonal dynamics over an 8 day interval during the growing period contrastingly wuet kept constant as a plateau in the middle stage of crop growing season which reflected the inherently coupling relations to gpp through plant stomata at the canopy scale the extremely low gpp or t at the beginning and ending of crop growing season can explain large fluctuations or anomalous values in wuet over such period the study also compared the magnitudes of multi year mean wuet and wueet for three typical croplands fig 8 since wueet represented water use efficiency of the entire ecosystem including water consumption by soil evaporation whereas wuet was only contributed by vegetation transpiration component wuet was apparently larger than wueet for all crops overall without distinguishing crop types the mean wueet was approximately half of wuet 2 2 g c kg 1 h2o vs 5 0 g c kg 1 h2o additionally it seems that both wuet and wueet of the c4 cropland maize were slightly bigger than the c3 croplands including soybean and winter wheat ranging from 2 8 to 22 2 4 discussion 4 1 effect of the biotic and abiotic factors on t et the ratio of transpiration to total terrestrial evapotranspiration t et plays an important role in the hydrological cycle and in the energy budgets between the biosphere and the atmosphere zhou et al 2014 niu et al 2019 as the primary factor controlling variations in t et an increase in lai by increasing the vegetation coverage area promotes canopy t and interception evaporation thereby leading to the rise in et piao et al 2007 fatichi and pappas 2017 li et al 2018 however increasing lai lowered the amount of energy net radiation reaching the soil surface soil evaporation usually reduced which partly offset the increase in et associated with high lai hu et al 2009 huang et al 2015 gu et al 2018 therefore t and et may have different sensitivities to the changes in lai niu et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 revealed the significantly positive correlations p 0 01 between daily t et and modis lai at four representative winter wheat paddy rice soybean and summer maize sites which were consistent to our results as illustrated in fig 9 the highest r2 between t et and lai of maize reached up to 0 68 at 8 day time scale followed by soybean with 0 63 and the lowest for winter wheat was 0 37 all analyses again indicated that lai dominated the water related et and t cycles previous studies found that when lai is relatively low at the early growing stage an increase in lai caused by crop growth will obviously enhance vegetation photosynthesis jiang et al 2020 and subsequently lead to an increase in wue once lai exceeds the threshold the change in crop t et is limited resulting in the insensitive response of wue to lai zhang et al 2013a 2013b thus lai can influence water use efficiency from canopy to ecosystem scales by adjusting the variability in t et zhang et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 hu et al 2008 kato et al 2004 besides the abiotic factors including ambient atmospheric conditions soil moisture and solar radiation affected the dynamics of t et at daily or seasonal scales good et al 2014 scott and biederman 2017 gao et al 2021 meanwhile niu et al 2019 suggested that temperature change is the most important factor in driving interannual t et trend both nationally and regionally 4 2 contrasting controls on wuet and wueet a deep understanding of the water carbon relationship is critical for model development water and carbon management and decision making for precision agriculture previous studies mostly focused on ecosystem level water consumption and the associated water use efficiency gao et al 2014 wang et al 2018 in this study we investigated the difference in wuet and wueet from the canopy to ecosystem scales across the typical croplands figs 7 and 8 cheng et al 2017 indicated that the increase in carbon uptake was not accompanied by a proportional increase in et which was largely driven by increased wue in terrestrial ecosystem about 90 by comparison with et wang et al 2018 revealed that gpp determined the variability in wueet for croplands throughout the growing season li et al 2019 also indicated that seasonal dynamics in wue was mainly controlled by the carbon flux rather than water flux in shrubland of the northeastern qinghai tibetan plateau china nevertheless other studies suggested that gpp dominated the changes in wueet mainly during the high water carbon coupling strength stage gao et al 2021 our findings are consistent with previous studies at the ecosystem level as illustrated in fig 10 both gpp and et showed significant positive correlation with wueet p 0 01 across the typical croplands however compared with water flux carbon flux played a more important role in dominating the variability in wueet the correlations between wueet and gpp ranged from 0 52 at the winter wheat site to 0 91 at the maize site contrastingly the correlations between wueet and et were apparently lower without distinguishing crop types the correlations between wueet and gpp or et were 0 85 and 0 45 respectively during the early and late growing seasons water and carbon fluxes were primarily determined by the biotic factor such as lai and varied towards a concurrent trend but the amplitude of variation of the carbon flux was slightly larger than that of the water flux mainly due to soil evaporation fig 5 in addition our finding further evidenced that the canopy scale wuet had no significant linear correlations with gpp or t in fig 11 as gpp and t varied wuet approached a constant value which indicated that both gpp and t changed in the same proportion the coordinated relationship between gpp and t proved that the seasonal variation of wuet was not related to these two parameters and recognized as the intrinsic characteristic of the plant functional types broeckx et al 2014 as important components of water and carbon fluxes both t and gpp are regulated and closely related through gas diffusion via plant stomata gao et al 2021 mathias and thomas 2021 therefore water and carbon fluxes are inherently coupled at the canopy scale 5 conclusions in this study we applied the uwue method for et partitioning to three typical cropland ecosystems and quantified the variability in water fluxes from the canopy scale to ecosystem scale as well as their associated water use efficiency as a proxy for the transpiration ratio t et exhibited a single peak curve over all three crops time series modis lai data performed great potential for remotely retrieving large scale t et pattern meanwhile multiple site years of flux data inferred that maize has the largest t et by 0 50 followed by soybean of 0 43 and winter wheat of 0 38 respectively the study also indicated that both et and t covaried with the dynamics in gpp yet large discrepancies between t and et became narrow as crops grew furthermore the relationship between gpp and t showed a linear correlation at canopy scale whereas a nonlinear relationship existed between gpp and et at the ecosystem scale in addition wueet of croplands exhibited distinct seasonal patterns during the growing season contrastingly wuet kept constant as a plateau nearly throughout crop growth period which reflected the inherently coupling relations to gpp through plant stomata at the canopy scale despite that the uwue method can be used as an effective tool to estimate t et of croplands further study could evaluate the performance of other methods such as isotope or lysimeter techniques for et partitioning as one of the largest terrestrial biomes on the planet the role of cropland in food security is facing serious threats from global climate change especially for water scarcity problems a deep understanding of the processes of cropland et and sustainable use of water resources is significant for global food security essentially the water consumed by vegetation t is directly associated to grain production several management practices have been implemented to reduce the useless water consumption by bare soil in recent years for example planting green manure crops before spring ploughing sorkheh et al 2020 and returning crop stalks to the field after harvest can largely decrease soil evaporation li et al 2020 therefore this study is helpful for a more profound recognition of the water carbon coupling and provides a new framework for developing water saving

9691,current how to use limited water resources efficiently and improve agricultural water use efficiency has become one of the greatest challenges for global food security in this study multiple site years of carbon and water flux data across the major crops including maize winter wheat and soybean were used to quantify the variability in canopy scale transpiration t ecosystem scale evapotranspiration et as well as the associated water use efficiencies wuet and wueet on the basis of et partitioning the results indicated that the transpiration ratio t et as well as t and et exhibited an obvious single peak seasonal pattern across the typical croplands however at the early and late growing stages there existed large discrepancies in t and et owing to low vegetation coverage while t and et were very close during the peak period among them maize exhibited the largest t et by 0 50 0 12 followed by soybean of 0 43 0 08 and winter wheat of 0 38 0 09 respectively furthermore the coupling relationships between gross primary productivity gpp and water fluxes including t and et changed from linear to nonlinear the study also found that the variability in wuet and wueet were not consistent specifically wueet showed distinct seasonal characteristic whereas wuet kept constant as a plateau almost throughout the growth period which reflected the inherent physiological property controlled by plant stomata at the canopy scale among these crops maize exhibited the largest wuet and wueet 5 30 0 89 and 2 48 1 14 g c kg 1 h2o followed by winter wheat 4 97 1

introduction detection of impacts on agriculture caused by global climate change has increased substantially in the past decades which is critical for designing and evaluating climate mitigation and adaptation measures song et al 2021 with increasing global surface temperature terrestrial et generally increased and soil moisture reduced resulting in the available water resource more stressed in agricultural ecosystems and decreasing grain reserves seriously jiang 2009 liu et al 2016 ullah et al 2019 therefore the widespread rapid and intensifying climate change has threatened global food security as a result of global population increase and changing demand how to use limited water resources more efficiently and improve agricultural water use efficiency has become the focus of grain

consumption by plant t or ecosystem level et tang et al 2014 depending on different research scales cropland wue can be divided into three levels leaf canopy and ecosystem blum 2005 niu et al 2011 as an especially important determinant of crop productivity the variability in wue describes the tradeoff process between water loss and carbon sequestration lan et al 2021 specifically carbon uptake by plant photosynthesis was accompanied by water dissipation to regulate the water carbon balance between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere berry et al 2010 mu et al 2011 ito and inatomi 2012 all these carbon and water cycling processes are essentially vulnerable to the effect of environmental changes especially for the semi artificial cropland ecosystems scanlon and albertson 2004 xu et al 2018 in the field some farmers have to reduce water use and select drought resistant crops achieving water saving agriculture zhao et al 2017 the eddy covariance based flux towers can directly and continuously measure terrestrial carbon and water fluxes at site scale which provides a feasible way to monitor the key processes of et and wueet wueet gpp et of farmland ecosystems yu et al 2014 tang et al 2015 currently a few flux sites have been established at the main croplands including corn soybean and wheat such observations can be further processed to standardized gpp and et products zhou et al 2015 tang et al 2017 essentially water loss through et in agroecosystem was mainly comprised of plant t and soil evaporation e fisher et al 2008 maxwell and condon 2016 moreover t is recognized as the dominant component of et which is more related to vegetation growth and biomass accumulation schlesinger and jasechko 2014 cheng et al 2017 ren et al 2019 therefore it is especially important to improve the inherent wuet wuet gpp t at the canopy scale to alleviate the current water crisis for food security nevertheless direct measurement of the canopy t from cropland remained difficult and complicated scott et al 2017 effectively separating the components of et is a challenge in the field of hydrometeorology which even constrained the deep understanding of interactions between carbon and water cycles scanlon 2008 scanlon and kustas 2010 currently several methods including micro lysimeter sap flow stable isotope and eddy covariance techniques have been developed to measure soil evaporation e vegetation transpiration t and et wang et al 2010 xiao et al 2018 paul limoges et al 2020 however the micro lysimeter method neglected canopy interception evaporation leading to larger estimation of transpiration liu et al 2002 large uncertainty existed in the isotope method for et partitioning owing to a series of assumptions especially when soil evaporation was small this technique was not suitable for agricultural and forest ecosystems griffis 2013 good et al 2014 sap flow can continuously record stand level transpiration but it is difficult to scale up to large scales rafi et al 2019 nowadays the eddy covariance based flux data has been used for partitioning et with relatively accurate results but this method was not widely adopted since it required high frequency 10 20 hz data that is only available to tower owners baldocchi and ryu 2011 wagle et al 2020 a simple method using the widely available half hourly flux data would contribute to et partitioning for different ecosystems based on the concept of underlying water use efficiency uwue zhou et al 2018 developed a novel partitioning method which can estimate t et at various spatiotemporal scales and is simple to apply in practice jiang et al 2020 nelson et al 2020 since the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic globally jointly with the effects of natural disasters such as locust plague drought and flood worldwide the agricultural production is disturbed seriously which even endangers human survival monfreda et al 2008 as the world s major food crops maize is one of the most widely produced and consumed cereal crops followed by wheat and soybean is a high protein plant that people can prepare and eat in a variety of ways to deeply reveal the underlying processes and mechanisms of water and carbon cycles during grain production for improving agricultural water use efficiency we partitioned ecosystem level et based on the concept of underlying water use efficiency and continuous flux observations across the major crop sites the overall aims of this study were 1 to characterize the seasonal dynamics of t et for the maize wheat and soybean croplands as well as their differences during the growing period 2 to analyze the variability in site level gpp and water loss from the canopy t to ecosystem scale et as well as the carbon water coupling relationship 3 to have a better understanding of the carbon water interactions by means of wuet and wueet over crop species and 4 to reveal the underlying influencing factors controlling the transpiration ratio t et wuet and wueet among the three typical cropland ecosystems all these analyses are of great significance for understanding the processes of cropland evapotranspiration and sustainable use of water resources for global food security 2 methods and materials 2 1 description of the flux sites a total of 9 flux sites across three typical croplands soybean maize winter wheat were used for analysis in the study table 1 which can be accessed from the ameriflux chinaflux and european flux network the geographical locations of all sites were also showed in fig s1 the soybean flux sites are comprised of us br3 us ne3 and us bo1 the us br3 site is located in central iowa usa with hot and humid climate in summer and soybean was planted in the odd years john and tim 2016 the us bo1 site lies in the midwestern part of the usa illinois the field cultivated soybean in the even years with temperate continental climate tilden 2016 the us ne3 flux site is placed in the university of nebraska agricultural research and development center near mead nebraska usa this area has similar cropping management as us bo1 where soybean was planted in the even years besides both us ne3 and us bo1 sites rely on natural rainfall for irrigation suyker 2021 three flux sites of maize were used for analysis including cn daman us ne1 and cn yuc the cn daman site lies in the farmland of daman irrigation district in zhangye city gansu province china where has been observed since june 2012 the climate of the region can be characterized as temperate continental arid with abundant heat and light dry and little rain liu et al 2013 the us ne1 is an irrigated continuous maize site one of three experimental fields us ne1 us ne2 and us ne3 located within 1 6 km of each other suyker 2021 the last corn site is cn yuc which is situated in the southwest of yucheng city shandong province china the area belongs to warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate with abundant supply of light heat and rainfall occurring in the same period generally winter wheat and summer corn are planted in yucheng station three winter wheat sites were comprised of cn yuc de seh and us arm detailed information about the cn yuc site has been described above the selhausen test site de seh belongs to the southern part of the lower rhine embayment and near the belgium boundary with temperate maritime climate schmidt et al 2012 wang et al 2018 this area is a rotation field and winter wheat was planted from october 2007 to october 2009 the us arm site with humid subtropical climate is situated in northern oklahoma usa in the field winter wheat corn soy and alfalfa have been planted in different years and we only used the winter wheat years for analysis lu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 2 2 flux data preprocessing for each flux site the eddy covariance system continuously records net ecosystem carbon exchange nee and latent heat le at a frequency of 10 hz meanwhile the meteorological data including solar radiation air temperature ta soil temperature moisture wind speed direction relative humidity rh and precipitation are measured at these cropland sites in addition to careful instrument maintenance and periodic calibration the standardized procedures require spike detection lag correction for h2o co2 relative to the vertical wind component density fluctuation correction wpl correction sonic virtual temperature correction and frequency response correction song et al 2016 liu and xu 2018 these 10 hz data were then processed into half hour products by the edire post processing software university of edinburgh edinburgh uk gap filling and flux partitioning by the nighttime based method were carried out with the r package by the max planck institute for biogeochemistry https www bgc jena mpg de bgi index php services reddyprocweb reichstein et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the half hourly gpp et and vpd data were used for et partitioning therefore the flux partition method proposed by reichstein et al 2005 was used to separate nee into the gpp and ecosystem respiration r e gpp was calculated as the sum of observed daytime nee and modeled r e inferred from night time nee the partitioning algorithm extrapolates night time values of r e into the daytime based on short term temperature sensitivity of r e the flow chart of data preprocessing can be seen in fig s2 then the measured latent heat le w m2 fluxes were derived to obtain water consumption et mm day by multiplying a factor of 0 035 which was converted by the formula et le λ λ represents amount of energy to evaporate per unit weight of water 2 454 000 j kg 1 tang et al 2014 wang et al 2018 at canopy or ecosystem scales vapor pressure deficit vpd is almost the same within a uniform environment and it can be calculated by ta and rh data from the flux site romero aranda et al 2006 in addition in order to partition et into e and t data screening and quality control were performed to select half hourly observations in accordance to the following criteria 1 the daylight gpp et and vpd data were used while defective entries were excluded 2 data from rainy days were excluded 3 sensible heat flux larger than 5 w m 2 and incoming shortwave radiation larger than 50 w m 2 were used to avoid stable boundary layer conditions 4 data were selected for each site during the growing season 5 8 day t et values were estimated at least 80 effective entries zhou et al 2016 li et al 2019 2 3 modis data preparation the normalized vegetation index ndvi has been widely used to describe the vegetation growth at different spatial and temporal scales pettorelli et al 2005 wardlow and egber 2008 in this study we used the mod09a1 product v6 over an 8 day interval to calculate time series ndvi https e4ftl01 cr usgs gov molt mod09a1 006 and then derive crop phenological information mod09a1 provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance of bands 1 7 at 500 m resolution corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gases aerosols and rayleigh scattering the near infrared band and red band were used to calculate ndvi gillies et al 1997 zhang et al 2006 the timesat program developed by department of earth and ecosystems sciences lund university was used to extract the phenological parameters including start of growing season sos end of growing season eos and length of the crop growing season due to noise of the clouds and atmosphere it is important to fit and reconstruct the time series ndvi data gu et al 2009 in this study we used the asymmetric gaussian function and a sliding window to obtain the valley and peak values of the ndvi curves cai et al 2017 furthermore sos and eos were defined as 20 of which multiplied by the amplitude of the left and right halves respectively using the dynamic threshold method fig 1 showed the process of extraction at the cn daman site in 2013 and the other sites were analyzed using the same method noteworthy sos of winter wheat was defined at the date when the wheat turned green after winter dormancy zhou et al 2013 guo et al 2016 leaf area index lai quantifies the amount of leaf area in an ecosystem and is a critical variable in processes such as photosynthesis evapotranspiration and precipitation interception alton 2016 the study used the mod15a2h lai v6 dataset at 8 day intervals to analyze the effect of vegetation status on the variability in t et at all cropland sites mod15a2h algorithm exploited the spectral information including modis red and near infrared surface retrieved reflectance and a radiative transfer equation generated based a look up table knyazikhin et al 1998 which has experienced substantial improvements till now fang et al 2019 2 4 process for partitioning et water consumptions from e t and et are essentially associated with non stomatal stomatal and stomatal non stomatal mixing behaviors respectively zhu et al 2015 drake et al 2017 t is controlled by stomatal regulation whereas e is only related to soil and environmental conditions the concept of wue includes ecosystem level wue wueet and canopy scale transpiration efficiency wuet wueet is defined as carbon uptake gpp per unit of water loss by et and wuet is defined as gpp per unit of water loss through t thus the ratio of wueet to wuet can be determined by t et wueet can be calculated directly from tower based flux observations which made t et crucial to derive wuet referring to the novel partitioning method developed by zhou et al 2018 this study also defined the uwuep and uwuea to represent the potential water use efficiency and apparent water use efficiency respectively here t et can be calculated by dividing uwuea to uwuep as follows 1 u w u e p g p p v p d t 2 u w u e a g p p v p d e t 3 t e t u w u e a u w u e p 4 t u w u e a u w u e p e t the uwuep and uwuea were estimated with all and 8 day period half hourly gpp vpd and et data at the cropland sites using the quantile regression and linear regression method respectively in addition the intercepts of both quantile and linear regressions were set to zero taking the site us ne3 as an example fig 2a the long term mean uwuep was estimated as the regression slope of the 95th quantile regression using all half hourly data from the site therefore the uwuep was 12 28 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o then the regression slope using half hourly data for a particular 8 day period was estimated to represent a typical 8 day uwuea value for the site as shown in fig 2b the value was 6 67 g c hpa0 5 kg h2o for doy 193 200 in 2008 so the ratio of t et was 0 54 for the 8 day period 2 5 statistical analysis two models including quantile regression and linear regression were used to derive the values of uwuep and uwuea by spss 26 0 chicago il usa respectively then we can acquire the seasonal variations in t et for each flux site to test the relationship between t et and lai across these typical croplands the regression model jointly with relevant coefficient of determination r 2 were used for evaluation r 2 indicated the overall explanatory ability of regression model in explaining the variability of t et data subsequently to reveal the differences in response mechanism of wuet and wueet to gpp t and et among different crops the pearson correlation coefficient r was performed generally a value of r close to 1 indicated a strong positive linear relationship as it passed the significance test 3 results 3 1 t et of typical croplands over 8 day period fig 3 illustrated the seasonal variations in t et across the typical cropland sites including soybean maize and winter wheat respectively as a proxy for the transpiration ratio t et exhibited a single peak curve over all these crops which was also well captured by the time series modis lai data at the soybean and maize sites t et nearly co varied with lai over an 8 day interval as the crops grew both t et and lai increased rapidly from the end of april reached the peaks in july of the year and then gradually decreased with leaf withering in autumn fig s3 owing to different agricultural planting systems the main growing period of winter wheat is the first half of next year after winter dormancy similar to the other crops the variability in t et also exhibited an obvious single peak pattern and climbed to the maximum around mid april therefore this study confirmed that t et varied consistently with lai across all cropland sites nevertheless the magnitudes of t et have contrasting heterogeneity because of differences in crop species climate zones and irrigation regimes especially for the cn yuc site winter wheat maize double cropping is an important rotation system in the north china plain which resulted in larger t et for both maize and winter wheat compared to other sites fig 4 despite of the same environment conditions between the us ne3 and us ne1 sites multi year mean t et of soybean was obviously lower than that of maize by 21 9 which proved that c4 crop has relatively higher t et value in comparison with c3 crop the low t et at the cn daman maize site can be ascribed to the effect of arid climate characteristic in this region overall multiple site years of flux data inferred that maize has the largest t et by 0 50 followed by soybean of 0 43 and winter wheat of 0 38 respectively 3 2 seasonal variations in gpp et and t of typical croplands dynamics of gpp et and t over an 8 day period for soybean maize and winter wheat croplands exhibited distinct seasonal trends fig 5 on the onset time when seeds of soybean and maize are sown in spring the photosynthetic activity of vegetation was weak subsequently gpp gradually increased with crop growth reached peak in summer approximately woy27 and decreased again as the crop matured in autumn however the seasonality of winter wheat was entirely different the gpp values were close to 0 g c m 2 d 1 during winter dormancy increased rapidly as the temperature rose in spring peaked in early may and then gradually decreased till the start of june us arm and cn yuc or july de seh despite of different magnitudes the variabilities in t and et at the three crops also showed similar seasonal patterns to gpp both et and t changed jointly with gpp meanwhile this study found that the maximum gpp of maize c4 crop was apparently larger than that of the other c3 crops 26 1 g c m 2 d 1 against 17 4 g c m 2 d 1 due to stronger carbon sequestration capacity in addition the results showed the largest gpp et and t values in maize crops for all sites with 8 96 2 17 g c m 2 d 1 3 03 0 35 and 1 70 0 27 mm d 1 followed by winter wheat 7 62 2 60 g c m 2 d 1 2 67 0 72 and 1 34 0 32 mm d 1 with the lowest values in soybean of 5 78 1 95 g c m 2 d 1 2 4 0 28 and 1 30 0 27 mm d 1 during the early and late stages of growing period owing to low vegetation coverage the water consumed by soil evaporation occupied a large proportion of et however as vegetation grew the water consumed by vegetation t gradually exceeded soil evaporation and became the main component of et then t and et were very close at the peak period with the relative difference of 15 6 11 8 the study also examined the pattern of the water carbon relationship at these cropland sites in fig 6 during the whole growing season for all sites 8 day gpp and t presented a strong positive linear correlation while 8 day gpp and et showed significant nonlinear relationship with r2 of 0 81 and 0 54 respectively generally the almost synchronous variation between gpp and et and between gpp and t as well as the primary control of canopy development and senescence induced a close water carbon coupling however gpp and t indicated a significant positive correlation than the nonlinear relationship of gpp and et due to the high et during early and late growing seasons fig 5 specially the c4 cropland maize had a maximum r2 with 0 84 followed by the c3 cropland including winter wheat 0 83 and soybean 0 80 3 3 comparison between wuet and wueet the variability in wuet and wueet at three typical croplands were shown in fig 7 which illustrated the water carbon relationships and variations from the canopy to ecosystem scale overall wueet at the soybean maize and winter wheat sites had significant seasonal dynamics over an 8 day interval during the growing period contrastingly wuet kept constant as a plateau in the middle stage of crop growing season which reflected the inherently coupling relations to gpp through plant stomata at the canopy scale the extremely low gpp or t at the beginning and ending of crop growing season can explain large fluctuations or anomalous values in wuet over such period the study also compared the magnitudes of multi year mean wuet and wueet for three typical croplands fig 8 since wueet represented water use efficiency of the entire ecosystem including water consumption by soil evaporation whereas wuet was only contributed by vegetation transpiration component wuet was apparently larger than wueet for all crops overall without distinguishing crop types the mean wueet was approximately half of wuet 2 2 g c kg 1 h2o vs 5 0 g c kg 1 h2o additionally it seems that both wuet and wueet of the c4 cropland maize were slightly bigger than the c3 croplands including soybean and winter wheat ranging from 2 8 to 22 2 4 discussion 4 1 effect of the biotic and abiotic factors on t et the ratio of transpiration to total terrestrial evapotranspiration t et plays an important role in the hydrological cycle and in the energy budgets between the biosphere and the atmosphere zhou et al 2014 niu et al 2019 as the primary factor controlling variations in t et an increase in lai by increasing the vegetation coverage area promotes canopy t and interception evaporation thereby leading to the rise in et piao et al 2007 fatichi and pappas 2017 li et al 2018 however increasing lai lowered the amount of energy net radiation reaching the soil surface soil evaporation usually reduced which partly offset the increase in et associated with high lai hu et al 2009 huang et al 2015 gu et al 2018 therefore t and et may have different sensitivities to the changes in lai niu et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 revealed the significantly positive correlations p 0 01 between daily t et and modis lai at four representative winter wheat paddy rice soybean and summer maize sites which were consistent to our results as illustrated in fig 9 the highest r2 between t et and lai of maize reached up to 0 68 at 8 day time scale followed by soybean with 0 63 and the lowest for winter wheat was 0 37 all analyses again indicated that lai dominated the water related et and t cycles previous studies found that when lai is relatively low at the early growing stage an increase in lai caused by crop growth will obviously enhance vegetation photosynthesis jiang et al 2020 and subsequently lead to an increase in wue once lai exceeds the threshold the change in crop t et is limited resulting in the insensitive response of wue to lai zhang et al 2013a 2013b thus lai can influence water use efficiency from canopy to ecosystem scales by adjusting the variability in t et zhang et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 hu et al 2008 kato et al 2004 besides the abiotic factors including ambient atmospheric conditions soil moisture and solar radiation affected the dynamics of t et at daily or seasonal scales good et al 2014 scott and biederman 2017 gao et al 2021 meanwhile niu et al 2019 suggested that temperature change is the most important factor in driving interannual t et trend both nationally and regionally 4 2 contrasting controls on wuet and wueet a deep understanding of the water carbon relationship is critical for model development water and carbon management and decision making for precision agriculture previous studies mostly focused on ecosystem level water consumption and the associated water use efficiency gao et al 2014 wang et al 2018 in this study we investigated the difference in wuet and wueet from the canopy to ecosystem scales across the typical croplands figs 7 and 8 cheng et al 2017 indicated that the increase in carbon uptake was not accompanied by a proportional increase in et which was largely driven by increased wue in terrestrial ecosystem about 90 by comparison with et wang et al 2018 revealed that gpp determined the variability in wueet for croplands throughout the growing season li et al 2019 also indicated that seasonal dynamics in wue was mainly controlled by the carbon flux rather than water flux in shrubland of the northeastern qinghai tibetan plateau china nevertheless other studies suggested that gpp dominated the changes in wueet mainly during the high water carbon coupling strength stage gao et al 2021 our findings are consistent with previous studies at the ecosystem level as illustrated in fig 10 both gpp and et showed significant positive correlation with wueet p 0 01 across the typical croplands however compared with water flux carbon flux played a more important role in dominating the variability in wueet the correlations between wueet and gpp ranged from 0 52 at the winter wheat site to 0 91 at the maize site contrastingly the correlations between wueet and et were apparently lower without distinguishing crop types the correlations between wueet and gpp or et were 0 85 and 0 45 respectively during the early and late growing seasons water and carbon fluxes were primarily determined by the biotic factor such as lai and varied towards a concurrent trend but the amplitude of variation of the carbon flux was slightly larger than that of the water flux mainly due to soil evaporation fig 5 in addition our finding further evidenced that the canopy scale wuet had no significant linear correlations with gpp or t in fig 11 as gpp and t varied wuet approached a constant value which indicated that both gpp and t changed in the same proportion the coordinated relationship between gpp and t proved that the seasonal variation of wuet was not related to these two parameters and recognized as the intrinsic characteristic of the plant functional types broeckx et al 2014 as important components of water and carbon fluxes both t and gpp are regulated and closely related through gas diffusion via plant stomata gao et al 2021 mathias and thomas 2021 therefore water and carbon fluxes are inherently coupled at the canopy scale 5 conclusions in this study we applied the uwue method for et partitioning to three typical cropland ecosystems and quantified the variability in water fluxes from the canopy scale to ecosystem scale as well as their associated water use efficiency as a proxy for the transpiration ratio t et exhibited a single peak curve over all three crops time series modis lai data performed great potential for remotely retrieving large scale t et pattern meanwhile multiple site years of flux data inferred that maize has the largest t et by 0 50 followed by soybean of 0 43 and winter wheat of 0 38 respectively the study also indicated that both et and t covaried with the dynamics in gpp yet large discrepancies between t and et became narrow as crops grew furthermore the relationship between gpp and t showed a linear correlation at canopy scale whereas a nonlinear relationship existed between gpp and et at the ecosystem scale in addition wueet of croplands exhibited distinct seasonal patterns during the growing season contrastingly wuet kept constant as a plateau nearly throughout crop growth period which reflected the inherently coupling relations to gpp through plant stomata at the canopy scale despite that the uwue method can be used as an effective tool to estimate t et of croplands further study could evaluate the performance of other methods such as isotope or lysimeter techniques for et partitioning as one of the largest terrestrial biomes on the planet the role of cropland in food security is facing serious threats from global climate change especially for water scarcity problems a deep understanding of the processes of cropland et and sustainable use of water resources is significant for global food security essentially the water consumed by vegetation t is directly associated to grain production several management practices have been implemented to reduce the useless water consumption by bare soil in recent years for example planting green manure crops before spring ploughing sorkheh et al 2020 and returning crop stalks to the field after harvest can largely decrease soil evaporation li et al 2020 therefore this study is helpful for a more profound recognition of the water carbon coupling and provides a new framework for developing water saving

rapid measurement of these factors facilitates quantification of etc and enables skilled decision making for data driven irrigation our main objective was to quantify the performance of different modeling approaches for forecasting seasonal etc using meteorological and vegetative data e g leaf area from five consecutive growing seasons 2013 2017 of vitis vinifera cabernet sauvignon vines time series of etc was acquired from water balance from vines grown in drainage lysimeters within the vineyard etc forecasts were generated for each season using twelve regression models six linear and six non linear multivariate adaptive regression spline mars models each regression model constituted a unique combination of variables some relying on crop coefficient kc and others based on direct etc forecasting the models were trained using data from four growing seasons and compared via measures of coefficient of determination r2 residual standard deviation and coefficient of variation each model was then tested using etc forecasts for a fifth growing season and compared to the measured etc values using correlation root mean squared error rmse and normalized rmse finally a mean seasonal rolling rmse with a window of 7 days was used to assess the accuracy of the different models the results show a clear advantage to using non linear modeling for etc forecasting average rmse range of 0 81 1 05 vs 0 64 0 71 mm day 1 respectively furthermore direct forecasting and kc based methods yielded similar results and all models benefited from the incorporation of leaf area data similar outcomes were found for the rolling rmse analysis with improved model accuracy credited to the inclusion of leaf area especially early in the season our findings confirm that advanced algorithms promote site specific and location oriented irrigation management keywords crop evapotranspiration lysimeters statistical modeling multivariate analysis meteorological variables leaf area index vitis

assessments of the vineyard water demands montoro et al 2016 and the ability to quantify etc or crop evapotranspiration etc lópez urrea et al 2006 etc is affected by various meteorological variables mvs availability of soil water as well as plant size and physiology monitoring and assessing grapevine etc is highly challenging with measurements conducted using various approaches including direct measurement with weighing lópez urrea et al 2012 williams and ayars 2005 and drainage lysimeters evans et al 1993 munitz et al 2016 2019 or calculation based on closure of water or energy balance equations the latter methods include eddy covariance ortega farias et al 2010 bowen ratio zhang et al 2007 surface renewal castellvi and snyder 2010 and two source temperature based models kustas et al 2019 a crop coefficient kc is commonly used to schedule irrigation based on reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 the crop coefficient can be derived by quantifying the ratio between etc and the penman monteith eto allen et al 1998 when etc is unknown various kc recommendations for specific cultivars regions and periods exist guerra et al 2016 however these are mostly general snyder et al 2000 and often are not accurate enough for precise site specific management in recent years efforts have been made to construct a framework for etc assessments using a direct approach this approach uses a set of mvs that are associated to et as predictors to etc estimation and assessment ohana levi et al 2020a and may be applied where accurate etc and mv measurements are available thus enabling model training for etc assessments in other locations with similar characteristics and crops this framework has been applied successfully in grapevines ohana levi et al 2020a shtein et al 2021 as well as in other crops such as potatoes aghajanloo et al 2013 vegetable green beans and hazelnuts kelley and pardyjak 2019 maize tang et al 2018 and strawberry in greenhouses gavilán et al 2015 mostly using complex modeling and machine learning algorithms in addition to mvs etc is affected by canopy structure shape volume and other geometric characteristics liu et al 2018 martínez cob and faci 2010 in deciduous plants such as grapevines there is a swift increase in leaf area at the beginning of the growing season munitz et al 2019 which causes corresponding rapid changes to the levels of etc ohana levi 2021 in specific periods of the season changes in canopy cover may occur over shorter time intervals than changes in meteorological conditions therefore strongly affecting etc during these times ohana levi et al 2020b strong relations between canopy area and water demand in grapevines have been documented in the literature netzer et al 2009 and williams et al 2003 found linear agreements between leaf area index lai and kc for table grapevines superior seedless in israel and thompson seedless in california respectively similar relationships were found for wine grapevines in israel for cabernet sauvignon by munitz et al 2016 2019 and in spain for tempranillo by lópez urrea et al 2012 therefore representing canopy area in addition to mvs in models for etc assessment may provide valuable information related to etc temporal variability thus adding to model accuracy and reliability complex modeling methods including machine learning algorithms are used for various agricultural applications to solve large non linear problems using multiple variables these methods enable extraction of meaningful knowledge from large datasets and facilitate decision making processes over space and time chlingaryan et al 2018 models for et assessments are based on statistical quantification of the relationship between meteorological variables granata 2019 meteorological and deciduous crop datasets feature cyclic seasonal patterns which are most commonly temporally dependent khanmohammadi et al 2021 temporal dependency or autocorrelation means that the dataset is characterized by clustering of residuals around trendlines autocorrelated time series exhibit slower changes in values than in timesteps tend to change gradually and include a lagging effect which constrains the rate of change mitchell et al 2019 temporal dependence may occur over short or long periods and therefore time scales should be considered carefully when analyzing time series when analyzing time series of factors such as et and mvs as well as crop measurements and their interrelations the temporal variability and patterns of these multi seasonal datasets must be considered for achieving higher forecasting accuracy ohana levi et al 2020b few complex modeling frameworks have been proposed to determine grapevine etc using direct analysis of mvs and crop characteristics ohana levi et al 2020a although there is a growing focus on using such an approach for other crops yamaç and todorovic 2020 the unique phenology of grapevines and the strong impact of precision irrigation on crop revenue in vineyards costa et al 2012 ruiz sanchez et al 2010 necessitate a thorough examination of methods to achieve accurate etc assessments through complex statistical models we propose a comprehensive comparative analysis of linear and non linear models for grapevine etc forecasting a successful model for skilled irrigation may lead to reduction in water use and assist in reaching the target quality and or yield of grapes in the vineyard munitz et al 2020 2016 our main objective was to quantify the performance of modeling approaches for forecasting seasonal etc the study focused on four specific objectives a to compare two regression approaches forecasting etc using regression models with kc as a response variable followed by multiplication by eto values vs forecasting etc directly using different sets of predictors b to compare linear regression with non linear regression models of time series c to assess the sensitivity of etc modeling to different variable combinations and d to evaluate model performance and accuracy levels of all regression models 2 methods 2 1 study site and experimental design the experimental plot is located within the kida commercial vineyard in the central mountain region of israel lat 32 2 n long 35 e 759 m above sea level the vineyard was planted in 2007 with vitis vinfera cv cabernet sauvignon vines with east west row orientation the vines were trained to a vertical shoot positioning trellis system with two foliage wires vine spacing was 1 5 m between vines and 3 m between rows with 2222 vines per hectare the climate in the region is semi arid mediterranean with an annual average of 415 mm rainfall mainly occurring between november and march vine scale etc data was attained from six drainage lysimeters installed in the second row of the kida vineyard fig 1 six containers each 1 47 m3 1 3 m high x 1 2 m diameter were packed with local soil terra rossa composed of 36 4 sand 30 6 silt and 33 clay and bulk density of 1 25 g cm 3 and buried in the soil with their surfaces aligned with the ground level two drainage pipes from the bottom of each container led to a 2 5 m deep underground tunnel located 10 m from the lysimeter tanks outside the vineyard fig 2 a four year old vine from the vineyard was replanted in each container in 2011 the lysimeter vines received similar agrotechnical treatment as the local commercial vineyard excluding irrigation a tailor made computer controller crystalvision kibbutz samar israel was used to separately irrigate each lysimeter 24 irrigation pulses per day to ensure optimum soil water conditions water amounts applied to the lysimeters exceeded the estimated daily etc of vines by 20 30 for more information concerning lysimeter construction and operation see munitz et al 2019 2 2 data collection data was collected during five consecutive growing seasons 2013 2017 from three different sources the first was the lysimeter system specified in subsection 2 1 the second was measured lai and the third was a meteorological station ms located 50 m east of the lysimeter system meteorological data were collected and stored in a data logger cr1000 campbell science logan ut usa some of the variables used in the models were derived by calculations based on other measured variables and the time variables were based on temporal information a total of 14 variables were utilized by the different regression models table 1 as following 2 2 1 meteorological variables temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were acquired from the meteorological station located within the vineyard figure1 the data was measured using sensors located on top of the ms a temperature c and relative humidity rh sensor hmp155 vaisala helsinki finland was located at 2 m height mean temperature tmean was calculated as the mean value between 06 00 and 18 00 each day active transpiration hours minimum tmin and maximum tmax temperature values were recorded for each day respectively mean rh rhmean was calculated as the mean value between 06 00 and 18 00 rhmin and rhmax were the minimum and maximum rh values recorded for each day respectively wind speed m s 1 and direction were measured by a sensor 05103lm young traverse city mi usa located at 10 m height mean wind speed u10mean was calculated as the mean value between 06 00 and 18 00 each day mean wind speed at 2 m height u2 was calculated as the daily mean value after transformation to speed at 2 m using u2 0 75 x u10 eq 47 in allen et al 1998 total solar radiation was derived using a solar radiation pyranometer sensor cm11 kipp zonen dlft the netherlands at 2 m height total daily solar radiation rn was measured at 10 min intervals and accumulated into a daily sum 2 2 2 leaf area index leaf area was represented by leaf area index lai m2 m 2 of the lysimeter grown vines lai was measured weekly during all growing seasons using a canopy analysis system sunscan model ss1 r3 bf3 delta t devices cambridge uk the protocol of the measurements was detailed in munitz et al 2016a and ohana levi et al 2020a the lai values for the six vines in lysimeters were averaged to receive one weekly value to represent the time series linear temporal interpolation was used to generate a daily time series using the zoo package in r zeileis and grothendieck 2005 2 2 3 evapotranspiration and crop coefficient crop evapotranspiration etc mm day 1 was measured using the drainage lysimeters specified in detail in section 2 1 gaps in etc values were interpolated by a moving average algorithm using a 4 day moving window and calculated using the imputets package in r moritz and bartz beielstein 2017 reference evapotranspiration et0 mm day 1 was calculated using meteorological data through the penman monteith equation according to the fao56 recommendations specified in detail in allen et al 1998 eto is defined as water consumed from a fully vegetated surface normally from clipped grass allen 2003 crop coefficient daily kc was calculated by dividing daily values of etc by eto allen 2003 2 2 4 temporal variables and data days of season represented the days during each growing season between april 1 and september 30 thus generating a total of 183 days per growing season this time vector was used to account for temporal autocorrelation explanation in subsection 2 3 phenological growth stages were used to characterize each growing season using segmentation into five stages numbered from 0 to 4 their multi seasonal start date ranges are as follows stage 0 budbreak to flowering between march 25 and april 12 stage 1 flowering to bunch closure between may 3 and may 21 stage 2 bunch closure to veraison between june 12 and june 20 stage 3 veraison to harvest between august 5 and august 13 stage 4 post harvest between august 29 and september 17 determination of the growth stages was detailed in munitz et al 2016a and ohana levi et al 2020b the julian start days of the different phenological stages during each growing season were averaged to achieve a set of representative start dates for each phenological stage the growth stages were used to relate changing performance levels of the models to specific growth stages and were not integrated into the models 2 3 assessment of temporal dependence modeling grapevine etc and its drivers should consider the time dependency and autocorrelated structure of the time series ohana levi et al 2020b if the dataset is indeed temporally autocorrelated then the regression models should control for these temporal patterns and effects therefore each of the numerical variables mvs etc eto kc and lai were checked for non stationarity due to time dependence using the box pierce test box and pierce 1970 at lags 1 3 applied with the stats package in r r core team 2021 2 4 linear models a linear regression model assumes that a dependent variable y is linearly affected by an independent variable x these are simple and interpretable models the relationship between x and y is estimated by a set of coefficients β0 intercept and β1 slope which quantify the degree and direction of the effect of x over y in this study the least squares method was used with the coefficients selected to minimize the sum of squares residuals from y hastie et al 2001 using r r core team 2021 five linear regression models were evaluated four of which were multiple regression models to evaluate etc using different sets of independent variables for each model a time component days variable was integrated to account for the temporal variability and autocorrelation of the model ohana levi et al 2020b two models were a composite of a statistical regression model to evaluate kc followed by a transformation to etc values using the physical penman monteith model by multiplying the evaluated kc values by eto the following sets of variables were used for the linear regression models a etc kc x eto where kc f days ε b etc kc x eto where kc f lai days ε c etc f lai days ε d etc f tmean rhmean u10mean rn days ε e etc f tmean rhmean u10mean rn lai days ε f etc f tmin tmax rhmin rhmax u2 rn lai days ε in model design f the variables are identical to those used to calculate the penman monteith equation 2 5 multivariate adaptive regression spline mars models mars models are designed for non linear non parametric modeling first introduced by friedman 1991 this method combines the advantages of regression trees and spline fitting it replaces the step functions associated with regression trees with piecewise linear basis functions sub regions allowing to model complex relationships between a response variable and its predictors basis functions are defined in pairs using a knot or a value of a predictor variable defining an inflection point coefficients are therefore applied to each of the basis functions and determine the slopes of the non zero sections this enables fitting of different slopes within different parts of a predictor s range more than one knot can characterize a non linear relation between the predictor and the response variable enabling fitting of complex non linear relationships leathwick et al 2006 recursive partitioning regression or stepwise regression procedures are adjusted to provide the best fit to the data and the optimal set of basis functions friedman 1991 the knots are chosen automatically in a forward stepwise form and may be placed at uneven distances from each other at each step the model selects the knot and a set of corresponding coefficients that minimize the residual sum of squares after maximum model size is reached a backwards pruning procedure is applied progressively eliminating the basis functions that contribute the least to model performance during this stage a predictor variable may be completely removed from the model if none of its basis functions contribute strongly to the predictive performance leathwick et al 2006 this regression model was established as highly suitable for moderate sample size data n 1000 and moderate to high dimensions between 3 and 20 friedman 1991 ranking it as an appropriate choice for non linearly analyzing the dataset presented in this study mars was successfully used in studies involving time series of meteorological variables mvs abraham et al 2001 massidda and marrocu 2017 sigauke and chikobvu 2010 and eto estimations ferreira et al 2019 kisi 2016 in this study mars was applied using the earth package in r milborrow 2020 2019 by fitting the six regression models each consisting of a different set of variables as described in section 2 4 a f 2 6 quality assessment of model performance as specified in section 2 2 the dataset consisted of five growing seasons 5 183 days per season the statistics used to evaluate model performance were the following adjusted r2 r2 adj with values ranging between 0 and 1 the higher the values the stronger the variation of etc is explained by the predictors standard deviation of the residuals s res measuring the extent of deviation of the observations around the fitted values lower values indicate a better model fitting coefficient of variation cv calculated as s res divided by the mean value of measured etc representing s res as unitless values ranging between 0 and 1 the higher the value the stronger the deviation from the model fitting forecasting quality was measured by comparison of forecast to measured values therefore to evaluate the predictive power of each of the models the data was split into training and testing sets five times iteratively each time data of four different growing seasons was used to train a model in order to forecast etc values for the fifth season so that etc values were forecast for each season 2013 2017 using the data from the four remaining seasons training set the testing set was then used to validate the forecasted results for the models that included fitting kc values kc was forecast kc forecast and then the etc kc forecast x eto transformation was used when to derive the forecast etc the statistics that were used to evaluate the forecasting power of the model were the following correlation r between forecast and test data values of r range between 1 and 1 higher absolute values indicate stronger relationships between fitted values and test values root mean square error rmse measure the average differences between fitted values and the test values the higher the value the stronger the difference between the fitted values and the test set rmse ratio to the range of the test data rmserange is a measure of rmse normalized to the mean enabling comparison among datasets with different units scales and ranges of values smaller values signify better fitting of the model in comparison to the test set finally a rolling rmse analysis was performed using a seven day bandwidth consecutively calculating the errors for the previous seven days to assess the weekly bias of the forecast values rolling functions are typically applied on ordered observations using a predefined window that is moved over the full sample period zeileis and grothendieck 2005 the rolling rmse statistic was applied on a seven day window since this is a commonly used time gap for irrigation decision making the mean weekly rmse values were calculated based on rolling rmse performed for the forecast values of all seasons and for all models this analysis was conducted by r using package zoo zeileis and grothendieck 2005 2 7 quantification of model uncertainty to assess the extent of over and under estimation of each regression model several measures were calculated for the six different scenarios including values of the variables from four full seasons that were used to forecast the etc or kc values of a fifth growing season the measures for each of the training and testing models total of five were averaged to receive the mean performance measure of each regression model their sd was also calculated to assess the degree of dispersion between the five different scenarios for each regression model the measures used were training correlation which calculates the correlation between etc measured values of the four training seasons and the fitted values of etc the training correlation of each scenario was compared to the correlation between the measured etc values of the forecast year against the forecast values comparison of the two correlation measures enables to assess whether the regression model is trained to provide over or underestimated etc values the differences between the training correlation and the testing correlation was then calculated as well as the absolute values of these differences to assess the overall degree of error in model estimations 3 results 3 1 assessment of variable temporal dependence and selection all the variables were found to have temporal dependence according to the box pierce test at lags of 1 3 for the linear models at the multi seasonal scale some variables were found to be insignificant to the prediction of etc for linear modeling of etc using lai mvs and days the latter was found to be insignificant for the mars model applied with mvs used to calculate eto rn was removed from the model due to its insignificance 3 2 model performance the fitted values of etc or kc generated by the regression models linear and mars were evaluated using three metrics r2 adj s res and cv the findings table 2 discussed hereinafter relate to the averaged results of the five models applied with the datasets of four growing seasons each time for each specific set of variables the mars models performed better than the linear models the kc models based only on days variable had the lowest performance levels and highest cvs incorporating lai into the kc models increased their accuracy and reduced model errors for the linear models r2 and s res of 0 34 and 0 17 vs 0 67 and 0 12 respectively for the mars models r2 and s res of 0 72 and 0 11 vs 0 78 and 0 10 respectively the etc models were more accurate than the kc models performance of etc models improved after incorporating the mvs compared to when lai alone was used the highest accuracy was achieved when mvs and lai were combined into the models with r2 and s res of 0 79 and 0 75 respectively for the linear model and r2 and s res of 0 89 and 0 52 respectively for the mars model the model based on the mvs used for calculating eto in addition to lai also performed slightly better than the model based on averaged daily mvs u10mean tmean rhmean and rn along with lai r2 0 9 vs 0 89 respectively and s res 0 51 vs s res 0 50 respectively with cv 0 14 for both models assessments of forecast quality using the metrics r rmse and rmserange table 3 show that for all forecast growing seasons the mars outperformed the linear models in terms of accuracy two regression models performed best on average the direct forecasting of etc using the mvs lai and days and the mvs used for eto lai and days both modeled with mars these models also deviated the least among the five different forecasting scenarios one per season with rmse 0 11 mm day 1 the worst performance levels were attributed to the linear kc based model incorporating days as the explanatory variable r and rmse of 0 79 and 1 05 mm day 1 respectively followed by the linear model that forecast etc using lai and days as predictors both models had errors exceeding 1 mm day 1 figs 3 and 4 show graphical representation of the forecasting performance for eto based models and direct etc forecasting models respectively for comparison the forecast values were plotted along with measured etc values of the 2016 growing seasons the rolling rmse analysis showed that on weekly intervals the linear models yielded results with much higher bias between measured and forecast values on average than the mars models fig 5 while the rolling rmse range of the linear models was between 0 31 and 1 41 mm day 1 the range for the mars models was 0 21 1 03 mm day 1 rmse analysis for the linear models revealed multiple findings first that the highest rmse on average 0 96 mm day 1 was attributed to the kc model with days as predictor with a range of 0 4 1 4 mm day 1 during stage 0 april rmse was constantly higher than 1 mm day 1 followed by a sharp decrease in rmse which stabilized at around 0 8 mm day 1 during stage 1 may rmse values started increasing in mid june with high sharply fluctuating inaccuracies during the summer months of stage 2 in mid august during stage 3 rmse decreased and reached its minimum value at the end of august the last month of the season stage 4 was characterized by a sharp increase in rmse signifying that the model did not perform well during this stage second kc modeled using lai and days had mean rmse and range of 0 73 and 0 38 1 11 mm day 1 respectively between the end of june and late august mainly during stage 2 rmse reached 0 8 mm day 1 with high fluctuations the beginning and end of the season were characterized by lower rmse values attributed to better model forecasting levels third the direct modeling of etc using lai and days yielded the most unstable rmse sd 0 26 mm day 1 with an overall mean and range of 0 89 and 0 31 1 41 mm day 1 respectively 37 of the season was characterized by rmse 1 mm day 1 and 68 of the season had rmse 0 8 mm day 1 with lower forecasting errors rmse 0 8 mm day 1 during the first month of the season stage 0 fourth etc modeled linearly by the mvs and days had an average rmse of 0 82 mm day 1 ranging between 0 36 and 1 4 mm day 1 the highest inaccuracies of the forecast values were observed during stage 0 until mid may the rest of the season was characterized by lower rmse fluctuating between 0 36 and 1 02 mm day 1 this model performed best during last 45 days of the season with rmse values almost constantly below 0 7 mm day 1 fifth the overall performance of etc modeling using lai mv and days was similar to etc modeled using lai mv used for calculating eto and days with mean and range rmse values of 0 74 and 0 41 1 06 mm day 1 respectively this model was the least variable with sd 0 14 mm day 1 stage 0 was characterized by moderate high rmse decreasing to values 0 5 mm day 1 during stage 1 and gradually increasing to levels 0 8 mm day 1 until the end of stage 2 where the values experienced a decrease this model was characterized by lower forecasting errors at the end of the season the mars models had overall superior performance levels throughout the season with multiple outcomes first most mars models had similar rmse patterns across the season with similar overall statistics mean rmse values ranged between 0 57 and 0 63 mm day 1 the fluctuations were much lower than for the linear models with sd levels ranging between 0 13 and 0 18 mm day 1 the rmse values ranged between 0 21 and 1 03 mm day 1 second the highest mean rmse was attributed to kc modeled by days and etc modeled by lai and days both with rmse 0 63 mm day 1 these models were also characterized by the highest sd 0 16 and 0 18 mm day 1 respectively signifying large deviations along the season together with kc modeled by lai and days sd 0 16 mm day 1 third the forecasting results of kc modeled by days were biased at rmse 0 8 mm day 1 during 20 of the season mostly during stage 0 adding lai reduced the number of days with rmse 0 8 mm day 1 to 12 of the season occurring mostly at the end of may beginning of stage 1 and late july until mid august end of stage 2 fourth direct modeling of etc using lai and days had a bias of over 10 rmse 0 75 mm day 1 during 31 of the season with lower bias at the beginning and end of the season stages 0 3 4 while preserving higher rmse values throughout most of the growing season early may to mid august fifth all of the direct approaches that incorporated mvs into modelling of etc had similar rmse patterns characterized by lower forecasting errors early in the season until the first week of may followed by three rmse peaks 0 75 mm day 1 during late may early stage 1 the beginning of july beginning of stage 2 and the first two weeks of august end of stage 2 finally stages 3 and 4 were characterized by low rmse values for all mars models 0 5 mm day 1 3 3 quantification of model uncertainty quantification of over and under estimation by the models is specified in table 4 this analysis shows the difference between the estimation of the model using fitted values and the actual forecasting performance for each season the results in table 4 show only the mean values for all seasons overall there was very high agreement among the fitted values using the training and testing sets all the linear models resulted in a slight underestimation of model performance meaning that their actual performance was slightly better than evaluated by modeling the training sets the linear model that used the mvs along with lai and days had the lowest under estimation along with the highest overall performance training and testing as well as the lowest deviations among the five seasons that were examined the mars models all resulted in overestimation meaning that the actual forecasting was slightly worse than anticipated by the models using training sets among the mars models the etc forecasting model using eto based mvs had the lowest absolute mean difference between mean training and mean testing correlations along with overall high performance this model also resulted in the lowest sd 0 016 signifying overall similar overestimation levels for all growing seasons overall the linear models showed higher bias in model performance estimation than the mars models the worst performance was attributed to the linear model of etc forecasting using lai and days as predictors absolute mean difference 0 096 and sd 0 12 with slightly poorer estimation than the model of kc against days this model also had the highest overestimation absolute mean difference 0 047 sd 0 055 among the mars models 4 discussion the purpose of this work was to provide insight to etc forecasting using various combinations of modeling approaches and sets of variables the issues raised here incorporate three aspects of etc model fitting the first was a comparison of etc forecasting accuracy using kc vs directly applying the models onto mvs the second was the choice of model to use for this task and in this case a generalized comparison between linear and non linear modeling the third aspect was the selection of variables to be included in etc forecasting to improve model accuracy in recent studies ohana levi 2020a 2020b and shtein et al 2021 showed that etc may be forecast and analyzed by directly applying the mvs to estimate etc in grapevines the use of kc necessitates the implementation of eto which imposes additional steps and complications to the model indeed the direct use of mvs was found to yield higher metrics of model performance when linearly modeling the test sets of kc against days variable set a vs etc against mvs and days variable set d the first resulted in r2 of 0 79 and rmse of 1 05 while the latter achieved r2 of 0 85 and rmse of 0 89 the same comparison using the mars model showed a slight advantage in favor of the direct use of mvs r2 0 96 rmse 0 64 compared to the kc modeling approach r2 0 92 rmse 0 68 etc estimation using direct mvs as input has also been investigated for other crops in recent years mostly using machine learning algorithms tabari et al 2013 and yamaç and todorovic 2020 used the direct mvs approach for potato etc assessment feng et al 2017 used this approach for maize additionally incorporating lai and plant height as plant indicators of crop physiology the direct approach of incorporating mvs was shown to overcome the limitations of the kc method which is prone to errors due to its generalized none site specific nature these studies all reported very accurate results achieved using direct implementation of mvs to etc forecasting with machine learning algorithms mainly attributed to their ability to handle the nonlinear dynamic complexity of etc and the associated meteorological data this corresponds to our findings which clearly demonstrate an advantage in using non linear modeling to accurately analyze multiple interrelations among different covariates ohana levi et al 2020b for all sets of variables the performance of the mars regression models was better than the linear models both for the training and test sets mean training and testing r of 0 84 and 0 85 for the linear models and 0 94 and 0 93 for the mars models the stronger fluctuations around measured values of etc derived from linear models are also apparent in figs 3b d and 4b d the high error rates of etc assessments associated with linear modeling are also apparent in fig 5 featuring the rolling rmse results the linear regression models applied to all sets of variables had much higher rmse values than those corresponding to the same sets incorporated in the mars model in addition to their higher accuracy and reliability non linear statistical methods including machine learning algorithms may assist in highlighting covariates that do not contribute to the models this knowledge may be valuable for effectively designing experiments where not all meteorological data is available yamaç and todorovic 2020 in this study the contribution of a vegetative development indicator lai to model accuracy was found to be profoundly valuable to the linear models incorporation of lai to the models reduced the testing rmse while using the kc approach rmse of 1 05 without lai vs 0 81 mm day 1 with lai and while incorporating the direct approach of using mvs to forecast etc rmse of 0 89 without lai vs 0 81 mm day 1 with lai with increased r2 values accounting for plant transpiring area throughout the growing season enabled reduction of error rates more profoundly in linear modeling especially early in the season stage 0 fig 5 the results for the mars models however did not show an important advantage when using lai this corresponds to the findings of ohana levi et al 2020b that showed a high ratio between lai and etc during stage 2 which is the longest stage including 52 days on average since stages 1 and 2 were characterized by stabilization of leaf area development and further increase in etc values tmean was found to be a stronger driver during these stages ohana levi et al 2020b furthermore the relationship between leaf area and temperature in grapevines has been well established lanari et al 2019 williams and ayars 2005 this relationship implies that lai might function as an intermediate variable and share similar temporal patterns as the mvs therefore not contributing much to the performance of the mars models nevertheless the rmse levels were found to be very low at the beginning and the end of the growing season stages 0 and 4 fig 5b when lai was incorporated in the mars models during these stages lai dynamics are rapid munitz et al 2019 and the relationship between etc and lai are the strongest therefore improving model accuracy however when using only days and lai as covariates for etc assessments the forecast values had a very coarse nature and did not account for daily fluctuations fig 4 this highlights the need for mvs as predictors however not all mvs are necessary for achieving high model performance ohana levi et al 2020b there were negligible differences between the model outcomes when using daily mean values for t and rh or using minimum and maximum values as defined for eto calculations therefore to minimize model complexion daily mean values are preferable seasonal attributes of plant vegetative traits and meteorological factors are commonly subjected to temporal autocorrelation seasonal structure should be considered when analyzing and interpreting data dominici et al 2002 ohana levi et al 2020a in this study we acknowledged the temporal dependence by integrating information on the days since budbreak into the models in many cases the temporal dynamics of meteorological and plant measurements are masked out by means of deseasonalizing or detrending the seasonal time series mosaedi et al 2017 richards et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 nevertheless in our case the seasonal patterns were valuable to the forecasting and temporal autocorrelation was not removed from the data this approach also enabled the analysis of rmse for short term periods thus providing information on the degree of accuracy of each regression model during different stages along the growing season the comparison between multiple regression models presented in this study may benefit decision makers and growers in vineyard management and data analysis higher accuracy of etc forecast may allow growers to irrigate their vineyards more precisely to impose the exact amount of water stress and to fulfill the growing goals of the vineyard the main general insights that stem from the comparison may be summarized in three points first given an extensive dataset there is no advantage in using kc to model etc the measured meteorological variables may be used directly without the need for eto calculations second in this era of data deluge where high volumes of data are collected stored and analyzed competence in learning from data is crucial to advancement of both scientific and practical knowledge slavakis et al 2014 cross disciplinary efforts between agronomy agrotechnology data science and learning tools will improve progression and advancements regarding smart and precise irrigation therefore when appropriate datasets should be analyzed using complex and advanced modeling techniques to obtain desired outcomes and minimize uncertainty and errors however adding complexity to the models is preferred only when improving the certainty accuracy and quality of the forecasts third quantification and assessment of crop water demands may benefit from incorporation of data describing canopy dynamics munitz et al 2016 netzer et al 2009 ohana levi et al 2020a williams and phene 2003 when using both linear and non linear modeling approaches with deciduous crop data leaf area is an important contributor for simulation accuracy particularly early and late in the season when it is most dynamic ohana levi et al 2020b 5 conclusions a comparative analysis of various models for optimizing etc forecasting was presented twelve different regression models were used consisting of linear and non linear methods different variable composition and evaluation of approaches to quantify water demand i e etc and kc the findings show that non linear models should be preferred since they performed superiorly and were more successful in capturing the complex interrelations among the covariates linear modeling may benefit from the incorporation of lai as an additional covariate to the mvs furthermore direct use of mvs gave similar results and model performance as models based on calculation of kc using eto the direct approach of mv modeling is less complex includes a smaller number of steps and is therefore advantageous we have featured forecasting of vine etc using mars however non linear modeling may also be relevant using other types of non linear statistical models or machine learning algorithms the performance and quality of the regression models was calculated for each growing season based on training of the other four seasons the model outputs indicating their performance levels were then averaged although the quality of each regression model was assessed using one set of statistical indicators it is important to acknowledge the variability of error rates of the different models along the growing season some etc assessments were more accurate during specific phenological stages along the season therefore it is possible to use different regression models for different periods of the season for example since lai was found to improve model accuracy during the beginning and end of the season it is possible to invest in field measurements in order to incorporate lai into the regression model along with mvs particularly during these critical periods and reduce or neglect measurements of this covariate during mid season when its contribution to etc assessment is reduced the abundance of advanced modeling methods algorithms and platforms along with better computing power generate opportunities for more effective analyses of datasets with more accurate outcomes these resources promote possibilities for modeling frameworks that are site specific and more location oriented rather than general highly accurate etc assessments are an overture to skilled irrigation practices and smart farming where local environmental and crop conditions are monitored and precisely

series of etc was acquired from water balance from vines grown in drainage lysimeters within the vineyard etc forecasts were generated for each season using twelve regression models six linear and six non linear multivariate adaptive regression spline mars models each regression model constituted a unique combination of variables some relying on crop coefficient kc and others based on direct etc forecasting the models were trained using data from four growing seasons and compared via measures of coefficient of determination r2 residual standard deviation and coefficient of variation each model was then tested using etc forecasts for a fifth growing season and compared to the measured etc values using correlation root mean squared error rmse and normalized rmse finally a mean seasonal rolling rmse with a window of 7 days was used to assess the accuracy of the different models the results show a clear advantage to using non linear modeling for etc forecasting average rmse range of 0 81 1 05 vs 0 64 0 71 mm day 1 respectively furthermore direct forecasting and kc based methods yielded similar results and all models benefited from the incorporation of leaf area data similar outcomes were found for the rolling rmse analysis with improved model accuracy credited to the inclusion of leaf area especially early in the season our findings confirm that advanced algorithms promote site specific and location oriented irrigation management keywords crop evapotranspiration lysimeters statistical modeling multivariate analysis meteorological variables leaf area index vitis vinifera vineyards 1 introduction wine grape vitis vinifera yield quality and value are closely governed by crop evapotranspiration etc and status van leeuwen et al 2009 optimizing grapevine production in drip irrigated vineyards may be facilitated by effective design of irrigation protocols vineyard irrigation management schemes especially in arid and semi arid regions rely on accurate assessments of the vineyard water demands montoro et al 2016 and the ability to quantify etc or crop evapotranspiration etc lópez urrea et al 2006 etc is affected by various meteorological variables mvs availability of soil water as well as plant size and physiology monitoring and assessing grapevine etc is highly challenging with measurements conducted using various approaches including direct measurement with weighing lópez urrea et al 2012 williams and ayars 2005 and drainage lysimeters evans et al 1993 munitz et al 2016 2019 or calculation based on closure of water or energy balance equations the latter methods include eddy covariance ortega farias et al 2010 bowen ratio zhang et al 2007 surface renewal castellvi and snyder 2010 and two source temperature based models kustas et al 2019 a crop coefficient kc is commonly used to schedule irrigation based on reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 the crop coefficient can be derived by quantifying the ratio between etc and the penman monteith eto allen et al 1998 when etc is unknown various kc recommendations for specific cultivars regions and periods exist guerra et al 2016 however these are mostly general snyder et al 2000 and often are not accurate enough for precise site specific management in recent years efforts have been made to construct a framework for etc assessments using a direct approach this approach uses a set of mvs that are associated to et as predictors to etc estimation and assessment ohana levi et al 2020a and may be applied where accurate etc and mv measurements are available thus enabling model training for etc assessments in other locations with similar characteristics and crops this framework has been applied successfully in grapevines ohana levi et al 2020a shtein et al 2021 as well as in other crops such as potatoes aghajanloo et al 2013 vegetable green beans and hazelnuts kelley and pardyjak 2019 maize tang et al 2018 and strawberry in greenhouses gavilán et al 2015 mostly using complex modeling and machine learning algorithms in addition to mvs etc is affected by canopy structure shape volume and other geometric characteristics liu et al 2018 martínez cob and faci 2010 in deciduous plants such as grapevines there is a swift increase in leaf area at the beginning of the growing season munitz et al 2019 which causes corresponding rapid changes to the levels of etc ohana levi 2021 in specific periods of the season changes in canopy cover may occur over shorter time intervals than changes in meteorological conditions therefore strongly affecting etc during these times ohana levi et al 2020b strong relations between canopy area and water demand in grapevines have been documented in the literature netzer et al 2009 and williams et al 2003 found linear agreements between leaf area index lai and kc for table grapevines superior seedless in israel and thompson seedless in california respectively similar relationships were found for wine grapevines in israel for cabernet sauvignon by munitz et al 2016 2019 and in spain for tempranillo by lópez urrea et al 2012 therefore representing canopy area in addition to mvs in models for etc assessment may provide valuable information related to etc temporal variability thus adding to model accuracy and reliability complex modeling methods including machine learning algorithms are used for various agricultural applications to solve large non linear problems using multiple variables these methods enable extraction of meaningful knowledge from large datasets and facilitate decision making processes over space and time chlingaryan et al 2018 models for et assessments are based on statistical quantification of the relationship between meteorological variables granata 2019 meteorological and deciduous crop datasets feature cyclic seasonal patterns which are most commonly temporally dependent khanmohammadi et al 2021 temporal dependency or autocorrelation means that the dataset is characterized by clustering of residuals around trendlines autocorrelated time series exhibit slower changes in values than in timesteps tend to change gradually and include a lagging effect which constrains the rate of change mitchell et al 2019 temporal dependence may occur over short or long periods and therefore time scales should be considered carefully when analyzing time series when analyzing time series of factors such as et and mvs as well as crop measurements and their interrelations the temporal variability and patterns of these multi seasonal datasets must be considered for achieving higher forecasting accuracy ohana levi et al 2020b few complex modeling frameworks have been proposed to determine grapevine etc using direct analysis of mvs and crop characteristics ohana levi et al 2020a although there is a growing focus on using such an approach for other crops yamaç and todorovic 2020 the unique phenology of grapevines and the strong impact of precision irrigation on crop revenue in vineyards costa et al 2012 ruiz sanchez et al 2010 necessitate a thorough examination of methods to achieve accurate etc assessments through complex statistical models we propose a comprehensive comparative analysis of linear and non linear models for grapevine etc forecasting a successful model for skilled irrigation may lead to reduction in water use and assist in reaching the target quality and or yield of grapes in the vineyard munitz et al 2020 2016 our main objective was to quantify the performance of modeling approaches for forecasting seasonal etc the study focused on four specific objectives a to compare two regression approaches forecasting etc using regression models with kc as a response variable followed by multiplication by eto values vs forecasting etc directly using different sets of predictors b to compare linear regression with non linear regression models of time series c to assess the sensitivity of etc modeling to different variable combinations and d to evaluate model performance and accuracy levels of all regression models 2 methods 2 1 study site and experimental design the experimental plot is located within the kida commercial vineyard in the central mountain region of israel lat 32 2 n long 35 e 759 m above sea level the vineyard was planted in 2007 with vitis vinfera cv cabernet sauvignon vines with east west row orientation the vines were trained to a vertical shoot positioning trellis system with two foliage wires vine spacing was 1 5 m between vines and 3 m between rows with 2222 vines per hectare the climate in the region is semi arid mediterranean with an annual average of 415 mm rainfall mainly occurring between november and march vine scale etc data was attained from six drainage lysimeters installed in the second row of the kida vineyard fig 1 six containers each 1 47 m3 1 3 m high x 1 2 m diameter were packed with local soil terra rossa composed of 36 4 sand 30 6 silt and 33 clay and bulk density of 1 25 g cm 3 and buried in the soil with their surfaces aligned with the ground level two drainage pipes from the bottom of each container led to a 2 5 m deep underground tunnel located 10 m from the lysimeter tanks outside the vineyard fig 2 a four year old vine from the vineyard was replanted in each container in 2011 the lysimeter vines received similar agrotechnical treatment as the local commercial vineyard excluding irrigation a tailor made computer controller crystalvision kibbutz samar israel was used to separately irrigate each lysimeter 24 irrigation pulses per day to ensure optimum soil water conditions water amounts applied to the lysimeters exceeded the estimated daily etc of vines by 20 30 for more information concerning lysimeter construction and operation see munitz et al 2019 2 2 data collection data was collected during five consecutive growing seasons 2013 2017 from three different sources the first was the lysimeter system specified in subsection 2 1 the second was measured lai and the third was a meteorological station ms located 50 m east of the lysimeter system meteorological data were collected and stored in a data logger cr1000 campbell science logan ut usa some of the variables used in the models were derived by calculations based on other measured variables and the time variables were based on temporal information a total of 14 variables were utilized by the different regression models table 1 as following 2 2 1 meteorological variables temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were acquired from the meteorological station located within the vineyard figure1 the data was measured using sensors located on top of the ms a temperature c and relative humidity rh sensor hmp155 vaisala helsinki finland was located at 2 m height mean temperature tmean was calculated as the mean value between 06 00 and 18 00 each day active transpiration hours minimum tmin and maximum tmax temperature values were recorded for each day respectively mean rh rhmean was calculated as the mean value between 06 00 and 18 00 rhmin and rhmax were the minimum and maximum rh values recorded for each day respectively wind speed m s 1 and direction were measured by a sensor 05103lm young traverse city mi usa located at 10 m height mean wind speed u10mean was calculated as the mean value between 06 00 and 18 00 each day mean wind speed at 2 m height u2 was calculated as the daily mean value after transformation to speed at 2 m using u2 0 75 x u10 eq 47 in allen et al 1998 total solar radiation was derived using a solar radiation pyranometer sensor cm11 kipp zonen dlft the netherlands at 2 m height total daily solar radiation rn was measured at 10 min intervals and accumulated into a daily sum 2 2 2 leaf area index leaf area was represented by leaf area index lai m2 m 2 of the lysimeter grown vines lai was measured weekly during all growing seasons using a canopy analysis system sunscan model ss1 r3 bf3 delta t devices cambridge uk the protocol of the measurements was detailed in munitz et al 2016a and ohana levi et al 2020a the lai values for the six vines in lysimeters were averaged to receive one weekly value to represent the time series linear temporal interpolation was used to generate a daily time series using the zoo package in r zeileis and grothendieck 2005 2 2 3 evapotranspiration and crop coefficient crop evapotranspiration etc mm day 1 was measured using the drainage lysimeters specified in detail in section 2 1 gaps in etc values were interpolated by a moving average algorithm using a 4 day moving window and calculated using the imputets package in r moritz and bartz beielstein 2017 reference evapotranspiration et0 mm day 1 was calculated using meteorological data through the penman monteith equation according to the fao56 recommendations specified in detail in allen et al 1998 eto is defined as water consumed from a fully vegetated surface normally from clipped grass allen 2003 crop coefficient daily kc was calculated by dividing daily values of etc by eto allen 2003 2 2 4 temporal variables and data days of season represented the days during each growing season between april 1 and september 30 thus generating a total of 183 days per growing season this time vector was used to account for temporal autocorrelation explanation in subsection 2 3 phenological growth stages were used to characterize each growing season using segmentation into five stages numbered from 0 to 4 their multi seasonal start date ranges are as follows stage 0 budbreak to flowering between march 25 and april 12 stage 1 flowering to bunch closure between may 3 and may 21 stage 2 bunch closure to veraison between june 12 and june 20 stage 3 veraison to harvest between august 5 and august 13 stage 4 post harvest between august 29 and september 17 determination of the growth stages was detailed in munitz et al 2016a and ohana levi et al 2020b the julian start days of the different phenological stages during each growing season were averaged to achieve a set of representative start dates for each phenological stage the growth stages were used to relate changing performance levels of the models to specific growth stages and were not integrated into the models 2 3 assessment of temporal dependence modeling grapevine etc and its drivers should consider the time dependency and autocorrelated structure of the time series ohana levi et al 2020b if the dataset is indeed temporally autocorrelated then the regression models should control for these temporal patterns and effects therefore each of the numerical variables mvs etc eto kc and lai were checked for non stationarity due to time dependence using the box pierce test box and pierce 1970 at lags 1 3 applied with the stats package in r r core team 2021 2 4 linear models a linear regression model assumes that a dependent variable y is linearly affected by an independent variable x these are simple and interpretable models the relationship between x and y is estimated by a set of coefficients β0 intercept and β1 slope which quantify the degree and direction of the effect of x over y in this study the least squares method was used with the coefficients selected to minimize the sum of squares residuals from y hastie et al 2001 using r r core team 2021 five linear regression models were evaluated four of which were multiple regression models to evaluate etc using different sets of independent variables for each model a time component days variable was integrated to account for the temporal variability and autocorrelation of the model ohana levi et al 2020b two models were a composite of a statistical regression model to evaluate kc followed by a transformation to etc values using the physical penman monteith model by multiplying the evaluated kc values by eto the following sets of variables were used for the linear regression models a etc kc x eto where kc f days ε b etc kc x eto where kc f lai days ε c etc f lai days ε d etc f tmean rhmean u10mean rn days ε e etc f tmean rhmean u10mean rn lai days ε f etc f tmin tmax rhmin rhmax u2 rn lai days ε in model design f the variables are identical to those used to calculate the penman monteith equation 2 5 multivariate adaptive regression spline mars models mars models are designed for non linear non parametric modeling first introduced by friedman 1991 this method combines the advantages of regression trees and spline fitting it replaces the step functions associated with regression trees with piecewise linear basis functions sub regions allowing to model complex relationships between a response variable and its predictors basis functions are defined in pairs using a knot or a value of a predictor variable defining an inflection point coefficients are therefore applied to each of the basis functions and determine the slopes of the non zero sections this enables fitting of different slopes within different parts of a predictor s range more than one knot can characterize a non linear relation between the predictor and the response variable enabling fitting of complex non linear relationships leathwick et al 2006 recursive partitioning regression or stepwise regression procedures are adjusted to provide the best fit to the data and the optimal set of basis functions friedman 1991 the knots are chosen automatically in a forward stepwise form and may be placed at uneven distances from each other at each step the model selects the knot and a set of corresponding coefficients that minimize the residual sum of squares after maximum model size is reached a backwards pruning procedure is applied progressively eliminating the basis functions that contribute the least to model performance during this stage a predictor variable may be completely removed from the model if none of its basis functions contribute strongly to the predictive performance leathwick et al 2006 this regression model was established as highly suitable for moderate sample size data n 1000 and moderate to high dimensions between 3 and 20 friedman 1991 ranking it as an appropriate choice for non linearly analyzing the dataset presented in this study mars was successfully used in studies involving time series of meteorological variables mvs abraham et al 2001 massidda and marrocu 2017 sigauke and chikobvu 2010 and eto estimations ferreira et al 2019 kisi 2016 in this study mars was applied using the earth package in r milborrow 2020 2019 by fitting the six regression models each consisting of a different set of variables as described in section 2 4 a f 2 6 quality assessment of model performance as specified in section 2 2 the dataset consisted of five growing seasons 5 183 days per season the statistics used to evaluate model performance were the following adjusted r2 r2 adj with values ranging between 0 and 1 the higher the values the stronger the variation of etc is explained by the predictors standard deviation of the residuals s res measuring the extent of deviation of the observations around the fitted values lower values indicate a better model fitting coefficient of variation cv calculated as s res divided by the mean value of measured etc representing s res as unitless values ranging between 0 and 1 the higher the value the stronger the deviation from the model fitting forecasting quality was measured by comparison of forecast to measured values therefore to evaluate the predictive power of each of the models the data was split into training and testing sets five times iteratively each time data of four different growing seasons was used to train a model in order to forecast etc values for the fifth season so that etc values were forecast for each season 2013 2017 using the data from the four remaining seasons training set the testing set was then used to validate the forecasted results for the models that included fitting kc values kc was forecast kc forecast and then the etc kc forecast x eto transformation was used when to derive the forecast etc the statistics that were used to evaluate the forecasting power of the model were the following correlation r between forecast and test data values of r range between 1 and 1 higher absolute values indicate stronger relationships between fitted values and test values root mean square error rmse measure the average differences between fitted values and the test values the higher the value the stronger the difference between the fitted values and the test set rmse ratio to the range of the test data rmserange is a measure of rmse normalized to the mean enabling comparison among datasets with different units scales and ranges of values smaller values signify better fitting of the model in comparison to the test set finally a rolling rmse analysis was performed using a seven day bandwidth consecutively calculating the errors for the previous seven days to assess the weekly bias of the forecast values rolling functions are typically applied on ordered observations using a predefined window that is moved over the full sample period zeileis and grothendieck 2005 the rolling rmse statistic was applied on a seven day window since this is a commonly used time gap for irrigation decision making the mean weekly rmse values were calculated based on rolling rmse performed for the forecast values of all seasons and for all models this analysis was conducted by r using package zoo zeileis and grothendieck 2005 2 7 quantification of model uncertainty to assess the extent of over and under estimation of each regression model several measures were calculated for the six different scenarios including values of the variables from four full seasons that were used to forecast the etc or kc values of a fifth growing season the measures for each of the training and testing models total of five were averaged to receive the mean performance measure of each regression model their sd was also calculated to assess the degree of dispersion between the five different scenarios for each regression model the measures used were training correlation which calculates the correlation between etc measured values of the four training seasons and the fitted values of etc the training correlation of each scenario was compared to the correlation between the measured etc values of the forecast year against the forecast values comparison of the two correlation measures enables to assess whether the regression model is trained to provide over or underestimated etc values the differences between the training correlation and the testing correlation was then calculated as well as the absolute values of these differences to assess the overall degree of error in model estimations 3 results 3 1 assessment of variable temporal dependence and selection all the variables were found to have temporal dependence according to the box pierce test at lags of 1 3 for the linear models at the multi seasonal scale some variables were found to be insignificant to the prediction of etc for linear modeling of etc using lai mvs and days the latter was found to be insignificant for the mars model applied with mvs used to calculate eto rn was removed from the model due to its insignificance 3 2 model performance the fitted values of etc or kc generated by the regression models linear and mars were evaluated using three metrics r2 adj s res and cv the findings table 2 discussed hereinafter relate to the averaged results of the five models applied with the datasets of four growing seasons each time for each specific set of variables the mars models performed better than the linear models the kc models based only on days variable had the lowest performance levels and highest cvs incorporating lai into the kc models increased their accuracy and reduced model errors for the linear models r2 and s res of 0 34 and 0 17 vs 0 67 and 0 12 respectively for the mars models r2 and s res of 0 72 and 0 11 vs 0 78 and 0 10 respectively the etc models were more accurate than the kc models performance of etc models improved after incorporating the mvs compared to when lai alone was used the highest accuracy was achieved when mvs and lai were combined into the models with r2 and s res of 0 79 and 0 75 respectively for the linear model and r2 and s res of 0 89 and 0 52 respectively for the mars model the model based on the mvs used for calculating eto in addition to lai also performed slightly better than the model based on averaged daily mvs u10mean tmean rhmean and rn along with lai r2 0 9 vs 0 89 respectively and s res 0 51 vs s res 0 50 respectively with cv 0 14 for both models assessments of forecast quality using the metrics r rmse and rmserange table 3 show that for all forecast growing seasons the mars outperformed the linear models in terms of accuracy two regression models performed best on average the direct forecasting of etc using the mvs lai and days and the mvs used for eto lai and days both modeled with mars these models also deviated the least among the five different forecasting scenarios one per season with rmse 0 11 mm day 1 the worst performance levels were attributed to the linear kc based model incorporating days as the explanatory variable r and rmse of 0 79 and 1 05 mm day 1 respectively followed by the linear model that forecast etc using lai and days as predictors both models had errors exceeding 1 mm day 1 figs 3 and 4 show graphical representation of the forecasting performance for eto based models and direct etc forecasting models respectively for comparison the forecast values were plotted along with measured etc values of the 2016 growing seasons the rolling rmse analysis showed that on weekly intervals the linear models yielded results with much higher bias between measured and forecast values on average than the mars models fig 5 while the rolling rmse range of the linear models was between 0 31 and 1 41 mm day 1 the range for the mars models was 0 21 1 03 mm day 1 rmse analysis for the linear models revealed multiple findings first that the highest rmse on average 0 96 mm day 1 was attributed to the kc model with days as predictor with a range of 0 4 1 4 mm day 1 during stage 0 april rmse was constantly higher than 1 mm day 1 followed by a sharp decrease in rmse which stabilized at around 0 8 mm day 1 during stage 1 may rmse values started increasing in mid june with high sharply fluctuating inaccuracies during the summer months of stage 2 in mid august during stage 3 rmse decreased and reached its minimum value at the end of august the last month of the season stage 4 was characterized by a sharp increase in rmse signifying that the model did not perform well during this stage second kc modeled using lai and days had mean rmse and range of 0 73 and 0 38 1 11 mm day 1 respectively between the end of june and late august mainly during stage 2 rmse reached 0 8 mm day 1 with high fluctuations the beginning and end of the season were characterized by lower rmse values attributed to better model forecasting levels third the direct modeling of etc using lai and days yielded the most unstable rmse sd 0 26 mm day 1 with an overall mean and range of 0 89 and 0 31 1 41 mm day 1 respectively 37 of the season was characterized by rmse 1 mm day 1 and 68 of the season had rmse 0 8 mm day 1 with lower forecasting errors rmse 0 8 mm day 1 during the first month of the season stage 0 fourth etc modeled linearly by the mvs and days had an average rmse of 0 82 mm day 1 ranging between 0 36 and 1 4 mm day 1 the highest inaccuracies of the forecast values were observed during stage 0 until mid may the rest of the season was characterized by lower rmse fluctuating between 0 36 and 1 02 mm day 1 this model performed best during last 45 days of the season with rmse values almost constantly below 0 7 mm day 1 fifth the overall performance of etc modeling using lai mv and days was similar to etc modeled using lai mv used for calculating eto and days with mean and range rmse values of 0 74 and 0 41 1 06 mm day 1 respectively this model was the least variable with sd 0 14 mm day 1 stage 0 was characterized by moderate high rmse decreasing to values 0 5 mm day 1 during stage 1 and gradually increasing to levels 0 8 mm day 1 until the end of stage 2 where the values experienced a decrease this model was characterized by lower forecasting errors at the end of the season the mars models had overall superior performance levels throughout the season with multiple outcomes first most mars models had similar rmse patterns across the season with similar overall statistics mean rmse values ranged between 0 57 and 0 63 mm day 1 the fluctuations were much lower than for the linear models with sd levels ranging between 0 13 and 0 18 mm day 1 the rmse values ranged between 0 21 and 1 03 mm day 1 second the highest mean rmse was attributed to kc modeled by days and etc modeled by lai and days both with rmse 0 63 mm day 1 these models were also characterized by the highest sd 0 16 and 0 18 mm day 1 respectively signifying large deviations along the season together with kc modeled by lai and days sd 0 16 mm day 1 third the forecasting results of kc modeled by days were biased at rmse 0 8 mm day 1 during 20 of the season mostly during stage 0 adding lai reduced the number of days with rmse 0 8 mm day 1 to 12 of the season occurring mostly at the end of may beginning of stage 1 and late july until mid august end of stage 2 fourth direct modeling of etc using lai and days had a bias of over 10 rmse 0 75 mm day 1 during 31 of the season with lower bias at the beginning and end of the season stages 0 3 4 while preserving higher rmse values throughout most of the growing season early may to mid august fifth all of the direct approaches that incorporated mvs into modelling of etc had similar rmse patterns characterized by lower forecasting errors early in the season until the first week of may followed by three rmse peaks 0 75 mm day 1 during late may early stage 1 the beginning of july beginning of stage 2 and the first two weeks of august end of stage 2 finally stages 3 and 4 were characterized by low rmse values for all mars models 0 5 mm day 1 3 3 quantification of model uncertainty quantification of over and under estimation by the models is specified in table 4 this analysis shows the difference between the estimation of the model using fitted values and the actual forecasting performance for each season the results in table 4 show only the mean values for all seasons overall there was very high agreement among the fitted values using the training and testing sets all the linear models resulted in a slight underestimation of model performance meaning that their actual performance was slightly better than evaluated by modeling the training sets the linear model that used the mvs along with lai and days had the lowest under estimation along with the highest overall performance training and testing as well as the lowest deviations among the five seasons that were examined the mars models all resulted in overestimation meaning that the actual forecasting was slightly worse than anticipated by the models using training sets among the mars models the etc forecasting model using eto based mvs had the lowest absolute mean difference between mean training and mean testing correlations along with overall high performance this model also resulted in the lowest sd 0 016 signifying overall similar overestimation levels for all growing seasons overall the linear models showed higher bias in model performance estimation than the mars models the worst performance was attributed to the linear model of etc forecasting using lai and days as predictors absolute mean difference 0 096 and sd 0 12 with slightly poorer estimation than the model of kc against days this model also had the highest overestimation absolute mean difference 0 047 sd 0 055 among the mars models 4 discussion the purpose of this work was to provide insight to etc forecasting using various combinations of modeling approaches and sets of variables the issues raised here incorporate three aspects of etc model fitting the first was a comparison of etc forecasting accuracy using kc vs directly applying the models onto mvs the second was the choice of model to use for this task and in this case a generalized comparison between linear and non linear modeling the third aspect was the selection of variables to be included in etc forecasting to improve model accuracy in recent studies ohana levi 2020a 2020b and shtein et al 2021 showed that etc may be forecast and analyzed by directly applying the mvs to estimate etc in grapevines the use of kc necessitates the implementation of eto which imposes additional steps and complications to the model indeed the direct use of mvs was found to yield higher metrics of model performance when linearly modeling the test sets of kc against days variable set a vs etc against mvs and days variable set d the first resulted in r2 of 0 79 and rmse of 1 05 while the latter achieved r2 of 0 85 and rmse of 0 89 the same comparison using the mars model showed a slight advantage in favor of the direct use of mvs r2 0 96 rmse 0 64 compared to the kc modeling approach r2 0 92 rmse 0 68 etc estimation using direct mvs as input has also been investigated for other crops in recent years mostly using machine learning algorithms tabari et al 2013 and yamaç and todorovic 2020 used the direct mvs approach for potato etc assessment feng et al 2017 used this approach for maize additionally incorporating lai and plant height as plant indicators of crop physiology the direct approach of incorporating mvs was shown to overcome the limitations of the kc method which is prone to errors due to its generalized none site specific nature these studies all reported very accurate results achieved using direct implementation of mvs to etc forecasting with machine learning algorithms mainly attributed to their ability to handle the nonlinear dynamic complexity of etc and the associated meteorological data this corresponds to our findings which clearly demonstrate an advantage in using non linear modeling to accurately analyze multiple interrelations among different covariates ohana levi et al 2020b for all sets of variables the performance of the mars regression models was better than the linear models both for the training and test sets mean training and testing r of 0 84 and 0 85 for the linear models and 0 94 and 0 93 for the mars models the stronger fluctuations around measured values of etc derived from linear models are also apparent in figs 3b d and 4b d the high error rates of etc assessments associated with linear modeling are also apparent in fig 5 featuring the rolling rmse results the linear regression models applied to all sets of variables had much higher rmse values than those corresponding to the same sets incorporated in the mars model in addition to their higher accuracy and reliability non linear statistical methods including machine learning algorithms may assist in highlighting covariates that do not contribute to the models this knowledge may be valuable for effectively designing experiments where not all meteorological data is available yamaç and todorovic 2020 in this study the contribution of a vegetative development indicator lai to model accuracy was found to be profoundly valuable to the linear models incorporation of lai to the models reduced the testing rmse while using the kc approach rmse of 1 05 without lai vs 0 81 mm day 1 with lai and while incorporating the direct approach of using mvs to forecast etc rmse of 0 89 without lai vs 0 81 mm day 1 with lai with increased r2 values accounting for plant transpiring area throughout the growing season enabled reduction of error rates more profoundly in linear modeling especially early in the season stage 0 fig 5 the results for the mars models however did not show an important advantage when using lai this corresponds to the findings of ohana levi et al 2020b that showed a high ratio between lai and etc during stage 2 which is the longest stage including 52 days on average since stages 1 and 2 were characterized by stabilization of leaf area development and further increase in etc values tmean was found to be a stronger driver during these stages ohana levi et al 2020b furthermore the relationship between leaf area and temperature in grapevines has been well established lanari et al 2019 williams and ayars 2005 this relationship implies that lai might function as an intermediate variable and share similar temporal patterns as the mvs therefore not contributing much to the performance of the mars models nevertheless the rmse levels were found to be very low at the beginning and the end of the growing season stages 0 and 4 fig 5b when lai was incorporated in the mars models during these stages lai dynamics are rapid munitz et al 2019 and the relationship between etc and lai are the strongest therefore improving model accuracy however when using only days and lai as covariates for etc assessments the forecast values had a very coarse nature and did not account for daily fluctuations fig 4 this highlights the need for mvs as predictors however not all mvs are necessary for achieving high model performance ohana levi et al 2020b there were negligible differences between the model outcomes when using daily mean values for t and rh or using minimum and maximum values as defined for eto calculations therefore to minimize model complexion daily mean values are preferable seasonal attributes of plant vegetative traits and meteorological factors are commonly subjected to temporal autocorrelation seasonal structure should be considered when analyzing and interpreting data dominici et al 2002 ohana levi et al 2020a in this study we acknowledged the temporal dependence by integrating information on the days since budbreak into the models in many cases the temporal dynamics of meteorological and plant measurements are masked out by means of deseasonalizing or detrending the seasonal time series mosaedi et al 2017 richards et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 nevertheless in our case the seasonal patterns were valuable to the forecasting and temporal autocorrelation was not removed from the data this approach also enabled the analysis of rmse for short term periods thus providing information on the degree of accuracy of each regression model during different stages along the growing season the comparison between multiple regression models presented in this study may benefit decision makers and growers in vineyard management and data analysis higher accuracy of etc forecast may allow growers to irrigate their vineyards more precisely to impose the exact amount of water stress and to fulfill the growing goals of the vineyard the main general insights that stem from the comparison may be summarized in three points first given an extensive dataset there is no advantage in using kc to model etc the measured meteorological variables may be used directly without the need for eto calculations second in this era of data deluge where high volumes of data are collected stored and analyzed competence in learning from data is crucial to advancement of both scientific and practical knowledge slavakis et al 2014 cross disciplinary efforts between agronomy agrotechnology data science and learning tools will improve progression and advancements regarding smart and precise irrigation therefore when appropriate datasets should be analyzed using complex and advanced modeling techniques to obtain desired outcomes and minimize uncertainty and errors however adding complexity to the models is preferred only when improving the certainty accuracy and quality of the forecasts third quantification and assessment of crop water demands may benefit from incorporation of data describing canopy dynamics munitz et al 2016 netzer et al 2009 ohana levi et al 2020a williams and phene 2003 when using both linear and non linear modeling approaches with deciduous crop data leaf area is an important contributor for simulation accuracy particularly early and late in the season when it is most dynamic ohana levi et al 2020b 5 conclusions a comparative analysis of various models for optimizing etc forecasting was presented twelve different regression models were used consisting of linear and non linear methods different variable composition and evaluation of approaches to quantify water demand i e etc and kc the findings show that non linear models should be preferred since they performed superiorly and were more successful in capturing the complex interrelations among the covariates linear modeling may benefit from the incorporation of lai as an additional covariate to the mvs furthermore direct use of mvs gave similar results and model performance as models based on calculation of kc using eto the direct approach of mv modeling is less complex includes a smaller number of steps and is therefore advantageous we have featured forecasting of vine etc using mars however non linear modeling may also be relevant using other types of non linear statistical models or machine learning algorithms the performance and quality of the regression models was calculated for each growing season based on training of the other four seasons the model outputs indicating their performance levels were then averaged although the quality of each regression model was assessed using one set of statistical indicators it is important to acknowledge the variability of error rates of the different models along the growing season some etc assessments were more accurate during specific phenological stages along the season therefore it is possible to use different regression models for different periods of the season for example since lai was found to improve model accuracy during the beginning and end of the season it is possible to invest in field measurements in order to incorporate lai into the regression model along with mvs particularly during these critical periods and reduce or neglect measurements of this covariate during mid season when its contribution to etc assessment is reduced the abundance of advanced modeling methods algorithms and platforms along with better computing power generate opportunities for more effective analyses of datasets with more accurate outcomes these resources promote possibilities for modeling frameworks that are site specific and more location oriented rather than general highly accurate etc assessments are an overture to skilled irrigation practices and smart farming where local environmental and crop conditions are monitored and precisely

9693,phosphorus p critical nutrient for plant growth and environment has been greatly concerned abundant studies have been focused on soil p loss while only sparse studies have concerned on soil p loss under extreme hydrological events even less on drought flood abrupt alternation dfaa this study explored the p migration in summer maize farmland systems based on field experiments further obtained the proportion of soil p loss we also simulated the soil p loss to dfaa in summer maize planting area in the northern anhui plain based on history future and hypothetical natural assuming no dfaa events scenarios the field experiments revealed that dfaa events reduced plant p storage by 47 7 than that in the natural control systems cs the mean proportion of soil p loss increased in the dfaa treatments 8 96 than that in the cs treatments 1 60 the numerical simulation results show that the proportion of average annual soil p loss due to dfaa has been increasing in the northern anhui plain with 7 98 10 34 during 1964 2017 2 07 14 16 during 2020 2050 the spatial distribution of annual soil p loss changed as well the soil p loss in hypothetical natural scenario was 5 1 times and 5 9 times lower than that in history and future scenarios which indicates significantly negative impacts of dfaa on environment this study can provide references for estimating the environmental effects of dfaa on p in farmland systems graphical abstract ga1 keywords extreme climate events phosphorus migration phosphorus storage soil phosphorus loss topsoil 1 introduction phosphorus p a vital macronutrient mainly concentrated in topsoil layers suriyagoda et al 2014 affects both plant growth shi et al 2021 vitousek et al 2009 and water quality yan et al 2019 zamparas and zacharias 2014 plant p uptake largely depends on the soil water content around roots gahoonia et al 1994 püschel et al 2021 thus plant p uptake would be affected by the changes of soil moisture under extreme hydrological events soil p loss was significantly affected by climate conditions especially in rainfed cropping systems sharma et al 2021 the soil p loss due to soil degradation and erosion would cause eutrophication chen et al 2021 kurek et al 2021 and sedimentation cortina et al 2018 tang et al 2018 in water bodies and so on therefore it is of great importance to study the soil p loss in rainfed crops planting area under extreme climate there have been extensive studies on soil p loss under extreme hydrological events such as flood bayad et al 2022 gao et al 2016 maranguit et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 drying rewetting brödlin et al 2019 dinh et al 2017 gao et al 2020 wang et al 2021 etc during flooding over 90 of p losses occurred in the first runoff event bayad et al 2022 drying and rewetting significantly affected soil p pools and fluxes gao et al 2020 periodic drying rewetting cycles also accelerate the depletion of the p pool in the soil brödlin et al 2019 however barring a few on drought flood abrupt alternation dfaa in this study dfaa refers to drought turning to flood which is a phenomenon of persistent drought followed by sudden heavy precipitation at a certain level wu et al 2006 the dfaa events bring significant stress to agricultural production water environmental quality ecosystem stability and many other socio economic aspects gao et al 2019 xiong et al 2018 yu et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 the frequency of dfaa events have been increasing with covering area expanding amirataee and montaseri 2017 fang et al 2019 under these circumstances it is essential to explore the evolution mechanisms of plant growth and water quality under climate change especially the agricultural soil p loss an essential source for non point pollution our previous study focused on the transformation of p in typical rainfed cropping systems summer maize farmland systems the results revealed that the available p ap in topsoil increased under dfaa with longer drought duration while the soluble p and total p in surface runoff showed a decreasing trend bi et al 2020b how does p migrate in farmland systems how much soil p is lost due to dfaa these questions need to be concerned hitherto far less studies on dfaa were conducted in filed also the quantitative analysis in regional scale based on the field research still needs to be deep going to fill this gap in knowledge we carried out filed experiment to reveal the p migration and soil p loss in the summer maize farmland systems further applied the field data to the northern anhui plain through numerical simulations to explore the p migration in summer maize farmland systems the p storage in different components should be calculated first the plant p storage is the product of plant p uptake and plant quantity the p storage is the product of p concentration and mass in soil surface runoff and groundwater we set out to test the hypothesis that i the dfaa events reduced plant p storage ii the dfaa events increased the p storage in surface runoff and groundwater i e the soil p loss increased and iii the soil p loss due to dfaa would increase in summer maize planting area in the northern anhui plain to confirm the hypothesis we i investigate the p storage in different components soil plant surface runoff etc in topsoil under dfaa based on field experiments ii obtain the key parameters of soil p loss in summer maize farmland systems and iii estimate the topsoil p loss due to dfaa in summer maize planting area in the northern anhui plain in history and in the future fig 1 the results can provide guidance for evaluating the impacts of dfaa on environment and further provide targeted regulation measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and dfaa evaluation the experiments were conducted at wudaogou experimentation research station 33 09 n 117 21 e bengbu city northern anhui plain china fig s1 where the dfaa events occurred about every 4 years the average annual precipitation was 890 mm during 1963 2017 of over 60 in summer the main soil types in the study area are dark hydromorphic clay loam and fluvo aquic soil which account for 52 2 and 30 9 of the total area respectively fig s1 based on the determination method of dfaa events proposed in our previous study bi et al 2019 we improved the method on considering both the meteorological and agricultural indicators the dfaa level on daily scale can be evaluated as follows 1 dfaa l j i j p d l 1 0 w d l 1 m θ d l 1 m f c 100 j j n 1 p f l 2 where dfaa l is the level of the dfaa event i is the duration of drought period days j is the day begins to rain p d l 1 is the amount of available precipitation w d l 1 m is the relative soil moisture on day m j i m j is the range of day m which can determine the drought level l 1 θ d l 1 m is the soil water content on day m n is consecutive rainy days p f l 2 is the total amount of precipitation from day j to day j n 1 the flood level l 2 can be determined compared with the precipitation threshold the dfaa level dfaa l is determined by the drought level l 1 and the flood level l 2 the beginning day of the drought period and flood period in dfaa event are j i and j respectively the drought duration is i days the consecutive rainy days is n the drought level l 1 is determined by the standard of classification for drought severity sl424 2008 table 1 and the classification of meteorological drought gb t 20481 2006 the meteorological drought level is generally assessed by the relative soil moisture in 10 20 cm or 0 40 cm depth table 1 eq 2 2 w θ f c 100 where w is the relative soil moisture θ is the soil water content f c is the soil field capacity the flood level l 2 is determined by the amount of precipitation within 5 days after drought bi et al 2019b the classification of flood levels in the northern anhui plain is shown in table 1 we classified the dfaa events into light moderate and severe level table 2 the light dfaa contains light drought light flood light drought moderate flood and moderate drought light flood the moderate dfaa contains severe drought light flood moderate drought moderate flood and light drought severe flood the severe dfaa contains severe drought moderate flood moderate drought severe flood and severe drought severe flood 2 2 experimental design according to the dfaa characteristics in the northern anhui plain the four most occurring types i e light drought light flood light drought moderate flood moderate drought light flood and moderate drought moderate flood accounting for over 90 in all dfaa events were chosen for field experiments we conducted these four dfaa conditions during two summer maize growing stages i e the seeding jointing stage and the tasseling grain filling stage in addition a control system cs was operated under the natural climatic conditions the experiments were conducted at a local farmland site in dark hydromorphic clay loam figure s2 plots the experimental plots design and corresponding devices a total of 15 experimental plots length width 5 5 m 3 7 m were established for the experiment with three replicates for each treatment aluminum plastic composite panels with a depth of 1 2 m 0 2 m standing above ground level were used as baffles surrounding each experimental plot to prevent external water and groundwater from entering each plot from other experimental plots each experimental plot had only one outlet length height 10 cm 10 cm connected with a water collecting device made from acrylic the eight dfaa treatments table 3 were sheltered under a ventilated shed to block the entry of external precipitation and with an artificial rainfall device to simulate consecutive rainless conditions and abrupt precipitation conditions we also buried pipes for soil water content measurement aim wifi soil multi parameters monitoring system and root observation azr 100 root ecological detection system all the tests were conducted in the growing season of summer maize deng hai 618 from 25 june to 9 october 2018 and 13 june to 27 september 2019 the plant density of each experimental plot was 7 5 plant m 2 before planting maize we fertilized each experimental plot with 75 g m 2 of compound fertilizer with potassium sulfate and 30 g m 2 of urea no more fertilizer was added during the experiment the initial conditions soil water content p addition and so on were kept the same for all the experimental plots 2 2 1 phosphorus measurement we collected soil samples in topsoil 0 40 cm plant samples and surface runoff samples during the experiments the samples were collected on specific days as follows before the dfaa experiments baseline value bv and 1 day after dfaa in the dfaa treatments or after natural rainfall in the cs treatment after precipitation apre the specific measurement processes were described in our previous study bi et al 2020b 2 2 2 calculation of phosphorus migration the soil p pool was fixed as no p additives during experiment thus the proportion of p storage in each component in summer maize farmland can be calculated fig 2 the baseline value of soil p storage in each experimental plot can be calculated as follows 3 p bv pc bv ρ d soil a plot 10 where p bv is the baseline value of soil p storage mg pc bv is the baseline value of soil p concentration mg kg 1 ρ is the soil bulk density g m 3 d soil is the thickness of soil layer cm a plot is the experimental plot area m2 eq 4 can calculate the soil p storage in each experimental plot after dfaa or natural precipitation 4 p soil pc soil ρ

is the thickness of soil layer cm a plot is the experimental plot area m2 the plant p storage in each experimental plot after dfaa or natural precipitation can be calculated as follows 5 p plant pu root pu stem pu leaf pu f ruit n plant where p plant is the plant p storage mg pu root pu stem pu leaf pu fruit is the p uptake by plant in roots stems leaves fruits respectively mg plant 1 n plant is the plant number in each experimental plot plant the p uptake can be calculated by the method mentioned in previous study bi et al 2020b the soil p loss after dfaa or natural precipitation can be calculated as 6 p loss p bv p soil p plant where p loss is the soil p loss mg p bv is the baseline value of soil p storage mg p soil is the soil p storage after dfaa or natural rainfall mg p plant is the plant p storage mg notably the soil p loss contains the p content in surface runoff and groundwater the p content in surface runoff water part can be calculated as 7 p runoff w pc runoff w q runoff w t 10 3 where p runoff w is the p content in the water part of surface runoff mg pc runoff w is the p concentration in surface runoff water part after dfaa or natural rainfall mg l 1 q runoff w is the average runoff flow during dfaa or natural rainfall m3 s 1 t is duration of rainfall s the p in surface runoff sediment part can be calculated as follows 8 p runoff s pc runoff s m runoff s where p runoff s is the p content in the sediment part of surface runoff mg pc runoff s is the p concentration in surface runoff sediment part after dfaa or natural rainfall mg kg 1 m runoff s is the total sediment content during dfaa or natural rainfall kg the p content flowing into the groundwater during dfaa natural rainfall is theoretically equal to the difference between soil p loss and the sum of p contents in the water part and sediment part of surface runoff 9 p under ground p loss p runoff w p runoff s where p underground is the p content flowing into groundwater mg p loss is the soil p loss mg p runoff w is the p content in the water part of surface runoff mg p runoff s is the p content in the sediment part of surface runoff mg to discern the law of p migration the proportion of p in soil plant surface runoff and inflow into groundwater after dfaa natural rainfall can be calculated as follows 10 x x p x p bv 100 where x x is the proportion of p storage in each component in the cs treatment x or in the dfaa treatments x p bv is the baseline value of soil p storage mg p x is the p storage mg in soil plant surface runoff inflow into groundwater when x a b c d respectively to further clarify the proportion of p storage in each organ of plant after dfaa natural rainfall it can be calculated as 11 b i b i p i p bv 100 where b i b i is the proportion of p content in each organ of plant in the cs treatment b i or in the dfaa treatments b i p bv is the baseline value of soil p storage mg p x is the p storage mg in roots stems leaves fruit when i 1 2 3 4 respectively 2 3 numerical simulation scenarios we apply the results of field experiment to regional scale in the northern anhui plain which is one of the most important agricultural regions in china fig s1 in total three types of scenarios were set history scenarios future scenario and hypothetical natural scenarios the analysis was only based on the climatic change not considering the distribution of human activities additional fertilizer addition control measures to dfaa etc and the variations of cropping systems irrigation regime summer maize varieties etc the scenarios we set may not be highly consistent with actual situations but can reflect the impacts of a single variable 1 history scenarios based on the inverse distance weighted interpolation method khouni et al 2021 munyati and sinthumule 2021 the daily data from 1964 to 2017 of the 16 meteorological stations in and around the northern anhui plain were used to evaluate the dfaa characteristics in history the regional soil p loss in history can further be calculated on combining the frequency distribution of dfaa events and the distribution of dark hydromorphic clay loam in the northern anhui plain to explore the effects of dfaa on soil p loss over time we calculated the abrupt climate change point based on mann kendall test method kendall 1975 mann 1945 which revealed that the climate in the northern anhui plain experienced abrupt changes in 1993 bi 2020 thus we set the history scenarios into three time periods 1964 2017 1964 1993 1994 2017 2 future scenario to predict future climate this study applied the representative concentration pathways rcps developed in the intergovernmental panel on climate change s fifth assessment report moss et al 2010 taylor et al 2012 and the climate scenarios reported in the coupled model intercomparison project cmip 5 hagemann et al 2011 piani et al 2010 warszawski et al 2014 according to previous studies in the study area the best simulation results were found with the combination of the intermediate stable path rcp4 5 and the climate scenario hadgem2 es gao et al 2014 lin et al 2019 the data resolution provided by the model is 0 5 0 5 and the time scale is from january 1960 to december 2099 this study selected the period from 2020 to 2050 as future scenario the average annual soil p loss due to dfaa in history and future can be calculated as follows 12 p dfaa i 1 n p i dfaa n where p dfaa is the average annual soil p loss in the years occurring dfaa events p i dfaa is the soil p loss corresponding to the dfaa level in event i n is the number of years occurring dfaa events 3 hypothetical natural scenarios to compare the soil p loss under dfaa with that under natural rainfall condition we set hypothetical natural scenarios by replacing the soil p loss in the dfaa treatment with that in the corresponding cs treatment same rainfall level with that in dfaa that is the soil p loss in hypothetical natural scenarios in the area occurring dfaa events with light and moderate flood were replaced by that in the cs1 treatment with natural rainfall in light flood level and cs2 treatment with natural rainfall in moderate flood level respectively as hardly any dfaa events with severe flood this study supposed that the soil p loss in the area occurring dfaa events with severe flood was replaced with that in the cs2 treatment under hypothetical natural condition the average annual soil p loss in hypothetical natural condition in history and in the future can be calculated as follows 13 p hn i 1 n p i hn n where p hn is the average annual soil p loss in hypothetical natural condition in the years occurring dfaa events p i hn is the soil p loss in dfaa event i corresponding to the hypothetical natural condition n is the counts of years occurring dfaa events 2 4 statistical analysis data were shown in mean standard deviation variables were analyzed with one way anova the significance of linear correlations between parameters was expressed as pearson s product moment correlation coefficient a statistical difference was considered significant when p 0 05 the figures were drawn in origin version 9 0 originlab inc hampton ma usa

times in the center of the northern anhui plain 8 10 times to the northeast and 10 12 times to the southwest fig 3a notably in summer the counts of dfaa events were 11 14 times in the center of the northern anhui plain 7 9 times to the northeast and 9 11 times to the southwest fig 3b during 1964 1993 about 4 8 dfaa events occurred in whole year decreasing from southwest to northeast fig 3a in summer the dfaa events also decreased from southwest to northeast with counts decreasing from 7 to 3 times fig 3b during 1994 2017 the counts of dfaa events were 7 10 5 7 and 4 or 5 times in the center southwest and northeast respectively fig 3a in summer there were 7 9 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 dfaa events in the center southwest and northeast respectively fig 3b according to the classification of dfaa levels from 1964 to 2017 for the light level there were 9 13 dfaa events in the center and 6 8 dfaa events in the northeast and southwest fig 4a the counts of dfaa events decreased from southwest 5 times to northeast 0 in moderate level fig 4b and there were only 1 dfaa event occurred in the east in severe level fig 4c from 1964 1993 the counts of dfaa events decreased from the center 7 times

surroundings 0 in moderate level fig 4b and only 1 dfaa event occurred in the east in severe level fig 4c during 2020 2050 there were 1 9 dfaa events in whole year and 1 8 dfaa events in summer fig 5a the counts decreased from the northwest to the southeast in both whole year and in summer the counts of dfaa events were 1 8 times 0 3 times and 0 or 1 time in light level moderate level and severe level respectively fig 5b the amount decreased from the northwest to the southeast in light level only 1 3 dfaa events occurred in the west and north of the northern anhui plain in moderate level only 1 dfaa event occurred in the northwest in severe level 3 2 soil phosphorus changes under dfaa in the field experiment 3 2 1 phosphorus storage in different components the p storage of baseline value was 5418 g on average in the dfaa treatments and was 6484 g on average in the cs treatments fig 6a there were significant differences between the dfaa treatments and the cs treatments there were no significant differences among the dfaa treatments except the lmtg and mmtg treatment or among the cs treatments after dfaa the average p storage in topsoil were 4368 g and 6285 g in the dfaa treatments and cs treatments respectively fig 6b there were significant differences between the dfaa treatments and the cs treatments significant differences can be found among different dfaa treatments while no significant difference between the two cs treatments notably in the same dfaa condition the soil p storage in the tasseling grain filling stage period was about 13 8 higher than in the seeding jointing stage period the plant p storage after dfaa were 31 11 g and 71 09 g in the dfaa treatments and cs treatments fig 6c the average plant p storage were 31 77 g 31 20 g 26 83 g and 34 65 g in the light drought light flood moderate drought light flood light drought moderate flood and moderate drought moderate flood treatments respectively the plant p storage was about 38 2 higher in the tasseling grain filling stage period than that in the seeding jointing stage period the p storage in the water part of surface runoff were about 0 29 g and 0 54 g in the dfaa treatments and cs treatments respectively fig 6d under the same dfaa condition significant differences can be found between the dfaa treatments in the tasseling grain filling stage period and in the seeding jointing stage period the p storage in surface runoff was 134 4 higher in the tasseling grain filling stage period than that in the seeding jointing stage period in addition we measured the p concentration in the sediment part of surface runoff in several dfaa treatments the p storage in the sediment part of surface runoff were 18 55 g and 19 79 g in the lmtg and mmtg treatment 3 2 2 phosphorus migration in summer maize farmland systems according to eqs 10 and 11 the p migration after dfaa can be quantified fig 7 the mean proportion of soil p storage were 90 47 and 97 30 in the dfaa treatments and cs treatments respectively specifically the proportions of soil p storage were 88 61 97 76 93 25 99 27 81 90 84 09 86 17 92 71 98 44 and 96 16 in the llsj lltg mlsj mltg lmsj lmtg mmsj mmtg cs1 and cs2 treatments respectively for the plant p storage the mean proportion were 0 57 and 1 09 in the dfaa treatments and cs treatments respectively in the llsj lltg mlsj mltg lmsj lmtg mmsj mmtg cs1 and cs2 treatments the proportions were 0 61 0 62 0 67 0 55 0 27 0 65 0 45 0 75 0 86 and 1 33 respectively the mean proportions were 9 12 32 05 and 58 83 in roots stems and leaves in the dfaa treatments respectively while the mean proportions were 22 27 31 42 and 46 30 in roots stems and leaves in the cs treatments respectively the proportions of soil p loss were 8 96 and 1 60 on average in the dfaa and cs treatments the soil p loss were 10 78 1 62 6 08 0 18 17 83 15 27 13 38 6 54 0 70 and 2 51 in the llsj lltg mlsj mltg lmsj lmtg mmsj mmtg cs1 and cs2 treatments respectively the soil p loss in the surface runoff accounted 0 0054 and 0 0083 on average of the soil p storage in the dfaa and cs treatments the proportions of p storage in the surface runoff were 0 0032 0 0094 0 0026 0 0084 0 0030 0 0055 0 0046 0 0065 0 011 and 0 0058 in the llsj lltg mlsj mltg lmsj lmtg mmsj mmtg cs1 and cs2 treatments respectively the proportions of the sediment were 0 31 and 0 33 in the lmtg and mmtg treatments respectively 3 3 soil phosphorus loss in summer maize planting area in the northern anhui plain based on the results in section 3 2 the soil p losses were 6 2 3 1 16 5 and 9 9 in the ll ml lm and mm treatments respectively as almost no dfaa events in severe level the soil p loss was considered as 9 9 for the dfaa in severe level same as that in moderate level in this study for the history scenarios during 1964 2017 in topsoil the average annual soil p loss was 7 98 10 34 fig 8a the average annual soil p loss was 8 26 12 12 during 1964 1993 and 6 74 10 56 during 1994 2017 fig 8a the spatial distribution of soil p loss changed over time with highest center of soil p loss shifted from the northeast 1964 1993 to the southwest 1994 2017 for the future scenario during 2020 2050 the average annual soil p loss is 2 07 14 16 fig 8a the highest average annual soil p loss is in the central and southern regions and decrease from the center to the west and north the spatial distribution would change in the future compared with that in history especially the highest center of soil p loss according to the field experiments and hypothetical natural scenario the soil p loss in hypothetical natural condition was 0 70 and 2 51 in the area occurring dfaa events with light flood and with moderate severe flood respectively the results of soil p loss in hypothetical natural condition can be found in fig 8b the soil p loss in hypothetical natural condition was 1 09 1 91 during 1964 2017 1 09 2 21 during 1964 1993 0 66 2 86 during 1994 2017 and 0 23 2 12 during 2020 2050 the soil p loss increased by 6 9 8 6 when occurred dfaa events instead of natural rainfall in history and in the future about 5 1 times and 5 9 times respectively 4 discussion 4 1 dfaa decreased plant p storage and increased soil p loss in field experiments the results showed that the soil p storage in topsoil decreased by 9 53 in the dfaa treatments while by 2 70 in the cs treatments the decreases were mainly contributed to plant growth and soil p loss in surface runoff and groundwater in particular the plant p storage in the dfaa treatments 0 57 were lower than that in the cs treatments 1 09 and the soil p loss in the dfaa treatments 8 96 were much higher than that in the cs treatments 1 60 it is indicated that dfaa decreased the plant p uptake and increased the soil p loss in topsoil of summer maize farmland further revealed that the dfaa could have negative impacts on plant growth i e yield quality etc and water environment i e eutrophication sedimentation etc the negative impacts have been reported in previous studies bi et al 2020a chen et al 2021 huang et al 2019 plant growth needs suitable water and fertilizer conditions an et al 2021 singh et al 2021 the dfaa had significant impacts on the soil water conditions in soil chen et al 2019 ma et al 2019 especially in topsoil which resulted in the weak absorption capacity of water as most nutrients can be absorbed by plants are water soluble heronemus et al 2021 rezakhani et al 2019 especially for p the weak absorption capacity of water further leads to lower absorption of nutrients other studies also reported that plant nutrient uptake is significantly influenced by the changes in soil water content acosta motos et al 2020 turner et al 2003 such as the plant uptake of p could decrease during drought yue et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 while increase in flooding maranguit et al 2017 vourlitis et al 2017 therefore the reasons for plant p uptake decreasing in the dfaa treatments mainly are i the reduced plant biomass both aboveground and belowground and ii the decreased root p absorptive capacity notably compared with the cs treatments the plant p storage mainly presented a shift trend from roots to leaves under dfaa the proportion of p storage in the stems basically kept unchanged in addition we found that the proportion of below ground biomass was lower in the dfaa treatments than that in the cs treatments bi et al 2020a it can be inferred that the dfaa has more significantly negative effects on the below ground biomass than the above ground biomass of summer maize which further led to the p storage shift from roots to leaves for the same dfaa condition the plant p storage in the seeding jointing stage period was 1 4 22 1 57 89 and 39 3 lower than in the tasseling grain filling stage period for the ll ml lm and mm treatment respectively the reasons can be concluded as i the plant biomass was larger in the tasseling grain filling stage period than in the seeding jointing stage period bi et al 2020a and ii the concentration of ap was higher in the tasseling grain filling stage period than in the seeding jointing stage period bi et al 2020b the soil p loss was concentrated in surface runoff water part and sediment part and groundwater the soil p loss in surface runoff water part in the dfaa treatments was 26 03 lower than that in the cs treatments the soil p loss in surface runoff sediment part was 0 32 in the dfaa treatments 3 5 of the total soil p loss even higher than the total soil p loss in the cs1 treatment the soil p loss flowing into groundwater occupied more than 90 of the total soil p loss our previous studies revealed that dfaa events increased the soil total porosity bi et al 2020b which further increased p leaching effect as the rainfall intensity was great under dfaa the scouring effect was strong as well nazir et al 2016 wei et al 2021 thus the possible causes of higher soil p loss in the dfaa treatments than in the cs treatments were i the soil p loss into groundwater increased due to the increased p leaching as soil total porosity increased after dfaa van gestel et al 1993 and ii the soil p loss in surface runoff sediment part increased due to the strong scouring effect han et al 2021 ma et al 2011 the lower soil p loss in surface runoff water part in the dfaa treatments could be that the lost p was mainly adsorbed on the surface of sediment wu et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 for the dfaa events in same level the soil p loss in the surface runoff in the seeding jointing stage period were 66 4 69 3 44 7 and 29 4 lower than that in the tasseling grain filling stage period for the ll ml lm and mm treatments respectively the possible reason was that the p absorbed on the surface of sediment decreased as the canopy interception increased 4 2 counts of dfaa events increased in the next 30 years further increased the water pollution risk according to the results of the average annual soil p loss in the northern anhui plain fig 8 the average annual soil p loss increased in future scenario 2020 2050 compared with that in history scenarios 1964 2017 the main reason was that the counts of dfaa events in moderate and severe level increased in 2020 2050 the high value center of soil p loss shifted from the southwest in history scenarios to the center in future scenario which was not the same with the frequency of dfaa in any level while was most similar with that in moderate level thus the distribution of soil p loss was the comprehensive results of dfaa events in different levels and the frequency of dfaa in moderate level had significant impacts on the distribution of soil p loss the high value center of soil p loss shifted from the northeast to the southwest before and after the climate change point in 1993 it was mainly due to that the light drought moderate flood events occupied larger proportion during 1994 2017 than that during 1964 1993 the key areas for p pollution treatment would change with the shifted high frequency center of dfaa which increased the burden of treatments and the corresponding engineering constructions based on the soil p loss in hypothetical natural scenario it can be learned that dfaa would significantly increase the soil p loss in the northern anhui plain compared with natural rainfall conditions and present an increasing negative impact on environment in the next 30 years in the northern anhui plain situated in the huaibei plain surface water and shallow groundwater are important sources of water for both irrigation and drinking gou et al 2020 zhu et al 2018 the main p loss in sediment of surface runoff and groundwater would further bring pollution and healthy risk for local agriculture and inhabitant the p input in water bodies causes eutrophication then results in algae bloom which consumes oxygen dissolved in water further causes the death of fish and other aquatic plants and releases toxins harmful to humans and animals bastami et al 2021 x han et al 2021 z han et al 2021 remund et al 2021 at the same time soil p loss would reduce soil fertility which may result in agricultural production reduction li et al 2021 räty et al 2020 otherwise the corresponding treatments against p pollution due to dfaa would cost a lot several measures are proposed to control p pollution such as reduction of non point source pollution load deep aeration dredged sediment supervision and management etc gourevitch et al 2021 liu et al 2021 in a word the soil p loss due to dfaa significantly affects local socio economic development and drinking water health further studies on agricultural water management should be focused 5 conclusions this study explored the changes in the p storage of different components and obtained the soil p loss in summer maize farmland systems in field further estimated the soil p loss in the northern anhui plain based on history future and hypothetical natural scenarios the results showed that the average plant storage was 0 57 in the dfaa treatments 47 7 lower than that in the cs treatments 1 09 and the plant p storage shifted from roots to leaves under dfaa the proportion of p storage in surface runoff water part was 0 0054 in the dfaa treatments 34 9 lower than that in the cs treatment 0 0083 the proportion of p storage in surface runoff sediment was 0 32 in the dfaa treatments in total the mean proportion of soil p loss was 8 96 in the dfaa treatment about 5 6 times of that in the cs treatments 1 60 the proportion of average annual soil p loss due to dfaa was 7 98 10 34 during 1964 2017 2 07 14 16 during 2020 2050 the soil p loss in hypothetical natural condition was 5 1 times and 5 9 times lower than that in history and in the future respectively the soil p loss due to dfaa got more and more worse over time and the high value center of annual soil p loss shifted as well the results basically verified our hypothesis which provide an empirical basis for the exploration of p migration in topsoil under dfaa our field experiments and numerical simulations did not consider the distributions of control measures planting measures irrigation regimes crop varieties etc further studies could extend relevant field experiments and numerical simulations also explore the targeted regulation measures to dfaa and agricultural water pollution management in addition the future scenarios can

9693,phosphorus p critical nutrient for plant growth and environment has been greatly concerned abundant studies have been focused on soil p loss while only sparse studies have concerned on soil p loss under extreme hydrological events even less on drought flood abrupt alternation dfaa this study explored the p migration in summer maize farmland systems based on field experiments further obtained the proportion of soil p loss we also simulated the soil p loss to dfaa in summer maize planting area in the northern anhui plain based on history future and hypothetical natural assuming no dfaa events scenarios the field experiments revealed that dfaa events reduced plant p storage by 47 7 than that in the natural control systems cs the mean proportion of soil p loss increased in the dfaa treatments 8 96 than that in the cs treatments 1 60 the numerical simulation results show that the proportion of average annual soil p loss due to dfaa has been increasing in the northern anhui plain with 7 98 10 34 during 1964 2017 2 07 14 16 during 2020 2050 the spatial distribution of annual soil p loss changed as well the soil p loss in hypothetical natural scenario was 5 1 times and 5 9 times lower than that in history and future scenarios which indicates significantly negative impacts of dfaa on environment this study can provide references for estimating the environmental effects of dfaa on p in farmland systems graphical abstract ga1 keywords extreme climate events phosphorus migration phosphorus storage soil phosphorus loss topsoil 1 introduction phosphorus p a vital macronutrient mainly concentrated in topsoil layers suriyagoda et al 2014 affects both plant growth shi et al 2021 vitousek et al 2009 and water quality yan et al 2019 zamparas and zacharias 2014 plant p uptake largely depends on the soil water content around roots gahoonia et al 1994 püschel et al 2021 thus plant p uptake would be affected by the changes of soil moisture under extreme hydrological events soil p loss was significantly affected by climate conditions especially in rainfed cropping systems sharma et al 2021 the soil p loss due to soil degradation and erosion would cause eutrophication chen et al 2021 kurek et al 2021 and sedimentation cortina et al 2018 tang et al 2018 in water bodies and so on therefore it is of great importance to study the soil p loss in rainfed crops planting area under extreme climate there have been extensive studies on soil p loss under extreme hydrological events such as flood bayad et al 2022 gao et al 2016 maranguit et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 drying rewetting brödlin et al 2019 dinh et al 2017 gao et al 2020 wang et al 2021 etc during flooding over 90 of p losses occurred in the first runoff event bayad et al 2022 drying and rewetting significantly affected soil p pools and fluxes gao et al 2020 periodic drying rewetting cycles also accelerate the depletion of the p pool in the soil brödlin et al 2019 however barring a few on drought flood abrupt alternation dfaa in this study dfaa refers to drought turning to flood which is a phenomenon of persistent drought followed by sudden heavy precipitation at a certain level wu et al 2006 the dfaa events bring significant stress to agricultural production water environmental quality ecosystem stability and many other socio economic aspects gao et al 2019 xiong et al 2018 yu et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 the frequency of dfaa events have been increasing with covering area expanding amirataee and montaseri 2017 fang et al 2019 under these circumstances it is essential to explore the evolution mechanisms of plant growth and water quality under climate change especially the agricultural soil p loss an essential source for non point pollution our previous study focused on the transformation of p in typical rainfed cropping systems summer maize farmland systems the results revealed that the available p ap in topsoil increased under dfaa with longer drought duration while the soluble p and total p in surface runoff showed a decreasing trend bi et al 2020b how does p migrate in farmland systems how much soil p is lost due to dfaa these questions need to be concerned hitherto far less studies on dfaa were conducted in filed also the quantitative analysis in regional scale based on the field research still needs to be deep going to fill this gap in knowledge we carried out filed experiment to reveal the p migration and soil p loss in the summer maize farmland systems further applied the field data to the northern anhui plain through numerical simulations to explore the p migration in summer maize farmland systems the p storage in different components should be calculated first the plant p storage is the product of plant p uptake and plant quantity the p storage is the product of p concentration and mass in soil surface runoff and groundwater we set out to test the hypothesis that i the dfaa events reduced plant p storage ii the dfaa events increased the p storage in surface runoff and groundwater i e the soil p loss increased and iii the soil p loss due to dfaa would increase in summer maize planting area in the northern anhui plain to confirm the hypothesis we i investigate the p storage in different components soil plant surface runoff etc in topsoil under dfaa based on field experiments ii obtain the key parameters of soil p loss in summer maize farmland systems and iii estimate the topsoil p loss due to dfaa in summer maize planting area in the northern anhui plain in history and in the future fig 1 the results can provide guidance for evaluating the impacts of dfaa on environment and further provide targeted regulation measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and dfaa evaluation the experiments were conducted at wudaogou experimentation research station 33 09 n 117 21 e bengbu city northern anhui plain china fig s1 where the dfaa events occurred about every 4 years the average annual precipitation was 890 mm during 1963 2017 of over 60 in summer the main soil types in the study area are dark hydromorphic clay loam and fluvo aquic soil which account for 52 2 and 30 9 of the total area respectively fig s1 based on the determination method of dfaa events proposed in our previous study bi et al 2019 we improved the method on considering both the meteorological and agricultural indicators the dfaa level on daily scale can be evaluated as follows 1 dfaa l j i j p d l 1 0 w d l 1 m θ d l 1 m f c 100 j j n 1 p f l 2 where dfaa l is the level of the dfaa event i is the duration of drought period days j is the day begins to rain p d l 1 is the amount of available precipitation w d l 1 m is the relative soil moisture on day m j i m j is the range of day m which can determine the drought level l 1 θ d l 1 m is the soil water content on day m n is consecutive rainy days p f l 2 is the total amount of precipitation from day j to day j n 1 the flood level l 2 can be determined compared with the precipitation threshold the dfaa level dfaa l is determined by the drought level l 1 and the flood level l 2 the beginning day of the drought period and flood period in dfaa event are j i and j respectively the drought duration is i days the consecutive rainy days is n the drought level l 1 is determined by the standard of classification for drought severity sl424 2008 table 1 and the classification of meteorological drought gb t 20481 2006 the meteorological drought level is generally assessed by the relative soil moisture in 10 20 cm or 0 40 cm depth table 1 eq 2 2 w θ f c 100 where w is the relative soil moisture θ is the soil water content f c is the soil field capacity the flood level l 2 is determined by the amount of precipitation within 5 days after drought bi et al 2019b the classification of flood levels in the northern anhui plain is shown in table 1 we classified the dfaa events into light moderate and severe level table 2 the light dfaa contains light drought light flood light drought moderate flood and moderate drought light flood the moderate dfaa contains severe drought light flood moderate drought moderate flood and light drought severe flood the severe dfaa contains severe drought moderate flood moderate drought severe flood and severe drought severe flood 2 2 experimental design according to the dfaa characteristics in the northern anhui plain the four most occurring types i e light drought light flood light drought moderate flood moderate drought light flood and moderate drought moderate flood accounting for over 90 in all dfaa events were chosen for field experiments we conducted these four dfaa conditions during two summer maize growing stages i e the seeding jointing stage and the tasseling grain filling stage in addition a control system cs was operated under the natural climatic conditions the experiments were conducted at a local farmland site in dark hydromorphic clay loam figure s2 plots the experimental plots design and corresponding devices a total of 15 experimental plots length width 5 5 m 3 7 m were established for the experiment with three replicates for each treatment aluminum plastic composite panels with a depth of 1 2 m 0 2 m standing above ground level were used as baffles surrounding each experimental plot to prevent external water and groundwater from entering each plot from other experimental plots each experimental plot had only one outlet length height 10 cm 10 cm connected with a water collecting device made from acrylic the eight dfaa treatments table 3 were sheltered under a ventilated shed to block the entry of external precipitation and with an artificial rainfall device to simulate consecutive rainless conditions and abrupt precipitation conditions we also buried pipes for soil water content measurement aim wifi soil multi parameters monitoring system and root observation azr 100 root ecological detection system all the tests were conducted in the growing season of summer maize deng hai 618 from 25 june to 9 october 2018 and 13 june to 27 september 2019 the plant density of each experimental plot was 7 5 plant m 2 before planting maize we fertilized each experimental plot with 75 g m 2 of compound fertilizer with potassium sulfate and 30 g m 2 of urea no more fertilizer was added during the experiment the initial conditions soil water content p addition and so on were kept the same for all the experimental plots 2 2 1 phosphorus measurement we collected soil samples in topsoil 0 40 cm plant samples and surface runoff samples during the experiments the samples were collected on specific days as follows before the dfaa experiments baseline value bv and 1 day after dfaa in the dfaa treatments or after natural rainfall in the cs treatment after precipitation apre the specific measurement processes were described in our previous study bi et al 2020b 2 2 2 calculation of phosphorus migration the soil p pool was fixed as no p additives during experiment thus the proportion of p storage in each component in summer maize farmland can be calculated fig 2 the baseline value of soil p storage in each experimental plot can be calculated as follows 3 p bv pc bv ρ d soil a plot 10 where p bv is the baseline value of soil p storage mg pc bv is the baseline value of soil p concentration mg kg 1 ρ is the soil bulk density g m 3 d soil is the thickness of soil layer cm a plot is the experimental plot area m2 eq 4 can calculate the soil p storage in each experimental plot after dfaa or natural precipitation 4 p soil pc soil ρ

is the thickness of soil layer cm a plot is the experimental plot area m2 the plant p storage in each experimental plot after dfaa or natural precipitation can be calculated as follows 5 p plant pu root pu stem pu leaf pu f ruit n plant where p plant is the plant p storage mg pu root pu stem pu leaf pu fruit is the p uptake by plant in roots stems leaves fruits respectively mg plant 1 n plant is the plant number in each experimental plot plant the p uptake can be calculated by the method mentioned in previous study bi et al 2020b the soil p loss after dfaa or natural precipitation can be calculated as 6 p loss p bv p soil p plant where p loss is the soil p loss mg p bv is the baseline value of soil p storage mg p soil is the soil p storage after dfaa or natural rainfall mg p plant is the plant p storage mg notably the soil p loss contains the p content in surface runoff and groundwater the p content in surface runoff water part can be calculated as 7 p runoff w pc runoff w q runoff w t 10 3 where p runoff w is the p content in the water part of surface runoff mg pc runoff w is the p concentration in surface runoff water part after dfaa or natural rainfall mg l 1 q runoff w is the average runoff flow during dfaa or natural rainfall m3 s 1 t is duration of rainfall s the p in surface runoff sediment part can be calculated as follows 8 p runoff s pc runoff s m runoff s where p runoff s is the p content in the sediment part of surface runoff mg pc runoff s is the p concentration in surface runoff sediment part after dfaa or natural rainfall mg kg 1 m runoff s is the total sediment content during dfaa or natural rainfall kg the p content flowing into the groundwater during dfaa natural rainfall is theoretically equal to the difference between soil p loss and the sum of p contents in the water part and sediment part of surface runoff 9 p under ground p loss p runoff w p runoff s where p underground is the p content flowing into groundwater mg p loss is the soil p loss mg p runoff w is the p content in the water part of surface runoff mg p runoff s is the p content in the sediment part of surface runoff mg to discern the law of p migration the proportion of p in soil plant surface runoff and inflow into groundwater after dfaa natural rainfall can be calculated as follows 10 x x p x p bv 100 where x x is the proportion of p storage in each component in the cs treatment x or in the dfaa treatments x p bv is the baseline value of soil p storage mg p x is the p storage mg in soil plant surface runoff inflow into groundwater when x a b c d respectively to further clarify the proportion of p storage in each organ of plant after dfaa natural rainfall it can be calculated as 11 b i b i p i p bv 100 where b i b i is the proportion of p content in each organ of plant in the cs treatment b i or in the dfaa treatments b i p bv is the baseline value of soil p storage mg p x is the p storage mg in roots stems leaves fruit when i 1 2 3 4 respectively 2 3 numerical simulation scenarios we apply the results of field experiment to regional scale in the northern anhui plain which is one of the most important agricultural regions in china fig s1 in total three types of scenarios were set history scenarios future scenario and hypothetical natural scenarios the analysis was only based on the climatic change not considering the distribution of human activities additional fertilizer addition control measures to dfaa etc and the variations of cropping systems irrigation regime summer maize varieties etc the scenarios we set may not be highly consistent with actual situations but can reflect the impacts of a single variable 1 history scenarios based on the inverse distance weighted interpolation method khouni et al 2021 munyati and sinthumule 2021 the daily data from 1964 to 2017 of the 16 meteorological stations in and around the northern anhui plain were used to evaluate the dfaa characteristics in history the regional soil p loss in history can further be calculated on combining the frequency distribution of dfaa events and the distribution of dark hydromorphic clay loam in the northern anhui plain to explore the effects of dfaa on soil p loss over time we calculated the abrupt climate change point based on mann kendall test method kendall 1975 mann 1945 which revealed that the climate in the northern anhui plain experienced abrupt changes in 1993 bi 2020 thus we set the history scenarios into three time periods 1964 2017 1964 1993 1994 2017 2 future scenario to predict future climate this study applied the representative concentration pathways rcps developed in the intergovernmental panel on climate change s fifth assessment report moss et al 2010 taylor et al 2012 and the climate scenarios reported in the coupled model intercomparison project cmip 5 hagemann et al 2011 piani et al 2010 warszawski et al 2014 according to previous studies in the study area the best simulation results were found with the combination of the intermediate stable path rcp4 5 and the climate scenario hadgem2 es gao et al 2014 lin et al 2019 the data resolution provided by the model is 0 5 0 5 and the time scale is from january 1960 to december 2099 this study selected the period from 2020 to 2050 as future scenario the average annual soil p loss due to dfaa in history and future can be calculated as follows 12 p dfaa i 1 n p i dfaa n where p dfaa is the average annual soil p loss in the years occurring dfaa events p i dfaa is the soil p loss corresponding to the dfaa level in event i n is the number of years occurring dfaa events 3 hypothetical natural scenarios to compare the soil p loss under dfaa with that under natural rainfall condition we set hypothetical natural scenarios by replacing the soil p loss in the dfaa treatment with that in the corresponding cs treatment same rainfall level with that in dfaa that is the soil p loss in hypothetical natural scenarios in the area occurring dfaa events with light and moderate flood were replaced by that in the cs1 treatment with natural rainfall in light flood level and cs2 treatment with natural rainfall in moderate flood level respectively as hardly any dfaa events with severe flood this study supposed that the soil p loss in the area occurring dfaa events with severe flood was replaced with that in the cs2 treatment under hypothetical natural condition the average annual soil p loss in hypothetical natural condition in history and in the future can be calculated as follows 13 p hn i 1 n p i hn n where p hn is the average annual soil p loss in hypothetical natural condition in the years occurring dfaa events p i hn is the soil p loss in dfaa event i corresponding to the hypothetical natural condition n is the counts of years occurring dfaa events 2 4 statistical analysis data were shown in mean standard deviation variables were analyzed with one way anova the significance of linear correlations between parameters was expressed as pearson s product moment correlation coefficient a statistical difference was considered significant when p 0 05 the figures were drawn in origin version 9 0 originlab inc hampton ma usa

summer the dfaa events also decreased from southwest to northeast with counts decreasing from 7 to 3 times fig 3b during 1994 2017 the counts of dfaa events were 7 10 5 7 and 4 or 5 times in the center southwest and northeast respectively fig 3a in summer there were 7 9 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 dfaa events in the center southwest and northeast respectively fig 3b according to the classification of dfaa levels from 1964 to 2017 for the light level there were 9 13 dfaa events in the center and 6 8 dfaa events in the northeast and southwest fig 4a the counts of dfaa events decreased from southwest

surroundings 0 in moderate level fig 4b and only 1 dfaa event occurred in the east in severe level fig 4c during 2020 2050 there were 1 9 dfaa events in whole year and 1 8 dfaa events in summer fig 5a the counts decreased from the northwest to the southeast in both whole year and in summer the counts of dfaa events were 1 8 times 0 3 times and 0 or 1 time in light level moderate level and severe level respectively fig 5b the amount decreased from the northwest to the southeast in light level only 1 3 dfaa events occurred in the west and north of the northern anhui plain in moderate level only 1 dfaa event occurred in the northwest in severe level 3 2 soil phosphorus changes under dfaa in the field experiment 3 2 1 phosphorus storage in different components the p storage of baseline value was 5418 g on average in the dfaa treatments and was 6484 g on average in the cs treatments fig 6a there were significant differences between the dfaa treatments and the cs treatments there were no significant differences among the dfaa treatments except the lmtg and mmtg treatment or among the cs treatments after dfaa the average p storage in topsoil were 4368 g and 6285 g in the dfaa treatments and cs treatments respectively fig 6b there were significant differences between the dfaa treatments and the cs treatments significant differences can be found among different dfaa treatments while no significant difference between the two cs treatments notably in the same dfaa condition the soil p storage in the tasseling grain filling stage period was about 13 8 higher than in the seeding jointing stage period the plant p storage after dfaa were 31 11 g and 71 09 g in the dfaa treatments and cs treatments fig 6c the average plant p storage were 31 77 g 31 20 g 26 83 g and 34 65 g in the light drought light flood moderate drought light flood light drought moderate flood and moderate drought moderate flood treatments respectively the plant p storage was about 38 2 higher in the tasseling grain filling stage period than that in the seeding jointing stage period the p storage in the water part of surface runoff were about 0 29 g and 0 54 g in the dfaa treatments and cs treatments respectively fig 6d under the same dfaa condition significant differences can be found between the dfaa treatments in the tasseling grain filling stage period and in the seeding jointing stage period the p storage in surface runoff was 134 4 higher in the tasseling grain filling stage period than that in the seeding jointing stage period in addition we measured the p concentration in the sediment part of surface runoff in several dfaa treatments the p storage in the sediment part of surface runoff were 18 55 g and 19 79 g in the lmtg and mmtg treatment 3 2 2 phosphorus migration in summer maize farmland systems according to eqs 10 and 11 the p migration after dfaa can be quantified fig 7 the mean proportion of soil p storage were 90 47 and 97 30 in the dfaa treatments and cs treatments respectively specifically the proportions of soil p storage were 88 61 97 76 93 25 99 27 81 90 84 09 86 17 92 71 98 44 and 96 16 in the llsj lltg mlsj mltg lmsj lmtg mmsj mmtg cs1 and cs2 treatments respectively for the plant p storage the mean proportion were 0 57 and 1 09 in the dfaa treatments and cs treatments respectively in the llsj lltg mlsj mltg lmsj lmtg mmsj mmtg cs1 and cs2 treatments the proportions were 0 61 0 62 0 67 0 55 0 27 0 65 0 45 0 75 0 86 and 1 33 respectively the mean proportions were 9 12 32 05 and 58 83 in roots stems and leaves in the dfaa treatments respectively while the mean proportions were 22 27 31 42 and 46 30 in roots stems and leaves in the cs treatments respectively the proportions of soil p loss were 8 96 and 1 60 on average in the dfaa and cs treatments the soil p loss were 10 78 1 62 6 08 0 18 17 83 15 27 13 38 6 54 0 70 and 2 51 in the llsj lltg mlsj mltg lmsj lmtg mmsj mmtg cs1 and cs2 treatments respectively the soil p loss in the surface runoff accounted 0 0054 and 0 0083 on average of the soil p storage in the dfaa and cs treatments the proportions of p storage in the surface runoff were 0 0032 0 0094 0 0026 0 0084 0 0030 0 0055 0 0046 0 0065 0 011 and 0 0058 in the llsj lltg mlsj mltg lmsj lmtg mmsj mmtg cs1 and cs2 treatments respectively the proportions of the sediment were 0 31 and 0 33 in the lmtg and mmtg treatments respectively 3 3 soil phosphorus loss in summer maize planting area in the northern anhui plain based on the results in section 3 2 the soil p losses were 6 2 3 1 16 5 and 9 9 in the ll ml lm and mm treatments respectively as almost no dfaa events in severe level the soil p loss was considered as 9 9 for the dfaa in severe level same as that in moderate level in this study for the history scenarios during 1964 2017 in topsoil the average annual soil p loss was 7 98 10 34 fig 8a the average annual soil p loss was 8 26 12 12 during 1964 1993 and 6 74 10 56 during 1994 2017 fig 8a the spatial distribution of soil p loss changed over time with highest center of soil p loss shifted from the northeast 1964 1993 to the southwest 1994 2017 for the future scenario during 2020 2050 the average annual soil p loss is 2 07 14 16 fig 8a the highest average annual soil p loss is in the central and southern regions and decrease from the center to the west and north the spatial distribution would change in the future compared with that in history especially the highest center of soil p loss according to the field experiments and hypothetical natural scenario the soil p loss in hypothetical natural condition was 0 70 and 2 51 in the area occurring dfaa events with light flood and with moderate severe flood respectively the results of soil p loss in hypothetical natural condition can be found in fig 8b the soil p loss in hypothetical natural condition was 1 09 1 91 during 1964 2017 1 09 2 21 during 1964 1993 0 66 2 86 during 1994 2017 and 0 23 2 12 during 2020 2050 the soil p loss increased by 6 9 8 6 when occurred dfaa events instead of natural rainfall in history and in the future about 5 1 times and 5 9 times respectively 4 discussion 4 1 dfaa decreased plant p storage and increased soil p loss in field experiments the results showed that the soil p storage in topsoil decreased by 9 53 in the dfaa treatments while by 2 70 in the cs treatments the decreases were mainly contributed to plant growth and soil p loss in surface runoff and groundwater in particular the plant p storage in the dfaa treatments 0 57 were lower than that in the cs treatments 1 09 and the soil p loss in the dfaa treatments 8 96 were much higher than that in the cs treatments 1 60 it is indicated that dfaa decreased the plant p uptake and increased the soil p loss in topsoil of summer maize farmland further revealed that the dfaa could have negative impacts on plant growth i e yield quality etc and water environment i e eutrophication sedimentation etc the negative impacts have been reported in previous studies bi et al 2020a chen et al 2021 huang et al 2019 plant growth needs suitable water and fertilizer conditions an et al 2021 singh et al 2021 the dfaa had significant impacts on the soil water conditions in soil chen et al 2019 ma et al 2019 especially in topsoil which resulted in the weak absorption capacity of water as most nutrients can be absorbed by plants are water soluble heronemus et al 2021 rezakhani et al 2019 especially for p the weak absorption capacity of water further leads to lower absorption of nutrients other studies also reported that plant nutrient uptake is significantly influenced by the changes in soil water content acosta motos et al 2020 turner et al 2003 such as the plant uptake of p could decrease during drought yue et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 while increase in flooding maranguit et al 2017 vourlitis et al 2017 therefore the reasons for plant p uptake decreasing in the dfaa treatments mainly are i the reduced plant biomass both aboveground and belowground and ii the decreased root p absorptive capacity notably compared with the cs treatments the plant p storage mainly presented a shift trend from roots to leaves under dfaa the proportion of p storage in the stems basically kept unchanged in addition we found that the proportion of below ground biomass was lower in the dfaa treatments than that in the cs treatments bi et al 2020a it can be inferred that the dfaa has more significantly negative effects on the below ground biomass than the above ground biomass of summer maize which further led to the p storage shift from roots to leaves for the same dfaa condition the plant p storage in the seeding jointing stage period was 1 4 22 1 57 89 and 39 3 lower than in the tasseling grain filling stage period for the ll ml lm and mm treatment respectively the reasons can be concluded as i the plant biomass was larger in the tasseling grain filling stage period than in the seeding jointing stage period bi et al 2020a and ii the concentration of ap was higher in the tasseling grain filling stage period than in the seeding jointing stage period bi et al 2020b the soil p loss was concentrated in surface runoff water part and sediment part and groundwater the soil p loss in surface runoff water part in the dfaa treatments was 26 03 lower than that in the cs treatments the soil p loss in surface runoff sediment part was 0 32 in the dfaa treatments 3 5 of the total soil p loss even higher than the total soil p loss in the cs1 treatment the soil p loss flowing into groundwater occupied more than 90 of the total soil p loss our previous studies revealed that dfaa events increased the soil total porosity bi et al 2020b which further increased p leaching effect as the rainfall intensity was great under dfaa the scouring effect was strong as well nazir et al 2016 wei et al 2021 thus the possible causes of higher soil p loss in the dfaa treatments than in the cs treatments were i the soil p loss into groundwater increased due to the increased p leaching as soil total porosity increased after dfaa van gestel et al 1993 and ii the soil p loss in surface runoff sediment part increased due to the strong scouring effect han et al 2021 ma et al 2011 the lower soil p loss in surface runoff water part in the dfaa treatments could be that the lost p was mainly adsorbed on the surface of sediment wu et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 for the dfaa events in same level the soil p loss in the surface runoff in the seeding jointing stage period were 66 4 69 3 44 7 and 29 4 lower than that in the tasseling grain filling stage period for the ll ml lm and mm treatments respectively the possible reason was that the p absorbed on the surface of sediment decreased as the canopy interception increased 4 2 counts of dfaa events increased in the next 30 years further increased the water pollution risk according to the results of the average annual soil p loss in the northern anhui plain fig 8 the average annual soil p loss increased in future scenario 2020 2050 compared with that in history scenarios 1964 2017 the main reason was that the counts of dfaa events in moderate and severe level increased in 2020 2050 the high value center of soil p loss shifted from the southwest in history scenarios to the center in future scenario which was not the same with the frequency of dfaa in any level while was most similar with that in moderate level thus the distribution of soil p loss was the comprehensive results of dfaa events in different levels and the frequency of dfaa in moderate level had significant impacts on the distribution of soil p loss the high value center of soil p loss shifted from the northeast to the southwest before and after the climate change point in 1993 it was mainly due to that the light drought moderate flood events occupied larger proportion during 1994 2017 than that during 1964 1993 the key areas for p pollution treatment would change with the shifted high frequency center of dfaa which increased the burden of treatments and the corresponding engineering constructions based on the soil p loss in hypothetical natural scenario it can be learned that dfaa would significantly increase the soil p loss in the northern anhui plain compared with natural rainfall conditions and present an increasing negative impact on environment in the next 30 years in the northern anhui plain situated in the huaibei plain surface water and shallow groundwater are important sources of water for both irrigation and drinking gou et al 2020 zhu et al 2018 the main p loss in sediment of surface runoff and groundwater would further bring pollution and healthy risk for local agriculture and inhabitant the p input in water bodies causes eutrophication then results in algae bloom which consumes oxygen dissolved in water further causes the death of fish and other aquatic plants and releases toxins harmful to humans and animals bastami et al 2021 x han et al 2021 z han et al 2021 remund et al 2021 at the same time soil p loss would reduce soil fertility which may result in agricultural production reduction li et al 2021 räty et al 2020 otherwise the corresponding treatments against p pollution due to dfaa would cost a lot several measures are proposed to control p pollution such as reduction of non point source pollution load deep aeration dredged sediment supervision and management etc gourevitch et al 2021 liu et al 2021 in a word the soil p loss due to dfaa significantly affects local socio economic development and drinking water health further studies on agricultural water management should be focused 5 conclusions this study explored the changes in the p storage of different components and obtained the soil p loss in summer maize farmland systems in field further estimated the soil p loss in the northern anhui plain based on history future and hypothetical natural scenarios the results showed that the average plant storage was 0 57 in the dfaa treatments 47 7 lower than that in the cs treatments 1 09 and the plant p storage shifted from roots to leaves under dfaa the proportion of p storage in surface runoff water part was 0 0054 in the dfaa treatments 34 9 lower than that in the cs treatment 0 0083 the proportion of p storage in surface runoff sediment was 0 32 in the dfaa treatments in total the mean proportion of soil p loss was 8 96 in the dfaa treatment about 5 6 times of that in the cs treatments 1 60 the proportion of average annual soil p loss due to dfaa was 7 98 10 34 during 1964 2017 2 07 14 16 during 2020 2050 the soil p loss in hypothetical natural condition was 5 1 times and 5 9 times lower than that in history and in the future respectively the soil p loss due to dfaa got more and more worse over time and the high value center of annual soil p loss shifted as well the results basically verified our hypothesis which provide an empirical basis for the exploration of p migration in topsoil under dfaa our field experiments and numerical simulations did not consider the distributions of control measures planting measures irrigation regimes crop varieties etc further studies could extend relevant field experiments and numerical simulations also explore the targeted regulation measures to dfaa and agricultural water pollution management in addition the future scenarios can

9694,five integrated experiments irrigated with water of moderate salinity about 1 6 ds m 1 were conducted in an spanish mediterranean greenhouse to provide a better insight into soil salt accumulation processes in tomato crops and how to leach away these salts by irrigation both during and outside the cropping period salts mostly chloride and sodium coming from the irrigation water accumulated in the soil wet bulb leading to soil solution electrical conductivities ecss of about 6 ds m 1 or higher during the second half of the crop cycles during the first phases of these tomato crops it appears to be advisable to apply the crop evapotranspiration etc requirements or slightly higher rates 1 1 etc subsequently before salts accumulated reach hazardous levels it is necessary to over irrigate with a leaching fraction to avoid further salinity increments moreover crop water requirements must be applied with a single daily irrigation rather than several shorter ones after the cropping period the application of 60 70 mm of irrigation water leached away most of the accumulated salts and led to ecss slightly below 3 ds m 1 considered appropriate for planting a new crop this amount of water which has to be adapted to the soil salinity content and characteristics supplied with daily irrigation rates of about 3 10 mm d 1 led to lower ecss values compared with higher irrigation rates moreover the application of crop water requirements with water 11 33 of the irrigation rate and nutrient solution instead of nutrient solution over the whole event substantially reduced the total fertiliser supplied and the concentration of the main nutrients in the wet bulb but did not negatively affect the biomass productivity or fruit quality of tomato crop however this fertigation strategy requires low cost fast monitoring systems of water and nutrients in the soil and or the plant keywords crop yield leaching requirements nutrients soil solution electrical conductivity water quality 1 introduction protected agriculture is steadily growing around the world but water availability and quality are major factors limiting its expansion phogat et al 2020 in mediterranean areas water is frequently a scarce resource and its quality is worsening in many irrigation areas pulido bosch 2005 thompson et al 2007b in open field crops of mediterranean areas usually irrigated around summer with water or low concentration nutrient solution most salts and nutrients accumulated in the soil throughout the cropping period are washed away by the rainwater which mainly falls around winter in soil grown greenhouse crops fertigated with much higher nutrient concentrations than open field crops sonneveld and vogt 2009 and drip irrigated with moderately saline water like many greenhouse tomato crops on the se spanish mediterranean coast cabrera corral et al 2016 considerable amounts of nutrients and above all salts accumulate in the soil wet bulb thompson et al 2007b de pascale et al 2017 in these crops abundant irrigation water is required after the cropping periods mostly in summer to leach the accumulated salts before starting a new crop cycle sánchez et al 2015 bonachela et al 2018 according to thompson et al 2007b information describing or analysing the irrigation practices for leaching the salts accumulated in such crops is scarce these authors carried out a comprehensive survey on commercial greenhouses regarding irrigation practices that contribute to nitrate leaching loss they found that i the vast majority of farmers irrigate abundantly after the cropping period and most also irrigate just before transplanting sowing the next crop with a view to salt leaching and soil profile wetting ii the total irrigation volume applied for salt leaching varies considerably as did the irrigation rates and frequencies and iii additional abundant irrigation is frequently applied for soil disinfection after the cropping period moreover most crops are also frequently over irrigated during the first weeks of their cycles fernández et al 2007 thompson et al 2007b data on seasonal irrigation supply for greenhouse tomato crops on the se spanish mediterranean coast are scarce and vary according to crop cycle length in particular fernández et al 2007 gallardo et al 2013 reported a mean seasonal irrigation supply of 558 mm for long tomato crop cycles while sanchez et al 2015 reported mean seasonal irrigation supplies of 326 and 339 mm for two short autumn cycles but neither study considered the irrigation water supply for soil disinfection and salt leaching after the cropping period in mediterranean greenhouse areas in se spain the salt content of the irrigation water is generally increasing mostly due to nitrate contamination and above all salinisation of local aquifers pulido bosch 2005 thompson et al 2007b the electrical conductivity ec of irrigation water mostly ranges between 0 6 and 4 ds m 1 depending on water source geographical area year and season etc magán et al 2008 sánchez et al 2015 in these areas tomato a moderately sensitive species to salinity maas and hoffman 1977 hanson et al 2006 is mostly soil grown and frequently irrigated with moderately saline water 1 3 4 0 ds m 1 which might enhance some fruit quality parameters magán et al 2008 sánchez et al 2015 in these tomato crops though farmers frequently over irrigate sánchez et al 2015 bonachela et al 2018 salts accumulate in the soil wet bulb where most roots are located leading to high salinity levels throughout most of the second half of their cycles cabrera corral et al 2016 to our knowledge little research has been carried out into irrigation practices rates and frequencies of irrigation water or nutrient solution applications etc to control soil salinity during and after tomato crops grown in mediterranean greenhouses and irrigated with moderately saline water in order to reduce water and fertilizer use and to minimise salt accumulation in the wet bulb nutrient pollution and salinisation of the groundwater the main aims of the work were to analyse and optimise i irrigation practices regarding soil salt accumulation throughout the crop cycle and ii irrigation practices to leach accumulated salts after the cropping period in soil grown greenhouse tomato crops irrigated with moderately saline water in a mediterranean area 2 material and methods 2 1 site and experiments the experiments were conducted in a parral type greenhouse 24 m 18 m located at the research station of cajamar foundation las palmerillas 2 43 w 36 48 n 155 m a s l on the almería coast se spain the greenhouse was a low cost structure covered with plastic film divided in two parts by a 2 m width aisle and with a layered soil known as enarenado and of widespread use in the region the soil consisted of the naturally occurring gravelly sandy loam soil covered with a 0 4 m layer of imported silty clay loam soil and an upper 0 1 m mulch layer of coarse sand and fine gravel particles the 0 05 m upper part of the imported soil layer was mixed with sand and gravel particles from the top layer this greenhouse soil presents high ph values above 7 mostly due to its high caco3 content calcareous soil the saturation water content for the imported silty clay loam layer was 0 43 m3 m 3 and the upper limit of drained water content field capacity was 0 37 m3 m 3 measured in unaltered soil samples using hyprop and wp4c decagon devices inc washington usa there were two free drainage lysimeters of 8 0 m2 surface orgaz et al 2005 which can be considered to present undisturbed soil conditions as they have been continuously cultivated since the early nineties cabrera corral et al 2016 two tomato solanum lycopersicum l experiments irrigated with moderately saline water were carried out to evaluate how to reduce irrigation water use and soil salt accumulation during and after the cropping period table 1 fig 1 a first crop grown from 3 february to 29 june 2016 was subjected to four common irrigation fertigation practices in order to know better how to manage soil salinity during the cropping period practice 1 p1 29 02 12 04 and 2 05 15 05 two or more short irrigations with nutrient solution were daily supplied automatically when the soil matric potential was lower than 20 kpa at two of the three digital tensiometers or than 30 kpa at one tensiometer the daily irrigation rate was close to the tomato evapotranspiration requirement etc practice 2 p2 13 04 01 05 and 26 05 12 06 the irrigation rate equal to the etc in the second half of march but approximately 10 higher at the end of april and beginning of may was supplied daily with one irrigation of nutrient solution practice 3 p3 16 05 25 05 the irrigation rate about 10 higher than the etc was supplied daily alternating one day with water and the other with nutrient solution practice 4 p4 13 06 20 06 the irrigation rate equal to the etc was supplied every two days with nutrient solution these irrigation practices were evaluated mainly by analysing periodical and continuous measurements of soil water content and electrical conductivity of the soil solution throughout the tomato cycle in the second tomato crop from 13 september 2016 24 may 2017 two irrigation treatments were studied one crop irrigated with nutrient solution alone c and another one with water and nutrient solution lf in the latter at each irrigation event about 30 10 in winter was firstly supplied as water and the rest as nutrient solution irrigation rates and frequencies were the same for both treatments the soil salt content and nutrient concentration at the beginning of this experiment were similar for the two studied treatments representative tomato cultivars adapted to spring cultivar valquiria for 2016 and autumn spring cultivar ateneo for 2016 17 cycles were chosen greenhouse air temperature and humidity were measured throughout both tomato cycles with a capacitance psychrometer hmp45 vaisala campbell scientific inc logan ut usa daily global solar radiation was calculated from outdoor measurements with a pyranometer cmp3 kipp zonen campbell scientific and the greenhouse transmission coefficient was periodically measured with a ceptometer accupar par lai ceptometer decagon devices inc pullman wa usa mean seasonal values of daily greenhouse air temperature and humidity and outdoor global solar radiation were 19 1 ºc 72 0 and 21 5 mj m 2 d 1 respectively for the 2016 cycle as compared to 17 4 ºc 72 2 and 15 4 mj m 2 d 1 for the 2016 17 cycle the external surface of greenhouses was whitened with calcium carbonate throughout the spring for air cooling following local practices water or nutrient solution was supplied through a surface drip system with over 90 distribution uniformity emitters one per plant of 2 4 l h 1 of nominal flow at 1 atm uniram netafim tel aviv israel were 0 5 m apart and 1 5 m between rows 1 33 plants m 2 this is a common plant density for traditional low cost mediterranean greenhouses in the area the mean composition of the irrigation water and the nutrient solution supplied to both tomato cycles is shown in table 2 in these crops although the ph of the supplied nutrient solution was adjusted to a value close to 6 by adding acids the ph of the soil solution in the rooted zone remained high above 7 5 throughout both cycles bonachela et al 2020 salinas et al 2020 due to the high ph buffering capacity of this calcareous soil the etc was calculated using the eto kc fao method adapted to mediterranean greenhouses fernández et al 2010 orgaz et al 2005 daily kc values determined by fernández 2000 were slightly corrected if necessary when crop leaves were pruned the irrigation water was usually applied when the soil matric potential ψm was between 20 and 30 kpa these ψm values prevent water deficits in mediterranean greenhouse grown vegetable crops thompson et al 2007a the irrigation rates and frequencies used during the 2016 17 tomato crop cycle were determined taking into account the results from the previous 2016 tomato experiment the total irrigation water supply was 312 mm for the 2016 cycle and 387 and 386 mm respectively for the c and lf treatments of the 2016 17 cycle while the total calculated crop evapotranspiration was 313 mm for the 2016 cycle and 378 mm for the 2016 17 cycle crops were managed following local practices plants were periodically pruned and harvested growing vertically supported by cord guides to a height of 2 25 m after which they were allowed to grow freely downwards three experiments without crop were also conducted to evaluate how to leach with irrigation the salts accumulated in the previous cropping period table 1 fig 1 in the first experiment carried out after a 2014 15 sweet pepper crop and before the 2016 tomato crop about 102 mm of water of 1 6 ds m 1 ec were applied with irrigation rates of about 9 13 mm before this experiment the soil had been disinfected with agrocelhone c aql central valencia spain a chemical product that contains 99 5 of chloropicrin in the middle of the experiment immediately after having supplied about 55 mm all emitter lines were longitudinally displaced 0 25 m leading to an interchange of measurement positions below the emitter row in the second experiment carried out after the 2016 tomato crop about 25 mm of water of 1 6 ds m 1 ec was supplied by two treatments one single irrigation and four irrigations of about 6 4 mm every two days in the third experiment carried after the 2016 17 tomato crop about 60 mm of water of 1 6 ds m 1 ec were supplied by 18 9 and 6 irrigations of 3 3 6 5 and 10 mm d 1 respectively the irrigation rates applied in these experiments are based on information from local technical advisers and thompson et al 2007b the total amount of irrigation water supplied to reach an appropriate electrical conductivity value of the soil solution ecss to initiate a new crop cycle was within the range reported by thompson et al 2007b for the same greenhouse area these three experiments which were integrated with the above mentioned tomato experiments were carried out before the first studied tomato crop between both tomato cycles and after the second studied tomato cycle in order to better analyse the total irrigation water used in this greenhouse crop system the soil salt content and nutrient concentration at the beginning of these experiments were similar for the studied treatments 2 2 statistical analysis in the 2016 17 tomato crop and in the three experiments without crop treatments were arranged in a randomised complete block design with four replications one way analysis of variance was used to test for statistical differences among treatments when differences were significant p 0 05 tukey s hsd difference procedure was used for mean comparisons the experimental unit was three plant or emitter rows of about 8 m length 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil solution sampling suction cups model ssat irrometer riverside ca usa were installed randomly before crop planting at four representative positions three repetitions per

from the emitter and perpendicular to the drip line in the middle of silty clay loam layer 0 35 m depth br m soil solution samples were taken at these positions for all the experiments and treatments table 1 except for the two first experiments without crop only taken at e m and be m and for the 3 3 and 10 0 mm d 1 irrigation rates in the third experiment without crop only taken at e m be m and br m at each measurement date a suction of about 50 60 kpa was applied to each suction cup four hours after irrigation and the soil solution was collected early the following day and stored at 4 ºc the ecss ds m 1 was measured with a conductivimeter basic model 30 crison instruments sa barcelona spain the concentration of the main soil nutrients nitrate potassium calcium magnesium sodium chloride and sulphate in the two first experiments without crop table 1 at the beginning 20 02 middle 17 05 and end 29 06 of the 2016 tomato cycle and the concentration of chloride in the 2016 and 2016 2017 tomato cycles were measured using standard laboratory methods mapa 1994 the concentration of nitrate potassium calcium and sodium on all the remaining sampling dates in the two tomato experiments and in the third experiment without crop table 1 was measured with laqua twin no3 k ca2 and na sensors horiba instruments inc ca usa respectively strong linear relationships between laqua sensors and laboratory measurements were found for nitrate potassium calcium and sodium and the errors of using these rapid analysis methods were relatively low cabrera corral et al 2016 these relationships were applied to correct laqua data for the sampling dates when laboratory measurements were not conducted 2 3 2 soil water potential soil water content and bulk and pore electrical conductivity the ψm kpa

calibration supplied by the manufacturer and the pore water or soil solution electrical conductivity ecss ds m 1 was estimated with the equations provided by hilhorst 2000 and bonachela et al 2018 the θw was also measured 0 02 0 05 m from emitter and plant in the upper part of the gravelly sandy loam layer 0 55 m depth with three 10hs sensors decagon devices inc throughout the 2016 tomato crop 2 3 3 water use the irrigation water or nutrient solution applied was measured daily with a pulse counter arad sf regaber barcelona spain in all the treatments and experiments 2 3 4 petiole sap analysis the nitrate and the potassium concentration in the petiole sap was measured at representative dates throughout the 2016 17 tomato crop peña fleitas et al 2015 for each determination the most recently fully expanded leaf from four different plants in each replicate plot was removed upon sampling leaves were enclosed in sealed plastic bags from which air had been squeezed and were immediately refrigerated before processing in the laboratory within 6 h of sampling petioles were removed from each leaf cut into 1 cm long pieces and then squeezed with a manual garlic press the resulting juice from the four petioles in each replicate plot was filtered before analysis with laqua twin no3 and k probes horiba instruments inc 2 3 5 crop biomass and productivity the shoot dry matter and its partitioning into vegetative and fruit biomass were measured in two plants per replication at the end of the 2016 17 tomato crop axillary stems and old leaves were pruned throughout the cycle following local practices and included in the corresponding biomass fraction total marketable and non marketable yield and yield components of the marketable yield fruit number and mean fruit weight were measured in 8 plants per replication eight fruits per replication were selected to measure fruit dry matter total soluble solids content tss º brix and titratable acidity of marketable tomato fruits were also measured in four fruits per replication for titratable acidity measurement organic acids were titrated with 0 1 mol l 1 naoh and calculated as equivalents of citric acid expressed as a percentage 3 results 3 1 soil salinity management without crop 3 1 1 soil salt leaching after the 2014 15 sweet pepper crop at the beginning of this experiment the ecss in the soil wet bulb was very high about 9 5 ds m 1 fig 2 due to the salts accumulated throughout the previous sweet pepper crop but also to the subsequent soil disinfection treatment with chloropicrin a chemical fumigant that liberates nitrogen and chloride about 102 mm of water of 1 6 ds m 1 ec was supplied to lixiviate the accumulated salts with irrigation rates of 9 3 12 8 mm d 1 fig 2 the initial ecss substantially decreased after each irrigation event in the middle of the silty clay loam layer below the emitter e m but not in the middle of the silty clay loam layer between two contiguous emitters be m after applying about 55 mm of water the ecss decreased to 3 7 ds m 1 at e m but hardly changed at be m 9 0 ds m 1 hereafter the drip irrigation lines were longitudinally displaced 0 25 m to reduce more homogeneously the salt content within the whole soil wet bulb which led to an exchange of the two measured soil positions then the subsequent irrigations decreased substantially the ecss at the former

considered appropriate for starting a new crop cycle according to local practices at both positions the ecss values were to a great extent attributable to the accumulation and subsequent leaching respectively of two salts chloride and sodium table 3 the soil solution concentration of these salts throughout the experiment generally presented a similar response to that observed for the ecss they decreased substantially at e m and scarcely at be m throughout the first half of the irrigation period and the opposite occurred in the second half once the soil positions had been exchanged in general a similar response was also observed for the soil concentration of most nutrients table 3 3 1 2 soil salt leaching after the 2016 tomato crop about 25 mm of water of 1 6 ds m 1 ec was supplied for salt leaching in two treatments a single irrigation versus four of about 6 4 mm d 1 every two days at the two soil positions measured e m and be m the ecss initially between 6 and 7 ds m 1 decreased less with one irrigation than with four shorter ones fig 3 nevertheless the total amount of water supplied in both irrigation treatments was insufficient to leach properly the salts accumulated in the wet bulb the ecss at the end of this experiment was too high for growing a new greenhouse crop fig 3 the soil solution concentration of the main salts chloride and sodium and nutrients nitrate potassium calcium magnesium and sulphate also decreased less with one long irrigation than with four shorter ones table 4a and the concentrations of sodium and particularly chloride at the end of both treatments were high 3 1 3 soil salt leaching after the 2016 17 tomato crop about 60 mm of water of 1 6 ds m 1 ec was applied with three irrigation rates fig 3 the initial ecss about 6 ds m 1 for all the positions of the wet bulb decreased slightly more and faster with the irrigation rate of 3 3 mm d 1 than with the greater irrigation rates at e m fig 3a while no differences were observed between irrigation rates at the two other measured positions be m and br m figs 3b and 3c at the end of the experiment the ecss which was generally lower at e m than at be m or br m for all the irrigation rates reached values considered appropriate for starting a new crop cycle according to local practices especially at e m moreover the mean soil solution concentration of the main salts and nutrients in the wet bulb average of e m be m and br m decreased substantially at the end of the experiment particularly sodium and chloride table 4b consequently the lixiviates collected from the drainage lysimeters in the treatment irrigated with 6 5 mm d 1 were mostly composed of the two main salts coming from the irrigation water sodium and especially chloride fig 3d with some nitrate 3 2 soil salinity management during tomato crops 3 2 1 2016 tomato cycle the mean ecss in the soil wet bulb measured with suction cups increased throughout this tomato cycle reaching values above 6 ds m 1 at the end fig 4a the mean soil solution concentration of sodium and particularly chloride in the wet bulb also increased substantially throughout the cycle reaching relatively high values fig 4b while the mean soil solution concentration of nitrate potassium and calcium was relatively steady throughout except at the end when the nitrate concentration rose slightly when the daily crop evapotranspiration requirements were met by applying two or more short irrigations per day with nutrient solution p1 the volumetric water content θw just below the silty clay loam soil layer remained relatively steady fig 4c and the mean ecss of the wet bulb progressively increased which can be clearly observed in the continuous ecss data from the gs3 fig 4a by contrast the application of the daily crop evapotranspiration requirements march or slightly higher values may june with a single irrigation per day with nutrient solution p2 increased the θw below the imported soil layer slightly march or clearly may june but maintained the mean ecss of the wet bulb relatively steady on the other hand applying one irrigation per day over several days slightly above the crop evapotranspiration requirement alternating one day with only water and the other with nutrient solution p3 increased the θw below the imported soil layer and decreased gs3 or maintained steady suction cup the mean ecss of the wet bulb the soil matric potential ψm in the middle of the wet bulb at e m remained relatively steady between 10 and 20 kpa during these scenarios fig 4d finally the application over several days of the crop evapotranspiration requirements with one irrigation every two days p4 at the end of the cycle maintained steady the θw below the silty clay loam soil layer decreased the ψm and increased slightly the mean ecss of the wet bulb 3 2 2 2016 17 tomato cycle 3 2 2 1 crop water use and soil water status the total water supply was practically the same for the two studied treatments fig 5 387 mm for the crop irrigated with nutrient solution c and 386 mm for that irrigated with water 110 mm and nutrient solution 276 mm at each irrigation of the lf treatment

in the middle of the wet bulb e m which remained above 30 kpa throughout most of the tomato cycle except for some parts of the winter period was relatively similar for both irrigation treatments fig 5b 3 2 2 2 soil salinity the mean ecss in the wet bulb average of e m be m br m and e l measured with the suction cup increased progressively reaching values of about 6 ds m 1 at the end of the winter period in the c treatment and remained relatively steady later on fig 6a in the lf treatment the seasonal ecss dynamic was similar to that observed for c while the absolute values were slightly lower throughout most of the cycle although they were not significantly different except for one measurement date 24 04 the seasonal dynamics of the mean soil solution concentration of chloride and sodium in the wet bulb average of e m be m br m and e l were relatively similar to those observed for the ecss in both irrigation treatments fig 6b and c the absolute values of the mean soil solution concentration of chloride and sodium were in general similar for both irrigation treatments and no significant differences were observed between treatments for any measuring date this is in accordance with the similar amounts of sodium and chloride supplied via irrigation to both treatments 558 and 556 kg ha 1 of sodium and 1207 and 1190 kg ha 1 of chloride for the c and lf treatment respectively 3 2 2 3 soil and plant nutrient status the total amount of nutrients supplied with irrigation to the lf treatment were lower than in the c one 1404 versus 1755 kg ha 1 of nitrate 20 lower 771 versus 989 kg ha 1 of potassium 22 lower and 740 versus 841 kg ha 1 of calcium 12 lower approximately 96 of the total amount of supplied nitrogen 415 and 330 kg ha 1 for the c and lf treatments respectively was supplied as nitrate the mean soil solution concentrations of nitrate potassium and calcium in the wet bulb initially similar for both treatments were generally lower in the lf than in the c treatment throughout most of the rest of the cycle fig 7 however no symptoms of nutrient deficiency or toxicity were visually detected for any treatment the nitrate concentration in the petiole sap was slightly lower in the lf treatment compared to the c one throughout most of the tomato cycle while the potassium concentration in the petiole sap was similar for both irrigation treatments fig 8 3 2 2 4 crop growth and productivity the shoot dry matter and its partitioning into vegetative and reproductive biomass were similar for both irrigation treatments at the end of the tomato cycle table a 1 no significant differences were found between irrigation treatments for the vegetative generative and total shoot dry matter the total shoot biomass at the end of the tomato cycle was 2263 and 2274 g m 2 for the c and lf treatments respectively the marketable non marketable and total fresh weight of tomato fruits accumulated at the end of the cycle were also similar for both irrigation treatments table a 1 no significant differences were observed between irrigation treatments for any of these variables nor for the yield components of marketable fruits the total marketable yield was 13 2 and 13 6 kg m 2 for the c and lf treatments respectively measured parameters of fruit quality content of soluble solids and titratable acidity were also similar for both treatments table a 1 4 discussion 4 1 soil salt leaching without crop in soil grown greenhouse crops from mediterranean areas irrigated with moderately saline water it is highly recommendable to leach away a substantial part of salts previously accumulated in the soil wet bulb before transplanting or sowing a new crop in 98 of greenhouses surveyed by thompson et al 2007b additional irrigations were applied to the soil outside of the cropping period to leach salts in the three experiments carried out outside the cropping period different rates and volumes of irrigation water were applied to leach away the salts accumulated over previous crop cycles overall the lowest irrigation rate studied 3 3 mm d 1 led to the lowest values of ecss fig 3 especially at the centre of the wet bulb below the emitter e m and of chloride and sodium concentration table 4 irrigation rates of about 6 5 and 10 mm d 1 were also effective in reducing both the ecss and the concentrations of the main salts at most soil positions fig 3 table 4 but not so the highest irrigation rate 25 mm d 1 which is commonly used in this greenhouse area for salt leaching thompson et al 2007b for the studied enarenado soil considering that emitters wetted the silty clay loam soil layer to about 0 30 m on both sides of plant rows bonachela et al 2018 about 10 mm of water is needed to reach the saturation water content from field capacity high irrigation rates clearly above the water needed to reach soil saturation from field capacity in this enarenado soil such as applying 25 mm d 1 may have created preferential soil water flows thereby reducing the effectiveness of irrigation salt leaching although this hypothesis requires further research on the other hand most of the elements lixiviated from the wet bulb and collected with drainage lysimeters corresponded to the two main salts coming from the irrigation water sodium and particularly chloride fig 3 although a relevant amount of nitrate was also lixiviated thompson et al 2007b little information is available about the total irrigation water volume needed for salt leaching in soil grown mediterranean greenhouse crops thompson et al 2007b in the three experiments analysed this amount mainly depended on the initial level of soil salinity in the soil with an initial ecss of about 6 ds m 1 the application of about 60 mm of moderately saline water 1 6 ds m 1 led to an ecss of slightly below 3 ds m 1 at e m fig 3 which appears to be according to local practices sufficient for planting a new tomato crop machado and serralheiro 2017 in the same soil but with an initial ecss of about 9 5 ds m 1 the application of about 102 mm of irrigation water was needed to reach an ecss of about or lower than 3 ds m 1 at the two measured positions e m and be m although approximately 70 mm was sufficient to reach this ecss threshold at e m the middle of the wet bulb below the emitter and the plant fig 2 overall the application of 60 70 mm of irrigation water to this enarenado soil common in this greenhouse area contreras et al 2017 was needed to leach a substantial part of the salts and nutrients accumulated at the middle of the wet bulb below the emitter and the plant this amount which must be adapted to each soil type and the initial level of soil salinity minhas et al 2020 should include the irrigation water applied for soil disinfection a common annual practice in soil grown mediterranean greenhouse crops that usually consume large irrigation volumes thompson et al 2007b in the same greenhouse area the latter authors also found that about 33 of surveyed greenhouses applied more than 60 mm of irrigation water to leach salts and about 16 applied more than 80 mm thus the total irrigation water used for soil salt leaching in this area can be substantially reduced in this greenhouse area in general the ecss was lower in the middle of the wet bulb below the emitter and the plant hanson et al 2006 than in the other studied positions within the wet bulb at the end of the irrigation salt leaching experiments regardless of the irrigation rate and volume figs 2 and 3 this logical result might have notable practical consequences for drip irrigation management in mediterranean greenhouses changes in the soil location of emitter lines emitters or plant rows should be avoided or minimised due to the non uniform salt distribution in the soil and the salt accumulation near the periphery of the wet bulb hanson et al 2006 otherwise additional leaching irrigations should be applied to avoid plant growth issues particularly in salt sensitive crops 4 2 soil salt leaching during the crop period on the se spanish mediterranean coast salts mostly coming from the irrigation water accumulated in the wet bulb throughout two soil grown greenhouse tomato crops drip irrigated with moderately saline water 1 5 1 6 ds m 1 ec leading to ecss of about 6 ds m 1 or even higher during the second half of their cycles figs 4 and 6 regardless of the soil position within the wet bulb in the same area ecss values similar to those found in the two studied tomato crops were measured by cabrera corral et al 2016 using various lysimetry methods in general the high ecss found in soil grown greenhouse tomato crops from the se spanish mediterranean coastal area can be mainly attributed to the accumulation in the wet bulb of sodium and particularly chloride figs 4 and 6 these salts are abundantly supplied in the irrigation water section 2 1 but they are scarcely absorbed by the crops sonneveld and vogt 1990 minhas et al 2020 for example mean soil solution concentrations of chloride and sodium in the wet bulb at the end of the 2016 tomato cycle were 48 1 and 29 1 mmol l 1 respectively fig 4 the process of soil salt accumulation is highly dependent on the irrigation water salinity above all and the amount of irrigation water or nutrient solution supplied assouline et al 2006 minhas et al 2020 but is also influenced by soil characteristics irrigation system irrigation and fertigation practices etc minhas et al 2020 in the se spanish mediterranean greenhouse area irrigation rates clearly in excess of the crop evapotranspiration rates are frequently applied during the first phases of most crop cycles fernández et al 2007 thompson et al 2007b this practice will reduce the salt content in the wet bulb but it might be questionable when salt leaching irrigations have been properly applied before starting the tomato cycle letey et al 2011 minhas et al 2020 in the first phases of tomato crops drip irrigated with moderately saline waters and grown on soils leached properly it may be recommendable to supply merely the crop evapotranspiration requirements or slightly higher rates about 1 1 etc by irrigating every day or every two days as occurred during the p2 periods in the 2016 tomato cycle fig 4 since the salinisation rate of soils with low salinity levels depends on the amount of saline water applied meiri 1984 shalhevet 1994 the daily application of 1 1 etc might lead to a flush of salts just below the wet bulb and maintain lower ecss values in it subsequently well before the salts accumulated in the wet bulb reach hazardous levels it is advisable to over irrigate with a leaching fraction to avoid further soil salinity increments meiri 1984 shalhevet 1994 sánchez et al 2015 bonachela et al 2018 however in order to provide accurate estimates of the leaching fraction for this greenhouse tomato production system further research appears to be needed since the traditional salinity management approach to calculate leaching requirements ayers and westcot 1985 may overestimate this variable letey et al 2011 corwin and grattan 2018 on the other hand the soil salinisation rate was slightly higher when two short irrigations were applied daily p1 fig 4 rather than one longer one p2 periods as is clearly shown by the continuous ecss data estimated from gs3 fig 4 assouline et al 2006 in a sweet pepper crop grown in a screenhouse also found that the application of the crop evapotranspiration requirements by several daily irrigations pulse irrigation as opposed to one daily event increased the salt accumulation in the soil wet bulb though the issue of irrigation frequency and salinity is controversial minhas et al 2020 applying the full crop water requirements with one daily irrigation appears to be appropriate fig 4 as a further increase of the irrigation frequency did not add significant benefits assouline et al 2006 on the contrary the absence of a flush of salts to lower soil layers as in the once daily irrigated treatment is believed to be the major cause of the higher soil salinity in the active root zone under the higher irrigation frequencies assouline et al 2006 applying several irrigations per day in the tomato crop might also reduce the wet bulb volume which may in turn increase the salt load of the wet bulb minhas et al 2020 in the 2016 17 tomato crop the application of only water at the beginning of each irrigation event 11 33 of the irrigation rate and nutrient solution thereafter lf treatment fig 5 rather than applying nutrient solution over the entire irrigation event c substantially reduced 20 the total amounts supplied of the two main nutrients nitrate and potassium consequently the lf crop showed lower soil solution concentration of these nutrients than the c one fig 7 as well as slightly lower mean ecss in the wet bulb throughout most of the cycle fig 6 the latter may be mostly attributable to the lower soil solution concentration of the main nutrients fig 7 since the soil solution concentration of the main salts chloride and sodium was similar for both treatments fig 6 this is in accordance with the fact that the total amount of irrigation water supplied was practically the same for both irrigation treatments fig 5 as these salts mostly come from the irrigation water although in the lf treatment the total fertilizer supply and the concentration of the main nutrients within the wet bulb were lower no symptoms of nutrient deficiency or toxicity were visually detected for any treatment since the absolute concentration in the petiole sap of nitrate and potassium was above or within the recommended ranges hochmuth 1994 peña fleitas et al 2015 for both irrigation treatments throughout the cycle fig 8 consequently this fertigation practice did not negatively affect the biomass productivity or fruit quality of the tomato crop as no differences were found between irrigation treatments for shoot biomass and its partitioning marketable yield and yield components or fruit quality parameters table a 1 overall the lf strategy might lead to a more efficient fertilizer use and to lower nutrient leaching but it requires real time monitoring of the soil plant nutrient status in order to correct possible nutrient deficiencies and avoid crop yield drawbacks granados et al 2013 thompson et al 2020 moreover the long term application of this fertigation strategy e g for several consecutive tomato crops might require the use of more concentrated nutrient solution for some crop phases real time monitoring of the soil plant nutrient status for increasing fertilizer use efficiency and minimising soil and water pollution of high value greenhouse crops can be carried out by combined use of suction cups with on farm fast analysing systems cabrera corral et al 2016 petiole sap no3 analysis peña fleitas et al 2015 leaf chlorophyll content meters padilla et al 2018 etc however more accurate real time methods of continuously measuring the volumetric soil water content and above all the soil nutrient concentration and the ecss are still needed bonachela et al 2018 5 conclusions the integration of five experiments in a mediterranean greenhouse irrigated with moderately saline water two tomato crops and three non crop experiments conducted before the first tomato crop studied between both tomato cycles and after the second tomato cycle provides a better insight into the soil salt accumulation processes and how to leach away the accumulated salts by irrigation both during and outside the cropping period the best irrigation rates and frequencies for this production system were determined both during and outside the growing period in order to improve salt and irrigation management and minimise water use and soil and water pollution in mediterranean greenhouse tomato crops however further research is needed to better estimate the leaching fraction that must be applied before the salts accumulated in the wet bulb reach hazardous levels for this production system experimental results from the 2016 17 tomato crop indicate that in mediterranean greenhouse tomato crops irrigated with moderately saline water substantially lower amounts of fertilizer can be used than usually applied without affecting crop productivity or fruit quality this and other irrigation and fertigation strategies to increase the fertiliser use efficiency and reduce soil and water pollution are required in many mediterranean greenhouse areas declared nitrate vulnerable zones where in accordance with european union legislation there is a legal obligation to implement management practices to reduce nitrate contamination of water bodies overall the application of irrigation and fertigation strategies to reduce water use and soil salt accumulation and enhance fertiliser use efficiency in mediterranean greenhouse crops irrigated with moderately saline water requires low cost and real time monitoring systems of water and nutrients in the soil and or the plant lysimeter methods in combination with on farm fast analysing systems can already be used to monitor soil nutrient and salt status but low cost real time methods such as ecss dielectric sensors are still needed to accurately measure these parameters credit authorship contribution statement s bonachela

9694,five integrated experiments irrigated with water of moderate salinity about 1 6 ds m 1 were conducted in an spanish mediterranean greenhouse to provide a better insight into soil salt accumulation processes in tomato crops and how to leach away these salts by irrigation both during and outside the cropping period salts mostly chloride and sodium coming from the irrigation water accumulated in the soil wet bulb leading to soil solution electrical conductivities ecss of about 6 ds m 1 or higher during the second half of the crop cycles during the first phases of these tomato crops it appears to be advisable to apply the crop evapotranspiration etc requirements or slightly higher rates 1 1 etc subsequently before salts accumulated reach hazardous levels it is necessary to over irrigate with a leaching fraction to avoid further salinity increments moreover crop water requirements must be applied with a single daily irrigation rather than several shorter ones after the cropping period the application of 60 70 mm of irrigation water leached away most of the accumulated salts and led to ecss slightly below 3 ds m 1 considered appropriate for planting a new crop this amount of water which has to be adapted to the soil salinity content and characteristics supplied with daily irrigation rates of about 3 10 mm d 1 led to lower ecss values compared with higher irrigation rates moreover the application of crop water requirements with water 11 33 of the irrigation rate and nutrient solution instead of nutrient solution over the whole event substantially reduced the total fertiliser supplied and the concentration of the main nutrients in the wet bulb but did not negatively affect the biomass productivity or fruit quality of tomato crop however this

conductivity water quality 1 introduction protected agriculture is steadily growing around the world but water availability and quality are major factors limiting its expansion phogat et al 2020 in mediterranean areas water is frequently a scarce resource and its quality is worsening in many irrigation areas pulido bosch 2005 thompson et al 2007b in open field crops of mediterranean areas usually irrigated around summer with water or low concentration nutrient solution most salts and nutrients accumulated in the soil throughout the cropping period are washed away by the rainwater which mainly falls around winter in soil grown greenhouse crops fertigated with much higher nutrient concentrations than open field crops sonneveld and vogt 2009 and drip irrigated with moderately saline water like many greenhouse tomato crops on the se spanish mediterranean coast cabrera corral et al 2016 considerable amounts of nutrients and above all salts accumulate in the soil wet bulb thompson et al 2007b de pascale et al 2017 in these crops abundant irrigation water is required after the cropping periods mostly in summer to leach the accumulated salts before starting a new crop cycle sánchez et al 2015 bonachela et al 2018 according to thompson et al 2007b information describing or analysing the irrigation practices for leaching the salts accumulated in such crops is scarce these authors carried out a comprehensive survey on commercial greenhouses regarding irrigation practices that contribute to nitrate leaching loss they found that i the vast majority of farmers irrigate abundantly after the cropping period and most also irrigate just before transplanting sowing the next crop with a view to salt leaching and soil profile wetting ii the total irrigation volume applied for salt leaching varies considerably as did the irrigation rates and frequencies and iii additional abundant irrigation is frequently applied for soil disinfection after the cropping period moreover most crops are also frequently over irrigated during the first weeks of their cycles fernández et al 2007 thompson et al 2007b data on seasonal irrigation supply for greenhouse tomato crops on the se spanish mediterranean coast are scarce and vary according to crop cycle length in particular fernández et al 2007 gallardo et al 2013 reported a mean seasonal irrigation supply of 558 mm for long tomato crop cycles while sanchez et al 2015 reported mean seasonal irrigation supplies of 326 and 339 mm for two short autumn cycles but neither study considered the irrigation water supply for soil disinfection and salt leaching after the cropping period in mediterranean greenhouse areas in se spain the salt content of the irrigation water is generally increasing mostly due to nitrate contamination and above all salinisation of local aquifers pulido bosch 2005 thompson et al 2007b the electrical conductivity ec of irrigation water mostly ranges between 0 6 and 4 ds m 1 depending on water source geographical area year and season etc magán et al 2008 sánchez et al 2015 in these areas tomato a moderately sensitive species to salinity maas and hoffman 1977 hanson et al 2006 is mostly soil grown and frequently irrigated with moderately saline water 1 3 4 0 ds m 1 which might enhance some fruit quality parameters magán et al 2008 sánchez et al 2015 in these tomato crops though farmers frequently over irrigate sánchez et al 2015 bonachela et al 2018 salts accumulate in the soil wet bulb where most roots are located leading to high salinity levels throughout most of the second half of their cycles cabrera corral et al 2016 to our knowledge little research has been carried out into irrigation practices rates and frequencies of irrigation water or nutrient solution applications etc to control soil salinity during and after tomato crops grown in mediterranean greenhouses and irrigated with moderately saline water in order to reduce water and fertilizer use and to minimise salt accumulation in the wet bulb nutrient pollution and salinisation of the groundwater the main aims of the work were to analyse and optimise i irrigation practices regarding soil salt accumulation throughout the crop cycle and ii irrigation practices to leach accumulated salts after the cropping period in soil grown greenhouse tomato crops irrigated with moderately saline water in a mediterranean area 2 material and methods 2 1 site and experiments the experiments were conducted in a parral type greenhouse 24 m 18 m located at the research station of cajamar foundation las palmerillas 2 43 w 36 48 n 155 m a s l on the almería coast se spain the greenhouse was a low cost structure covered with plastic film divided in two parts by a 2 m width aisle and with a layered soil known as enarenado and of widespread use in the region the soil consisted of the naturally occurring gravelly sandy loam soil covered with a 0 4 m layer of imported silty clay loam soil and an upper 0 1 m mulch layer of coarse sand and fine gravel particles the 0 05 m upper part of the imported soil layer was mixed with sand and gravel particles from the top layer this greenhouse soil presents high ph values above 7 mostly due to its high caco3 content calcareous soil the saturation water content for the imported silty clay loam layer was 0 43 m3 m 3 and the upper limit of drained water content field capacity was 0 37 m3 m 3 measured in unaltered soil samples using hyprop and wp4c decagon devices inc washington usa there were two free drainage lysimeters of 8 0 m2 surface orgaz et al 2005 which can be considered to present undisturbed soil conditions as they have been continuously cultivated since the early nineties cabrera corral et al 2016 two tomato solanum lycopersicum l experiments irrigated with moderately saline water were carried out to evaluate how to reduce irrigation water use and soil salt accumulation during and after the cropping period table 1 fig 1 a first crop grown from 3 february to 29 june 2016 was subjected to four common irrigation fertigation practices in order to know better how to manage soil salinity during the cropping period practice 1 p1 29 02 12 04 and 2 05 15 05 two or more short irrigations with nutrient solution were daily supplied automatically when the soil matric potential was lower than 20 kpa at two of the three digital tensiometers or than 30 kpa at one tensiometer the daily irrigation rate was close to the tomato evapotranspiration requirement etc practice 2 p2 13 04 01 05 and 26 05 12 06 the irrigation rate equal

irrigation rate about 10 higher than the etc was supplied daily alternating one day with water and the other with nutrient solution practice 4 p4 13 06 20 06 the irrigation rate equal to the etc was supplied every two days with nutrient solution these irrigation practices were evaluated mainly by analysing periodical and continuous measurements of soil water content and electrical conductivity of the soil solution throughout the tomato cycle in the second tomato crop from 13 september 2016 24 may 2017 two irrigation treatments were studied one crop irrigated with nutrient solution alone c and another one with water and nutrient solution lf in the latter at each irrigation event about 30 10 in winter was firstly supplied as water and the rest as nutrient solution irrigation rates and frequencies were the same for both treatments the soil salt content and nutrient concentration at the beginning of this experiment were similar for the two studied treatments representative tomato

2016 17 cycle the external surface of greenhouses was whitened with calcium carbonate throughout the spring for air cooling following local practices water or nutrient solution was supplied through a

is shown in table 2 in these crops although the ph of the supplied nutrient solution was adjusted to a value close to 6 by adding acids the ph of the soil solution in the rooted zone remained high above 7 5 throughout both cycles bonachela et al 2020 salinas et al 2020 due to the high ph buffering capacity of this calcareous soil the etc was calculated using the eto kc fao method adapted to mediterranean greenhouses fernández et al 2010 orgaz et al 2005 daily kc values determined by fernández 2000 were slightly corrected if necessary when crop leaves were pruned the irrigation water was usually applied when the soil matric potential ψm was between 20 and 30 kpa these ψm values prevent water deficits in mediterranean greenhouse grown vegetable crops thompson et al 2007a the irrigation rates and frequencies used during the 2016 17 tomato crop cycle were determined taking into account the results from the previous 2016 tomato experiment the total irrigation water supply was 312 mm for the 2016 cycle and 387 and 386 mm respectively for the c and lf treatments of the 2016 17 cycle while the total calculated crop evapotranspiration was 313 mm for the 2016 cycle and 378 mm for the 2016 17 cycle crops were managed following local practices plants were periodically pruned and harvested growing vertically supported by cord guides to a height of 2 25 m after which they were allowed to grow freely downwards three experiments without crop were also conducted to evaluate how to leach with irrigation the salts accumulated in the previous cropping period table 1 fig 1 in the first experiment carried out after a 2014 15 sweet pepper crop and before the 2016 tomato crop about 102 mm of water of 1 6 ds m 1 ec were applied with irrigation rates of about 9 13 mm before this experiment the soil had been disinfected with agrocelhone c aql central valencia spain a chemical product that contains 99 5 of chloropicrin in the middle of the experiment immediately after having supplied about 55 mm all emitter lines were longitudinally displaced 0 25 m leading to an interchange of measurement positions below the emitter row in the second experiment carried out after the 2016 tomato crop about 25 mm of water of 1 6 ds m 1 ec was supplied by two treatments one single irrigation and four irrigations of about 6 4 mm every two days in the third experiment carried after the 2016 17 tomato crop about 60 mm of water of 1 6 ds m 1 ec were supplied by 18 9 and 6 irrigations of 3 3 6 5 and 10 mm d 1 respectively the irrigation rates applied in these experiments are based on information from local technical advisers and thompson et al 2007b the total amount of irrigation water supplied to reach an appropriate electrical conductivity value of the soil solution ecss to initiate a new crop cycle was within the range reported by thompson et al 2007b for the same greenhouse area these three experiments which were integrated with the above mentioned tomato experiments were carried out before the first studied tomato crop between both tomato cycles and after the second studied tomato cycle in order to better analyse the total irrigation water used in this greenhouse crop system the soil salt content and nutrient concentration at the beginning of these experiments were similar for the studied treatments 2 2 statistical analysis in the 2016 17 tomato crop and in the three experiments without crop treatments were arranged in a randomised complete block design with four replications one way analysis of variance was used to test for statistical differences among treatments when differences were significant p 0 05 tukey s hsd difference procedure was used for mean comparisons the experimental unit was three plant or emitter rows of about 8 m length 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil solution sampling suction cups model ssat irrometer riverside ca usa were installed randomly before crop planting at four representative positions three repetitions per

ecss ds m 1 was measured with a conductivimeter basic model 30 crison instruments sa barcelona spain the concentration of the main soil nutrients nitrate potassium calcium magnesium sodium chloride and sulphate in the two first experiments without crop table 1 at the beginning 20 02 middle 17 05 and end 29 06 of the 2016 tomato cycle and the concentration of chloride in the 2016 and 2016 2017 tomato cycles were measured using standard laboratory methods mapa 1994 the concentration of nitrate potassium calcium and sodium on all the remaining sampling dates in the two tomato experiments and in the third experiment without crop table 1 was measured with laqua twin no3 k ca2 and na sensors horiba instruments inc ca usa respectively strong linear relationships between laqua sensors and laboratory measurements were found for nitrate potassium calcium and sodium and the errors of using these rapid analysis methods were relatively low cabrera corral et al 2016 these relationships were applied to correct laqua data for the sampling dates when laboratory measurements were not conducted 2 3 2 soil water potential soil water content and bulk and pore electrical conductivity the ψm kpa

the nitrate and the potassium concentration in the petiole sap was measured at representative dates throughout the 2016 17 tomato crop peña fleitas et al 2015 for each determination the most recently fully expanded leaf from four different plants in each replicate plot was removed upon sampling leaves were enclosed in sealed plastic bags from which air had been squeezed and were immediately refrigerated before processing in the laboratory within 6 h of sampling petioles were removed from each leaf cut into 1 cm long pieces and then squeezed with a manual garlic press the resulting juice

partitioning into vegetative and fruit biomass were measured in two plants per replication at the end of the 2016 17 tomato crop axillary stems and old leaves were pruned throughout the cycle following local practices and included in the corresponding biomass fraction total marketable and non marketable yield and yield components of the marketable yield fruit number and mean fruit weight were measured in 8 plants per replication eight fruits per replication were selected to measure fruit dry matter total soluble solids content tss º brix and titratable acidity of marketable tomato fruits were also measured in four fruits per replication for titratable acidity measurement organic acids were titrated with 0 1 mol l 1 naoh and calculated as equivalents of citric acid expressed as a percentage 3 results 3 1 soil salinity management without crop 3 1 1 soil salt leaching after the 2014 15 sweet pepper crop at the beginning of this experiment the ecss in the soil wet bulb was very high about 9 5 ds m 1 fig 2 due to the salts accumulated throughout the previous sweet pepper crop but also to the subsequent soil disinfection treatment with chloropicrin a chemical fumigant that liberates nitrogen and chloride about 102 mm of water of 1 6 ds m 1 ec was supplied to lixiviate the accumulated salts with irrigation rates of 9 3 12 8 mm d 1 fig 2 the initial ecss substantially decreased after each irrigation event in the middle of the silty clay loam layer below the emitter e m but not in the middle of the silty clay loam layer between two contiguous emitters be m after applying about 55 mm of water the ecss decreased to 3 7 ds m 1 at e m but hardly changed at be m 9 0 ds m 1 hereafter the drip irrigation lines were longitudinally displaced 0 25 m to reduce more homogeneously the salt content within the whole soil wet bulb which led to an exchange of the two measured soil positions then the subsequent irrigations decreased substantially the ecss at the former be m position now e m position and moderately at the former e m position now be m position at the end of the experiment the ecss was practically similar at both positions fig 2 attaining values considered appropriate for starting a new crop cycle according to local practices at both positions the ecss values were to a great extent attributable to the accumulation and subsequent leaching respectively of two salts chloride and sodium table 3 the soil solution concentration of these salts throughout the experiment generally presented a similar response to that observed for the ecss they decreased substantially at e m and scarcely at be m throughout the first half of the irrigation period and the opposite occurred in the second half once the soil positions had been exchanged in general a similar response was also observed for the soil concentration of most nutrients table 3 3 1 2 soil salt leaching after the 2016 tomato crop about 25 mm of water of 1 6 ds m 1 ec was supplied for salt leaching in two treatments a single irrigation versus four of about 6 4 mm d 1 every two days at the two soil positions measured e m and be m the ecss initially between 6 and 7 ds m 1 decreased less with one irrigation than with four shorter ones fig 3 nevertheless the total amount of water supplied in both irrigation treatments was insufficient to leach properly the salts accumulated in the wet bulb the ecss at the end of this experiment was too high for growing a new greenhouse crop fig 3 the soil solution concentration of the main salts chloride and sodium and nutrients nitrate potassium calcium magnesium and sulphate also decreased less with one long irrigation than with four shorter ones table 4a and the concentrations of sodium and particularly chloride at the end of both treatments were high 3 1 3 soil salt leaching after the 2016 17 tomato crop about 60 mm of water of 1 6 ds m 1 ec was applied with three irrigation rates fig 3 the initial ecss about 6 ds m 1 for all the positions of the wet bulb decreased slightly more and faster with the irrigation rate of 3 3 mm d 1 than with the greater irrigation rates at e m fig 3a while no differences were observed between irrigation rates at the two other measured positions be m and br m figs 3b and 3c at the end of the experiment the ecss which was generally lower at e m than at be m or br m for all the irrigation rates reached values considered appropriate for starting a new crop cycle according to local practices especially at e m moreover the mean soil solution concentration of the main salts and nutrients in the wet bulb average of e m be m and br m decreased substantially at the end of the experiment particularly sodium and chloride table 4b consequently the lixiviates collected from the drainage lysimeters in the treatment irrigated with 6 5 mm d 1 were mostly composed of the two main salts coming from the irrigation water sodium and especially chloride fig 3d with some nitrate 3 2 soil salinity management during tomato crops 3 2 1 2016 tomato cycle the mean ecss in the soil wet bulb measured with suction cups increased throughout this tomato cycle reaching values above 6 ds m 1 at the end fig 4a the mean soil solution concentration of sodium and particularly chloride in the wet bulb also increased substantially throughout the cycle reaching relatively high values fig 4b while the mean soil solution concentration of nitrate potassium and calcium was relatively steady throughout except at the end when the nitrate concentration rose slightly when the daily crop evapotranspiration requirements were met by applying two or more short irrigations per day with nutrient solution p1 the volumetric water content θw just below the silty clay loam soil layer remained relatively steady fig 4c and the mean ecss of the wet bulb progressively increased which can be clearly observed in the continuous ecss data from the gs3 fig 4a by contrast the application of the daily crop evapotranspiration requirements march or slightly higher values may june with a single irrigation per day with nutrient solution p2 increased the θw below the imported soil layer slightly march or clearly may june but maintained the mean ecss of the wet bulb relatively steady on the other hand applying one irrigation per day over several days slightly above the crop evapotranspiration requirement alternating one day with only water and the other with nutrient solution p3 increased the θw below the imported soil layer and decreased gs3 or maintained steady suction cup the mean ecss of the wet bulb the soil matric potential ψm in the middle of the wet bulb at e m remained relatively steady between 10 and 20 kpa during these scenarios fig 4d finally the application over several days of the crop evapotranspiration requirements with one irrigation every two days p4 at the end of the cycle maintained steady the θw below the silty clay loam soil layer decreased the ψm and increased slightly the mean ecss of the wet bulb 3 2 2 2016 17 tomato cycle 3 2 2 1 crop water use and soil water status the total water supply was practically the same for the two studied treatments fig 5 387 mm for the crop irrigated with nutrient solution c and 386 mm for that irrigated with water 110 mm and nutrient solution 276 mm at each irrigation of the lf treatment 11 of the irrigation rate in winter and 30 33 in the remaining crop periods was firstly supplied with only water and the rest was subsequently supplied with nutrient solution fig 5a the mean daily ψm in the middle of the wet bulb e m which remained above 30 kpa throughout most of the tomato cycle except for some parts of the winter period was relatively similar for both irrigation treatments fig 5b 3 2 2 2 soil salinity the mean ecss in the wet bulb average of e m be m br m and e l measured with the suction cup increased progressively reaching values of about 6 ds m 1 at the end of the winter period in the c treatment and remained relatively steady later on fig 6a in the lf treatment the seasonal ecss dynamic was similar to that observed for c while the absolute values were slightly lower throughout most of the cycle although they were not significantly different except for one measurement date 24 04 the seasonal dynamics of the mean soil solution concentration of chloride and sodium in the wet bulb average of e m be m br m and e l were relatively similar to those observed for the ecss in both irrigation treatments fig 6b and c the absolute values of the mean soil solution concentration of chloride and sodium were in general similar for both irrigation treatments and no significant differences were observed between treatments for any measuring date this is in accordance with the similar amounts of sodium and chloride supplied via irrigation to both treatments 558 and 556 kg ha 1 of sodium and 1207 and 1190 kg ha 1 of chloride for the c and lf treatment respectively 3 2 2 3 soil and plant nutrient status the total amount of nutrients supplied with irrigation to the lf treatment were lower than in the c one 1404 versus 1755 kg ha 1 of nitrate 20 lower 771 versus 989 kg ha 1 of potassium 22 lower and 740 versus 841 kg ha 1 of calcium 12 lower approximately 96 of the total amount of supplied nitrogen 415 and 330 kg ha 1 for the c and lf treatments respectively was supplied as nitrate the mean soil solution concentrations of nitrate potassium and calcium in the wet bulb initially similar for both treatments were generally lower in the lf than in the c treatment throughout most of the rest of the cycle fig 7 however no symptoms of nutrient deficiency or toxicity were visually detected for any treatment the nitrate concentration in the petiole sap was slightly lower in the lf treatment compared to the c one throughout most of the tomato cycle while the potassium concentration in the petiole sap was similar for both irrigation treatments fig 8 3 2 2 4 crop growth and productivity the shoot dry matter and its partitioning into vegetative and reproductive biomass were similar for both irrigation treatments at the end of the tomato cycle table a 1 no significant differences were found between irrigation treatments for the vegetative generative and total shoot dry matter the total shoot biomass at the end of the tomato cycle was 2263 and 2274 g m 2 for the c and lf treatments respectively the marketable non marketable and total fresh weight of tomato fruits accumulated at the end of the cycle were also similar for both irrigation treatments table a 1 no significant differences were observed between irrigation treatments for any of these variables nor for the yield components of marketable fruits the total marketable yield was 13 2 and 13 6 kg m 2 for the c and lf treatments respectively measured parameters of fruit quality content of soluble solids and titratable acidity were also similar for both treatments table a 1 4 discussion 4 1 soil salt leaching without crop in soil grown greenhouse crops from mediterranean areas irrigated with moderately saline water it is highly recommendable to leach away a substantial part of salts previously accumulated in the soil wet bulb before transplanting or sowing a new crop in 98 of greenhouses surveyed by thompson et al 2007b additional irrigations were applied to the soil outside of the cropping period to leach salts in the three experiments carried out outside the cropping period different rates and volumes of irrigation water were applied to leach away the salts accumulated over previous crop cycles overall the lowest irrigation rate studied 3 3 mm d 1 led to the lowest values of ecss fig 3 especially at the centre of the wet bulb below the emitter e m and of chloride and sodium concentration table 4 irrigation rates of about 6 5 and 10 mm d 1 were also effective in reducing both the ecss and the concentrations of the main salts at most soil positions fig 3 table 4 but not so the highest irrigation rate 25 mm d 1 which is commonly used in this greenhouse area for salt leaching thompson et al 2007b for the studied enarenado soil considering that emitters wetted the silty clay loam soil layer to about 0 30 m on both sides of plant rows bonachela et al 2018 about 10 mm of water is needed to reach the saturation water content from field capacity high irrigation rates clearly above the water needed to reach soil saturation from field capacity in this enarenado soil such as applying 25 mm d 1 may have created preferential soil water flows thereby reducing the effectiveness of irrigation salt leaching although this hypothesis requires further research on the other hand most of the elements lixiviated from the wet bulb and collected with drainage lysimeters corresponded to the two main salts coming from the irrigation water sodium and particularly chloride fig 3 although a relevant amount of nitrate was also lixiviated thompson et al 2007b little information is available about the total irrigation water volume needed for salt leaching in soil grown mediterranean greenhouse crops thompson et al 2007b in the three experiments analysed this amount mainly depended on the initial level of soil salinity in the soil with an initial ecss of about 6 ds m 1 the application of about 60 mm of moderately saline water 1 6 ds m 1 led to an ecss of slightly below 3 ds m 1 at e m fig 3 which appears to be according to local practices sufficient for planting a new tomato crop machado and serralheiro 2017 in the same soil but with an initial ecss of about 9 5 ds m 1 the application of about 102 mm of irrigation water was needed to reach an ecss of about or lower than 3 ds m 1 at the two measured positions e m and be m although approximately 70 mm was sufficient to reach this ecss threshold at e m the middle of the wet bulb below the emitter and the plant fig 2 overall the application of 60 70 mm of irrigation water to this enarenado soil common in this greenhouse area contreras et al 2017 was needed to leach a substantial part of the salts and nutrients accumulated at the middle of the wet bulb below the emitter and the plant this amount which must be adapted to each soil type and the initial level of soil salinity minhas et al 2020 should include the irrigation water applied for soil disinfection a common annual practice in soil grown mediterranean greenhouse crops that usually consume large irrigation volumes thompson et al 2007b in the same greenhouse area the latter authors also found that about 33 of surveyed greenhouses applied more than 60 mm of irrigation water to leach salts and about 16 applied more than 80 mm thus the total irrigation water used for soil salt leaching in this area can be substantially reduced in this greenhouse area in general the ecss was lower in the middle of the wet bulb below the emitter and the plant hanson et al 2006 than in the other studied positions within the wet bulb at the end of the irrigation salt leaching experiments regardless of the irrigation rate and volume figs 2 and 3 this logical result might have notable practical consequences for drip irrigation management in mediterranean greenhouses changes in the soil location of emitter lines emitters or plant rows should be avoided or minimised due to the non uniform salt distribution in the soil and the salt accumulation near the periphery of the wet bulb hanson et al 2006 otherwise additional leaching irrigations should be applied to avoid plant growth issues particularly in salt sensitive crops 4 2 soil salt leaching during the crop period on the se spanish mediterranean coast salts mostly coming from the irrigation water accumulated in the wet bulb throughout two soil grown greenhouse tomato crops drip irrigated with moderately saline water 1 5 1 6 ds m 1 ec leading to ecss of about 6 ds m 1 or even higher during the second half of their cycles figs 4 and 6 regardless of the soil position within the wet bulb in the same area ecss values similar to those found in the two studied tomato crops were measured by cabrera corral et al 2016 using various lysimetry methods in general the high ecss found in soil grown greenhouse tomato crops from the se spanish mediterranean coastal area can be mainly attributed to the accumulation in the wet bulb of sodium and particularly chloride figs 4 and 6 these salts are abundantly supplied in the irrigation water section 2 1 but they are scarcely absorbed by the crops sonneveld and vogt 1990 minhas et al 2020 for example mean soil solution concentrations of chloride and sodium in the wet bulb at the end of the 2016 tomato cycle were 48 1 and 29 1 mmol l 1 respectively fig 4 the process of soil salt accumulation is highly dependent on the irrigation water salinity above all and the amount of irrigation water or nutrient solution supplied assouline et al 2006 minhas et al 2020 but is also influenced by soil characteristics irrigation system irrigation and fertigation practices etc minhas et al 2020 in the se spanish mediterranean greenhouse area irrigation rates clearly in excess of the crop evapotranspiration rates are frequently applied during the first phases of most crop cycles fernández et al 2007 thompson et al 2007b this practice will reduce the salt content in the wet bulb but it might be questionable when salt leaching irrigations have been properly applied before starting the tomato cycle letey et al 2011 minhas et al 2020 in the first phases of tomato crops drip irrigated with moderately saline waters and grown on soils leached properly it may be recommendable to supply merely the crop evapotranspiration requirements or slightly higher rates about 1 1 etc by irrigating every day or every two days as occurred during the p2 periods in the 2016 tomato cycle fig 4 since the salinisation rate of soils with low salinity levels depends on the amount of saline water applied meiri 1984 shalhevet 1994 the daily application of 1 1 etc might lead to a flush of salts just below the wet bulb and maintain lower ecss values in it subsequently well before the salts accumulated in the wet bulb reach hazardous levels it is advisable to over irrigate with a leaching fraction to avoid further soil salinity increments meiri 1984 shalhevet 1994 sánchez et al 2015 bonachela et al 2018 however in order to provide accurate estimates of the leaching fraction for this greenhouse tomato production system further research appears to be needed since the traditional salinity management approach to calculate leaching requirements ayers and westcot 1985 may overestimate this variable letey et al 2011 corwin and grattan 2018 on the other hand the soil salinisation rate was slightly higher when two short irrigations were applied daily p1 fig 4 rather than one longer one p2 periods as is clearly shown by the continuous ecss data estimated from gs3 fig 4 assouline et al 2006 in a sweet pepper crop grown in a screenhouse also found that the application of the crop evapotranspiration requirements by several daily irrigations pulse irrigation as opposed to one daily event increased the salt accumulation in the soil wet bulb though the issue of irrigation frequency and salinity is controversial minhas et al 2020 applying the full crop water requirements with one daily irrigation appears to be appropriate fig 4 as a further increase of the irrigation frequency did not add significant benefits assouline et al 2006 on the contrary the absence of a flush of salts to lower soil layers as in the once daily irrigated treatment is believed to be the major cause of the higher soil salinity in the active root zone under the higher irrigation frequencies assouline et al 2006 applying several irrigations per day in the tomato crop might also reduce the wet bulb volume which may in turn increase the salt load of the wet bulb minhas et al 2020 in the 2016 17 tomato crop the application of only water at the beginning of each irrigation event 11 33 of the irrigation rate and nutrient solution thereafter lf treatment fig 5 rather than applying nutrient solution over the entire irrigation event c substantially reduced 20 the total amounts supplied of the two main nutrients nitrate and potassium consequently the lf crop showed lower soil solution concentration of these nutrients than the c one fig 7 as well as slightly lower mean ecss in the wet bulb throughout most of the cycle fig 6 the latter may be mostly attributable to the lower soil solution concentration of the main nutrients fig 7 since the soil solution concentration of the main salts chloride and sodium was similar for both treatments fig 6 this is in accordance with the fact that the total amount of irrigation water supplied was practically the same for both irrigation treatments fig 5 as these salts mostly come from the irrigation water although in the lf treatment the total fertilizer supply and the concentration of the main nutrients within the wet bulb were lower no symptoms of nutrient deficiency or toxicity were visually detected for any treatment since the absolute concentration in the petiole sap of nitrate and potassium was above or within the recommended ranges hochmuth 1994 peña fleitas et al 2015 for both irrigation treatments throughout the cycle fig 8 consequently this fertigation practice did not negatively affect the biomass productivity or fruit quality of the tomato crop as no differences were found between irrigation treatments for shoot biomass and its partitioning marketable yield and yield components or fruit quality parameters table a 1 overall the lf strategy might lead to a more efficient fertilizer use and to lower nutrient leaching but it requires real time monitoring of the soil plant nutrient status in order to correct possible nutrient deficiencies and avoid crop yield drawbacks granados et al 2013 thompson et al 2020 moreover the long term application of this fertigation strategy e g for several consecutive tomato crops might require the use of more concentrated nutrient solution for some crop phases real time monitoring of the soil plant nutrient status for increasing fertilizer use efficiency and minimising soil and water pollution of high value greenhouse crops can be carried out by combined use of suction cups with on farm fast analysing systems cabrera corral et al 2016 petiole sap no3 analysis peña fleitas et al 2015 leaf chlorophyll content meters padilla et al 2018 etc however more accurate real time methods of continuously measuring the volumetric soil water content and above all the soil nutrient concentration and the ecss are still needed bonachela et al 2018 5 conclusions the integration of five experiments in a mediterranean greenhouse irrigated with moderately saline water two tomato crops and three non crop experiments conducted before the first tomato crop studied between both tomato cycles and after the second tomato cycle provides a better insight into the soil salt accumulation processes and how to leach away the accumulated salts by irrigation both during and outside the cropping period the best irrigation rates and frequencies for this production system were determined both during and outside the growing period in order to improve salt and irrigation management and minimise water use and soil and water pollution in mediterranean greenhouse tomato crops however further research is needed to better estimate the leaching fraction that must be applied before the salts accumulated in the wet bulb reach hazardous levels for this production system experimental results from the 2016 17 tomato crop indicate that in mediterranean greenhouse tomato crops irrigated with moderately saline water substantially lower amounts of fertilizer can be used than usually applied without affecting crop productivity or fruit quality this and other irrigation and fertigation strategies to increase the fertiliser use efficiency and reduce soil and water pollution are required in many mediterranean greenhouse areas declared nitrate vulnerable zones where in accordance with european union legislation there is a legal obligation to implement management practices to reduce nitrate contamination of water bodies overall the application of irrigation and fertigation strategies to reduce water use and soil salt accumulation and enhance fertiliser use efficiency in mediterranean greenhouse crops irrigated with moderately saline water requires low cost and real time monitoring systems of water and nutrients in the soil and or the plant lysimeter methods in combination with on farm fast analysing systems can already be used to monitor soil nutrient and salt status but low cost real time methods such as ecss dielectric sensors are still needed to accurately measure these parameters credit authorship contribution statement s bonachela
