24700,emergent aquatic vegetation eav is an important part of wetland ecosystems that provide multiple ecological services however human activities and natural changes often influence wetland hydrological regimes such as water levels salinity and other factors which greatly influence the survival and growth of wetland plants based on field measurements and control experiments we developed an eav model to simulate biomass dynamics under changing conditions of water levels and salinity this model successfully reproduced the seasonal biomass variation of three typical emergent plants phragmites australis typha angustifolia and scirpus mariqueter and simulated the response of eva biomass under multiple scenarios of water levels and salinity in the chongming dongtan nature reserve cdnr shanghai china results suggest that there is a negative correlation between salinity and biomass an optimal range of water levels are suitable for eav and biomass will decrease when the water levels are below or above their optimal range applying this dynamic eav model is a cost effective approach to find a sustainable and nature based solution to managing and predicting wetland vegetation changes the model and approach used in this study may provide a sustainable and nature based solution for management and protection of wetland ecosystems and may be transferrable to other wetland systems as well keywords emergent aquatic vegetation vegetation biomass model wetland water level water salinity nature based solution 1 introduction as an important part of wetland ecosystems the community spatial pattern and productivity of emergent aquatic vegetation eav are the habitat quality indexes useful for evaluating wetland structure and function matthews 2015 taddeo and dronova 2018 the health of eav is influenced by various environmental factors such as light temperature nutrition water level and salinity smith and dukes 2013 zhang et al 2020 changes in hydrological regimes are considered to be the main factors controlling the distribution and succession of eav he et al 2017 grabas et al 2019 liu et al 2020 many studies have highlighted that changes in water depth and salinity concentration can influence photosynthetic and biomass accumulation in leaves by affecting leaf development stomata size photosynthetic enzymatic rate respiration rate and nutrient uptake causing ion toxicity chaves et al 2009 jacoby et al 2011 song et al 2020 and may be responsible for significant changes in the spatial pattern and biomass of wetland vegetation huckelbridge et al 2010 grabas et al 2019 the biomass of wetland vegetation reflecting the primary productivity of the wetland system is a key indicator of the health of the vegetation and sustainability of the ecosystem jones et al 2016 taddeo and dronova 2018 maintaining an appropriate amount of biomass is of great importance for achieving nature based wetland management staszak and armitage 2013 thorslund et al 2017 taddeo and dronova 2018 vegetation biomass or productivity measurements are usually obtained by using biological sampling the eddy flux method and the remote sensing process model which are time consuming and laborious or may insufficiently reflect the heterogeneity of ecological elements in high resolution and cannot predict future plant growth changes blatchford et al 2019 sun et al 2019 the dynamic vegetation model is governed by an underlying vegetation mechanism controlled by a variety of ecological processes which has remarkable predictive abilities and is suitable for coupling with the hydrological model to quantitatively forecast the potential for aquatic vegetation growth and reproduction in different nutrient water levels and salinity conditions kuroda et al 2020 therefore the dynamic vegetation models have been increasingly applied in wetland ecosystems to simulate the impacts of nutrient enrichment control and fluctuation of water depth or turbidity on aquatic plant growth špoljar et al 2017 lavaud et al 2020 and to guide wetland restoration in lakes shallow estuaries and reservoirs brush and nixon 2010 jin and ji 2013 špoljar et al 2017 existing dynamic vegetation models often lack quantification of the effects of environmental dynamics on eav growth developing a model including the quantification of water salt effects on eav biomass could predict wetland vegetation dynamics under future changes of hydrological regimes and salinity as well as providing nature based strategies for wetlands restoration and management to quantitatively simulate and predict the potential impacts of hydrological regimes and salinity dynamics on eav biomass we developed a dynamic eav model with the aim of providing a useful tool for the management of wetland vegetation and being applied to other wetland systems firstly we modeled the photosynthetic responses to temperature and light intensity for three typical emergent plants phragmites australis typha angustifolia and scirpus mariqueter in a restored wetland in the chongming dongtan national nature reserve cdnr shanghai china and plant biomass responses to the changes in salinity and water levels were measured by control experiments secondly based on the submerged aquatic vegetation model by cerco et al 2001 the equation of photosynthesis and respiration of eav was improved through field measurements the limit functions of water levels and salinity in control experiments were added so that our eav model could simulate biomass dynamics of eav under different water level and salinity conditions thirdly the model parameters were estimated reasonably well by field measurements control experiments and literature data and goodness of fit was assessed by comparing simulation results with field measured data finally seasonal biomass dynamics of the three species under different water level and salinity conditions in the restored chongming dongtan wetlands were successfully reproduced by this dynamic eav model the implications of the model results could improve our understanding of eav biomass dynamics and the likely role of eav in wetland ecosystems 2 study area and method 2 1 study area the cdnr 31 25 31 38 n 121 50 122 05 e located on the eastern fringe of chongming island at the mouth of the yangtze river china fig 1 a was designated as internationally important under the ramsar wetlands convention tian et al 2008 as an important station on the eastern migratory routes of the asian and pacific region 17 orders 50 families and 288 species of waterbirds have been recorded there ma et al 2009 in 1995 the exotic species s alterniflora smooth cordgrass was introduced to cdnr where it gradually replaced the native s mariqueter and p australis spread across more than 1 3 of the total saltmarsh wetlands and seriously degraded waterbird habitats yuan et al 2014 in order to control the invasive s alterniflora and recover waterbird habitats a large scale ecological engineering project for controlling s alternaflora and optimizing bird habitats 23 6 km2 was conducted in the cdnr from 2013 to 2016 fig 1b the ecological engineering area was enclosed by 27 km of dykes and s alternaflora was cleared thoroughly by cutting and then drowning in this embanked semi natural wetland region the reserved saltmarsh species are predominantly p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia the recovered wetlands inside the engineering region were divided into three parts and several separate sections for different bird habitats and the ecosystem based management of hydrology was carried out by controlling sluices and pumps to maintain the optimized habitats without natural tidal processes the water levels and salinity could keep relative stable in separate sections which provided ideal field sites to study dynamic vegetation responses under different water level and salinity conditions 2 2 field measurement the biomass of three dominant eav species p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia was measured at multiple sampling points fig 1c at each sampling point three 2 m 2 m quadrats were set and aboveground biomass of eav were harvested and measured from may to october 2019 these measured biomass data were used to validate the model in august 2019 leaf surface area was measured in the field and leaf dry weight dw was measured in the lab after drying the photosynthetic rates under a series of temperature and light intensity were measured in the field by using a portable steady state photosynthetic measurement system li 6400 xt li cor inc lincoln ne usa li et al 2018 the measured data of photosynthesis leaf surface area and dry weight were used to estimate the model parameters 2 3 control experiment of water levels and salinity to investigate the response of plant biomass to changes in water levels and salinity two factor water level and salinity interactive experiments were conducted during the growing season april october in 2019 at a greenhouse in cdnr healthy plants of p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia with consistent height were collected from the ecological engineering area in april then ten individuals of s mariqueter three individuals of p australis and three individuals of t angustifolia were transplanted with soil into experimental pots each diameter 20 cm height 50 cm all pots with transplanted plants were then placed into a series of tanks each length 60 cm width 40 cm height 80 cm for different treatments of water levels and salinity according to the different tolerance of these three species to flooding and salinity five static water levels were set at 0 5 10 15 and 20 cm for s mariqueter 0 10 20 30 and 50 cm for p australis and 0 15 30 45 and 60 cm for t angustifolia at the same time five salinity conditions were established at 0 5 10 15 and 20 for these three species thus there were totally 25 treatments and each treatment with 3 replicates the aboveground and underground parts of these experimental plants with different treatments were harvested in the end of experiments october and the dry weights dw were measured in the lab after drying 2 4 eav model the eav model is developed based on a sav model by cerco et al 2001 2002 with the aim to incorporate multiple stressors into simulating plant biomass dynamics under different water level and salinity conditions the model includes processes of primary production respiration ecological factor limitation and decay two model state variables of the eav model are dry weight biomass of aboveground leaves and stems along with underground roots which are applied for three major species of wetland plants and can be expressed as 1 d g r d t p l f 1 f a m f s f l f p g r b m g r g r d 2 d r t d t p l f 1 f a m f s f l f p r t b m r t r t where g r and r t are biomass of aboveground plants leaves and stems and roots g dw m 2 b m gr and b m rt are the respiration dry weight ratio of aboveground plants and roots day 1 p l f is the primary production of leaves g dw day 1 m 2 fam is the fraction of leaf production devoted to active metabolism thornley 1970 caleb et al 2016 the production of aboveground plants and roots is expressed as a fraction of leaf primary production where f p g r and f p r t are fractions of leaf production routed to aboveground and root biomass biomass allocation is determined by biomass ratio between aboveground and root biomass both f l and f s are dimensionless functions varying from 0 to 1 which are the stress functions due to the impact of water level and salinity on plant production we used a multiplicative approach to incorporate the stressors of water levels and salinity on primary production d is seasonal mortality adjustment parameter which is a ratio between biomass reduction due to decay and total biomass as the aboveground part of the eav will wither and decay in the end of growing season while the underground part still be alive so d only exists in eq 1 the formula of d is further explained in section 2 4 4 2 4 1 plant primary production the plant primary production rate is computed using photosynthesis with several limiting factors and converted to dry weight using a c dw ratio 3 p l f p i f n u a c d w where f n u is the limitation of nutrition resources on photosynthesis which is mainly the nutrient limitations of n and p and its formulas will be explained in the section 2 4 4 p i is photosynthesis production of per unit area g c m 2 day 1 and is converted to dry weight by a c d w a c d w is plant carbon content g c g 1 dw which represents the ratio of carbon to dry weight c dw a c d w ranges from 0 4 0 5 for crops and aquatic plants ma et al 2016 2018 photosynthesis production of leaves is the organic matter accumulated by leaf photosynthesis per unit time which is a function of leaf area 4 p i lai p m m c where lai is leaf area index m2 m 2 expressed as the projected area of leaves over a unit of land bréda 2008 which is proportional to the aboveground biomass kimball et al 2002 m c is the molar mass of carbon g c mol 1 the change in lai may be regulated by the phenological phase of the plant when the plant grows to a certain stage the leaf area will stop increasing kimball et al 2002 and therefore the lai is modified to 5 l a i min g r l a r l a i m a x l a i m a x occurs from july august for the eav in the yangtze estuary ge et al 2016 the lai of the plants in the study area is obtained by using the prospect radiative transmission model jacquemoud and baret 1990 verrelst et al 2012 based on remote sensing images of the sentinel 2 satellite then the l a i m a x for the three species is estimated though comparing the lai of each month l a r is leaf area ratio m2 g 1 which is the total leaf area divided the dry weight of the plant it is equal to the product of the leaf mass ratio lmr and the specific leaf area sla 6 l a r s l a l m r where s l a is specific leaf area m2 g 1 expressed as the ratio of leaf area leaf mass l m r is the leaf mass ratio g g 1 expressed as the ratio of leaf mass plant mass the l a r of p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia is obtained based on measurements during 2019 photosynthesis p m mol co2 m 2 day 1 is a process in which plants absorb co2 to produce c containing organics and release o2 when light is available which is measured by the o2 or co2 flux mol m 2 using a conversion factor m c g c mol 1 of 12 as 12 g mass of c is produced per mole of co2 as the plant growth is temperature dependent the temperature limit function uses a piecewise function to achieve a better fit to the photosynthetic data 7 p m c o n p m m a x e k t g 1 t t o p t t x t o p t 2 w h e n t t o p t 8 p m c o n p m m a x

day 1 which can be customarily expressed in μmol m 2 s 1 using a conversion constant c o n 2 4 2 plant respiration plant respiration can be divided into growth respiration and maintenance respiration thornley 1970 the model represents growth respiration f a m as a function of the primary production chiariello et al 1989 caleb et al 2016 which is proportional to the growth rate and its formulation is described in eqs 1 and 2 while maintenance respiration is proportional to biomass caleb et al 2016 which is affected by temperature 10 b m g r b m r g r g r q 10 10 1 t tr 11 b m r t b m r r t r t q 10 10 1 t tr where b m r is the respiration rate at temperature tr day 1 q 10 is the metabolic change rate per 10 c in temperature where g r q 10 and r t q 10 are above and under ground respectively with a value of approximately 2 0 atkin et al 2005 2 4 3 limitation function the growth of wetland plants is also controlled by water levels and salinity humphries et al 2011 sheng et al 2015 the water level and salinity stressors are included as growth limitation functions the limiting functions are developed based on the data obtained from the control experiments using empirical approach we found that gaussian functions work well for our experimental data to represent the nonlinear plant response this function has been often used to describe the ecological amplitudes of plant species yuan et al 2020a therefore the effects of water levels and salinity on eav growth are empirically described by gaussian models with different parameters for different species the empirical equations used for salinity and water lever are expressed as 12 f s e s a l t μ s 2 2 λ s 2 13 f l e l e v e l μ l 2 2 λ l 2 where l e v e l and s a l t are water level cm and salinity and their optimal values where biomass reached its maximum are expressed as μ s and μ l λ l and λ s are tolerance for water levels and salinity respectively which affects the adaptation interval of the plant the model parameters are determined based on the best fit of the experimental data the growth of plants is always limited by the availability of nutrients here a simple term cerco and moore 2001 is built into the model and expressed as 14 f n u m i n f n f p where f n and f p are limitations of n and p which are evaluated from a formula that combines individual monod like functions for roots and shoots madden and kemp 1996 the limiting functions for nitrogen and phosphorus are 15 f n n h 4 w n o 3 w khnw khns n h 4 s khnw nh 4 w n o 3 w khnw khns n h 4 s 16 f p p o 4 w khpw khps p o 4 s khpw p o 4 w khpw khps p o 4 s where n h 4 w n o 3 w p o 4 w n h 4 s p o 4 s are nutrient concentrations in the water column and sediments respectively g m 3 khnw khns khpw and khps are half saturation concentrations for nitrogen and phosphorus uptake from water column and sediments respectively g m 3 2 4 4 plant decay due to seasons in the wetlands natural decay of aboveground plants in the autumn is controlled by genes displaying a seasonal rhythm the aboveground biomass decay rate is forced as a function of temperature we use a stress terms to increase respiration of vegetation the sigmoid function often used to solve two class classification problems is used for the model here we add it to the respiration term to account for the decay occurring with temperature 17 d a 1 e b t c φ 1 the magnitude of the decay function is controlled by a and the temperature dependent decay is decided by a linear function determined by b c 1 c c and φ φ is the base rate of decay the parameters are obtained by fitting the plant biomass measurements in the study area in autumn the d term is 1 when the temperature does not reach the seasonal decay temperature and the d term rises rapidly until the biomass reaches to zero biomass when the temperature is below the decay temperature threshold 2 5 model calibration validation and sensitivity analysis 2 5 1 model parameter determination model parameters of local functions are manually calibrated by using datasets from control experiments field measurements and literature values all parameters are adjusted again within their known ranges until an acceptable visual fit is achieved between the simulated and observed biomass these observed biomasses have been measured at multiple sampling points fig 1c from may to october 2019 the spring measured biomass is used by the model as the initial condition in addition the initial biomass of each year can also be determined by the winter biomass of the previous year when the model is running continuously 2 5 2 model validation the model s goodness of fit is assessed using error statistics of mean absolute percent error mape mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse increases and decreases of the infinitival condition of plant biomass in favorable environmental conditions result in similar biomass trajectories with differences only in magnitude which would be reflected in peak biomass water levels and salinity values measured at the part of sampling points are input to the calibrated model to simulate the peak biomass the goodness of fit of measured and simulated peak biomass is assessed by analysis of mape mae and rmse 2 5 3 model sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the model to initial conditions and individual parameter estimates is tested by running the model and varying key parameter values by 1 2 and 2 times the initial values of state variables and with each parameter set at 20 of its value obtained from model calibration for parameters whose approximate ranges we know or which are accepted by other models with less uncertainty the values are used directly results of the sensitivity run are measured as the percent difference from the standard run 18 s b i o standard b i o s e n s i t i c i t y b i o standard 100 where b i o is the model prediction of a given variable on a given day b i o standard refers to the standard run and b i o s e n s i t i c i t y refers to the sensitivity runs the overall model sensitivity s to a given parameter is computed as the average of two sensitivity runs an increase or decrease of parameter values 2 6 model application seasonal biomass dynamics of three plants are simulated by the eav model to compare differences in vegetation growth under different water levels 0 5 10 15 20 cm and salinity conditions 0 5 10 15 20 3 result 3 1 parameter estimation par and temperature correction function fig 2 are calculated based on the fit of the photosynthesis mechanistic equation eq 9 and the piecewise equation eqs 7 and 8 to measured photosynthesis data for different plant species respectively the photosynthetic rate of the three plants increases with increasing light intensity it can be seen that p australis reaches saturation earlier than s mariqueter and t angustifolia fig 2a the rmse of par photosynthesis is 0 83 μmol m 2 s 1 which indicates that the light dependent photosynthesis function is suitable for simulating eav the photosynthetic rates of three species increase with an increase in temperature until it reaches to an optimum value and then a rapid decline occurs fig 2b the rmse of temperature photosynthesis is 2 35 μmol m 2 s 1 which suggests that the piecewise function works well for describing the relationship between temperature and photosynthesis and that it is suitable for simulating eav the control experiment results indicate that the adaptability to water levels and salinity of p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia is different and the relationships between normalized biomass and water level or salinity are in accordance with gaussian distribution fig 3 the parameters are estimated based on the best fit of the gaussian equation and experiment datasets eqs 12 and 13 the results fig 3 are satisfactory with rmse values of 0 13 and 0 14 for water levels and salinity respectively this shows that the biomass of eav depends heavily on both water levels and salinity and that the equations used fit our experimental data the salinity and water level limiting functions are determined based on control experiments the parameters used for determining light and temperature dependent functions are calibrated based on photosynthetic measurements the rmse is generally satisfactory for the datasets and the model functions can fit the data well other model parameters are obtained from model calibration of simulated plant biomass against observations and listed in table 1 the observation data and experimental data provide most of the parameters required by the model and thus only a small set of unknown model parameters need to calibrate 3 2 model validation the light and temperature dependent growth functions established based on observation data are directly used for the eav model the salinity and water level limiting functions based on control experiments are implemented in the model the aboveground biomass dynamics of p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia are simulated though a calibrated model based on measured temperature solar radiation water levels and salinity in 2019 since there are large variations in the measured biomass data the model calibration focuses on simulating the mean model results show that the simulated biomass of the three plants fell within the appropriate envelope of sampling biomass data from the field surveys fig 4 the statistics table 2 derived by comparing measured values and model predictions are within an acceptable range the mape of the model predictions of biomass are 56 80 34 06 and 37 98 for p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia respectively while mae and rms are 266 78 and 326 20 g dw m 2 for p australis 85 06 and 144 83 g dw m 2 for s mariqueter and 180 35 and 235 28 g dw m 2 for t angustifolia the model seems to perform better for s mariqueter and t angustifolia based on the statistics which may be caused by p australis adjusting its biomass to adapt to a wider range of environmental conditions increases and decreases in favorable environmental conditions result in similar biomass trajectories with the differences only in magnitude which can be reflected in peak biomass observed versus simulated data in august fig 5 indicate an overall good performance of the model prediction of peak biomass the error results table 2 indicate that the model has a good predictive skill for simulating seasonal variation of eav biomass under different water level and salinity conditions in addition samples in the vicinity of two sites are selected in the study area for comparison of measured biomass against the model simulation as verification without changing the calibrated model parameters overall s mariqueter and t angustifolia biomass are remarkably higher in the low salinity environments fig 6 b c as compared to the medium salinity fig 6e f while p australis biomass shows a similar pattern in the low and medium salinity environments fig 6a d as expected different initial condition of biomass water levels and salinity limit the growth of eav and result in a different biomass distribution 3 3 sensitivity analysis model sensitivity tests are performed for selected key model parameters and the most parameters vary by 5 to 20 the biomass predicted by the eav model is moderately sensitive to values of initial conditions and some key parameters table 3 as the biomass generally change less than 40 the biomass measured in spring is used by the model as the initial conditions increases and decreases in initial conditions result in similar biomass trajectories with the different magnitudes acdw is highly sensitive and its change can result in an increase or decrease in biomass however the acdw associated with each species is usually considered unchanged and its measurement errors exceed not more than 20 3 4 change in eav biomass under different water levels and salinity the model results suggest that high water levels and salinity will reduce eav growth fig 7 plant biomass will decrease as the water levels and salinity increase the impacts of different environmental variables on eav begin in june and show significant differences between august and september the model results with different salinity levels indicate that p australis can survive at 20 salinity and has the strongest salinity tolerance among the three species s mariqueter biomass decreases rapidly when salinity reaches higher than 15 and cannot survive when salinity reaches 20 t angustifolia has the weakest salinity tolerance when salinity reaches 10 growth of t angustifolia is significantly inhibited and cannot survive when salinity is higher than 15 the simulation results for changing water levels show that the shallow water levels between 5 and 10 cm can facilitate the growth of eav but water levels either higher than 10 cm or below 5 cm are not beneficial to the plants the biomass of s mariqueter will clearly decrease when the water level is higher than 15 cm and s mariqueter will die quickly under 20 cm water levels however 0 20 cm water levels will not significantly influence the biomass of p australis and t angustifolia fluctuations in water level and salinity will also affect plant biomass results indicate that biomass responses of s mariqueter to water level and salinity are completely different at different growth stages fig 8 accumulation of biomass is slower under the high water level 20 cm or salinity 20 in spring while increases rapidly when water level and salinity decrease in summer fig 8a and d in contrast accumulation of biomass increases quickly in spring and slows down when the water levels or salinity increases in summer fig 8b and e meanwhile the peak biomass in summer are lower than that in spring fig 8a 8b 8d and 8e in addition if the stress exceeds the tolerance range of s mariqueter the biomass cannot recover even if the stress disappears fig 8c and f 4 discussion 4 1 ecological mechanism of the model although the dynamic vegetation model is formated as plant unit biomass it is ideally suitable for scaling the role of vegetation to the system level as the underlying vegetation mechanisms are controlled by a variety of ecological processes ganju et al 2016 at the moment multiple species can be represented by our model with multiple parameter sets for different regions in the eav model the model can also be applied in a two dimensional grid setting and coupled with a hydrodynamic model however no more than one species can be assigned for each model cell as the competitions between plant species are not considered in the current model and the changes in plant biomass are only influenced by the light supply and temperature water levels and salinity adaptation light is no longer a strong limiting factor for eav in the process of photosynthesis if plant density is not very high the difference in light utilization will be reflected more by the difference in leaf area the parameter sla is important to the eva model because it determines that the capacity of new leaves produced for each unit of biomass and therefore determines the lai value fang and liang 2014 it should be noted that each plant has its own maximum lai which could be a plant survival strategy under environmental stress that makes population growth consistent with logistic growth function aside from light temperature is a primary factor affecting seasonal growth and photosynthesis nakayama et al 2020 the piecewise function works well for describing the relationship between temperature and photosynthesis as photosynthetic rates of plants usually increase with raising of temperature until they reach an optimum value and after that a rapid decline occurs smith and dukes 2013 plants use respiration to maintain survival provide the energy required for the daily maintenance of cells and provide substances and energy for biomass synthesis during their growth thornley 2011 the maintenance respiration of plants is basically stable regardless of growth rate can be calculated according to the proportion of dry weight and is affected by temperature chiariello et al 1989 caleb et al 2016 the growth respiration of plants is proportional to the growth rate and the respiration rate can reflect the intensity of the physiological activity of the tissue van iersel and seymour 2000 caleb et al 2016 plant respiration is very sensitive to temperature and the q10 exponential equation is widely used to describe the relationship between temperature and respiration atkin et al 2005 global q10 observations show that q10 has a certain degree of spatial heterogeneity li et al 2020 while it has been agreed that the q10 for the same plant species can be approximated as a fixed value in the small scale area atkin et al 2005 as long as the q10 value of a species and the respiration rate at a certain temperature are known one can infer its maintenance respiration rate at any temperature therefore the estimation of accurate q10 value and proportion of maintenance respiration has a significant effect on the model based on data collected from the soil nutrients are not limited in the chongming ecological restoration area and therefore nutritional limitations are negligible in this study water level and salinity limitations are strong limiting factor for eav and affect the process of photosynthesis and growth respiration jacoby et al 2011 song et al 2020 therefore the gaussian functions of water levels and salinity can describe the effects on the total primary productivity including the process of photosynthesis and respiration in this study we use a multiplicative approach to incorporate the stressors of water levels and salinity on primary production by multiplying functions of water levels and salinity each range from 0 to 1 the interactions between them can be well expressed the growth of eav is controlled by various meteorological events including sudden changes in light temperature rainfall and flood smith and dukes 2013 nakayama et al 2020 light and temperature have been considered as the primary factors controlling seasonal growth of eav nakayama et al 2020 meanwhile the vegetation hydrology feedbacks are of crucial importance as every stage of plant life depends on water availability nakayama et al 2020 rainfall and flood can induce severe fluctuations in the water levels which may affect the attenuation of biomass grabas et al 2019 liu et al 2020 therefore the eav biomass responses to the changes in water levels has been paid special attention in our eav model besides intense floods can even cause scour vegetation uprooting and mechanical damage in wetlands of riparian area latella et al 2020 currently various models incorporated the interactions of vegetation with floods have been developed to evaluate the colonization and succession of riparian vegetation kuroda et al 2020 in our study the mechanical damage of flood has not included in the eav model because the results from our control experiments suggest that it is not suitable to simulate the effects of the short term flood event on eav biomass dynamic moreover climate change will also alter flooding timing and magnitude creating inundation and salinity conditions different from the current conditions for vegetation kuroda et al 2020 nakayama et al 2020 elevated salinity intrusion great flood or drought would limit productivity and carbon storage nakayama et al 2020 the effects of interaction among sea level rise hydrology and water hydrodynamics on flooding and salinity should be further investigated to understand their influence on future vegetation 4 2 role of water levels and salinity for emerged plant development studies show that water levels and salinity play a vital role in controlling aquatic vegetation height biomass production vegetation cover species richness and reproduction brock et al 2005 he et al 2017 grabas et al 2019 liu et al 2020 changes in eav vegetation patterns and characteristics are sensitive to the water level fluctuations a stable moderate water level is conducive to the maintenance of eav vegetation health cover survivorship and reproduction humphries et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 grabas et al 2019 liu et al 2020 low salinity is beneficial to increasing vegetation biomass species richness and seedling numbers strehlow et al 2005 huckelbridge et al 2010 sheng et al 2015 he et al 2017 the ecological restoration area inside cdnr differs from natural coastal wetlands because the tidal effect is completely removed however the restoration area in cdnr offers a unique method of managing wetland vegetation by artificially controlling the hydrological regimes and salinity a negative correlation has been found between the maximum biomass and water level and salinity in five common water level and salinity scenarios in the study area based on the results of control experiments and model sensitivity runs for 5 water level scenarios shallow water of 5 10 cm is conducive to the biomass accumulation of eav while too high or low water levels are not conducive to biomass accumulation increasing the water levels will reduce the biomass of eav the possible reason is that increased water level can cause an insufficient oxygen supply to the eav s roots zhou et al 2020 many studies have reported that the biomass of eav is sensitive of water levels which may vary from species to species buffington et al 2020 janousek and mayo 2013 the results from our study indicate that s mariqueter is sensitive to water levels and prefers to grow at a water level of 0 15 cm in the wetlands while p australis and t angustifolia are more tolerant to flooding and their biomass does not shown significant reduction even at water level of 20 cm the reason may be that increased water levels reduce the oxygen supply to the roots of eav and the plant underground portion of s mariqueter is significantly lower than that of p australis and t angustifolia so they are more likely to die of hypoxia it has been reported that s mariqueter is a flood tolerant species water level over 1 m in the tidal environment yuan et al 2020b however our study shows that s mariqueter could not resist to continuous flooding under stable water level even at the water levels less than 25 cm as continuous flooding increases root flooding time hypoxia stress and plant mortality compared with other study p australis and t angustifolia in our study show a similar flood tolerance li et al 2018 the increased salinity usually has a negative impact on saltmarsh plants under a fluctuating tide regime buffington et al 2020 the difference in salinity tolerance of eav plants is determined by their individual characteristics in our study aboveground biomass of t angustifolia and s mariqueter decrease significantly with the raising salinity under stable water levels and the salinity tolerance of s mariqueter p australis and t angustifolia is significantly different the result of our study is consistent with other study that the discrepancy of p australis growth and photosynthetic activity under 15 is not significantly different and p australis and s alterniflora exhibit a high salt tolerance li et al 2018 the combined effects of flooding and salinity can be greater than the effects of each stressor alone buffington et al 2020 species with low salinity tolerance may be more susceptible to interactive effects as the extended flooding exposes the plants to prolonged osmotic imbalance and salt accumulation in the soil janousek and mayo 2013 and to reduce the threshold of salinity tolerance he et al 2017 a variety of saltmarsh plants including s alterniflora p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia have been verified to have combined effects of flooding and salinity chen et al 2013 wen et al 2017 li et al 2018 buffington et al 2020 our eav model has developed a multiplicative approach to incorporate the stressors of water levels salinity and their combined effects on primary production which can improve our understanding of how these interactions affect the eav vegetation dynamics and persistence 4 3 sensitivity of model the sensitivity to various parameter values show the importance and accuracy of the model parameters and formula in this study the photosynthesis process of three species of eav is measured and modeled and sensitivity to various model parameter values is analyzed the sensitivity runs show that biomass changes are generally less than 40 relative to the standard run and these changes are within the same range as the estimated model error however we do not fully understand the response of key processes respiration budding and decay to the environment variables which highlights the need for community survey data to optimize various parameters the relational expressions such as between photosynthesis and respiration or water levels and salinity may be site specific and species specific and rely on the data from a given study area to support model development in addition eav has different phenophase stages such as germination leaf exhibition growth and panicle accumulated temperature may be a way to identify the phenophase as these stages have differences in responses to environmental and physiological parameters however due to the lack of data it is difficult to calibrate the parameters and verify the sensitivity of the parameters in each phenophase stage in addition to the sensitivity of parameters the sensitivity of main environmental factors has been also tested in this study temperature has the higher sensitivity and is an important factor determining the biomass accumulation since temperature can affect the daily photosynthesis and respiration and growth period of plants temperature may also be important when the model is applied to other areas in this study the sensitivity of water levels and salinity is low which means that small scale water level and salinity fluctuations will not cause the model to go out of control this indicates that model results are credible even if it is difficult to accurately predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of water levels and salinity because of the complexity of the wetland terrain and the difficulties of accurate surface elevation measurement 4 4 implications for eva management water level and salinity are important factors that limit plant growth in saltwater wetlands they affect many physiological processes while the majority of mechanisms are poorly understood particularly at the biochemical level munns and tester 2008 flowers et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 in this study the experimental results of the response of three species to water levels and salinity are quantified in the model our model sensitivity runs for 5 water levels and salinity scenarios provide useful information on the response of eav to changes in water level and salinity the results suggest that this model can promote studies on the interactive effects of hydrology regimes and salinity on physiological ecology diversity of species and vegetation dynamics of wetland plants the eav model successfully reproduces the biomass dynamics of three plant species in changing water salinity conditions vegetation is an important component of the wetland ecosystem changes in hydrological regimes and salinity due to climate change and human activities can directly affect the distribution and succession of wetland vegetation which has caused general degradation and salinization of natural wetlands resulting in a serious threat to the ecological health of these ecosystems huckelbridge et al 2010 hu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 to solve these problems the eav model can be coupled with hydrology and climate models to predict the evolution or succession of wetlands in future hydrological and salinity scenarios as well as to provide scientifically based decision support for wetland protection and management our results indicate that the eav model could simulate eav biomass dynamic under stable water level environment although the real hydrologic dynamics in field are more complex the constantly changing water levels and salinity can be input into the model to help us predict the growth of plants the results suggest that biomass responses of s mariqueter to water levels and salinity are completely different at different growth stages the results highlight that maintaining the optimal water levels in summer is most conducive to the accumulation of eav biomass and eav can grow quickly in summer even if their growth is strongly inhibited in spring however the stress cannot exceed the tolerance of the plant in spring otherwise plant cannot survive and recovery the eav model offers a useful tool to easily quantify the wetland eav biomass dynamic under different hydrology through model parameters corresponding to the water levels and salinity based on the predicted results of the model the manager could control biomass and protect or control certain species by managing hydrological condition in certain season the results of our simulations suggest that water level and salinity regulation could be used as a method of managing wetland vegetation water level regulation has an impact on biomass accumulation for p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia which can be used a tool for managing excessive biomass in wetlands salinity regulation can inhibit the growth of p australis and significantly control the survival of s mariqueter and t angustifolia which can be an effective tool for managing species diversity the plant community may succeed in a p australis t angustifolia community at low salinity p australis s mariqueter community at medium salinity and p australis community at high salinity we prefer to find suitable water levels and salinity through models to regulate plant growth rather than controlling vegetation types through artificial harvesting or planting therefore modeling is more suitable for the context of natural and sustainable development which highlights that adaptability of plants under different water levels and salinity concentrations that play an important role in future research 5 conclusion we have developed a dynamic eva model and applied it to the cdnr shanghai china our eva model successfully simulates the biomass dynamics of three typical emergent plants under different water levels and salinities in a non tidal environment results suggest that there is a negative correlation between salinity and biomass as salinity increases the biomass of these three plants will continue to decrease there will be optimal ranges of water levels suitable for plant biomass accumulation for different species the biomass will decrease when below or above the optimal water levels the modeling approach to simulate dynamic biomass has a positive implication for the study of wetland plants responses to changes in environmental conditions the model formulations employed here should be transferable to other saltwater wetland systems with increasing or decreasing eav as a tool for predicting natural vegetation changes biomass management and ecological protection as these models continue to be applied to wetland systems the understanding of wetland dynamics in the context of hydrological and salinity changes will continue to deepen credit authorship contribution statement yang li methodology software

24700,emergent aquatic vegetation eav is an important part of wetland ecosystems that provide multiple ecological services however human activities and natural changes often influence wetland hydrological regimes such as water levels salinity and other factors which greatly influence the survival and growth of wetland plants based on field measurements and control experiments we developed an eav model to simulate biomass dynamics under changing conditions of water levels and salinity this model successfully reproduced the seasonal biomass variation of three typical emergent plants phragmites australis typha angustifolia and scirpus mariqueter and simulated the response of eva biomass under multiple scenarios of water levels and salinity in the chongming dongtan nature reserve cdnr shanghai china results suggest that there is a negative correlation between salinity and biomass an optimal range of water levels are suitable for eav and biomass will decrease when the water levels are below or above their optimal range applying this dynamic eav model is a cost effective approach to find a sustainable and nature based solution to managing and predicting wetland vegetation changes the model and approach used in this study may provide a sustainable and nature based solution for management and protection of wetland ecosystems and may be transferrable to other wetland systems as well keywords emergent aquatic vegetation vegetation biomass model wetland water level water salinity nature based solution 1 introduction as an important part of wetland ecosystems the community spatial pattern and productivity of emergent aquatic vegetation eav are the habitat quality indexes useful for evaluating wetland structure and function matthews 2015 taddeo and dronova 2018 the health of eav is influenced by various environmental factors such as light temperature nutrition water level and salinity smith and dukes 2013 zhang et al 2020 changes in hydrological regimes are considered to be the main factors controlling the distribution and succession of eav he et al 2017 grabas et al 2019 liu et al 2020 many studies have highlighted that changes in water depth and salinity concentration can influence photosynthetic and biomass accumulation in leaves by affecting leaf development stomata size photosynthetic enzymatic rate respiration rate and nutrient uptake causing ion toxicity chaves et al 2009 jacoby et al 2011 song et al 2020 and may be responsible for significant changes in the spatial pattern and biomass of wetland vegetation huckelbridge et al 2010 grabas et al 2019 the biomass of wetland vegetation reflecting the primary productivity of the wetland system is a key indicator of the health of the vegetation and sustainability of the ecosystem jones et al 2016 taddeo and dronova 2018 maintaining an appropriate amount of biomass is of great importance for achieving nature based wetland management staszak and armitage 2013 thorslund et al 2017 taddeo and dronova 2018 vegetation biomass or productivity measurements are usually obtained by using biological sampling the eddy flux method and the remote sensing process model which are time consuming and laborious or may insufficiently reflect the heterogeneity of ecological elements in high resolution and cannot predict future plant growth changes blatchford et al 2019 sun et al 2019 the dynamic vegetation model is governed by an underlying vegetation mechanism controlled by a variety of ecological processes which has remarkable predictive abilities and is suitable for coupling with the hydrological model to quantitatively forecast the potential for aquatic vegetation growth and reproduction in different nutrient water levels and salinity conditions kuroda et al 2020 therefore the dynamic vegetation models have been increasingly applied in wetland ecosystems to simulate the impacts of nutrient enrichment control and fluctuation of water depth or turbidity on aquatic plant growth špoljar et al 2017 lavaud et al 2020 and to guide wetland restoration in lakes shallow estuaries and reservoirs brush and nixon 2010 jin and ji 2013 špoljar et al 2017 existing dynamic vegetation models often lack quantification of the effects of environmental dynamics on eav growth developing a model including the quantification of water salt effects on eav biomass could predict wetland vegetation dynamics under future changes of hydrological regimes and salinity as well as providing nature based strategies for wetlands restoration and management to quantitatively simulate and predict the potential impacts of hydrological regimes and salinity dynamics on eav biomass we developed a dynamic eav model with the aim of providing a useful tool for the management of wetland vegetation and being applied to other wetland systems firstly we modeled the photosynthetic responses to temperature and light intensity for three typical emergent plants phragmites australis typha angustifolia and scirpus mariqueter in a restored wetland in the chongming dongtan national nature reserve cdnr shanghai china and plant biomass responses to the changes in salinity and water levels were measured by control experiments secondly based on the submerged aquatic vegetation model by cerco et al 2001 the equation of photosynthesis and respiration of eav was improved through field measurements the limit functions of water levels and salinity in control experiments were added so that our eav model could simulate biomass dynamics of eav under different water level and salinity conditions thirdly the model parameters were estimated reasonably well by field measurements control experiments and literature data and goodness of fit was assessed by comparing simulation results with field measured data finally seasonal biomass dynamics of the three species under different water level and salinity conditions in the restored chongming dongtan wetlands were successfully reproduced by this dynamic eav model the implications of the model results could improve our understanding of eav biomass dynamics and the likely role of eav in wetland ecosystems 2 study area and method 2 1 study area the cdnr 31 25 31 38 n 121 50 122 05 e located on the eastern fringe of chongming island at the mouth of the yangtze river china fig 1 a was designated as internationally important under the ramsar wetlands convention tian et al 2008 as an important station on the eastern migratory routes of the asian and pacific region 17 orders 50 families and 288 species of waterbirds have been recorded there ma et al 2009 in 1995 the exotic species s alterniflora smooth cordgrass was introduced to cdnr where it gradually replaced the native s mariqueter and p australis spread across more than 1 3 of the total saltmarsh wetlands and seriously degraded waterbird habitats yuan et al 2014 in order to control the invasive s alterniflora and recover waterbird habitats a large scale ecological engineering project for controlling s alternaflora and optimizing bird habitats 23 6 km2 was conducted in the cdnr from 2013 to 2016 fig 1b the ecological engineering area was enclosed by 27 km of dykes and s alternaflora was cleared thoroughly by cutting and then drowning in this embanked semi natural wetland region the reserved saltmarsh species are predominantly p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia the recovered wetlands inside the engineering region were divided into three parts and several separate sections for different bird habitats and the ecosystem based management of hydrology was carried out by controlling sluices and pumps to maintain the optimized habitats without natural tidal processes the water levels and salinity could keep relative stable in separate sections which provided ideal field sites to study dynamic vegetation responses under different water level and salinity conditions 2 2 field measurement the biomass of three dominant eav species p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia was measured at multiple sampling points fig 1c at each sampling point three 2 m 2 m quadrats were set and aboveground biomass of eav were harvested and measured from may to october 2019 these measured biomass data were used to validate the model in august 2019 leaf surface area was measured in the field and leaf dry weight dw was measured in the lab after drying the photosynthetic rates under a series of temperature and light intensity were measured in the field by using a portable steady state photosynthetic measurement system li 6400 xt li cor inc lincoln ne usa li et al 2018 the measured data of photosynthesis leaf surface area and dry weight were used to estimate the model parameters 2 3 control experiment of water levels and salinity to investigate the response of plant biomass to changes in water levels and salinity two factor water level and salinity interactive experiments were conducted during the growing season april october in 2019 at a greenhouse in cdnr healthy plants of p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia with consistent height were collected from the ecological engineering area in april then ten individuals of s mariqueter three individuals of p australis and three individuals of t angustifolia were transplanted with soil into experimental pots each diameter 20 cm height 50 cm all pots with transplanted plants were then placed into a series of tanks each length 60 cm width 40 cm height 80 cm for different treatments of water levels and salinity according to the different tolerance of these three species to flooding and salinity five static water levels were set at 0 5 10 15 and 20 cm for s mariqueter 0 10 20 30 and 50 cm for p australis and 0 15 30 45 and 60 cm for t angustifolia at the same time five salinity conditions were established at 0 5 10 15 and 20 for these three species thus there were totally 25 treatments and each treatment with 3 replicates the aboveground and underground parts of these experimental plants with different treatments were harvested in the end of experiments october and the dry weights dw were measured in the lab after drying 2 4 eav model the eav model is developed based on a sav model by cerco et al 2001 2002 with the aim to incorporate multiple stressors into simulating plant biomass dynamics under different water level and salinity conditions the model includes processes of primary production respiration ecological factor limitation and decay two model state variables of the eav model are dry weight biomass of aboveground leaves and stems along with underground roots which are applied for three major species of wetland plants and can be expressed as 1 d g r d t p l f 1 f a m f s f l f p g r b m g r g r d 2 d r t d t p l f 1 f a m f s f l f p r t b m r t r t where g r and r t are biomass of aboveground plants leaves and stems and roots g dw m 2 b m gr and b m rt are the respiration dry weight ratio of aboveground plants and roots day 1 p l f is the primary production of leaves g dw day 1 m 2 fam is the fraction of leaf production devoted to active metabolism thornley 1970 caleb et al 2016 the production of aboveground plants and roots is expressed as a fraction of leaf primary production where f p g r and f p r t are fractions of leaf production routed to aboveground and root biomass biomass allocation is determined by biomass ratio between aboveground and root biomass both f l and f s are dimensionless functions varying from 0 to 1 which are the stress functions due to the impact of water level and salinity on plant production we used a multiplicative approach to incorporate the stressors of water levels and salinity on primary production d is seasonal mortality adjustment parameter which is a ratio between biomass reduction due to decay and total biomass as the aboveground part of the eav will wither and decay in the end of growing season while the underground part still be alive so d only exists in eq 1 the formula of d is further explained in section 2 4 4 2 4 1 plant primary production the plant primary production rate is computed using photosynthesis with several limiting factors and converted to dry weight using a c dw ratio 3 p l f p i f n u a c d w where f n u is the limitation of nutrition resources on photosynthesis which is mainly the nutrient limitations of n and p and its formulas will be explained in the section 2 4 4 p i is photosynthesis production of per unit area g c m 2 day 1 and is converted to dry weight by a c d w a c d w is plant carbon content g c g 1 dw which represents the ratio of carbon to dry weight c dw a c d w ranges from 0 4 0 5 for crops and aquatic plants ma et al 2016 2018 photosynthesis production of leaves is the organic matter accumulated by leaf photosynthesis per unit time which is a function of leaf area 4 p i lai p m m c where lai is leaf area index m2 m 2 expressed as the projected area of leaves over a unit of land bréda 2008 which is proportional to the aboveground biomass kimball et al 2002 m c is the molar mass of carbon g c mol 1 the change in lai may be regulated by the phenological phase of the plant when the plant grows to a certain stage the leaf area will stop increasing kimball et al 2002 and therefore the lai is modified to 5 l a i min g r l a r l a i m a x l a i m a x occurs from july august for the eav in the yangtze estuary ge et al 2016 the lai of the plants in the study area is obtained by using the prospect radiative transmission model jacquemoud and baret 1990 verrelst et al 2012 based on remote sensing images of the sentinel 2 satellite then the l a i m a x for the three species is estimated though comparing the lai of each month l a r is leaf area ratio m2 g 1 which is the total leaf area divided the dry weight of the plant it is equal to the product of the leaf mass ratio lmr and the specific leaf area sla 6 l a r s l a l m r where s l a is specific leaf area m2 g 1 expressed as the ratio of leaf area leaf mass l m r is the leaf mass ratio g g 1 expressed as the ratio of leaf mass plant mass the l a r of p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia is obtained based on measurements during 2019 photosynthesis p m mol co2 m 2 day 1 is a process in which plants absorb co2 to produce c containing organics and release o2 when light is available which is measured by the o2 or co2 flux mol m 2 using a conversion factor m c g c mol 1 of 12 as 12 g mass of c is produced per mole of co2 as the plant growth is temperature dependent the temperature limit function uses a piecewise function to achieve a better fit to the photosynthetic data 7 p m c o n p m m a x e k t g 1 t t o p t t x t o p t 2 w h e n t t o p t 8 p m c o n p m m a x

thornley 1970 the model represents growth respiration f a m as a function of the primary production chiariello et al 1989 caleb et al 2016 which is proportional to the growth rate and its formulation is described in eqs 1 and 2 while maintenance respiration is proportional to biomass caleb et al 2016 which is affected by temperature 10 b m g r b m r g r g r q 10 10 1 t tr 11 b m r t b m r r t r t q 10 10 1 t tr where b m r is the respiration rate at temperature tr day 1 q 10 is the metabolic change rate per 10 c in temperature where g r q 10 and r t q 10 are above and under ground respectively with a value of approximately 2 0 atkin et al 2005 2 4 3 limitation function the growth of wetland plants is also controlled by water levels and salinity humphries et al 2011 sheng et al 2015 the water level and salinity stressors are included as growth limitation functions the limiting functions are developed based on the data obtained from the control experiments using empirical approach we found that gaussian functions work well for our experimental data to represent the nonlinear plant response this function has been often used to describe the ecological amplitudes of plant species yuan et al 2020a therefore the effects of water levels and salinity on eav growth are empirically described by gaussian models with different parameters for different species the empirical equations used for salinity and water lever are expressed as 12 f s e s a l t μ s 2 2 λ s 2 13 f l e l e v e l μ l 2 2 λ l 2 where l e v e l and s a l t are water level cm and salinity and their optimal values where biomass reached its maximum are expressed as μ s and μ l λ l and λ s are tolerance for water levels and salinity respectively which affects the adaptation interval of the plant the model parameters are determined based on the best fit of the experimental data the growth of plants is always limited by the availability of nutrients here a simple term cerco and moore 2001 is built into the model and expressed as 14 f n u m i n f n f p where f n and f p are limitations of n and p which are evaluated from a formula that combines individual monod like functions for roots and shoots madden and kemp 1996 the limiting functions for nitrogen and phosphorus are 15 f n n h 4 w n o 3 w khnw khns n h 4 s khnw nh 4 w n o 3 w khnw khns n h 4 s 16 f p p o 4 w khpw khps p o 4 s khpw p o 4 w khpw khps p o 4 s where n h 4 w n o 3 w p o 4 w n h 4 s p o 4 s are nutrient concentrations in the water column and sediments respectively g m 3 khnw khns khpw and khps are half saturation concentrations for nitrogen and phosphorus uptake from water column and sediments respectively g m 3 2 4 4 plant decay due to seasons in the wetlands natural decay of aboveground plants in the autumn is controlled by genes displaying a seasonal rhythm the aboveground biomass decay rate is forced as a function of temperature we use a stress terms to increase respiration of vegetation the sigmoid function often used to solve two class classification problems is used for the model here we add it to the respiration term to account for the decay occurring with temperature 17 d a 1 e b t c φ 1 the magnitude of the decay function is controlled by a and the temperature dependent decay is decided by a linear function determined by b c 1 c c and φ φ is the base rate of decay the parameters are obtained by fitting the plant biomass measurements in the study area in autumn the d term is 1 when the temperature does not reach the seasonal decay temperature and the d term rises rapidly until the biomass reaches to zero biomass when the temperature is below the decay temperature threshold 2 5 model calibration validation and sensitivity analysis 2 5 1 model parameter determination model parameters of local functions are manually calibrated by using datasets from control experiments field measurements and literature values all parameters are adjusted again within their known ranges until an acceptable visual fit is achieved between the simulated and observed biomass these observed biomasses have been measured at multiple sampling points fig 1c from may to october 2019 the spring measured biomass is used by the model as the initial condition in addition the initial biomass of each year can also be determined by the winter biomass of the previous year when the model is running continuously 2 5 2 model validation the model s goodness of fit is assessed using error statistics of mean absolute percent error mape mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse increases and decreases of the infinitival condition of plant biomass in favorable environmental conditions result in similar biomass trajectories with differences only in magnitude which would be reflected in peak biomass water levels and salinity values measured at the part of sampling points are input to the calibrated model to simulate the peak biomass the goodness of fit of measured and simulated peak biomass is assessed by analysis of mape mae and rmse 2 5 3 model sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the model to initial conditions and individual parameter estimates is tested by running the model and varying key parameter values by 1 2 and 2 times the initial values of state variables and with each parameter set at 20 of its value obtained from model calibration for parameters whose approximate ranges we know or which are accepted by other models with less uncertainty the values are used directly results of the sensitivity run are measured as the percent difference from the standard run 18 s b i o standard b i o s e n s i t i c i t y b i o standard 100 where b i o is the model prediction of a given variable on a given day b i o standard refers to the standard run and b i o s e n s i t i c i t y refers to the sensitivity runs the overall model sensitivity s to a given parameter is computed as the average of two sensitivity runs an increase or decrease of parameter values 2 6 model application seasonal biomass dynamics of three plants are simulated by the eav model to compare differences in vegetation growth under different water levels 0 5 10 15 20 cm and salinity conditions 0 5 10 15 20 3 result 3 1 parameter estimation par and temperature correction function fig 2 are calculated based on the fit of the photosynthesis mechanistic equation eq 9 and the piecewise equation eqs 7 and 8 to measured photosynthesis data for different plant species respectively the photosynthetic rate of the three plants increases with increasing light intensity it can be seen that p australis reaches saturation earlier than s mariqueter and t angustifolia fig 2a the rmse of par photosynthesis is 0 83 μmol m 2 s 1 which indicates that the light dependent photosynthesis function is suitable for simulating eav the photosynthetic rates of three species increase with an increase in temperature until it reaches to an optimum value and then a rapid decline occurs fig 2b the rmse of temperature photosynthesis is 2 35 μmol m 2 s 1 which suggests that the piecewise function works well for describing the relationship between temperature and photosynthesis and that it is suitable for simulating eav the control experiment results indicate that the adaptability to water levels and salinity of p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia is different and the relationships between normalized biomass and water level or salinity are in accordance with gaussian distribution fig 3 the parameters are estimated based on the best fit of the gaussian equation and experiment datasets eqs 12 and 13 the results fig 3 are satisfactory with rmse values of 0 13 and 0 14 for water levels and salinity respectively this shows that the biomass of eav depends heavily on both water levels and salinity and that the equations used fit our experimental data the salinity and water level limiting functions are determined based on control experiments the parameters used for determining light and temperature dependent functions are calibrated based on photosynthetic measurements the rmse is generally satisfactory for the datasets and the model functions can fit the data well other model parameters are obtained from model calibration of simulated plant biomass against observations and listed in table 1 the observation data and experimental data provide most of the parameters required by the model and thus only a small set of unknown model parameters need to calibrate 3 2 model validation the light and temperature dependent growth functions established based on observation data are directly used for the eav model the salinity and water level limiting functions based on control experiments are implemented in the model the aboveground biomass dynamics of p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia are simulated though a calibrated model based on measured temperature solar radiation water levels and salinity in 2019 since there are large variations in the measured biomass data the model calibration focuses on simulating the mean model results show that the simulated biomass of the three plants fell within the appropriate envelope of sampling biomass data from the field surveys fig 4 the statistics table 2 derived by comparing measured values and model predictions are within an acceptable range the mape of the model predictions of biomass are 56 80 34 06 and 37 98 for p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia respectively while mae and rms are 266 78 and 326 20 g dw m 2 for p australis 85 06 and 144 83 g dw m 2 for s mariqueter and 180 35 and 235 28 g dw m 2 for t angustifolia the model seems to perform better for s mariqueter and t angustifolia based on the statistics which may be caused by p australis adjusting its biomass to adapt to a wider range of environmental conditions increases and decreases in favorable environmental conditions result in similar biomass trajectories with the differences only in magnitude which can be reflected in peak biomass observed versus simulated data in august fig 5 indicate an overall good performance of the model prediction of peak biomass the error results table 2 indicate that the model has a good predictive skill for simulating seasonal variation of eav biomass under different water level and salinity conditions in addition samples in the vicinity of two sites are selected in the study area for comparison of measured biomass against the model simulation as verification without changing the calibrated model parameters overall s mariqueter and t angustifolia biomass are remarkably higher in the low salinity environments fig 6 b c as compared to the medium salinity fig 6e f while p australis biomass shows a similar pattern in the low and medium salinity environments fig 6a d as expected different initial condition of biomass water levels and salinity limit the growth of eav and result in a different biomass distribution 3 3 sensitivity analysis model sensitivity tests are performed for selected key model parameters and the most parameters vary by 5 to 20 the biomass predicted by the eav model is moderately sensitive to values of initial conditions and some key parameters table 3 as the biomass generally change less than 40 the biomass measured in spring is used by the model as the initial conditions increases and decreases in initial conditions result in similar biomass trajectories with the different magnitudes acdw is highly sensitive and its change can result in an increase or decrease in biomass however the acdw associated with each species is usually considered unchanged and its measurement errors exceed not more than 20 3 4 change in eav biomass under different water levels and salinity the model results suggest that high water levels and salinity will reduce eav growth fig 7 plant biomass will decrease as the water levels and salinity increase the impacts of different environmental variables on eav begin in june and show significant differences between august and september the model results with different salinity levels indicate that p australis can survive at 20 salinity and has the strongest salinity tolerance among the three species s mariqueter biomass decreases rapidly when salinity reaches higher than 15 and cannot survive when salinity reaches 20 t angustifolia has the weakest salinity tolerance when salinity reaches 10 growth of t angustifolia is significantly inhibited and cannot survive when salinity is higher than 15 the simulation results for changing water levels show that the shallow water levels between 5 and 10 cm can facilitate the growth of eav but water levels either higher than 10 cm or below 5 cm are not beneficial to the plants the biomass of s mariqueter will clearly decrease when the water level is higher than 15 cm and s mariqueter will die quickly under 20 cm water levels however 0 20 cm water levels will not significantly influence the biomass of p australis and t angustifolia fluctuations in water level and salinity will also affect plant biomass results indicate that biomass responses of s mariqueter to water level and salinity are completely different at different growth stages fig 8 accumulation of biomass is slower under the high water level 20 cm or salinity 20 in spring while increases rapidly when water level and salinity decrease in summer fig 8a and d in contrast accumulation of biomass increases quickly in spring and slows down when the water levels or salinity increases in summer fig 8b and e meanwhile the peak biomass in summer are lower than that in spring fig 8a 8b 8d and 8e in addition if the stress exceeds the tolerance range of s mariqueter the biomass cannot recover even if the stress disappears fig 8c and f 4 discussion 4 1 ecological mechanism of the model although the dynamic vegetation model is formated as plant unit biomass it is ideally suitable for scaling the role of vegetation to the system level as the underlying vegetation mechanisms are controlled by a variety of ecological processes ganju et al 2016 at the moment multiple species can be represented by our model with multiple parameter sets for different regions in the eav model the model can also be applied in a two dimensional grid setting and coupled with a hydrodynamic model however no more than one species can be assigned for each model cell as the competitions between plant species are not considered in the current model and the changes in plant biomass are only influenced by the light supply and temperature water levels and salinity adaptation light is no longer a strong limiting factor for eav in the process of photosynthesis if plant density is not very high the difference in light utilization will be reflected more by the difference in leaf area the parameter sla is important to the eva model because it determines that the capacity of new leaves produced for each unit of biomass and therefore determines the lai value fang and liang 2014 it should be noted that each plant has its own maximum lai which could be a plant survival strategy under environmental stress that makes population growth consistent with logistic growth function aside from light temperature is a primary factor affecting seasonal growth and photosynthesis nakayama et al 2020 the piecewise function works well for describing the relationship between temperature and photosynthesis as photosynthetic rates of plants usually increase with raising of temperature until they reach an optimum value and after that a rapid decline occurs smith and dukes 2013 plants use respiration to maintain survival provide the energy required for the daily maintenance of cells and provide substances and energy for biomass synthesis during their growth thornley 2011 the maintenance respiration of plants is basically stable regardless of growth rate can be calculated according to the proportion of dry weight and is affected by temperature chiariello et al 1989 caleb et al 2016 the growth respiration of plants is proportional to the growth rate and the respiration rate can reflect the intensity of the physiological activity of the tissue van iersel and seymour 2000 caleb et al 2016 plant respiration is very sensitive to temperature and the q10 exponential equation is widely used to describe the relationship between temperature and respiration atkin et al 2005 global q10 observations show that q10 has a certain degree of spatial heterogeneity li et al 2020 while it has been agreed that the q10 for the same plant species can be approximated as a fixed value in the small scale area atkin et al 2005 as long as the q10 value of a species and the respiration rate at a certain temperature are known one can infer its maintenance respiration rate at any temperature therefore the estimation of accurate q10 value and proportion of maintenance respiration has a significant effect on the model based on data collected from the soil nutrients are not limited in the chongming ecological restoration area and therefore nutritional limitations are negligible in this study water level and salinity limitations are strong limiting factor for eav and affect the process of photosynthesis and growth respiration jacoby et al 2011 song et al 2020 therefore the gaussian functions of water levels and salinity can describe the effects on the total primary productivity including the process of photosynthesis and respiration in this study we use a multiplicative approach to incorporate the stressors of water levels and salinity on primary production by multiplying functions of water levels and salinity each range from 0 to 1 the interactions between them can be well expressed the growth of eav is controlled by various meteorological events including sudden changes in light temperature rainfall and flood smith and dukes 2013 nakayama et al 2020 light and temperature have been considered as the primary factors controlling seasonal growth of eav nakayama et al 2020 meanwhile the vegetation hydrology feedbacks are of crucial importance as every stage of plant life depends on water availability nakayama et al 2020 rainfall and flood can induce severe fluctuations in the water levels which may affect the attenuation of biomass grabas et al 2019 liu et al 2020 therefore the eav biomass responses to the changes in water levels has been paid special attention in our eav model besides intense floods can even cause scour vegetation uprooting and mechanical damage in wetlands of riparian area latella et al 2020 currently various models incorporated the interactions of vegetation with floods have been developed to evaluate the colonization and succession of riparian vegetation kuroda et al 2020 in our study the mechanical damage of flood has not included in the eav model because the results from our control experiments suggest that it is not suitable to simulate the effects of the short term flood event on eav biomass dynamic moreover climate change will also alter flooding timing and magnitude creating inundation and salinity conditions different from the current conditions for vegetation kuroda et al 2020 nakayama et al 2020 elevated salinity intrusion great flood or drought would limit productivity and carbon storage nakayama et al 2020 the effects of interaction among sea level rise hydrology and water hydrodynamics on flooding and salinity should be further investigated to understand their influence on future vegetation 4 2 role of water levels and salinity for emerged plant development studies show that water levels and salinity play a vital role in controlling aquatic vegetation height biomass production vegetation cover species richness and reproduction brock et al 2005 he et al 2017 grabas et al 2019 liu et al 2020 changes in eav vegetation patterns and characteristics are sensitive to the water level fluctuations a stable moderate water level is conducive to the maintenance of eav vegetation health cover survivorship and reproduction humphries et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 grabas et al 2019 liu et al 2020 low salinity is beneficial to increasing vegetation biomass species richness and seedling numbers strehlow et al 2005 huckelbridge et al 2010 sheng et al 2015 he et al 2017 the ecological restoration area inside cdnr differs from natural coastal wetlands because the tidal effect is completely removed however the restoration area in cdnr offers a unique method of managing wetland vegetation by artificially controlling the hydrological regimes and salinity a negative correlation has been found between the maximum biomass and water level and salinity in five common water level and salinity scenarios in the study area based on the results of control experiments and model sensitivity runs for 5 water level scenarios shallow water of 5 10 cm is conducive to the biomass accumulation of eav while too high or low water levels are not conducive to biomass accumulation increasing the water levels will reduce the biomass of eav the possible reason is that increased water level can cause an insufficient oxygen supply to the eav s roots zhou et al 2020 many studies have reported that the biomass of eav is sensitive of water levels which may vary from species to species buffington et al 2020 janousek and mayo 2013 the results from our study indicate that s mariqueter is sensitive to water levels and prefers to grow at a water level of 0 15 cm in the wetlands while p australis and t angustifolia are more tolerant to flooding and their biomass does not shown significant reduction even at water level of 20 cm the reason may be that increased water levels reduce the oxygen supply to the roots of eav and the plant underground portion of s mariqueter is significantly lower than that of p australis and t angustifolia so they are more likely to die of hypoxia it has been reported that s mariqueter is a flood tolerant species water level over 1 m in the tidal environment yuan et al 2020b however our study shows that s mariqueter could not resist to continuous flooding under stable water level even at the water levels less than 25 cm as continuous flooding increases root flooding time hypoxia stress and plant mortality compared with other study p australis and t angustifolia in our study show a similar flood tolerance li et al 2018 the increased salinity usually has a negative impact on saltmarsh plants under a fluctuating tide regime buffington et al 2020 the difference in salinity tolerance of eav plants is determined by their individual characteristics in our study aboveground biomass of t angustifolia and s mariqueter decrease significantly with the raising salinity under stable water levels and the salinity tolerance of s mariqueter p australis and t angustifolia is significantly different the result of our study is consistent with other study that the discrepancy of p australis growth and photosynthetic activity under 15 is not significantly different and p australis and s alterniflora exhibit a high salt tolerance li et al 2018 the combined effects of flooding and salinity can be greater than the effects of each stressor alone buffington et al 2020 species with low salinity tolerance may be more susceptible to interactive effects as the extended flooding exposes the plants to prolonged osmotic imbalance and salt accumulation in the soil janousek and mayo 2013 and to reduce the threshold of salinity tolerance he et al 2017 a variety of saltmarsh plants including s alterniflora p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia have been verified to have combined effects of flooding and salinity chen et al 2013 wen et al 2017 li et al 2018 buffington et al 2020 our eav model has developed a multiplicative approach to incorporate the stressors of water levels salinity and their combined effects on primary production which can improve our understanding of how these interactions affect the eav vegetation dynamics and persistence 4 3 sensitivity of model the sensitivity to various parameter values show the importance and accuracy of the model parameters and formula in this study the photosynthesis process of three species of eav is measured and modeled and sensitivity to various model parameter values is analyzed the sensitivity runs show that biomass changes are generally less than 40 relative to the standard run and these changes are within the same range as the estimated model error however we do not fully understand the response of key processes respiration budding and decay to the environment variables which highlights the need for community survey data to optimize various parameters the relational expressions such as between photosynthesis and respiration or water levels and salinity may be site specific and species specific and rely on the data from a given study area to support model development in addition eav has different phenophase stages such as germination leaf exhibition growth and panicle accumulated temperature may be a way to identify the phenophase as these stages have differences in responses to environmental and physiological parameters however due to the lack of data it is difficult to calibrate the parameters and verify the sensitivity of the parameters in each phenophase stage in addition to the sensitivity of parameters the sensitivity of main environmental factors has been also tested in this study temperature has the higher sensitivity and is an important factor determining the biomass accumulation since temperature can affect the daily photosynthesis and respiration and growth period of plants temperature may also be important when the model is applied to other areas in this study the sensitivity of water levels and salinity is low which means that small scale water level and salinity fluctuations will not cause the model to go out of control this indicates that model results are credible even if it is difficult to accurately predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of water levels and salinity because of the complexity of the wetland terrain and the difficulties of accurate surface elevation measurement 4 4 implications for eva management water level and salinity are important factors that limit plant growth in saltwater wetlands they affect many physiological processes while the majority of mechanisms are poorly understood particularly at the biochemical level munns and tester 2008 flowers et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 in this study the experimental results of the response of three species to water levels and salinity are quantified in the model our model sensitivity runs for 5 water levels and salinity scenarios provide useful information on the response of eav to changes in water level and salinity the results suggest that this model can promote studies on the interactive effects of hydrology regimes and salinity on physiological ecology diversity of species and vegetation dynamics of wetland plants the eav model successfully reproduces the biomass dynamics of three plant species in changing water salinity conditions vegetation is an important component of the wetland ecosystem changes in hydrological regimes and salinity due to climate change and human activities can directly affect the distribution and succession of wetland vegetation which has caused general degradation and salinization of natural wetlands resulting in a serious threat to the ecological health of these ecosystems huckelbridge et al 2010 hu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 to solve these problems the eav model can be coupled with hydrology and climate models to predict the evolution or succession of wetlands in future hydrological and salinity scenarios as well as to provide scientifically based decision support for wetland protection and management our results indicate that the eav model could simulate eav biomass dynamic under stable water level environment although the real hydrologic dynamics in field are more complex the constantly changing water levels and salinity can be input into the model to help us predict the growth of plants the results suggest that biomass responses of s mariqueter to water levels and salinity are completely different at different growth stages the results highlight that maintaining the optimal water levels in summer is most conducive to the accumulation of eav biomass and eav can grow quickly in summer even if their growth is strongly inhibited in spring however the stress cannot exceed the tolerance of the plant in spring otherwise plant cannot survive and recovery the eav model offers a useful tool to easily quantify the wetland eav biomass dynamic under different hydrology through model parameters corresponding to the water levels and salinity based on the predicted results of the model the manager could control biomass and protect or control certain species by managing hydrological condition in certain season the results of our simulations suggest that water level and salinity regulation could be used as a method of managing wetland vegetation water level regulation has an impact on biomass accumulation for p australis s mariqueter and t angustifolia which can be used a tool for managing excessive biomass in wetlands salinity regulation can inhibit the growth of p australis and significantly control the survival of s mariqueter and t angustifolia which can be an effective tool for managing species diversity the plant community may succeed in a p australis t angustifolia community at low salinity p australis s mariqueter community at medium salinity and p australis community at high salinity we prefer to find suitable water levels and salinity through models to regulate plant growth rather than controlling vegetation types through artificial harvesting or planting therefore modeling is more suitable for the context of natural and sustainable development which highlights that adaptability of plants under different water levels and salinity concentrations that play an important role in future research 5 conclusion we have developed a dynamic eva model and applied it to the cdnr shanghai china our eva model successfully simulates the biomass dynamics of three typical emergent plants under different water levels and salinities in a non tidal environment results suggest that there is a negative correlation between salinity and biomass as salinity increases the biomass of these three plants will continue to decrease there will be optimal ranges of water levels suitable for plant biomass accumulation for different species the biomass will decrease when below or above the optimal water levels the modeling approach to simulate dynamic biomass has a positive implication for the study of wetland plants responses to changes in environmental conditions the model formulations employed here should be transferable to other saltwater wetland systems with increasing or decreasing eav as a tool for predicting natural vegetation changes biomass management and ecological protection as these models continue to be applied to wetland systems the understanding of wetland dynamics in the context of hydrological and salinity changes will continue to deepen credit authorship contribution statement yang li methodology software

24701,insect physiology is highly dependent on the environmental temperature and the relationship can be mathematically defined thus many models that aim to predict insect pest population dynamics use meteorological data as input to descriptive functions that predict the development rate survival and reproduction of pest populations in most cases however these functions models are laboratory driven and are based on data from constant temperature experiments therefore they lack an important optimization and validation steps that test their accuracy under field conditions here we developed a realistic and robust regional framework for modeling the field population dynamics of the global insect pest bemisia tabaci first two non linear functions development rate dr and female reproduction en were fitted to data collected in constant temperature experiments next nine one generation field experiments were conducted in order to establish a field derived database of insect performance representing a variety of growing conditions different seasons regions and host plants then sensitivity analyses were performed for identifying the optimal time scale for which the running averaged temperatures should be fed to the model setting the time to 6 h i e each of the 24 time steps per day represents the last 6 h average produced the best fit rmsd score of 1 59 days 5 7 of the mean between the field observations and the model simulations we hypothesize that the 6 h relevant biological time scale captures the insect s physiological memory of daily cycling temperature events lastly we evaluated the potential of the developed modeling framework to serve as a decision support tool in pest management programs by correlating the model predictions with field observations of three pest control inspectors during 2019 the model successfully predicted the first notable appearance of the insect in the field completion of the third generation in may also the model correctly identified the sharp rise in abundance outbreak point in mid july completion of the fifth generation and the persistent rise in abundance through august and september comparing the simulations of the 2018 and 2019 seasons indicated that the model can also serve as a tool for retrospective systematic assessment of major decisions taken together these data demonstrate the model robustness and its potential to provide an excellent decision making support platform in regional control of pest species keywords population dynamics models field conditions invasive species intra annual temperature variability reproductive performance decision making support tool bemisia tabaci 1 introduction among environmental factors temperature has the most profound effect on the biology and life history of poikilothermic animals such as insects messenger 1959 it affects development time survivorship fecundity demographic parameters and foraging behavior davidson 1944 janisch 1932 sandehson 1910 each insect population has an optimum temperature at which it will develop at its fastest rate and lower and upper threshold temperatures beyond which it cannot develop messenger 1959 using the optimum temperature concept life table data of species can be obtained at different controlled and constant temperatures in the laboratory then mathematical non linear functions for development rate survival and reproduction can be established and combined to present the physiologically based demographic models of a given species tonnang et al 2017 these models not only allow estimating the lower and upper temperature thresholds for survival of the species but can also serve as important components in the development of pest management tools this is because they have the potential to realistically describe the spatio temporal dynamics of the population build up generation time and density as a function of the environmental forcing variables mainly temperature and host plants gilioli et al 2016 here we developed a modeling framework to simulate the population dynamics of the whitefly bemisia tabaci hemiptera aleyrodidae under field conditions aiming for its implementation in integrated pest management ipm practices as a decision support tool b tabaci is recognized to be one of the worst all time global pests de barro et al 2011 threatening food security in the developing world including africa the asian pacific and south america it causes severe damage to dozens of economically important plant species cabi 2020 directly by feeding and excreting honeydew and indirectly by transmitting more than 200 plant viruses brown et al 1995 navas castillo et al 2011 this damage is evaluated in millions of dollars in crop losses worldwide cuthbertson et al 2011 legg et al 2014 wan and yang 2016 moreover since the 1990s different species of b tabaci across the globe were reported to develop significant resistance against nearly all chemical compounds used to control phloem feeders leaving the chemical toolbox against this species extremely limited basit 2019 horowitz et al 2007 in addition like other phloem feeding insects b tabaci is predicted to strongly respond to global warming previously we have shown that an increase in the mean temperature of 2 c in the eastern mediterranean will allow the number of generations produced per year by b tabaci to increase from 9 to 12 zidon et al 2016 with a potentially huge increase in population size 10 fold increase it is therefore clear that the development of an ability to accurately predict the abundance of pests like b tabaci in multiple cropping systems could have many advantages first it could assist decision makers when they are faced with different types of uncertainties about biological and environmental processes and observational uncertainty gilioli et al 2013 second it could serve to identify the optimal time of sampling and to reduce unnecessary routine applications of insecticides given in many cases with no real knowledge on the level of risk by providing information on the necessity timing of the treatments throughout the season duffy et al 2017 this can reduce both the growing costs and the risk of local selection for insecticide resistance horowitz et al 2007 moreover modeling based pest management is expected to minimize two environmental risks of insecticides the negative human health outcomes and the unavoidable harm to non targets including beneficial organisms such as natural enemies and pollinators ellsworth and martinez carrillo 2001 third feeding the models with temperature data from medium range i e few days seasonal or climatic forecast models can allow taking adaption actions ahead of time reducing their predicted damages the model presented here is not the first one proposed to describe the population dynamics of b tabaci in the last 40 years multiple laboratory studies were conducted at constant temperatures in order to estimate the effect of temperature on the developmental rate survival and fecundity of the species bosco and caciagli 1998 butler et al 1983 powell and bellows 1992 wagner 1995 wang and tsai 1996 nava camberos et al 2001 muñiz and nombela 2001 yang and chi 2006 bonato et al 2007 tsueda and tsuchida 2011 some of these studies and also others developed mathematical non linear functions for describing the effect of temperature on the life history traits of the species arx et al 2009 bonato et al 2007 muñiz and nombela 2001 wagner 1995 wang and tsai 1996 yang and chi 2006 in addition two studies estimated the degree days dd required for the completing of a generation in b tabaci bosco and caciagli 1998 nava camberos et al 2001 although these laboratory driven functions models can be used to predict the time of first appearance of various developmental stages and facilitate the timing of early season sampling they were not optimized to work under field conditions and are predicted to fail in producing realistic estimates of population build up required for threshold based decision making of pest control gilioli et al 2016 in contrast a field relevant recent study by naranjo 2018 used a combination of field derived life tables temperature dependent matrix models and life table response experiments to estimate the effect of establishment of two exotic parasitoid species on b tabaci population dynamics in cotton fields from the other end and at a larger scale bioclimatic models such as climex ramos et al 2019 and maxent ramos et al 2018 have been recently used in order to predict the distribution and to a lesser extent the abundance of b tabaci at the continental and global levels respectively in addition gilioli et al 2014 developed a temperature dependent physiologically based demographic model pbdm in order to predict the potential distribution of b tabaci in europe under global climatic changes these models used a combination of inductive i e the presence of a species in a location is combined with digital layers of bio climatic variables and used to predict the likelihood of the species presence in other locations and deductive i e direct measurements of the relationships between life history traits and environmental variables are used to identify the likelihood for a location to be suitable for the occurrence of a species approaches tonnang et al 2017 and seem to be capable of predicting the potential distribution of b tabaci over a large geographic area for example global or continental scales therefore their use is more suitable for making risk assessments of the species invasive movement into new regions and for continental regional strategic decisions on the enforcement of quarantine measures or putting restrictions on the importation growing of certain crops in international trade sporleder et al 2013 than for predicting pest distribution abundance and critical thresholds over a small geographic scale in contrast to all previous studies our goal was to develop a population dynamics model for b tabaci that can be used in the field during the growing season to support ipm decision making at a local scale we started with the development of a non linear function that describes the developmental rate of b tabaci under constant temperatures at the next stage a nonlinear function that estimates the temperature effects on fecundity and survival was developed using literature data from multiple papers powell and bellows 1992 wang and tsai 1996 nava camberos et al 2001 yang and chi 2006 tsueda and tsuchida 2011 model predictions of development rate were tested against results from real field experiments in a range of conditions we also introduced a time scale parameter to better integrate the time varying observed temperature data into the model at the final stage critical decision points of field monitoring based pest management were mapped on the model output the ability of the optimized and validated model to support tactical field based decision making in b tabaci management is discussed 2 methods 2 1 population dynamics model as previously described in zidon et al 2016 the population dynamics model incorporates two temperature based functions 1 a performance function that simulates the developmental rate from egg to adult and determines the generation lengths females lay eggs within hours after emergence so the length of the adult to egg phase is neglected and 2 a productivity function describing the number of adults that each female produces 1 dr c 1 exp k 1 t t 1 1 e x p k 2 t t 2 where dr is the developmental rate 1 day t c is the temperature c is a multiplicative coefficient k1 is an increase rate coefficient 1 c t1 c is a lower developmental temperature threshold coefficient k2 is a decrease rate coefficient 1 c and t2 c is an upper developmental temperature threshold coefficient shi et al 2011 zidon et al 2016 the dr function coefficients were identified using data from controlled temperature experiments see next section applying a non linear fit and an optimization function matlab nlinfit and fminsearch respectively 2 en p 1 t p 2 exp p 3 t where en is the total number of adults produced per female i e number of eggs egg to adult survival t c is the temperature and p1 p2 and p3 are function coefficients bonato et al 2007 zidon et al 2016 we applied the same function coefficients that we identified previously in zidon et al 2016 using data from controlled environment experiments tsueda and tsuchida 2011 h tsueda unpublished data at a given generation we calculated the number of adults that emerge when the generation is completed by multiplying the en value by the number of surviving adult females in the previous generation the number of adults that emerged in the previous generation field egg to adult survival rate percentage of females in the population similar to zidon et al 2016 we used literature based fixed values for the two latter parameters the field estimated mean egg to adult survival rate 0 083 from naranjo and ellsworth 2005 was rounded to the first decimal point 0 1 and the percentage of females in the population was assumed to be 50 the temperature t used to compute en was defined as the average temperature during the last five days of the generation as reproductive physiology was presumed to be affected by temperature throughout this period as described in fig 1 model input was a temperature time series at the beginning of each generation the development state starts as zero and then increases at dr for each time step according to the temperature data until it reaches 1 indicating the end of the current generation and the beginning of the next one the population size starts with a pre defined number of surviving females generation 1 at the beginning of the season arbitrarily set here to 100 model output is the time and duration of each generation the population size i e number of surviving adults and the number of completed generations in one year january to december invariable developmental and reproductive rates and distinct generations through the year were assumed 2 2 estimating the development rate at constant temperatures experiments for estimating the development time of one generation of b tabaci days from egg laying to adult emergence under constant temperature regimes were conducted using the meam1 species of b tabaci and the host plant solanum nigrum solanaceae this host plant was selected as it is a worldwide distributed weed defelice 2003 and a preferred highly suitable alternative weed host to the crop plants of b tabaci meam1 in many agricultural systems calvitti and remotti 1998 muñiz 2000 guz et al 2016 moreover s nigrum is usually not treated by herbicides or insecticides and therefore allows the insect to establish multiple generations throughout the season the temperatures tested were 14 c 16 c 17 8 c 20 4 c 22 5 c 23 2 c 28 7 c 33 4 c 34 2 c and 35 0 c prior to running each experiment the population was synchronized so that all adults collected were 0 48 h old ten newly emerged female and male adults were collected into a clip cage and placed on the abaxial side of a leaf of a s nigrum plant with 4 5 true leaves temperature was recorded hourly using a hobo data logger onset computer corporation bourne ma usa starting immediately after the clip cages with the adults were placed on the leaves plant pots and hobos were transferred to a growth chamber programed to maintain a constant temperature regime rh 60 12l 12d adults were allowed an egg laying period of 24 48 h nymph development was monitored weekly until four stage nymphs red eyed appeared at this stage leaves were inspected every day in order to count newly emerged adults and remove their empty exuvia until no more adults emerged averaged development at a constant temperature was calculated as the weighted mean of the days to development the weights being the number of emerging adults collected each day 2 3 estimating the development time under field conditions nine field experiments were conducted in order to estimate the generation length of b tabaci under field conditions the field experiments took place at three locations in israel 1 kibbutz nachshon in the ayalon valley 31 83 n 34 96e during the spring and autumn of 2013 2014 2 kibbutz bar am in the galilee heights 33 05 n 35 43e during the spring and autumn of 2014 3 the hulla valley experiment station 33 15 n 35 62e during the summer and autumn of 2019 and the spring of 2020 in the kibbutz nachshon and kibbutz bar am sites the infested experimental plants were completely exposed in the hulla valley site large populations of other insect pest species were present therefore the experiments were conducted in a 50 mesh screen house all three sites are under mediterranean climate regime characterized by cold and wet winters 450 700 mm annually in the study sites and hot and dry summers the ayalon valley is located in central israel at the foothills of the judean mountains the site s land cover contains mediterranean low density forests a combination of shrub and trees growing on rendzina soil israel

upper galilee israel a high mountainous region compared to the other two sites it presented the coolest weather year round goldreich 2003 the natural land cover includes high density marquis shrub and trees along with augmented forests naveh and whittaker 1980 plantations mainly include apple orchards with some regions of open field crops israel ministry of agriculture and rural development website the hulla valley is located in northern israel the enclosure of the valley from west and east by the high ridges of the galil and golan heights respectively results in summer temperatures that are higher than those in coastal areas agriculture is abundant in the hulla valley and includes a combination of open field staple crops and various tree plantations various b tabaci host plants s nigrum ipomoea batatas convolvulaceae citrullus lanatus cucurbitaceae phaseolus vulgaris fabaceae and brassica oleracea var gemmifera brassicaceae were grown in pots 12 cm diameter for 3 5 weeks 2 3 leaves of each plant were inoculated with 10 20 adult pairs of b tabaci using a clip cage for an initial mating and oviposition period of 24 48 h after which the clipped cages were removed the adults were collected from a population reared on the same host plant for at least 2 3 generations temperature was recorded hourly by a hobo data logger from the time the clip cages were mounted on the plants in the kibbutz nachshon and kibbutz bar am sites data from one hobo was collected for each experiment in the hulla valley site several sensors collected the temperature data adult emergence was recorded daily by counting and removing exuviae see more details above the weighted mean emergence day was calculated for each plant the weights being the number of emerging adults each day this was followed by calculation of a weighted mean for the whole experiment 2 4 model fit in field conditions sensitivity analysis and the relevant biological time scale parameter data obtained from the field experiments were used to test the generation length computation as determined by the dr function the root mean square difference rmsd and the bias i e the difference of the means metrics were used to quantify the fit of the computed and observed generation length as indicated above temperature data from all field experiments were available at an hourly resolution and the dr function was applied initially at this time scale sensitivity to the time scale was further examined by comparing the hourly to the daily resolutions we further explored the time scale effect by testing a new model parameter the relevant biological time scale which represents the physiological memory of the insect the duration of the effect of temperature on physiological processes this parameter represents the number of hours averaged from a specific time point and backwards which creates a running average value for each time point thus while the hourly resolution is preserved the model inputs are backwards running averages we identified this parameter by averaging the hourly temperature data at different time scales and finding the scale with the optimal fit i e minimal rmsd leave one out cross validation was chosen for reinforcement due to the limited number of independent field experiments 2 5 integrating model predictions into ipm activities as we plan in the future to integrate the developed modeling tool into ipm decision making processes we established contacts with three local pest inspectors in the hulla valley this allowed us to compare between our modeled predictions of b tabaci population dynamics and observational data at a regional scale for producing seasonal predictions of population dynamics we chose three meteorological stations throughout the hulla valley from which we extracted hourly temperature data the meteorological stations belong to the department of agriculture northern research and development organization kabul 33 11 n 35 61e gadot 33 03 n 35 62e and havat gadash 33 18 n 35 58e temperature data for 2019 were acquired from the organization s website data were quality controlled and missing data were filled in a two step procedure first the neighboring station showing the highest correlation of temperature data was identified then a simple linear regression model describing the relationship between the temperature measures of the two stations was used to calculate the expected values of the missing data the model was provided with time series of temperature data starting from january 1 2019 and returned estimations of generation time and length population size and the number of generations completed along the year observational data were collected weekly from march 2019 to november 2019 each pest inspector monitored at least four fields in the vicinity 3 km radius of the meteorological stations see above we found that the inspectors tend to rely on general observations made every few days and on intimate familiarity with each field and that the reported data is more qualitative descriptive than quantitative therefore we limited our comparisons to four time points the generation in which the first detection of adult activity was observed in the field the generation in which the decision on the first spraying was made the generation in which a repeatable high infestation was followed by a multiple spraying effort and the extend development period at the end of the season comparisons were made over the entire 2019 growing season 3 results 3 1 constant temperature experiments and the fitting of a development rate dr function development time was estimated under eight constant temperature regimes appendix table a we could not estimate the development time at the fixed temperature regimes of 14 and 35 c as no survivors were obtained the fastest development time was 12 6 days at constant experimental temperature of 33 4 c suggesting it to be close to the optimum temperature of development an asymmetric response was found around the optimum a significant slower development time was observed at 34 5 c 18 9 days followed by no survival at 35 c in contrast low temperatures allowed some survival but severely prolonged the development time up to 56 2 days at 16 c a dr function describing the development rate as a function of temperature was fitted based on the results obtained in the controlled temperature experiments fig 2 a the threshold temperatures for development calculated by the fitting process i e t1 and t2 were 10 4 c and 35 1 c optimal development rate was calculated at 33 c as described in zidon et al 2016 a non linear function fitting was used to create the en function describing the number of adults produced by a single female i e number of eggs x egg to adult survival as a function of temperature the resulting function has an optimal rate at 26 c symmetrical responses were calculated at both sides of the optimum point sensitivity tests of the dr and en functions fit score to parameters values indicated that except of k2 sensitivity is very high implying well optimized functions and low uncertainty in the optimized parameters the least certain parameter k2 was further tested for its effect on the model outputs specifically the number of generations and the mean generation length and their sensitivity was found to be very low our conclusion from these analyses was that the optimized dr and en functions are trustable and can be used for population dynamics modeling 3 2 estimating the development time under field conditions and testing the dr function fit in total nine experiments were conducted in order to estimate the weighted mean of days for development from egg to adult under field conditions table 1 the estimated development periods varied between 21 days at mid summer in the hulla valley july to 39 days at autumn in kibbutz bar am october november these experiments also presented the high and low extremities of the average temperatures the effect of temperature on development time was mostly apparent at late autumn table 1 experiments 1 3 5 8 while the hulla valley and kibbutz nachshon sites displayed similar average temperatures and development time the cooler climate at kibbutz bar am led to an extended development period of 15 days a seasonal effect was also observed experiments 2 4 and 9 were performed at late spring early summer and had similar development periods 28 32 days which were 4 8 days longer than the development periods observed in experiments 1 3 and 8 that were conducted at autumn although the average temperatures were similar in all experiments this difference might relate to the higher variance and larger interquartile temperature ranges observed in the late spring early summer experiments especially during march april 2014 at the kibbutz nachshon site and the early summer of 2020 at the hulla valley site table 1 for correlating between the field estimates and the developed dr function estimates the measured hourly temperature data from the experiments was used as a model input to compute the generation length fig 3 presents the observed and modeled generation length for the different experiments the rmsd was 2 18 days and the bias 1 18 days 7 8 and 4 2 of the mean observed generation length respectively in eight out of nine experiments the differences between the computed and observed generation length were in the range of 0 4 2 3 days only in one case the sweet potato experiment in the hulla valley site a large generation length overestimation of 5 4 days was obtained fig 3 considering the number of experiments conducted the range of experimental conditions plant hosts seasons and locations and the independence of the data set we find the relatively good fit obtained between observed and computed generation length highly encouraging and believe that the developed dr function is both accurate and robust 3 3 the relevant biological time scale the controlled temperature experiments from which the dr function was developed were conducted under fix temperature conditions for many hours 12 60 days and therefore the function does not have an inherent time scale still when the dr function is applied as part of our model in field conditions fig 3 a choice of the time period duration for which the average temperature is calculated can be made as a starting default we have used 1 hour data as this was the time frame for which the raw temperature data were available however a question was raised for the appropriate or optimal time scale to be applied to the model this time scale which we termed as the relevant biological time scale should represents the insect s physiological memory one simple possibility for example was to follow the insect s circadian clock rhythm and to apply daily time steps however the model in this case presented a rmsd value of 3 6 days which was larger than that obtained for the hourly scale 2 18 days we tested the model s performance sensitivity to the relevant biological time scale by applying a running average function to the hourly temperature data before it serves as input to the model fig 4 a reveals a great sensitivity to this parameter with the minimal rmsd score of 1 59 days 5 7 of the mean observed generation length for the values of 6 h the bias at this time scale is 0 09 days 0 3 of the mean we utilized a leave one out cross validation framework to examine the model estimation errors for an out of sample data the mean absolute difference between the observed and computed data for the experiment that was left out from calibration in each iteration was 1 6 days and the distribution of the optimal parameter value for each of the nine iterations is shown in fig 4b in six out of the nine cases the optimal value was at the 6 hour range which reinforced the accuracy of the calculation of the optimal value based on the entire set of experiments the reanalysis of the fit with observed data using the 6 hour relevant biological time scale is shown in fig 4c due to the improved fit we used the model containing this parameter in all further simulations 3 4 integrating model predictions into ipm activities for preliminary evaluation of our model as a decision support tool temperature data from three meteorological stations in the hulla valley were used as input to the model for simulating b tabaci population dynamics duration of each generation number of generations population size along the year of 2019 fig 5 regional observational data on b tabaci abundance and spread were collected weekly by three pest inspectors in the hulla valley throughout the 2019 growing season march november the information gathered by the inspectors was condensed to identify only major events throughout the month of may and early june first detection of adults activity took place in various fields this time period correlated with the completion of generation 3 in the model fig 5a point i a subtle rise in population size towards the end of june resulted in high abundancy in mid july when the first insecticide treatments were applied in tomato and watermelon fields this time period correlated with the completion of generation 5 in the model and a 19 fold increase in population size between generations 3 and 5 fig 5a point ii by august generation 7 according to the model fig 5a point iii all three inspectors reported large infestations in all crops followed by repeated chemical treatments at least 2 3 applications per field only in october control on infestation levels was achieved at this time the mean daily temperature dropped by 4 c and most crops were already harvested in the model generation 10 fig 5a point iv this time period was characterized by slower developmental rate 20 25 days only bean fields were still infested with high levels of persistent populations that were only slightly affected by the application of insecticides at the end of the season the inspectors were asked to provide a general assessment of the growing season in comparison to their previous experience two out of three inspectors indicated a notable delay in the first detection of significant number of adults in the fields during the end of spring of 2019 when compared to the similar period in 2018 this observation perfectly correlated with our modeling results which predicted the insects to complete generation 4 at early june in 2019 but 20 days earlier in 2018 fig 5b in addition all three inspectors were in consensus that the growing season of 2019 was characterized by extremely heavy populations that were capable of surviving the chemical treatments this general assessment was also supported by comparing the modeling results of 2018 and 2019 fig 5a and b although the model predicted for 2018 the completion of 13 generations in many fields one generation more than in 2019 the population size estimates for 2019 were 2 3 fold higher than in 2018 at the end of the season november 4 discussion tools for modeling population dynamics of insect pests that endanger public health and food security in the eastern mediterranean region are currently lacking moreover previously developed laboratory driven functions models for describing the effect of temperature on b tabaci population dynamics were not optimized for inter and intra daily fluctuating temperatures and have not been tested for accuracy under field conditions see the list of cited literature in the introduction here we developed and tested a realistic and robust regional modeling framework for b tabaci population dynamics under both laboratory and field conditions we utilized data from constant temperature experiments to set model parameters which is the common practice in similar modeling efforts e g arx von et al 1983 muñiz nombela 2001 bonato et al 2007 zidon et al 2016 the model simulations of generation lengths under field conditions were found to fit very well with the observations rmsd of 1 59 days 5 7 of the mean with relevant biological time scale of 6 h it should be emphasized that the good fit obtained was for independent data sets that also represent a variety of conditions i e seasons sites and host plants table 1 this demonstrates the model robustness which is an important modeling characteristic especially if it is planned to be used in practice and out of sample data are expected depending on data availability there is often a tradeoff between model accuracy and robustness e g su et al 2018 the former can be improved for example by increasing model complexity or by further optimization in the risk of having relatively large errors when conditions are somewhat changed a situation often referred as overfitting hawkins 2004 in our case after testing the model in nine field experiments we decided not to apply fine tuning to the model parameters as we plan to integrate it into ipm practices and prefer to keep its robustness moving from constant temperature experiments to field experiments one important decision to make is how to represent temperature data in the model our initial results were obtained with the data at their original resolution of 1 hour other studies used different time scales for example sporleder et al 2013 interpolated daily minimum and maximum temperatures into 15 min data and zidon et al 2016 used daily data due to the non linearity of the model different time scales may lead to different predictions interestingly the temperature time scale can be considered as a representation of the accumulating temporal effect of temperature on the physiology of the insect we found that setting the relevant biological time scale parameter to 6 h has improved our model estimations previous studies on b tabaci revealed two major strategies the insect is using for dealing with heat stress the synthesis of heat shock proteins hsps and sorbitol buildup elbaz et al 2011 mahadav et al 2009 salvucci et al 2000 wolfe et al 1998 yu and wan 2009 the accumulation of these products is likely to have broad temporal effects on the physiology of the insect for example danxi and duncan 1995 described the variability of the turn over rate of hsp70 proteins in drosophila melanogaster and showed that their half life could be prolonged from 2 h to 7 when continuous heat stress is applied additionally vitek and berger 1984 showed that high temperatures increase the mrna stability and translational efficiency of both hsp70 and small hsp genes in d melanoaster temperature dependent sorbitol accumulation in b tabaci has been shown to be derived from regulatory changes in the sorbitol synthesis pathway salvucci et al 1999 sorbitol levels were also correlated with diurnal variations in temperature increasing steadily to about ten fold from the morning 8 00 a m to the early afternoon 2 00 p m wolfe et al 1998 taken together these finding may suggest that the physiological effects of both regular daily temperature fluctuations and heat stress periods do not disappear rapidly in b tabaci and can be maintained for about six to seven hours before fading gradually the relevant biological time scale parameter may correctly capture these physiological cycles which could explain its improving effect on the model predictions nonetheless other explanations to the improving effect of the six hours time scale may exist for example smoothing of the small scale temperature variability caused by less realistic changes in dr from hour to hour that produce larger errors compared to the observations in the field control failure of insect pests results many times from a decision making process that was conducted in a too noisy or uncertain environment the uncertainty was likely caused by a combination of biological environmental and operational factors such as the lack of knowledge on the true number of insects that are actually present in the agricultural system the methodological and random errors produced by the sampling technique utilized or the effects of the changing environmental mainly weather conditions on insect pest population dynamics schaub et al 1988 unlike predominating conservative fixed managing strategies the modern approach of active adaptive management is capable of taking into consideration most types of uncertainty walters and holling 1990 it acts through the understanding that the best way to handle uncertainty is to go beyond the conventional self experience decision making alternatively it recommends an extensive and continues learning phase of the agricultural system for gaining better understanding of how the system works before a decision is taken ketterings 2014 shea et al 2002 for example a conventional management approach will likely recommend the spraying of chemicals when a population of a managed pest species crosses the economic threshold level pedigo 1999 on the other hand an active adaptive management approach will require first a learning prediction step in which the short and long term effects of early spraying of chemicals is evaluated using seasonal and historic data only if significant advantage will be predicted to the application of the chemical control this mode of action will be selected che et al 2013 population dynamics modeling has been applied as a decision support tool for pest management in different agricultural environmental systems for example mul et al 2017 developed an empirical population dynamics model for the mite dermanyssus gallinae a major pest of laying hen facilities they used temperature and few other factors to create current state and future population dynamics estimations to be used as a decision support tool when applying ipm approaches in the facilities gil gilioli et al 2016 developed a physiological based model describing the dynamics of the grape berry moth populations they used temperature data to create estimations of population abundancy dynamics segmented into different life stages of the pest barclay and vreysen 2011 constructed a multi staged spatial population model for tsetse glossina palpalis ssp and g pallidipes to predict the efficacy of different ipm strategies in eradicating the pest naranjo 2018 combined life tables and empirical matrix models to retrospectively evaluate the success of biological control programs in controlling b tabaci populations in arizona cotton fields similarly the modeling framework developed in this study can provide an excellent platform for integrating active adaptive management approaches into regional control programs of b tabaci and other major pest species this is because it can significantly reduce uncertainties that relate to the insect s population dynamics and the effects of fluctuating temperatures as part of the model development process its seasonal estimations were correlated with the observations of three hulla valley pest inspectors during the 2019 growing season these comparisons allowed us to evaluate both the model robustness and putative improvements it could bring to the currently established ipm strategies the model was successful in predicting the first notable appearance of the insect fig 5a point i in the field which correlated with the completion of the third generation in may also the model identified the sharp rise in abundance outbreak point that occurred around mid july which led to the first chemical treatment intervention this was associated with the completion of the fifth generation fig 5a point ii later events such as the persistent rise in abundance through august and september fig 5a point iii were also predicted by the model considering the proven robustness of the developed modeling tool it is clear that its integration into the decision making process of the three inspectors could have brought significant benefits for example it could have reduced the monitoring uncertainty by knowing that significant field activity is not expected before the completion of the third generation it could have helped in planning the monitoring timeline and the design of specific extensive monitoring time periods it could have helped testing if the timing of applying the first round of chemical control is supported by the population dynamics predictions end of the fifth generation it could have also contributed to the evaluation of the effect of the chemical treatments on the pest population size by highlighting the time frames in which comparisons should be made between the sprayed generation and the one after lastly the inspectors could have used the modeling framework to simulate the previous growing season s for systematic assessment of their main decisions and their effects on the relationship between the observed notebook documentation and predicted obtained by modeling of historic temperature data series dynamics of the insect pest populations throughout the previous growing seasons making the link between meteorological measurements of regional stations and year to year variability in pest population dynamics years with high or low infestation rates outbreak periods and their effect on crop production will only be the first stage in the integration of the developed modeling tool into decision support systems marchi et al 2016 in a follow up study we plan to develop a simulation tool that will utilize a seasonal forecast linked with a weather generator zidon et al 2016 and a population dynamics model to compute probabilistic forecast before and during the growing season seasonal forecast at a sub daily resolution is available from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf seven months ahead the weather generator will be fed by atmospheric variables from the ecmwf model for the next months and will produce ensembles of local temperatures for any station of interest in the hulla valley forecasted temperature series will be used as model input and population dynamics at selected locations will be computed the outputs will be presented to the user in probabilistic manner as a risk measure where times and locations where there is a high probability of population to exceed a pre defined threshold will issue a warning for a potential outbreak implementing this knowledge into decision making will allow timely set up of the monitoring network and proactive seasonal planning for optimizing agricultural production while reducing its negative effects on the environment 5 conclusions in this study we developed a realistic and robust regional framework for modeling the field population dynamics of the global insect pest bemisia tabaci first we combined two non linear functions describing the insect s development rate and female reproduction with data from nine field experiments then we conducted sensitivity analyses that identified the optimal time scale for which regional temperatures should be fed to the model the developed model was successful in identifying all major events important for pest control the first notable field appearance the outbreak point that requires the implementation of pest control tactics and the extension in development time that leads to population decline at the end of the season taken together these results emphasize the model s potential to serve both in supporting decision making throughout the growing season and in off season retrospective systematic assessment of major decisions moreover due to its robustness we expect the model to be relevant accurate and easy to apply in multiple locations around the globe in which mediterranean climate conditions and the insect pest exist data availability

24701,insect physiology is highly dependent on the environmental temperature and the relationship can be mathematically defined thus many models that aim to predict insect pest population dynamics use meteorological data as input to descriptive functions that predict the development rate survival and reproduction of pest populations in most cases however these functions models are laboratory driven and are based on data from constant temperature experiments therefore they lack an important optimization and validation steps that test their accuracy under field conditions here we developed a realistic and robust regional framework for modeling the field population dynamics of the global insect pest bemisia tabaci first two non linear functions development rate dr and female reproduction en were fitted to data collected in constant temperature experiments next nine one generation field experiments were conducted in order to establish a field derived database of insect performance representing a variety of growing conditions different seasons regions and host plants then sensitivity analyses were performed for identifying the optimal time scale for which the running averaged temperatures should be fed to the model setting the time to 6 h i e each of the 24 time steps per day represents the last 6 h average produced the best fit rmsd score of 1 59 days 5 7 of the mean between the field observations and the model simulations we hypothesize that the 6 h relevant biological time scale captures the insect s physiological memory of daily cycling temperature events lastly we evaluated the potential of the developed modeling framework to serve as a decision support tool in pest management programs by correlating the model predictions with field observations of three pest control inspectors during 2019 the model successfully predicted the first notable appearance of the insect in the field completion of the third generation in may also the model correctly identified the sharp rise in abundance outbreak point in mid july completion of the fifth generation and the persistent rise in abundance through august and september comparing the simulations of the 2018 and 2019 seasons indicated that the model can also serve as a tool for retrospective systematic assessment of major decisions taken together these data demonstrate the model robustness and its potential to provide an excellent decision making support platform in regional control of pest species keywords population dynamics models field conditions invasive species intra annual temperature variability reproductive performance decision making support tool bemisia tabaci 1 introduction among environmental factors temperature has the most profound effect on the biology and life history of poikilothermic animals such as insects messenger 1959 it affects development time survivorship fecundity demographic parameters and foraging behavior davidson 1944 janisch 1932 sandehson 1910 each insect population has an optimum temperature at which it will develop at its fastest rate and lower and upper threshold temperatures beyond which it cannot develop messenger 1959 using the optimum temperature concept life table data of species can be obtained at different controlled and constant temperatures in the laboratory then mathematical non linear functions for development rate survival and reproduction can be established and combined to present the physiologically based demographic models of a given species tonnang et al 2017 these models not only allow estimating the lower and upper temperature thresholds for survival of the species but can also serve as important components in the development of pest management tools this is because they have the potential to realistically describe the spatio temporal dynamics of the population build up generation time and density as a function of the environmental forcing variables mainly temperature and host plants gilioli et al 2016 here we developed a modeling framework to simulate the population dynamics of the whitefly bemisia tabaci hemiptera aleyrodidae under field conditions aiming for its implementation in integrated pest management ipm practices as a decision support tool b tabaci is recognized to be one of the worst all time global pests de barro et al 2011 threatening food security in the developing world including africa the asian pacific and south america it causes severe damage to dozens of economically important plant species cabi 2020 directly by feeding and excreting honeydew and indirectly by transmitting more than 200 plant viruses brown et al 1995 navas castillo et al 2011 this damage is evaluated in millions of dollars in crop losses worldwide cuthbertson et al 2011 legg et al 2014 wan and yang 2016 moreover since the 1990s different species of b tabaci across the globe were reported to develop significant resistance against nearly all chemical compounds used to control phloem feeders leaving the chemical toolbox against this species extremely limited basit 2019 horowitz et al 2007 in addition like other phloem feeding insects b tabaci is predicted to strongly respond to global warming previously we have shown that an increase in the mean temperature of 2 c in the eastern mediterranean will allow the number of generations produced per year by b tabaci to increase from 9 to 12 zidon et al 2016 with a potentially huge increase in population size 10 fold increase it is therefore clear that the development of an ability to accurately predict the abundance of pests like b tabaci in multiple cropping systems could have many advantages first it could assist decision makers when they are faced with different types of uncertainties about biological and environmental processes and observational uncertainty gilioli et al 2013 second it could serve to identify the optimal time of sampling and to reduce unnecessary routine applications of insecticides given in many cases with no real knowledge on the level of risk by providing information on the necessity timing of the treatments throughout the season duffy et al 2017 this can reduce both the growing costs and the risk of local selection for insecticide resistance horowitz et al 2007 moreover modeling based pest management is expected to minimize two environmental risks of insecticides the negative human health outcomes and the unavoidable harm to non targets including beneficial organisms such as natural enemies and pollinators ellsworth and martinez carrillo 2001 third feeding the models with temperature data from medium range i e few days seasonal or climatic forecast models can allow taking adaption actions ahead of time reducing their predicted damages the model presented here is not the first one proposed to describe the population dynamics of b tabaci in the last 40 years multiple laboratory studies were conducted at constant temperatures in order to estimate the effect of temperature on the developmental rate survival and fecundity of the species bosco and caciagli 1998 butler et al 1983 powell and bellows 1992 wagner 1995 wang and tsai 1996 nava camberos et al 2001 muñiz and nombela 2001 yang and chi 2006 bonato et al 2007 tsueda and tsuchida 2011 some of these studies and also others developed mathematical non linear functions for describing the effect of temperature on the life history traits of the species arx et al 2009 bonato et al 2007 muñiz and nombela 2001 wagner 1995 wang and tsai 1996 yang and chi 2006 in addition two studies estimated the degree days dd required for the completing of a generation in b tabaci bosco and caciagli 1998 nava camberos et al 2001 although these laboratory driven functions models can be used to predict the time of first appearance of various developmental stages and facilitate the timing of early season sampling they were not optimized to work under field conditions and are predicted to fail in producing realistic estimates of population build up required for threshold based decision making of pest control gilioli et al 2016 in contrast a field relevant recent study by naranjo 2018 used a combination of field derived life tables temperature dependent matrix models and life table response experiments to estimate the effect of establishment of two exotic parasitoid species on b tabaci population dynamics in cotton fields from the other end and at a larger scale bioclimatic models such as climex ramos et al 2019 and maxent ramos et al 2018 have been recently used in order to predict the distribution and to a lesser extent the abundance of b tabaci at the continental and global levels respectively in addition gilioli et al 2014 developed a temperature dependent physiologically based demographic model pbdm in order to predict the potential distribution of b tabaci in europe under global climatic changes these models used a combination of inductive i e the presence of a species in a location is combined with digital layers of bio climatic variables and used to predict the likelihood of the species presence in other locations and deductive i e direct measurements of the relationships between life history traits and environmental variables are used to identify the likelihood for a location to be suitable for the occurrence of a species approaches tonnang et al 2017 and seem to be capable of predicting the potential distribution of b tabaci over a large geographic area for example global or continental scales therefore their use is more suitable for making risk assessments of the species invasive movement into new regions and for continental regional strategic decisions on the enforcement of quarantine measures or putting restrictions on the importation growing of certain crops in international trade sporleder et al 2013 than for predicting pest distribution abundance and critical thresholds over a small geographic scale in contrast to all previous studies our goal was to develop a population dynamics model for b tabaci that can be used in the field during the growing season to support ipm decision making at a local scale we started with the development of a non linear function that describes the developmental rate of b tabaci under constant temperatures at the next stage a nonlinear function that estimates the temperature effects on fecundity and survival was developed using literature data from multiple papers powell and bellows 1992 wang and tsai 1996 nava camberos et al 2001 yang and chi 2006 tsueda and tsuchida 2011 model predictions of development rate were tested against results from real field experiments in a range of conditions we also introduced a time scale parameter to better integrate the time varying observed temperature data into the model at the final stage critical decision points of field monitoring based pest management were mapped on the model output the ability of the optimized and validated model to support tactical field based decision making in b tabaci management is discussed 2 methods 2 1 population dynamics model as previously described in zidon et al 2016 the population dynamics model incorporates two temperature based functions 1 a performance function that simulates the developmental rate from egg to adult and determines the generation lengths females lay eggs within hours after emergence so the length of the adult to egg phase is neglected and 2 a productivity function describing the number of adults that each female produces 1 dr c 1 exp k 1 t t 1 1 e x p k 2 t t 2 where dr is the developmental rate 1 day t c is the temperature c is a multiplicative coefficient k1 is an increase rate coefficient 1 c t1 c is a lower developmental temperature threshold coefficient k2 is a decrease rate coefficient 1 c and t2 c is an upper developmental temperature threshold coefficient shi et al 2011 zidon et al 2016 the dr function coefficients were identified using data from controlled temperature experiments see next section applying a non linear fit and an optimization function matlab nlinfit and fminsearch respectively 2 en p 1 t p 2 exp p 3 t where en is the total number of adults produced per female i e number of eggs egg to adult survival t c is the temperature and p1 p2 and p3 are function coefficients bonato et al 2007 zidon et al 2016 we applied the same function coefficients that we identified previously in zidon et al 2016 using data from controlled environment experiments tsueda and tsuchida 2011 h tsueda unpublished data at a given generation we calculated the number of adults that emerge when the generation is completed by multiplying the en value by the number of surviving adult females in the previous generation the number of adults that emerged in the previous generation field egg to adult survival rate percentage of females in the population similar to zidon et al 2016 we used literature based fixed values for the two latter parameters the field estimated mean egg to adult survival rate 0 083 from naranjo and ellsworth 2005 was rounded to the first decimal point 0 1 and the percentage of females in the population was assumed to be 50 the temperature t used to compute en was defined as the average temperature during the last five days of the generation as reproductive physiology was presumed to be affected by temperature throughout this period as described in fig 1 model input was a temperature time series at the beginning of each generation the development state starts as zero and then increases at dr for each time step according to the temperature data until it reaches 1 indicating the end of the current generation and the beginning of the next one the population size starts with a pre defined number of surviving females generation 1 at the beginning of the season arbitrarily set here to 100 model output is the time and duration of each generation the population size i e number of surviving adults and the number of completed generations in one year january to december invariable developmental and reproductive rates and distinct generations through the year were assumed 2 2 estimating the development rate at constant temperatures experiments for estimating the development time of one generation of b tabaci days from egg laying to adult emergence under constant temperature regimes were conducted using the meam1 species of b tabaci and the host plant solanum nigrum solanaceae this host plant was selected as it is a worldwide distributed weed defelice 2003 and a preferred highly suitable alternative weed host to the crop plants of b tabaci meam1 in many agricultural systems calvitti and remotti 1998 muñiz 2000 guz et al 2016 moreover s nigrum is usually not treated by herbicides or insecticides and therefore allows the insect to establish multiple generations throughout the season the temperatures tested were 14 c 16 c 17 8 c 20 4 c 22 5 c 23 2 c 28 7 c 33 4 c 34 2 c and 35 0 c prior to running each experiment the population was synchronized so that all adults collected were 0 48 h old ten newly emerged female and male adults were collected into a clip cage and placed on the abaxial side of a leaf of a s nigrum plant with 4 5 true leaves temperature was recorded hourly using a hobo data logger onset computer corporation bourne ma usa starting immediately after the clip cages with the adults were placed on the leaves plant pots and hobos were transferred to a growth chamber programed to maintain a constant temperature regime rh 60 12l 12d adults were allowed an egg laying period of 24 48 h nymph development was monitored weekly until four stage nymphs red eyed appeared at this stage leaves were inspected every day in order to count newly emerged adults and remove their empty exuvia until no more adults emerged averaged development at a constant temperature was calculated as the weighted mean of the days to development the weights being the number of emerging adults collected each day 2 3 estimating the development time under field conditions nine field experiments were conducted in order to estimate the generation length of b tabaci under field conditions the field experiments took place at three locations in israel 1 kibbutz nachshon in the ayalon valley 31 83 n 34 96e during the spring and autumn of 2013 2014 2 kibbutz bar am in the galilee heights 33 05 n 35 43e during the spring and autumn of 2014 3 the hulla valley experiment station 33 15 n 35 62e during the summer and autumn of 2019 and the spring of 2020 in the kibbutz nachshon and kibbutz bar am sites the infested experimental plants were completely exposed in the hulla valley site large populations of other insect pest species were present therefore the experiments were conducted in a 50 mesh screen house all three sites are under mediterranean climate regime characterized by cold and wet winters 450 700 mm annually in the study sites and hot and dry summers the ayalon valley is located in central israel at the foothills of the judean mountains the site s land cover contains mediterranean low density forests a combination of shrub and trees growing on rendzina soil israel ministry of environmental protection website agriculture is abundant in the area and includes open field staple crops various tree plantations and some screen houses kibbutz bar am is located in the upper galilee israel a high mountainous region compared to the other two sites it presented the coolest weather year round goldreich 2003 the natural land cover includes high density marquis shrub and trees along with augmented forests naveh and whittaker 1980 plantations mainly include apple orchards with some regions of open field crops israel ministry of agriculture and rural development website the hulla valley is located in northern israel the enclosure of the valley from west and east by the high ridges of the galil and golan heights respectively results in summer temperatures that are higher than those in coastal areas agriculture is abundant in the hulla valley and includes a combination of open field staple crops and various tree plantations various b tabaci host plants s nigrum ipomoea batatas convolvulaceae citrullus lanatus cucurbitaceae phaseolus vulgaris fabaceae and brassica oleracea var gemmifera brassicaceae were grown in pots 12 cm diameter for 3 5 weeks 2 3 leaves of each plant were inoculated with 10 20 adult pairs of b tabaci using a clip cage for an initial mating and oviposition period of 24 48 h after which the clipped cages were removed the adults were collected from a population reared on the same host plant for at least 2 3 generations temperature was recorded hourly by a hobo data logger from the time the clip cages were mounted on the plants in the kibbutz nachshon and kibbutz bar am sites data from one hobo was collected for each experiment in the hulla valley site several sensors collected the temperature data adult emergence was recorded daily by counting and removing exuviae see more details above the weighted mean emergence day was calculated for each plant the weights being the number of emerging adults each day this was followed by calculation of a weighted mean for the whole experiment 2 4 model fit in field conditions sensitivity analysis and the relevant biological time scale parameter data obtained from the field experiments were used to test the generation length computation as determined by the dr function the root mean square difference rmsd and the bias i e the difference of the means metrics were used to quantify the fit of the computed and observed generation length as indicated above temperature data from all field experiments were available at an hourly resolution and the dr function was applied initially at this time scale sensitivity to the time scale was further examined by comparing the hourly to the daily resolutions we further explored the time scale effect by testing a new model parameter the relevant biological time scale which represents the physiological memory of the insect the duration of the effect of temperature on physiological processes this parameter represents the number of hours averaged from a specific time point and backwards which creates a running average value for each time point thus while the hourly resolution is preserved the model inputs are backwards running averages we identified this parameter by averaging the hourly temperature data at different time scales and finding the scale with the optimal fit i e minimal rmsd leave one out cross validation was chosen for reinforcement due to the limited number of independent field experiments 2 5 integrating model predictions into ipm activities as we plan in the future to integrate the developed modeling tool into ipm decision making processes we established contacts with three local pest inspectors in the hulla valley this allowed us to compare between our modeled predictions of b tabaci population dynamics and observational data at a regional scale for producing seasonal predictions of population dynamics we chose three meteorological stations throughout the hulla valley from which we extracted hourly temperature data the meteorological stations belong to the department of agriculture northern research and development organization kabul 33 11 n 35 61e gadot 33 03 n 35 62e and havat gadash 33 18 n 35 58e temperature data for 2019 were acquired from the organization s website data were quality controlled and missing data were filled in a two step procedure first the neighboring station showing the highest correlation of temperature data was identified then a simple linear regression model describing the relationship between the temperature measures of the two stations was used to calculate the expected values of the missing data the model was provided with time series of temperature data starting from january 1 2019 and returned estimations of generation time and length population size and the number of generations completed along the year observational data were collected weekly from march 2019 to november 2019 each pest inspector monitored at least four fields in the vicinity 3 km radius of the meteorological stations see above we found that the inspectors tend to rely on general observations made every few days and on intimate familiarity with each field and that the reported data is more qualitative descriptive than quantitative therefore we limited our comparisons to four time points the generation in which the first detection of adult activity was observed in the field the generation in which the decision on the first spraying was made the generation in which a repeatable high infestation was followed by a multiple spraying effort and the extend development period at the end of the season comparisons were made over the entire 2019 growing season 3 results 3 1 constant temperature experiments and the fitting of a development rate dr function development time was estimated under eight constant temperature regimes appendix table a we could not estimate the development time at the fixed temperature regimes of 14 and 35 c as no survivors were obtained the fastest development time was 12 6 days at constant experimental temperature of 33 4 c suggesting it to be close to the optimum temperature of development an asymmetric response was found around the optimum a significant slower development time was observed at 34 5 c 18 9 days followed by no survival at 35 c in contrast low temperatures allowed some survival but severely prolonged the development time up to 56 2 days at 16 c a dr function describing the development rate as a function of temperature was fitted based on the results obtained in the controlled temperature experiments fig 2 a the threshold temperatures for development calculated by the fitting process i e t1 and t2 were 10 4 c and 35 1 c optimal development rate was calculated at 33 c as described in zidon et al 2016 a non linear function fitting was used to create the en function describing the number of adults produced by a single female i e number of eggs x egg to adult survival as a function of temperature the resulting function has an optimal rate at 26 c symmetrical responses were calculated at both sides of the optimum point sensitivity tests of the dr and en functions fit score to parameters values indicated that except of k2 sensitivity is very high implying well optimized functions and low uncertainty in the optimized parameters the least certain parameter k2 was further tested for its effect on the model outputs specifically the number of generations and the mean generation length and their sensitivity was found to be very low our conclusion from these analyses was that the optimized dr and en functions are trustable and can be used for population dynamics modeling 3 2 estimating the development time under field conditions and testing the dr function fit in total nine experiments were conducted in order to estimate the weighted mean of days for development from egg to adult under field conditions table 1 the estimated development periods varied between 21 days at mid summer in the hulla valley july to 39 days at autumn in kibbutz bar am october november these experiments also presented the high and low extremities of the average temperatures the effect of temperature on development time was mostly apparent at late autumn table 1 experiments 1 3 5 8 while the hulla valley and kibbutz nachshon sites displayed similar average temperatures and development time the cooler climate at kibbutz bar am led to an extended development period of 15 days a seasonal effect was also observed experiments 2 4 and 9 were performed at late spring early summer and had similar development periods 28 32 days which were 4 8 days longer than the development periods observed in experiments 1 3 and 8 that were conducted at autumn although the average temperatures were similar in all experiments this difference might relate to the higher variance and larger interquartile temperature ranges observed in the late spring early summer experiments especially during march april 2014 at the kibbutz nachshon site and the early summer of 2020 at the hulla valley site table 1 for correlating between the field estimates and the developed dr function estimates the measured hourly temperature data from the experiments was used as a model input to compute the generation length fig 3 presents the observed and modeled generation length for the different experiments the rmsd was 2 18 days and the bias 1 18 days 7 8 and 4 2 of the mean observed generation length respectively in eight out of nine experiments the differences between the computed and observed generation length were in the range of 0 4 2 3 days only in one case the sweet potato experiment in the hulla valley site a large generation length overestimation of 5 4 days was obtained fig 3 considering the number of experiments conducted the range of experimental conditions plant hosts seasons and locations and the independence of the data set we find the relatively good fit obtained between observed and computed generation length highly encouraging and believe that the developed dr function is both accurate and robust 3 3 the relevant biological time scale the controlled temperature experiments from which the dr function was developed were conducted under fix temperature conditions for many hours 12 60 days and therefore the function does not have an inherent time scale still when the dr function is applied as part of our model in field conditions fig 3 a choice of the time period duration for which the average temperature is calculated can be made as a starting default we have used 1 hour data as this was the time frame for which the raw temperature data were available however a question was raised for the appropriate or optimal time scale to be applied to the model this time scale which we termed as the relevant biological time scale should represents the insect s physiological memory one simple possibility for example was to follow the insect s circadian clock rhythm and to apply daily time steps however the model in this case presented a rmsd value of 3 6 days which was larger than that obtained for the hourly scale 2 18 days we tested the model s performance sensitivity to the relevant biological time scale by applying a running average function to the hourly temperature data before it serves as input to the model fig 4 a reveals a great sensitivity to this parameter with the minimal rmsd score of 1 59 days 5 7 of the mean observed generation length for the values of 6 h the bias at this time scale is 0 09 days 0 3 of the mean we utilized a leave one out cross validation framework to examine the model estimation errors for an out of sample data the mean absolute difference between the observed and computed data for the experiment that was left out from calibration in each iteration was 1 6 days and the distribution of the optimal parameter value for each of the nine iterations is shown in fig 4b in six out of the nine cases the optimal value was at the 6 hour range which reinforced the accuracy of the calculation of the optimal value based on the entire set of experiments the reanalysis of the fit with observed data using the 6 hour relevant biological time scale is shown in fig 4c due to the improved fit we used the model containing this parameter in all further simulations 3 4 integrating model predictions into ipm activities for preliminary evaluation of our model as a decision support tool temperature data from three meteorological stations in the hulla valley were used as input to the model for simulating b tabaci population dynamics duration of each generation number of generations population size along the year of 2019 fig 5 regional observational data on b tabaci abundance and spread were collected weekly by three pest inspectors in the hulla valley throughout the 2019 growing season march november the information gathered by the inspectors was condensed to identify only major events throughout the month of may and early june first detection of adults activity took place in various fields this time period correlated with the completion of generation 3 in the model fig 5a point i a subtle rise in population size towards the end of june resulted in high abundancy in mid july when the first insecticide treatments were applied in tomato and watermelon fields this time period correlated with the completion of generation 5 in the model and a 19 fold increase in population size between generations 3 and 5 fig 5a point ii by august generation 7 according to the model fig 5a point iii all three inspectors reported large infestations in all crops followed by repeated chemical treatments at least 2 3 applications per field only in october control on infestation levels was achieved at this time the mean daily temperature dropped by 4 c and most crops were already harvested in the model generation 10 fig 5a point iv this time period was characterized by slower developmental rate 20 25 days only bean fields were still infested with high levels of persistent populations that were only slightly affected by the application of insecticides at the end of the season the inspectors were asked to provide a general assessment of the growing season in comparison to their previous experience two out of three inspectors indicated a notable delay in the first detection of significant number of adults in the fields during the end of spring of 2019 when compared to the similar period in 2018 this observation perfectly correlated with our modeling results which predicted the insects to complete generation 4 at early june in 2019 but 20 days earlier in 2018 fig 5b in addition all three inspectors were in consensus that the growing season of 2019 was characterized by extremely heavy populations that were capable of surviving the chemical treatments this general assessment was also supported by comparing the modeling results of 2018 and 2019 fig 5a and b although the model predicted for 2018 the completion of 13 generations in many fields one generation more than in 2019 the population size estimates for 2019 were 2 3 fold higher than in 2018 at the end of the season november 4 discussion tools for modeling population dynamics of insect pests that endanger public health and food security in the eastern mediterranean region are currently lacking moreover previously developed laboratory driven functions models for describing the effect of temperature on b tabaci population dynamics were not optimized for inter and intra daily fluctuating temperatures and have not been tested for accuracy under field conditions see the list of cited literature in the introduction here we developed and tested a realistic and robust regional modeling framework for b tabaci population dynamics under both laboratory and field conditions we utilized data from constant temperature experiments to set model parameters which is the common practice in similar modeling efforts e g arx von et al 1983 muñiz nombela 2001 bonato et al 2007 zidon et al 2016 the model simulations of generation lengths under field conditions were found to fit very well with the observations rmsd of 1 59 days 5 7 of the mean with relevant biological time scale of 6 h it should be emphasized that the good fit obtained was for independent data sets that also represent a variety of conditions i e seasons sites and host plants table 1 this demonstrates the model robustness which is an important modeling characteristic especially if it is planned to be used in practice and out of sample data are expected depending on data availability there is often a tradeoff between model accuracy and robustness e g su et al 2018 the former can be improved for example by increasing model complexity or by further optimization in the risk of having relatively large errors when conditions are somewhat changed a situation often referred as overfitting hawkins 2004 in our case after testing the model in nine field experiments we decided not to apply fine tuning to the model parameters as we plan to integrate it into ipm practices and prefer to keep its robustness moving from constant temperature experiments to field experiments one important decision to make is how to represent temperature data in the model our initial results were obtained with the data at their original resolution of 1 hour other studies used different time scales for example sporleder et al 2013 interpolated daily minimum and maximum temperatures into 15 min data and zidon et al 2016 used daily data due to the non linearity of the model different time scales may lead to different predictions interestingly the temperature time scale can be considered as a representation of the accumulating temporal effect of temperature on the physiology of the insect we found that setting the relevant biological time scale parameter to 6 h has improved our model estimations previous studies on b tabaci revealed two major strategies the insect is using for dealing with heat stress the synthesis of heat shock proteins hsps and sorbitol buildup elbaz et al 2011 mahadav et al 2009 salvucci et al 2000 wolfe et al 1998 yu and wan 2009 the accumulation of these products is likely to have broad temporal effects on the physiology of the insect for example danxi and duncan 1995 described the variability of the turn over rate of hsp70 proteins in drosophila melanogaster and showed that their half life could be prolonged from 2 h to 7 when continuous heat stress is applied additionally vitek and berger 1984 showed that high temperatures increase the mrna stability and translational efficiency of both hsp70 and small hsp genes in d melanoaster temperature dependent sorbitol accumulation in b tabaci has been shown to be derived from regulatory changes in the sorbitol synthesis pathway salvucci et al 1999 sorbitol levels were also correlated with diurnal variations in temperature increasing steadily to about ten fold from the morning 8 00 a m to the early afternoon 2 00 p m wolfe et al 1998 taken together these finding may suggest that the physiological effects of both regular daily temperature fluctuations and heat stress periods do not disappear rapidly in b tabaci and can be maintained for about six to seven hours before fading gradually the relevant biological time scale parameter may correctly capture these physiological cycles which could explain its improving effect on the model predictions nonetheless other explanations to the improving effect of the six hours time scale may exist for example smoothing of the small scale temperature variability caused by less realistic changes in dr from hour to hour that produce larger errors compared to the observations in the field control failure of insect pests results many times from a decision making process that was conducted in a too noisy or uncertain environment the uncertainty was likely caused by a combination of biological environmental and operational factors such as the lack of knowledge on the true number of insects that are actually present in the agricultural system the methodological and random errors produced by the sampling technique utilized or the effects of the changing environmental mainly weather conditions on insect pest population dynamics schaub et al 1988 unlike predominating conservative fixed managing strategies the modern approach of active adaptive management is capable of taking into consideration most types of uncertainty walters and holling 1990 it acts through the understanding that the best way to handle uncertainty is to go beyond the conventional self experience decision making alternatively it recommends an extensive and continues learning phase of the agricultural system for gaining better understanding of how the system works before a decision is taken ketterings 2014 shea et al 2002 for example a conventional management approach will likely recommend the spraying of chemicals when a population of a managed pest species crosses the economic threshold level pedigo 1999 on the other hand an active adaptive management approach will require first a learning prediction step in which the short and long term effects of early spraying of chemicals is evaluated using seasonal and historic data only if significant advantage will be predicted to the application of the chemical control this mode of action will be selected che et al 2013 population dynamics modeling has been applied as a decision support tool for pest management in different agricultural environmental systems for example mul et al 2017 developed an empirical population dynamics model for the mite dermanyssus gallinae a major pest of laying hen facilities they used temperature and few other factors to create current state and future population dynamics estimations to be used as a decision support tool when applying ipm approaches in the facilities gil gilioli et al 2016 developed a physiological based model describing the dynamics of the grape berry moth populations they used temperature data to create estimations of population abundancy dynamics segmented into different life stages of the pest barclay and vreysen 2011 constructed a multi staged spatial population model for tsetse glossina palpalis ssp and g pallidipes to predict the efficacy of different ipm strategies in eradicating the pest naranjo 2018 combined life tables and empirical matrix models to retrospectively evaluate the success of biological control programs in controlling b tabaci populations in arizona cotton fields similarly the modeling framework developed in this study can provide an excellent platform for integrating active adaptive management approaches into regional control programs of b tabaci and other major pest species this is because it can significantly reduce uncertainties that relate to the insect s population dynamics and the effects of fluctuating temperatures as part of the model development process its seasonal estimations were correlated with the observations of three hulla valley pest inspectors during the 2019 growing season these comparisons allowed us to evaluate both the model robustness and putative improvements it could bring to the currently established ipm strategies the model was successful in predicting the first notable appearance of the insect fig 5a point i in the field which correlated with the completion of the third generation in may also the model identified the sharp rise in abundance outbreak point that occurred around mid july which led to the first chemical treatment intervention this was associated with the completion of the fifth generation fig 5a point ii later events such as the persistent rise in abundance through august and september fig 5a point iii were also predicted by the model considering the proven robustness of the developed modeling tool it is clear that its integration into the decision making process of the three inspectors could have brought significant benefits for example it could have reduced the monitoring uncertainty by knowing that significant field activity is not expected before the completion of the third generation it could have helped in planning the monitoring timeline and the design of specific extensive monitoring time periods it could have helped testing if the timing of applying the first round of chemical control is supported by the population dynamics predictions end of the fifth generation it could have also contributed to the evaluation of the effect of the chemical treatments on the pest population size by highlighting the time frames in which comparisons should be made between the sprayed generation and the one after lastly the inspectors could have used the modeling framework to simulate the previous growing season s for systematic assessment of their main decisions and their effects on the relationship between the observed notebook documentation and predicted obtained by modeling of historic temperature data series dynamics of the insect pest populations throughout the previous growing seasons making the link between meteorological measurements of regional stations and year to year variability in pest population dynamics years with high or low infestation rates outbreak periods and their effect on crop production will only be the first stage in the integration of the developed modeling tool into decision support systems marchi et al 2016 in a follow up study we plan to develop a simulation tool that will utilize a seasonal forecast linked with a weather generator zidon et al 2016 and a population dynamics model to compute probabilistic forecast before and during the growing season seasonal forecast at a sub daily resolution is available from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf seven months ahead the weather generator will be fed by atmospheric variables from the ecmwf model for the next months and will produce ensembles of local temperatures for any station of interest in the hulla valley forecasted temperature series will be used as model input and population dynamics at selected locations will be computed the outputs will be presented to the user in probabilistic manner as a risk measure where times and locations where there is a high probability of population to exceed a pre defined threshold will issue a warning for a potential outbreak implementing this knowledge into decision making will allow timely set up of the monitoring network and proactive seasonal planning for optimizing agricultural production while reducing its negative effects on the environment 5 conclusions in this study we developed a realistic and robust regional framework for modeling the field population dynamics of the global insect pest bemisia tabaci first we combined two non linear functions describing the insect s development rate and female reproduction with data from nine field experiments then we conducted sensitivity analyses that identified the optimal time scale for which regional temperatures should be fed to the model the developed model was successful in identifying all major events important for pest control the first notable field appearance the outbreak point that requires the implementation of pest control tactics and the extension in development time that leads to population decline at the end of the season taken together these results emphasize the model s potential to serve both in supporting decision making throughout the growing season and in off season retrospective systematic assessment of major decisions moreover due to its robustness we expect the model to be relevant accurate and easy to apply in multiple locations around the globe in which mediterranean climate conditions and the insect pest exist data availability

24702,nutrient loading in combination with climate change are important drivers of primary productivity in lakes understanding and forecasting future changes in primary production pp in response to local and global forcing are major challenges for developing sustainable lake management the objective of this study is to understand and characterize the mechanisms underlying the large differences in observed pp rates and nutrient concentrations between two consecutive years 2012 and 2013 in lake geneva switzerland for this purpose we apply a one dimensional 1d physical biogeochemical model system the framework of aquatic biogeochemical models fabm interface is used to couple the general ocean turbulence model gotm with a biogeochemical model the ecological regional ocean model ergom we calibrated gotm by adjusting physical parameters with the observed temperature profiles a model calibration method is implemented to minimize model data misfits and to optimize the biological parameters related to phytoplankton growth dynamics according to our results the simulated surface mixed layer depth is deeper and heat loss from the lake and turbulent kinetic energy in the water column are much higher in winter 2012 than that in 2013 pointing to a cooling driven deep mixing in the lake in 2012 we found significant differences in internal phosphorus loads in the epilimnion between the two years with estimates for 2012 being higher than those for 2013 ergom predicts weak nutrient limitation on phytoplankton and higher growth rates in 2012 apparently the deep mixing event led to high turnover of nutrients particularly dissolved inorganic phosphate to the productive surface layers and a massive algal bloom developed later in the productive season in contrary the turnover of nutrients in 2013 was weak and consequently the pp was low our findings demonstrate the utility of a coupled physical biological model framework for the investigation of the meteorological and physical controls of pp dynamics in aquatic systems keywords nutrient carbon fixation phytoplankton classes coupled models colimitation deep mixing model calibration 1 introduction changes in nutrient loads and climate forcing perturb lake ecosystems on different temporal scales on the one hand studies have linked long term responses e g increase in thermal stratification and shifts in phytoplankton and zooplankton community structures to global warming and different trophic conditions magnuson et al 1990 watson et al 1997 livingstone 2003 austin and colman 2007 perroud et al 2009 anneville et al 2019 lepori 2019 on the other hand seasonal and inter annual variations in dynamics of physical and biogeochemical processes as well as rapid responses to extreme events are evident in lakes gächter et al 1974 yoshioka et al 1994 scheffer et al 2001 macintyre et al 2002 anneville et al 2004 perga et al 2018 while much focus is on investigation of long term changes in lakes it is important to study processes on seasonal and yearly scales as they provide insights on physical biological interactions that contribute to the internal variability of the systems furthermore to disentangle response signals to climate change it is critical to resolve the inherent uncertainties in lake dynamics vertical mixing in lakes is largely controlled by heat fluxes and wind imboden and wüest 1995 typically for temperate lakes deep mixing occurs in spring and fall and in summer they remain stratified the turnover of water masses has important consequences for the development of the trophic state of a lake as it influences the exchange of heat and matter between epilimnion metalimnion and hypolimnion michalski and lemmin 1995 vertical mixing is one of the important factors controlling pp in a lake as the supply and concentration of nutrients from the deeper parts to the epilimnion depends on mixing strength schwefel et al 2019 investigated the total phosphorus tp concentrations in the epilimnion of a meromictic alpine lake under present and future climate conditions their data show that tp transport from the deep hypolimnion by winter mixing can be the predominant source of tp in the lake epilimnion much higher than the contributions of nutrient inputs from catchments the mixing depth has stochastic control on pp because it changes with meteorological forcing lewis 2011 these changes can occur on yearly scale or can be long term straile et al 2010 studied the impact of the warm winter of 2006 2007 w06 07 on nutrient mixing dynamics and phytoplankton biomass in lake constance and compared it with the preceding cold winter of 2005 2005 w05 06 their analysis shows that the density gradient between upper warm and lower cold water layers was strong in w06 07 which prevented deep mixing and consequently the vertical transport of phosphorus to the upper water layers in years 2005 and 2006 exceptional deep mixing events stirred up and ventilated the entire water column in lake lugano leading to high pp holzner et al 2009 goldman et al 1989 studied yearly fluctuations in pp in the two temperate lakes castle and tahoe they found that pp patterns in lake castle are driven by large scale climate events e g el niño or southern oscillation and in lake tahoe by strong mixing in winter and spring as climate warming continues a reduction in the potential of vertical mixing has been reported for tropical lake tanganyika and thereby limiting the nutrient fluxes to the photic layers verburga and hecky 2009 lake geneva is a peri

three times higher than that of 2013 whereas dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip concentrations were higher and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentrations were lower in the lake epilimnion in 2012 compared to 2013 we seek to gain insights on the drivers e g winter mixing intensity and riverine inputs that could generate such changes in pp and nutrient dynamics to address this we designed a calibration method that provides the optimized estimates of eco physiological parameters for 2012 and then we validate the model against the observations from 2013 together with estimates of physical quantities and biological parameters we aim to understand how changes in deep mixing dynamics affect pp rates and nutrient concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and observations lake geneva the largest lake in western europe is shared by switzerland 60 and france 40 it is situated at an altitude of 372 m on the north side of the alps and covers a total area of 580 km2 the residence time of the lake water is 11 years lake geneva can be divided into three parts the eastern part close to the rhône estuary the largest and deepest central basin grand lac and the south western shallower and narrow part petit lac lake geneva enjoys the legacy of a long sampling history and has been monitored since early 1950s initially by union générale des rhodaniens and thereafter 1963 onwards by commission internationale pour la protection des eaux du léman cipel water samples to study physical and biogeochemical properties of the lake e g temperature conductivity transparency dissolved oxygen and nutrient concentrations are collected monthly in winter and bimonthly in other seasons from stations ge3 petit lac and shl2 grand lac at the deepest location perroud et al 2009

institute for agricultural food and environment inrae in this study we apply a 1d coupled physical biogeochemical model system to analyse and interpret in situ temperature pp and nutrient data from shl2 station for two years 2012 and 2013 pp measurements were done using the 14c radiotracer method 2 2 yearly phosphorus budget in order to investigate the potential impact a deep mixing event may have on pp rates a full budget of bioavailable phosphorus was conducted in the production zone for the two years considered in our study the net p u p t a k e supports the phytoplankton biomass production in the trophogenic layer of a lake it corresponds to the sum of all watershed contributions entering and leaving the system l i n l o u t with the net difference of p stock in the epilimnion before and after the production period this stock difference corresponds to the total mass of tp in the epilimnion after the winter mixing minus the remaining mass in autumn at the end of the pp period 1 p u p t a k e l i n l o u t 0 z e p i a z t p m i x i n g z d z 0 z e p i a z t p a u t u m n z d z the productive zone was defined with z e p i 30 m based on the analysis of long term

averaged over the top 10 m multiplied by daily flows measured in geneva at the gauge station les halles same data source as above 2 3 meteorological data cosmo consortium for small scale modelling models are developed to forecast weather in the complex alpine region which includes switzerland baldauf et al 2011 we obtained hourly meteorological cosmo model data e g short wave radiation wind air pressure cloud cover and relative humidity for both years from meteoswiss the spatial resolution of the model is 1 1 km 2 4 modelling framework in this study we apply a coupled physical biogeochemical model system to investigate changes in dynamics of lake processes such as winter mixing evolution of temperature profiles nutrient pp we use the fabm interface bruggeman and bolding 2014 to couple gotm burchard et al 2006 with ergom neumann et al 2002 2 4 1 physical model gotm is a 1d hydrostatic model for studying thermo hydrodynamic processes of marine and lake ecosystems it contains state of the art parameterizations for describing the vertical turbulent fluxes of heat and salinity the model is based on reynolds averaged navier stokes equations of momentum temperature and salinity burchard et al 2006 the temperature equation is given as 2 t t z w t z i κ 2 z 2 t where the coordinate z is taken to point upwards with the origin z 0 at the lake surface t is the temperature in units c the specific heat capacity c p and the molecular diffusivity of heat κ are given in units j kg 1 c 1 and m2 s 1 i q s w c p ρ 0 is the kinematic radiative flux at a given depth and time and has units c m s 1 it is to note that i z t in gotm is estimated from the surface irradiance i 0 attenuation lengths at the surface ξ 1 and over 10 40 m depth ξ 2 and depth d paulson and simpson 1977 3 i i 0 r exp d ξ 1 1 r exp d ξ 2 where r is a weighting parameter and the depth at which i becomes 10 of i 0 is assumed to be the secchi depth z s d in the model hence eq 3 becomes 4 0 1 r exp z s d ξ 1 1 r exp z s d ξ 2 we assume ξ 1 0 7 m as this value is representative for lake geneva and corresponds to the mean value of ξ 1 for jerlov water types ia and ib jerlov 2014 we substitute the value for ξ 1 and measurements of z s d obtained from shl2 station in eq 4 to get the estimates of ξ 2 the momentum and salinity equations are formulated equivalently and to avoid repetitions they are presented in appendices a 1 and a 2 in this study we have applied gotm 5 3 version available at https github com gotm model code a second order turbulent model has been considered for computing vertical turbulence fluxes umlauf and burchard 2005 and longwave back radiation is estimated by the method described in clark et al 1974 in addition the model grid resolution at the surface is higher grid zooming parameter ddu 3 than the bottom ddl 0 for calibration we adapt values for gotm parameters from their typical ranges listed in wüest and lorke 2003 for lakes in the next step we adjust scaling parameters for winds and short wave radiations to obtain good agreement with observed temperature profiles the detailed descriptions of gotm are given in burchard et al 2006 umlauf et al 2003 and umlauf and burchard 2003 2 4 2 characterizing lake thermal stratification using the cosmo data in situ data from lake geneva and the gotm model output we estimated the net heat flux for the years

wave radiation heat fluxes while q sw is the short wave radiation heat flux which penetrates across the water column in particular we denote the surface net heat flux as q t z 0 q 0 t gotm provides the evolution of the thermal structure in lake geneva based on the temperature field t and the salinity reference observed in lake geneva s 0 0 2 g l 1 we determined the density field using the equation of state ρ t s in millero and poisson 1981 the density distribution allowed estimation of the water stability 6 n 2 t z 1 ρ ρ z the position of the pycnocline z pyc corresponds to the depth of the maximum stability n max 2 for simplicity we defined the surface mixed layer sml as z pyc to avoid capturing the diurnal surface mixed layer imberger 1985 we look for n max 2 in 5 m depth 309 m the turbulent kinetic energy t k e is a physical quantity modelled by gotm the root mean square of the depth averaged t k e in the sml t k e provides a level of velocity fluctuations in the sml and a quantity to assess the energetic state of the water column to quantify the kinetic energy generated by cooling driven convection in the sml we estimated the convective velocity scale w c bouffard and wüest 2019 known as well as the deardorff scale deardorff 1970 7 w c z pyc b 0 1 3 where b 0 α g q 0 c p ρ 0 α the thermal expansion coefficient g the gravitational acceleration and ρ 0 the water reference density having t k e w c implies that convection is the dominant mechanism generating kinetic energy in the sml 2 4 3 biogeochemical model we apply the ecological model to simulate nutrient and phytoplankton growth dynamics in lake geneva although the model was originally developed for studying biogeochemistry in marine ecosystems its complexity in terms of trophic structure and the description of physio ecological processes make ergom applicable for lakes as well the model resolves growth dynamics of three functional groups of phytoplankton diatoms p 1 flagellates p 2 and cyanobacteria p 3 that account for nutrient and light limitations the nitrogen limitation n f for the uptake of d i n is described by a squared form of the michaelis menten function as it stabilizes the model solutions through reducing phytoplankton uptake at low nutrient concentrations neumann et al 2002 8 d i n a n 9 n f d i n 2 α n 2 d i n 2 where n and a are concentrations of nitrate and ammonium in units of mmol n m 3 and α n is the half saturation constant for nitrogen uptake in mmol n m 3 likewise the phosphorus limitation function p f is given as 10 p f d i p 2 α n 2 s r 2 d i p 2 where d i p is given in units of mmol p m 3 and s r is the p n ratio the model has adapted the light limitation l f parameterization from steele 1962 11 l f i p a r i o p t exp 1 i p a r i o p t which applies to all three phytoplankton groups here i p a r is the photosynthetically active radiation in units w m 2 and it is estimated from the surface irradiance i 0 z and the attenuation coefficients of water and planktonic particles k w and k c the light optimum i o p t is the maximum value between 50 of i 0 and the minimum irradiance i m i n in contrast to phytoplankton ergom includes one bulk formulation for zooplankton that represents all species of heterotrophs all dead particulate organic matter are accounted in bulk detritus the model also resolves consumption and production of oxygen in the water column and sediment dynamics explicitly the detailed first description of the model is given in neumann 2000 and neumann et al 2002 below we briefly summarize the source parameterizations for phytoplankton and zooplankton phytoplankton the total phytoplankton biomass is given by the sum of the concentrations of diatoms flagellates and cyanobacteria the growth rate of diatoms r 1 depends on n f p f and l f and is given as 12 r 1 r 1 m a x min n f p f l f where r 1 m a x is the maximum potential growth rate of diatoms in units d 1 the model considers smooth increase in the growth rate of flagellates r 2 with temperature in addition to dependencies on n f p f and l f 13 r 2 r 2 m a x t 2 t f 2 t 2 min n f p f l f where r 2 m a x is the maximum potential growth rate of flagellates in units d 1 t f and t are the half saturation temperature for flagellates and water temperature in c for cyanobacteria ergom assumes an exponential increase in the growth rate r 3 with temperature and no nitrogen limitation 14 r 3 r 3 m a x 1 1 exp β c y a t c y a t min p f l f where r 3 m a x is the maximum potential growth rate of cyanobacteria in d 1 t c y a and β c y a are the half saturation temperature for cyanobacteria and a temperature control parameter in units c and c 1 respectively zooplankton the grazing by bulk zooplankton g n on phytoplankton is described by the ivlev formulation ivlev 1966 and assumed to be dependent on temperature with lower preference for cyanobacteria 15 g n g n m a x 1 t 2 t o p t 2 exp 1 2 t t o p t 1 exp i i v l e v p s u m 2 where g n has units d 1 t o p t and p s u m are the optimal temperature for zooplankton and the total biomass of phytoplankton in units c and mmol c m 3 and i i v l e v is the ivlev constant the maximum grazing rates for phytoplankton are denoted as g n m a x in units d 1 with the assumption that the rates on diatoms and flagellates g 1 m a x g 2 m a x are higher than that on cyanobacteria g 1 m a x g 2 m a x g 3 m a x detritus the dead phytoplankton and zooplankton are accounted for in bulk detritus besides this the resuspended matter from sediments also becomes a part of detritus eq b 1 in appendix b shows the source terms for detritus nutrients dynamics of nutrients d i n d i p are represented by losses of nitrogen and phosphorus by physiological processes e g respiration and excretion and biogeochemical processes e g remineralization of detritus and sediment eqs b 2 and b 3 in appendix show the rates of ammonification and nitrification whereas eq b 5 denotes the source minus sink equation of dip the ordinary differential equations odes for nutrients are given in neumann et al 2002 sediment the rate of sedimentation l d s in ergom depends on the sedimentation rate of detritus l d s and the critical stress τ c r i t at the bottom of the lake see eq b 6 in appendix b oxygen the sources for oxygen o t in the model are pp by phytoplankton and the gas exchange through lake surface f o 2 eq b 7 in appendix b shows the ordinary differential equation for dissolved oxygen fig c 8 in appendix c shows the schematics of ergom and its source code is available at https github com fabm model fabm blob master src models gotm ergom f90 2 5 model calibration from the results of our preceding test simulations not shown here we have identified that to realistically simulate the nutrient dynamics in the lake geneva it is critical that the model accounts for temporal variations in the riverine input loads this is particularly relevant for 2012 and 2013 because the observed monthly nutrient fluxes especially din from the rivers and tributaries are significantly different between the two years fig 1 our data assimilation da approach is to calibrate the model for 2012 and validate the optimized solution with the measurements of pp din and dip from 2013 while considering the observed monthly variations in the areal riverine influxes of din and dip in units mmol n m 2 d 1 and mmol p m 2 d 1 in the simulations the river fluxes are one of the source terms in the simulation of the state variables dip and din see eq b 5 to quantify the discrepancy between measurements and model outputs we designed a misfit cost function 2 5 1 cost function we implement a probabilistic based multi variate misfit function j t o t a l which is similar to that of schartau and oschlies 2003 on a given date the mean squared error mse is given as the square of the difference between the depth average value of an observed profile and the corresponding model output for a measurement type we consider three chi squared cost functions ward et al 2013 defined as sums of weighted mses to quantify the total temporal data model misfits in the lake epilimnion j e p i metalimnion j m e t and hypolimnion j h y p it is important to account for misfits in these layers of the water column individually because dynamics of physical and biogeochemical processes may vary between them particularly during the stratified period for any observation type the misfit costs in the three layers are given as 16 j e p i j 1 n j 1 σ e p i j 2 y e p i j x e p i j 2 17 j m e t j 1 n j 1 σ m e t j 2 y m e t j x m e t j 2 18 j h y p j 1 n j 1 σ h y p j 2 y h y p j x h y p j 2 where y e p i j y m e t j and y h y p j are the mean observations of epilimnion 0 to 10 m metalimnion 10 to 50 m and hypolimnion 50 m on a date j and x e p i j x m e t j and x h y p j are the equivalent model outputs likewise σ e p i σ m e t and σ h y p are the observed uncertainties standard deviations in epilimnion metalimnion and hypolimnion on a given date note j e p i j m e t and j h y p describe the conditional probability of explaining the observed data l i k e l i h o o d given model and its parameters and can be derived from their gaussian probability density functions using bayes theorem sivia and skilling 2006 three i 1 3 observation types d i n d i p p p are assimilated in the cost function and are assumed to be independent the overall misfit cost j t o t a l is given as the sum of j e p i j m e t and j h y p normalized to the number of observed profiles n i over the entire period for all three variables i 19 j t o t a l 1 3 i 1 3 1 n i j e p i i j m e t i j h y p i 2 5 2 parameter selection the selection of parameters for optimization is based on their relevance to pp and the degree of sensitivity of the results to the parameter values an ideal approach would be to assign the maximum growth rates parameters r 1 m a x r 2 m a x r 3 m a x the values identified in neumann 2000 for baltic sea and run the simulations for lake geneva we unsuccessfully tried this approach in the preceding test hand tuned simulations therefore we have decided to optimize r 1 m a x r 2 m a x r 3 m a x for the respective year and on purpose grant an extra degree of freedom to the model through a sensitivity analysis we found r i m a x l z d mortality rate of zooplankton l d a remineralization rate of detritus and w d sinking speed of detritus parameters to be critical in resolving nutrient dynamics hence we selected the above six physio ecological parameters also listed in table 1 other model parameters that are not subjected to optimization are assigned values that are identified in previous studies neumann 2000 neumann et al 2002 fennel and neumann 2014 and kerimoglu et al 2017 these parameters are listed in table 2 typically in lakes p n ratios of seston are highly variable and are lower than the redfield ratio for marine waters as phosphorus limitation of algal growth is stronger than nitrogen limitation healey and hendzel 1980 lakes with residence time greater than six months generally have p n 0 03 wetzel 2001 keeping all this in mind and after assessing performance of our hand tuned solutions we decided to fix p n of seston s r parameter in the model to a value of 0 02 2 5 3 optimization procedure in this study we adopted the optimization procedure of krishna et al 2019 we use functions from the r package fme soetaert et al 2010 to implement a two step optimization method that converges j t o t a l to its global minimum and yields us the corresponding parameter estimates θ o p t the first step is to hand tune the control parameters to obtain a model solution reference solution that gives a reasonably good agreement with the observed profiles of p p d i n and d i p the reference solution is provided as initial parameter values for the start of optimizations in the next step we apply a simulated annealing algorithm sann to perform stochastic search not using gradient information in the parameter space to find a solution in the vicinity of θ o p t bélisle 1992 this is done to avoid the algorithm getting trapped in the local minima of j t o t a l finally we apply the gradient based algorithm by broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 shanno 1970 to refine the model solution 3 results 3 1 measured temperatures and nutrient concentrations the measured epilimnion temperatures at shl2 in summer and autumn were higher in 2013 than 2012 fig 2 the maximum surface water temperature was 28 c in 2013 in august whereas for 2012 it was 23 c also the summer stratification was stronger in 2013 than 2012 these two years are interesting in terms of pp dynamics as in 2012 the maximum observed pp 140 mmol c m 3 d 1 was three times higher than the one for 2013 fig 2 in general din concentrations in the epilimnion and metalimnion were higher in 2013 than 2012 the average din concentration over the winter and early spring period was 40 mmol n m 3 in 2013 and 30 mmol n m 3 in 2012 fig 2 in contrast to din dip concentrations in the winter and spring of 2012 were higher than those in 2013 fig 2 3 2 phosphorus budgets for 2012 2013 the budgets of the bioavailable p for the two productive seasons of 2012 and 2013 are summarized in fig 3 as explained in the method section above we estimate the net p uptake as the net ecosystem production gross production minus respiration shown as the right bars in fig 3 by balancing the p input outflow and the stock difference between spring and autumn in the productive surface layer the bioavailable p input relevant for the primary production in lake geneva consists of i dip from the rhône river ii bioavailable p from all wwtps of the entire remaining catchment except those from the rhône river catchment that are already included in term i and finally iii all other bioavailable p from various sources the rhône river dip input is continuously monitored 6 km upstream of the lake in porte du scex by the swiss naduf program https www hydrodaten admin ch en 2009 html the dip annual inputs were 40 and 36 t p yr 1 for the years 2012 and 2013 respectively and were 29 and 26 t p during the seven months of the two productive seasons mid march to mid october of 2012 and 2013 respectively term ii the wwtp discharges contributed 34 and 35 t p during the productive seasons in 2012 and 2013 respectively in summary the first two monitored contributions of bioavailable p input results to 63 and 61 t p per productive season of 2012 and 2013 respectively the estimation of term iii via monitoring is almost impossible as this non point sources term consists of various contributions from agricultural land rain depositions and mineralization of flushed in allochthonous organic matter for this reason we use the lake overall p balance to estimate the annual p input and scale it using the water inflow to the seven months production period the annual p input is given by the sum of the p outflow 151 t p yr 1 in 2012 121 t p yr 1 in 2013 the net sedimentation 150 t p yr 1 equivalent to 11 g c m 2 yr 1 span et al 1990 loizeau et al 2012 and the decline of the p content 55 t p yr 1 calculated as the 5 year average müller et al 2019 this balance yields annual p inputs of 246 and 217 t p yr 1 for 2012 and 2013 respectively we feel comfortable with these estimates as they agree well with the linear p budget model müller et al 2019 2014 which would yield 228 and 215 t p yr 1 respectively and we consider the small discrepancies as well within the range of errors scaling to the seven productive months would lead to bioavailable p inputs of 168 and 146 t p for the two summers of 2012 and 2013 respectively the p net uptake during the productive season can now be calculated from the input 168 t p in 2012 and 146 t p in 2013 the spring to autumn stock difference in the productive layer 222 t p in 2012 and 118 in 2013 and the outflow 88 t p in 2012 and 71 t p in 2013 this leads to a p uptake of 302 and 193 t p in 2012 and 2013 which lets us expect a difference in net ecosystem production of 36 3 3 model data comparison from our da method we obtain an optimized set of parameters table 1 that simulates the observed pp and nutrient dynamics in 2012 although the value of r 3 m a x is higher than those listed in neumann 2000 and neumann et al 2002 it is well within the range of the maximum potential growth rates of cyanobacteria shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 lee et al 2018 furthermore we validate the model solution with the observations from 2013 3 3 1 temperature profiles by nuanced variations 10 in the scaling factors for wind and short wave radiation gotm parameters we obtain the simulated temperature profiles for both years that compare well to the observed ones fig 4 panels a and b also the summer stratification is well resolved by gotm the maximum epilimnion temperatures in 2012 and 2013 are similar at 20 c in late summer 3 3 2 nutrients and pp the observed and simulated din averaged over the top 20 m show good agreement fig 4 panels c and d although the model is calibrated only for 2012 the seasonal patterns of the observed din dynamics e g spring drawdown summer depletion and winter replenishment are well reproduced for both years however the model appears to be less sensitive in resolving the monthly variations both the model and observations show higher concentrations of din in 2013 than 2012 in general the model overestimates the observed dip in winter of both years fig 4 panels e and f however the time of dip depletion matches with the observations the model is also able to capture higher dip concentrations in 2012 than 2013 fig 5 shows simulated p and n limitation on phytoplankton growth in 2012 and 2013 the lower the value of the function black colours in fig 5 the lower the external concentration of the respective nutrient and the stronger its limitation on primary producers strikingly the period of p limitation is longer in 2013 than 2012 in other words our model suggests that dip remained depleted in the epilimnion from mid june to end of september in 2013 thereby limiting phytoplankton growth over a longer part of the productive period fig 6 panels a and b shows the simulated and observed pp averaged over the top 20 m of the water column there is a clear difference in the rates of pp between the two years the maximum rate of pp in 2012 is nearly three times higher than that of 2013 the estimate of integrated pp over the productive period in 2012 is 567 g c m 2 where as for 2013 it is 430 g c m 2 in 2012 a large contribution to the total pp comes from the summer bloom constituting mainly cyanobacteria as suggested by the model fig 6 panel c conversely in 2013 pp occurred mostly in spring dominated by diatoms 4 discussion 4 1 deep mixing event of 2012 february 2012 was characterized by a strong cooling event that lasted almost two weeks see the green shaded area in the estimated net surface heat flux shown in fig 7a during the first week of february the air temperature dropped significantly in a couple of days this abrupt atmospheric cooling led to a massive heat release from the lake s water towards the atmosphere reaching about q 0 650 w m 2 and drove a sharp increase of the deepening rate of the estimated sml h sml due to vigorous convection and entrainment of deep waters into the sml this process is shown in the time series of the sml thickness see blue triangles and green shaded area in fig 7b indeed during the first two weeks in february 2012 the sml deepened to almost 200 m the meteorological event was attributed to a cold wave associated with a large scale atmospheric disturbance connected to the artic oscillation that hit from east asia to western southern europe wmo rcc 2013 such an extreme event contrasts with the mild meteorological conditions registered in winter 2013 compare blue line with the red line in fig 7a schwefel et al 2019 proposed an empirical model to estimate the relative p flux into the epilimnion as a function of the surface mixed layer depth for lakes zug zürich geneva and tanganyika our results show that in the winter of 2012 sml deepened to 180 m which is about 60 of the maximum depth of lake geneva 309 m if we compare this to the model of schwefel et al 2019 it would correspond to 90 relative to its maximum p upwelling according to our p budgets based on observations 350 tons of tp have been transported to the epilimnion fig 3 which is 80 of the maximal p upwelling from the deeper layers of the lake in winter 2012 4 2 simulated temporal changes in phytoplankton the average phytoplankton biomass for epilimnion over the productive period in 2012 450 mg c m 3 is three times higher than the one for 2013 fig 6 panels c and d this could be because simulated nutrient limitation on growth of phytoplankton is weak in 2012 fig 5 furthermore there are significant differences in simulated dynamics of diatoms dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria between the years seasonal succession pattern of phytoplankton growth is clearly evident in 2012 our results show that dinoflagellate bloom occurs earlier in 2012 than 2013 to understand this we have to consider at first the timing of the onset of thermal stratification although the winter of 2012 is characterized by deep mixing events seasonal stratification arrives much earlier by april which indicates an increase in water temperature fig 7 as warm water stimulates the growth rate of dinoflagellates and also enables them to switch trophic strategy they may have dominated in summer 2012 wilken et al 2018 observed a faster increase in abundance of heterotrophic flagellates while decline in autotrophic biomass under the climate change scenario during spring according to the model a massive cyanobacteria bloom may have developed in late summer 2012 warm surface waters stratified conditions and abundant dip in the epilimnion could have elevated the growth rates of cyanobacteria modelling experiments of gray et al 2019 show that the increase in water temperature shallower mixed layer depth and meso eutrophic conditions result in higher biomass and dominance of cyanobacteria conversely in 2013 the simulated average concentrations of cyanobacteria in the epilimnion below 5 mg c m 3 are much lower than 2012 this is because dip gets depleted by early summer and consequently limiting the growth of phytoplankton however there is no significant difference in concentrations of diatoms between the years 4 3 model biases in general ergom underestimates carbon fixation by phytoplankton in the deeper epilimnion layers fig c 9 in appendix c this could be because of the dynamics of deep living phytoplankton e g planktothrix rubescens are not resolved by ergom it is to note that p rubescens are known to dwell close or below the thermocline and are tolerant to low light conditions kerimoglu et al 2017 furthermore the abundance of filamentous species like p rubescens has increased 2005 onwards in lake geneva anneville et al 2019 when we perform optimization the missing dynamics of deep phytoplankton is apparently compensated by introducing uncertainty in the estimate of r 3 m a x our results also reveal a few biases that may introduce uncertainties in the model solutions fig c 10 in appendix c shows the temporal evolution of the simulated and observed temperature values averaged over the layer between 20 to 50 m for both years the model underestimates the observed temperature by 1 2 c during late summer and autumn periods river intrusions have significant effect on physical and biological dynamics in lake geneva giovanoli 1990 loizeau and dominik 2000 as river water plunges into the lake it moves along the delta channel as buoyancy driven flows and perturbs the metalimnion temperature lambert and giovanoli 1988 wüest et al 1988 bouffard and perga 2016 performed a spatial sampling of lake geneva to study the effects of flood driven river intrusions on the temperature turbidity and oxygen gradients in the lake hypolimnion they found that the turbidity peak between 30 50 m associated to river inflow coincided with a peak in the temperature profile at shl2 station this indicates that the turbid layer in the metalimnion changes locally the density of the water and increases the temperature it is to note that our physical model do not include river intrusion this could be a possible explanation for the discrepancy in the observed and simulated temperature profiles in the metalimnion internal seiches in lake geneva is a known physical process imboden and wüest 1995 lemmin et al 2005 these are wind caused long standing waves strongly constrained by lake bathymetry and summer stratification they have modes of oscillation the positive phase is associated with shallowing of the thermocline and the negative phase with deepening of the stratified layer lemmin et al 2005 perroud et al 2009 applied different physical models to study multi annual thermal profiles in lake geneva and found that the models yield root mean square error value of 2 3 c in the layers with the greatest thermocline variability however the models that included a parameterization for internal seiche performed better than the ones without since the dynamics of internal seiches are not explicitly resolved by gotm this may contribute to uncertainty in the simulated deep epilimnion temperature profiles particularly after strong wind events in addition the temperature of the surface mixed layer can be affected by differential heating or cooling between the nearshore shallow regions and offshore interior waters this process could be particularly relevant in fall and winter periods during which the shallow regions cool faster than interior waters flushing cool waters towards the interior basin which is not accounted in a 1d model fer et al 2002 ulloa et al 2019 5 conclusion we have applied a coupled model system to investigate the differences in pp and nutrient dynamics in lake geneva for two consecutive years 2012 and 2012 according to the physical model the winter of 2012 particularly in february was exceptionally cold and it had triggered a deep convection in the lake that resulted in almost complete churning of the water column this has redistributed nutrients to the productive surface layers consequently throughout the production period dip replete conditions prevailed in 2012 and led to high algal biomass build up furthermore as water temperature increased in summer and autumn of 2012 abundances of dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria were stimulated conversely in 2013 there was a strong p limitation of phytoplankton growth and hence low biomass yield ergom suggests that as dip gets exhausted early in 2013 it may have limited the uptake of din by phytoplankton in the lake epilimnion in a nutshell an increase in tp by 52 in 2012 relative to 2013 due to deep mixing event has contributed to 32 higher pp in 2012 567 g c m 2 than 2013 430 g c m 2 to evaluate the model skills we calibrated it with the observations from 2012 and validated with those of 2013 we found that the model is quite robust in simulating pp phytoplankton growth and nutrient dynamics as long as we account for temporal changes in riverine dip and din fluxes however for more realistic modelling of pp in oligotrophic lakes we propose to resolve growth dynamics of deep dwelling phytoplankton e g planktothrix rubescens in biological models in addition changes in stoichiometry of seston with depth should also be considered in the model our study strengthens the utility of models to analyse and interpret field observations and highlights the significance of deep mixing events in driving pp in lakes under reoligotrophication as climate warming continues credit authorship contribution

24702,nutrient loading in combination with climate change are important drivers of primary productivity in lakes understanding and forecasting future changes in primary production pp in response to local and global forcing are major challenges for developing sustainable lake management the objective of this study is to understand and characterize the mechanisms underlying the large differences in observed pp rates and nutrient concentrations between two consecutive years 2012 and 2013 in lake geneva switzerland for this purpose we apply a one dimensional 1d physical biogeochemical model system the framework of aquatic biogeochemical models fabm interface is used to couple the general ocean turbulence model gotm with a biogeochemical model the ecological regional ocean model ergom we calibrated gotm by adjusting physical parameters with the observed temperature profiles a model calibration method is implemented to minimize model data misfits and to optimize the biological parameters related to phytoplankton growth dynamics according to our results the simulated surface mixed layer depth is deeper and heat loss from the lake and turbulent kinetic energy in the water column are much higher in winter 2012 than that in 2013 pointing to a cooling driven deep mixing in the lake in 2012 we found significant differences in internal phosphorus loads in the epilimnion between the two years with estimates for 2012 being higher than those for 2013 ergom predicts weak nutrient limitation on phytoplankton and higher growth rates in 2012 apparently the deep mixing event led to high turnover of nutrients particularly dissolved inorganic phosphate to the productive surface layers and a massive algal bloom developed later in the productive season in contrary the turnover of nutrients in 2013 was weak and consequently the pp was low our findings demonstrate the utility of a coupled physical biological model framework for the investigation of the meteorological and physical controls of pp dynamics in aquatic systems keywords nutrient carbon fixation phytoplankton classes coupled models colimitation deep mixing model calibration 1 introduction changes in nutrient loads and climate forcing perturb lake ecosystems on different temporal scales on the one hand studies have linked long term responses e g increase in thermal stratification and shifts in phytoplankton and zooplankton community structures to global warming and different trophic conditions magnuson et al 1990 watson et al 1997 livingstone 2003 austin and colman 2007 perroud et al 2009 anneville et al 2019 lepori 2019 on the other hand seasonal and inter annual variations in dynamics of physical and biogeochemical processes as well as rapid responses to extreme events are evident in lakes gächter et al 1974 yoshioka et al 1994 scheffer et al 2001 macintyre et al 2002 anneville et al 2004 perga et al 2018 while much focus is on investigation of long term changes in lakes it is important to study processes on seasonal and yearly scales as they provide insights on physical biological interactions that contribute to the internal variability of the systems furthermore to disentangle response signals to climate change it is critical to resolve the inherent uncertainties in lake dynamics vertical mixing in lakes is largely controlled by heat fluxes and wind imboden and wüest 1995 typically for temperate lakes deep mixing occurs in spring and fall and in summer they remain stratified the turnover of water masses has important consequences for the development of the trophic state of a lake as it influences the exchange of heat and matter between epilimnion metalimnion and hypolimnion michalski and lemmin 1995 vertical mixing is one of the important factors controlling pp in a lake as the supply and concentration of nutrients from the deeper parts to the epilimnion depends on mixing strength schwefel et al 2019 investigated the total phosphorus tp concentrations in the epilimnion of a meromictic alpine lake under present and future climate conditions their data show that tp transport from the deep hypolimnion by winter mixing can be the predominant source of tp in the lake epilimnion much higher than the contributions of nutrient inputs from catchments the mixing depth has stochastic control on pp because it changes with meteorological forcing lewis 2011 these changes can occur on yearly scale or can be long term straile et al 2010 studied the impact of the warm winter of 2006 2007 w06 07 on nutrient mixing dynamics and phytoplankton biomass in lake constance and compared it with the preceding cold winter of 2005 2005 w05 06 their analysis shows that the density gradient between upper warm and lower cold water layers was strong in w06 07 which prevented deep mixing and consequently the vertical transport of phosphorus to the upper water layers in years 2005 and 2006 exceptional deep mixing events stirred up and ventilated the entire water column in lake lugano leading to high pp holzner et al 2009 goldman et al 1989 studied yearly fluctuations in pp in the two temperate lakes castle and tahoe they found that pp patterns in lake castle are driven by large scale climate events e g el niño or southern oscillation and in lake tahoe by strong mixing in winter and spring as climate warming continues a reduction in the potential of vertical mixing has been reported for tropical lake tanganyika and thereby limiting the nutrient fluxes to the photic layers verburga and hecky 2009 lake geneva is a peri alpine lake which renders a variety of ecosystem services leisure fishing transportation etc to the region the lake has experienced severe eutrophication in the last century and slowly but steadily recovered from it significant efforts e g strict regulation were undertaken across switzerland and france since the 1970s to improve the trophic status of lakes and water quality jacquet et al 2014 although phosphorus concentrations in lake geneva have significantly decreased annual averages in the top 30 m in 1980 were 45 μ g l 1 compared to 5 μ g l 1 in 2015 due to successful point sources management anneville et al 2019 observed pp and total phytoplankton biomass remain high and strongly variable on inter annual and seasonal scales tadonléké et al 2009 these variations are underpinned by dynamic interactions between physical e g winter mixing and winds and ecological processes e g grazing pressure nutrient turnover remineralization etc in this study we apply a one dimensional 1d coupled model system to investigate variations in pp and nutrient dynamics in lake geneva between the two consecutive years 2012 and 2013 interestingly the maximum value of the observed pp in 2012 was three times higher than that of 2013 whereas dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip concentrations were higher and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentrations were lower in the lake epilimnion in 2012 compared to 2013 we seek to gain insights on the drivers e g winter mixing intensity and riverine inputs that could generate such changes in pp and nutrient dynamics to address this we designed a calibration method that provides the optimized estimates of eco physiological parameters for 2012 and then we validate the model against the observations from 2013 together with estimates of physical quantities and biological parameters we aim to understand how changes in deep mixing dynamics affect pp rates and nutrient concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and observations lake

have on pp rates a full budget of bioavailable phosphorus was conducted in the production zone for the two years considered in our study the net p u p t a k e supports the phytoplankton biomass production in the trophogenic layer of a lake it corresponds to the sum of all watershed contributions entering and leaving the system l i n l o u t with the net difference of p stock in the epilimnion before and after the production period this stock difference corresponds to the total mass of tp in the epilimnion after the winter mixing minus the remaining mass in autumn at the end of

model system to investigate changes in dynamics of lake processes such as winter mixing evolution of temperature profiles nutrient pp we use the fabm interface bruggeman and bolding 2014 to couple gotm burchard et al 2006 with ergom neumann et al 2002 2 4 1 physical model gotm is a 1d hydrostatic model for studying thermo hydrodynamic processes of marine and lake ecosystems it contains state of the art parameterizations for describing the vertical turbulent fluxes of heat and salinity the model is based on reynolds averaged navier stokes equations of momentum temperature and salinity burchard et al 2006 the temperature equation is given as 2 t t z w t z i κ 2 z 2 t where the coordinate z is taken to point upwards with the origin z 0 at the lake surface t is the temperature in units c the specific heat capacity c p and the molecular diffusivity of heat κ are given in units j kg 1 c 1 and m2 s 1 i q s w c p ρ 0 is the kinematic radiative flux at a given depth and time and has units c m s 1 it is to note that i z t in gotm is estimated from the surface irradiance i 0 attenuation lengths at the surface ξ 1 and over 10 40 m depth ξ 2 and depth d paulson and simpson 1977 3 i i 0 r exp d ξ 1 1 r exp d ξ 2 where r is a weighting parameter and the depth at which i becomes 10 of i 0 is assumed to be the secchi depth z s d in the model hence eq 3 becomes 4 0 1 r exp z s d ξ 1 1 r exp z s d ξ 2 we assume ξ 1 0 7 m as this value is representative for lake geneva and corresponds to the mean value of ξ 1 for jerlov water types ia and ib jerlov 2014 we substitute the value for ξ 1 and measurements of z s d obtained from shl2 station in eq 4 to get the estimates of ξ 2 the momentum and salinity equations are formulated equivalently and to avoid repetitions they are presented in appendices a 1 and a 2 in this study we have applied gotm 5 3 version available at https github com gotm model code a second order turbulent model has been considered for computing vertical turbulence fluxes umlauf and burchard 2005 and longwave back radiation is estimated by the method described in clark et al 1974 in addition the model grid resolution at the surface is higher grid zooming parameter ddu 3 than the bottom ddl 0 for calibration we adapt values for gotm parameters from their typical ranges listed in wüest and lorke 2003 for lakes in the next step we adjust scaling parameters for winds and short wave radiations to obtain good agreement with observed temperature profiles the detailed descriptions of gotm are given in burchard et al 2006 umlauf et al 2003 and umlauf and burchard 2003 2 4 2 characterizing lake thermal stratification using the cosmo data in situ data from lake geneva and the gotm model output we estimated the net heat flux for the years

wave radiation heat fluxes while q sw is the short wave radiation heat flux which penetrates across the water column in particular we denote the surface net heat flux as q t z 0 q 0 t gotm provides the evolution of the thermal structure in lake geneva based on the temperature field t and the salinity reference observed in lake geneva s 0 0 2 g l 1 we determined the density field using the equation of state ρ t s in millero and poisson 1981 the density distribution allowed estimation of the water stability 6 n 2 t z 1 ρ ρ z the position of the pycnocline z pyc corresponds to the depth of the maximum stability n max 2 for simplicity we defined the surface mixed layer sml as z pyc to avoid capturing the diurnal surface mixed layer imberger 1985 we look for n max 2 in 5 m depth 309 m the turbulent kinetic energy t k e is a physical quantity modelled by gotm the root mean square of the depth averaged t k e in the sml t k e provides a level of velocity fluctuations in the sml and a quantity to assess the energetic state of the water column to quantify the kinetic energy generated by cooling driven convection in the sml we estimated the convective velocity scale w c bouffard and wüest 2019 known as well as the deardorff scale deardorff 1970 7 w c z pyc b 0 1 3 where b 0 α g q 0 c p ρ 0 α the thermal expansion coefficient g the gravitational acceleration and ρ 0 the water reference density having t k e w c implies that convection is the dominant mechanism generating kinetic energy in the sml 2 4 3 biogeochemical model we apply the ecological model to simulate nutrient and phytoplankton growth dynamics in lake geneva although the model was originally developed for studying biogeochemistry in marine ecosystems its complexity in terms of trophic structure and the description of physio ecological processes make ergom applicable for lakes as well the model resolves growth dynamics of three functional groups of phytoplankton diatoms p 1 flagellates p 2 and cyanobacteria p 3 that account for nutrient and light limitations the nitrogen limitation n f for the uptake of d i n is described by a squared form of the michaelis menten function as it stabilizes the model solutions through reducing phytoplankton uptake at low nutrient concentrations neumann et al 2002 8 d i n a n 9 n f d i n 2 α n 2 d i n 2 where n and a are concentrations of nitrate and ammonium in units of mmol n m 3 and α n is the half saturation constant for nitrogen uptake in mmol n m 3 likewise the phosphorus limitation function p f is given as 10 p f d i p 2 α n 2 s r 2 d i p 2 where d i p is given in units of mmol p m 3 and s r is the p n ratio the model has adapted the light limitation l f parameterization from steele 1962 11 l f i p a r i o p t exp 1 i p a r i o p t which applies to all three phytoplankton groups here i p a r is the photosynthetically active radiation in units w m 2 and it is estimated from the surface irradiance i 0 z and the attenuation coefficients of water and planktonic particles k w and k c the light optimum i o p t is the maximum value between 50 of i 0 and the minimum irradiance i m i n in contrast to phytoplankton ergom includes one bulk formulation for zooplankton that represents all species of heterotrophs all dead particulate organic matter are accounted in bulk detritus the model also resolves consumption and production of oxygen in the water column and sediment dynamics explicitly the detailed first description of the model is given in neumann 2000 and neumann et al 2002 below we briefly summarize the source parameterizations for phytoplankton and zooplankton phytoplankton the total phytoplankton biomass is given by the sum of the concentrations of diatoms flagellates and cyanobacteria the growth rate of diatoms r 1 depends on n f p f and l f and is given as 12 r 1 r 1 m a x min n f p f l f where r 1 m a x is the maximum potential growth rate of diatoms in units d 1 the model considers smooth increase in the growth rate of flagellates r 2 with temperature in addition to dependencies on n f p f and l f 13 r 2 r 2 m a x t 2 t f 2 t 2 min n f p f l f where r 2 m a x is the maximum potential growth rate of flagellates in units d 1 t f and t are the half saturation temperature for flagellates and water temperature in c for cyanobacteria ergom assumes an exponential increase in the growth rate r 3 with temperature and no nitrogen limitation 14 r 3 r 3 m a x 1 1 exp β c y a t c y a t min p f l f where r 3 m a x is the maximum potential growth rate of cyanobacteria in d 1 t c y a and β c y a are the half saturation temperature for cyanobacteria and a temperature control parameter in units c and c 1 respectively zooplankton the grazing by bulk zooplankton g n on phytoplankton is described by the ivlev formulation ivlev 1966 and assumed to be dependent on temperature with lower preference for cyanobacteria 15 g n g n m a x 1 t 2 t o p t 2 exp 1 2 t t o p t 1 exp i i v l e v p s u m 2 where g n has units d 1 t o p t and p s u m are the optimal temperature for zooplankton and the total biomass of phytoplankton in units c and mmol c m 3 and i i v l e v is the ivlev constant the maximum grazing rates for phytoplankton are denoted as g n m a x in units d 1 with the assumption that the rates on diatoms and flagellates g 1 m a x g 2 m a x are higher than that on cyanobacteria g 1 m a x g 2 m a x g 3 m a x detritus the dead phytoplankton and zooplankton are accounted for in bulk detritus besides this the resuspended matter from sediments also becomes a part of detritus eq b 1 in appendix b

nutrient dynamics in the lake geneva it is critical that the model accounts for temporal variations in the riverine input loads this is particularly relevant for 2012 and 2013 because the observed monthly nutrient fluxes especially din from the rivers and tributaries are significantly different between the two years fig 1 our data assimilation da approach is to calibrate the model for 2012 and validate the optimized solution with the measurements of pp din and dip from 2013 while considering the observed monthly variations in the areal riverine influxes of din and dip in units mmol n m 2 d 1 and mmol p m 2 d 1 in the simulations the river fluxes are one of the source terms in the simulation of the state variables dip and din see eq b 5 to quantify the discrepancy between measurements and model outputs we designed a misfit cost function 2 5 1 cost function we implement a probabilistic based multi variate misfit function j t o t a l which is similar to that of schartau and oschlies 2003 on a given date the mean squared error mse is given as the square of the difference between the depth average value of an observed profile and the corresponding model output for a measurement type we consider three chi squared cost functions ward et al 2013 defined as sums of weighted mses to quantify the total temporal data model misfits in the lake epilimnion j e p i metalimnion j m e t and hypolimnion j h y p it is important to account for misfits in these layers of the water column individually because dynamics of physical and biogeochemical processes may vary between them particularly during the stratified period for any observation type the misfit costs in the three layers are given as 16 j e p i j 1 n j 1 σ e p i j 2 y e p i j x e p i j 2 17 j m e t j 1 n j 1 σ m e t j 2 y m e t j x m e t j 2 18 j h y p j 1 n j 1 σ h y p j 2 y h y p j x h y p j 2 where y e p i j y m e t j and y h y p j are the mean observations of epilimnion 0 to 10 m metalimnion 10 to 50 m and hypolimnion 50 m on a date j and x e p i j x m e t j and x h y p j are the equivalent model outputs likewise σ e p i σ m e t and σ h y p are the observed uncertainties standard deviations in epilimnion metalimnion and hypolimnion on a given date note j e p i j m e t and j h y p describe the conditional probability of explaining the observed data l i k e l i h o o d given model and its parameters and can be derived from their gaussian probability density functions using bayes theorem sivia and skilling 2006 three i 1 3 observation types d i n d i p p p are assimilated in the cost function and are assumed to be independent the overall misfit cost j t o t a l is given as the sum of j e p i j m e t and j h y p normalized to the number of observed profiles n i over the entire period for all three variables i 19 j t o t a l 1 3 i 1 3 1 n i j e p i i j m e t i j h y p i 2 5 2 parameter selection the selection of parameters for optimization is based on their relevance to pp and the degree of sensitivity of the results to the parameter values an ideal approach would be to assign the maximum growth rates parameters r 1 m a x r 2 m a x r 3 m a x the values identified in neumann 2000 for baltic sea and run the simulations for lake geneva we unsuccessfully tried this approach in the preceding test hand tuned simulations therefore we have decided to optimize r 1 m a x r 2 m a x r 3 m a x for the respective year and on purpose grant an extra degree of freedom to the model through a sensitivity analysis we found r i m a x l z d mortality rate of zooplankton l d a remineralization rate of detritus and w d sinking speed of detritus parameters to be critical in resolving nutrient dynamics hence we selected the above six physio ecological parameters also listed in table 1 other model parameters that are not subjected to optimization are assigned values that are identified in previous studies neumann 2000 neumann et al 2002 fennel and neumann 2014 and kerimoglu et al 2017 these parameters are listed in table 2 typically in lakes p n ratios of seston are highly variable and are lower than the redfield ratio for marine waters as phosphorus limitation of algal growth is stronger than nitrogen limitation healey and hendzel 1980 lakes with residence time greater than six months generally have p n 0 03 wetzel 2001 keeping all this in mind and after assessing performance of our hand tuned solutions we decided to fix p n of seston s r parameter in the model to a value of 0 02 2 5 3 optimization procedure in this study we adopted the optimization procedure of krishna et al 2019 we use functions from the r package fme soetaert et al 2010 to implement a two step optimization method that converges j t o t a l to its global minimum and yields us the corresponding parameter estimates θ o p t the first step is to hand tune the control parameters to obtain a model solution reference solution that gives a reasonably good agreement with the observed profiles of p p d i n and d i p the reference solution is provided as initial parameter values for the start of optimizations in the next step we apply a simulated annealing algorithm sann to perform stochastic search not using gradient information in the parameter space to find a solution in the vicinity of θ o p t bélisle 1992 this is done to avoid the algorithm getting trapped in the local minima of j t o t a l finally we apply the gradient based algorithm by broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 shanno 1970 to refine the model solution 3 results 3 1 measured temperatures and nutrient concentrations the measured epilimnion temperatures at shl2 in summer and autumn were higher in 2013 than 2012 fig 2 the maximum surface water temperature was 28 c in 2013 in august whereas for 2012 it was 23 c also the summer stratification was stronger in 2013 than 2012 these two years are interesting in terms of pp dynamics as in 2012 the maximum observed pp 140 mmol c m 3 d 1 was three times higher than the one for 2013 fig 2 in general din concentrations in the epilimnion and metalimnion were higher in 2013 than 2012 the average din concentration over the winter and early spring period was 40 mmol n m 3 in 2013 and 30 mmol n m 3 in 2012 fig 2 in contrast to din dip concentrations in the winter and spring of 2012 were higher than those in 2013 fig 2 3 2 phosphorus budgets for 2012 2013 the budgets of the bioavailable p for the two productive seasons of 2012 and 2013 are summarized in fig 3 as explained in the method section above we estimate the net p uptake as the net ecosystem production gross production minus respiration shown as the right bars in fig 3 by balancing the p input outflow and the stock difference between spring and autumn in the productive surface layer the bioavailable p input relevant for the primary production in lake geneva consists of i dip from the rhône river ii bioavailable p from all wwtps of the entire remaining catchment except those from the rhône river catchment that are already included in term i and finally iii all other bioavailable p from various sources the rhône river dip input is continuously monitored 6 km upstream of the lake in porte du scex by the swiss naduf program https www hydrodaten admin ch en 2009 html the dip annual inputs were 40 and 36 t p yr 1 for the years 2012 and 2013 respectively and were 29 and 26 t p during the seven months of the two productive seasons mid march to mid october of 2012 and 2013 respectively term ii the wwtp discharges contributed 34 and 35 t p during the productive seasons in 2012 and 2013 respectively in summary the first two monitored contributions of bioavailable p input results to 63 and 61 t p per productive season of 2012 and 2013 respectively the estimation of term iii via monitoring is almost impossible as this non point sources term consists of various contributions from agricultural land rain depositions and mineralization of flushed in allochthonous organic matter for this reason we use the lake overall p balance to estimate the annual p input and scale it using the water inflow to the seven months production period the annual p input is given by the sum of the p outflow 151 t p yr 1 in 2012 121 t p yr 1 in 2013 the net sedimentation 150 t p yr 1 equivalent to 11 g c m 2 yr 1 span et al 1990 loizeau et al 2012 and the decline of the p content 55 t p yr 1 calculated as the 5 year average müller et al 2019 this balance yields annual p inputs of 246 and 217 t p yr 1 for 2012 and 2013 respectively we feel comfortable with these estimates as they agree well with the linear p budget model müller et al 2019 2014 which would yield 228 and 215 t p yr 1 respectively and we consider the small discrepancies as well within the range of errors scaling to the seven productive months would lead to bioavailable p inputs of 168 and 146 t p for the two summers of 2012 and 2013 respectively the p net uptake during the productive season can now be calculated from the input 168 t p in 2012 and 146 t p in 2013 the spring to autumn stock difference in the productive layer 222 t p in 2012 and 118 in 2013 and the outflow 88 t p in 2012 and 71 t p in 2013 this leads to a p uptake of 302 and 193 t p in 2012 and 2013 which lets us expect a difference in net ecosystem production of 36 3 3 model data comparison from our da method we obtain an optimized set of parameters table 1 that simulates the observed pp and nutrient dynamics in 2012 although the value of r 3 m a x is higher than those listed in neumann 2000 and neumann et al 2002 it is well within the range of the maximum potential growth rates of cyanobacteria shimoda and arhonditsis 2016 lee et al 2018 furthermore we validate the model solution with the observations from 2013 3 3 1 temperature profiles by nuanced variations 10 in the scaling factors for wind and short wave radiation gotm parameters we obtain the simulated temperature profiles for both years that compare well to the observed ones fig 4 panels a and b also the summer stratification is well resolved by gotm the maximum epilimnion temperatures in 2012 and 2013 are similar at 20 c in late summer 3 3 2 nutrients and pp the observed and simulated din averaged over the top 20 m show good agreement fig 4 panels c and d although the model is calibrated only for 2012 the seasonal patterns of the observed din dynamics e g spring drawdown summer depletion and winter replenishment are well reproduced for both years however the model appears to be less sensitive in resolving the monthly variations both the model and observations show higher concentrations of din in 2013 than 2012 in general the model overestimates the observed dip in winter of both years fig 4 panels e and f however the time of dip depletion matches with the observations the model is also able to capture higher dip concentrations in 2012 than 2013 fig 5 shows simulated p and n limitation on phytoplankton growth in 2012 and 2013 the lower the value of the function black colours in fig 5 the lower the external concentration of the respective nutrient and the stronger its limitation on primary producers strikingly the period of p limitation is longer in 2013 than 2012 in other words our model suggests that dip remained depleted in the epilimnion from mid june to end of september in 2013 thereby limiting phytoplankton growth over a longer part of the productive period fig 6 panels a and b shows the simulated and observed pp averaged over the top 20 m of the water column there is a clear difference in the rates of pp between the two years the maximum rate of pp in 2012 is nearly three times higher than that of 2013 the estimate of integrated pp over the productive period in 2012 is 567 g c m 2 where as for 2013 it is 430 g c m 2 in 2012 a large contribution to the total pp comes from the summer bloom constituting mainly cyanobacteria as suggested by the model fig 6 panel c conversely in 2013 pp occurred mostly in spring dominated by diatoms 4 discussion 4 1 deep mixing event of 2012 february 2012 was characterized by a strong cooling event that lasted almost two weeks see the green shaded area in the estimated net surface heat flux shown in fig 7a during the first week of february the air temperature dropped significantly in a couple of days this abrupt atmospheric cooling led to a massive heat release from the lake s water towards the atmosphere reaching about q 0 650 w m 2 and drove a sharp increase of the deepening rate of the estimated sml h sml due to vigorous convection and entrainment of deep waters into the sml this process is shown in the time series of the sml thickness see blue triangles and green shaded area in fig 7b indeed during the first two weeks in february 2012 the sml deepened to almost 200 m the meteorological event was attributed to a cold wave associated with a large scale atmospheric disturbance connected to the artic oscillation that hit from east asia to western southern europe wmo rcc 2013 such an extreme event contrasts with the mild meteorological conditions registered in winter 2013 compare blue line with the red line in fig 7a schwefel et al 2019 proposed an empirical model to estimate the relative p flux into the epilimnion as a function of the surface mixed layer depth for lakes zug zürich geneva and tanganyika our results show that in the winter of 2012 sml deepened to 180 m which is about 60 of the maximum depth of lake geneva 309 m if we compare this to the model of schwefel et al 2019 it would correspond to 90 relative to its maximum p upwelling according to our p budgets based on observations 350 tons of tp have been transported to the epilimnion fig 3 which is 80 of the maximal p upwelling from the deeper layers of the lake in winter 2012 4 2 simulated temporal changes in phytoplankton the average phytoplankton biomass for epilimnion over the productive period in 2012 450 mg c m 3 is three times higher than the one for 2013 fig 6 panels c and d this could be because simulated nutrient limitation on growth of phytoplankton is weak in 2012 fig 5 furthermore there are significant differences in simulated dynamics of diatoms dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria between the years seasonal succession pattern of phytoplankton growth is clearly evident in 2012 our results show that dinoflagellate bloom occurs earlier in 2012 than 2013 to understand this we have to consider at first the timing of the onset of thermal stratification although the winter of 2012 is characterized by deep mixing events seasonal stratification arrives much earlier by april which indicates an increase in water temperature fig 7 as warm water stimulates the growth rate of dinoflagellates and also enables them to switch trophic strategy they may have dominated in summer 2012 wilken et al 2018 observed a faster increase in abundance of heterotrophic flagellates while decline in autotrophic biomass under the climate change scenario during spring according to the model a massive cyanobacteria bloom may have developed in late summer 2012 warm surface waters stratified conditions and abundant dip in the epilimnion could have elevated the growth rates of cyanobacteria modelling experiments of gray et al 2019 show that the increase in water temperature shallower mixed layer depth and meso eutrophic conditions result in higher biomass and dominance of cyanobacteria conversely in 2013 the simulated average concentrations of cyanobacteria in the epilimnion below 5 mg c m 3 are much lower than 2012 this is because dip gets depleted by early summer and consequently limiting the growth of phytoplankton however there is no significant difference in concentrations of diatoms between the years 4 3 model biases in general ergom underestimates carbon fixation by phytoplankton in the deeper epilimnion layers fig c 9 in appendix c this could be because of the dynamics of deep living phytoplankton e g planktothrix rubescens are not resolved by ergom it is to note that p rubescens are known to dwell close or below the thermocline and are tolerant to low light conditions kerimoglu et al 2017 furthermore the abundance of filamentous species like p rubescens has increased 2005 onwards in lake geneva anneville et al 2019 when we perform optimization the missing dynamics of deep phytoplankton is apparently compensated by introducing uncertainty in the estimate of r 3 m a x our results also reveal a few biases that may introduce uncertainties in the model solutions fig c 10 in appendix c shows the temporal evolution of the simulated and observed temperature values averaged over the layer between 20 to 50 m for both years the model underestimates the observed temperature by 1 2 c during late summer and autumn periods river intrusions have significant effect on physical and biological dynamics in lake geneva giovanoli 1990 loizeau and dominik 2000 as river water plunges into the lake it moves along the delta channel as buoyancy driven flows and perturbs the metalimnion temperature lambert and giovanoli 1988 wüest et al 1988 bouffard and perga 2016 performed a spatial sampling of lake geneva to study the effects of flood driven river intrusions on the temperature turbidity and oxygen gradients in the lake hypolimnion they found that the turbidity peak between 30 50 m associated to river inflow coincided with a peak in the temperature profile at shl2 station this indicates that the turbid layer in the metalimnion changes locally the density of the water and increases the temperature it is to note that our physical model do not include river intrusion this could be a possible explanation for the discrepancy in the observed and simulated temperature profiles in the metalimnion internal seiches in lake geneva is a known physical process imboden and wüest 1995 lemmin et al 2005 these are wind caused long standing waves strongly constrained by lake bathymetry and summer stratification they have modes of oscillation the positive phase is associated with shallowing of the thermocline and the negative phase with deepening of the stratified layer lemmin et al 2005 perroud et al 2009 applied different physical models to study multi annual thermal profiles in lake geneva and found that the models yield root mean square error value of 2 3 c in the layers with the greatest thermocline variability however the models that included a parameterization for internal seiche performed better than the ones without since the dynamics of internal seiches are not explicitly resolved by gotm this may contribute to uncertainty in the simulated deep epilimnion temperature profiles particularly after strong wind events in addition the temperature of the surface mixed layer can be affected by differential heating or cooling between the nearshore shallow regions and offshore interior waters this process could be particularly relevant in fall and winter periods during which the shallow regions cool faster than interior waters flushing cool waters towards the interior basin which is not accounted in a 1d model fer et al 2002 ulloa et al 2019 5 conclusion we have applied a coupled model system to investigate the differences in pp and nutrient dynamics in lake geneva for two consecutive years 2012 and 2012 according to the physical model the winter of 2012 particularly in february was exceptionally cold and it had triggered a deep convection in the lake that resulted in almost complete churning of the water column this has redistributed nutrients to the productive surface layers consequently throughout the production period dip replete conditions prevailed in 2012 and led to high algal biomass build up furthermore as water temperature increased in summer and autumn of 2012 abundances of dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria were stimulated conversely in 2013 there was a strong p limitation of phytoplankton growth and hence low biomass yield ergom suggests that as dip gets exhausted early in 2013 it may have limited the uptake of din by phytoplankton in the lake epilimnion in a nutshell an increase in tp by 52 in 2012 relative to 2013 due to deep mixing event has contributed to 32 higher pp in 2012 567 g c m 2 than 2013 430 g c m 2 to evaluate the model skills we calibrated it with the observations from 2012 and validated with those of 2013 we found that the model is quite robust in simulating pp phytoplankton growth and nutrient dynamics as long as we account for temporal changes in riverine dip and din fluxes however for more realistic modelling of pp in oligotrophic lakes we propose to resolve growth dynamics of deep dwelling phytoplankton e g planktothrix rubescens in biological models in addition changes in stoichiometry of seston with depth should also be considered in the model our study strengthens the utility of models to analyse and interpret field observations and highlights the significance of deep mixing events in driving pp in lakes under reoligotrophication as climate warming continues credit authorship contribution

24703,contrasting reductionistic versus holistic views it is a general question whether adding the parts equals the sum in the time of multiple drivers of anthropogenic change it is a crucial issue and better understanding additivity is critical for strategy and management more particular research questions ask what are the community effects of the extinction of a single species and whether multiple local effects on different species will generate additive community responses here we perform food web simulations and study the community response to perturbing each species one by one and perturbing each possible pairwise combination of species by comparing the two we quantify additivity and analyze how does it depend on the topological positions of perturbed species pairs results increase the predictability of food web research supporting systems based conservation management and possibly multi species maximum sustainable yield assessment in fisheries keywords food web simulation perturbation sensitivity analysis community response additivity 1 introduction in natural ecosystems various species are interconnected by a multiplicity of inter specific interactions in multi species ecological communities the perturbation of any species has direct and indirect effects on all of the others some species are better connected and indirect chain effects can spread in more directions while others are peripheric their perturbations cascade less easily across the food web it is an old question how to better understand dynamical effects based on simple topological information i e how to link structure to dynamics see pimm 1980 jordán et al 2002 2008 endrédi et al 2018 hansen et al 2019 to establish this link is not straightforward yet perturbing a single species is a major simplification during either climate change or fisheries several species are perturbed and a new question emerges are these effects additive determining the community responses of perturbing species i and j separately may not help to predict the community response of their pairwise perturbation beyond theoretical investigations also experimental results suggest high selectivity of effects the poor predictability of community response and the mutual dependence of effects on various species and interactions breitburg et al 1997 indirect effects spreading in food webs and their effects on dynamical behavior are key issues to study in a network context brose et al 2005 borrett 2013 lau et al 2017 cirtwill et al 2018 this issue was raised in a surprisingly few papers for several reasons the difference and the relationship between short term and long term effects is hard to understand so community response itself is not easy to quantify and predict yodzis 1988 this is true for single species effects and even harder for multi species scenarios see yodzis 2000 as an example for maximum sustainable yield estimations in multi species context the complications have been richly discussed may et al 1979 legovic and gecek 2010 legovic et al 2010 2012 following a simple pilot study on this issue focusing on a single network móréh et al 2018 here we scale up that previous analysis by dramatically increasing the number of food webs and enriching the analysis in this paper we study a large number of model food webs 1 we quantify the topological importance of particular species and their pairs 2 we define community dynamics and perform food web simulations 3 we quantify community response for single species and pairwise perturbations 4 we quantify the level of additivity and 5 we analyze which topological combinations of perturbed species pairs lead to additive or non additive community responses the main question to understand if central network position generates larger dynamical effects and if network position has an effect on the additivity of pairwise perturbations 2 methods 2 1 networks dynamical simulations and perturbations the whole process of the preparatory work generating proper networks simulating their dynamics and the systematic perturbations of consumers and their pairs is summarized in fig 1 2 1 1 random networks the investigated networks were created randomly by fixing the total number of species nodes s 15 and the number of basal species sb 3 the links between the nodes were drawn randomly taking some restrictions into account i consumers can consume only from lower levels cannibalism and loops are excluded ii we defined the maximum number of trophic levels maxtl 4 and top predators maxtop 3 iii the number of trophic links was constant nl 36 thus connectance c nl s2 0 16 and iv the graph was connected i e composed of a single component if a randomly created network did not meet these requirements it was rejected the suitable ones were used in dynamical simulations these topological features are based on observations in a real food web lin et al 2004 jordán et al 2009 and are used in an earlier pilot study móréh et al 2018 making the results comparable with those ones 2 1 2 dynamical simulations the dynamical behavior of the webs followed an earlier model móréh et al 2018 a system of odes describes the dynamics of each species in the webs as follows d b i d t r i b i 1 b i k i ρ r e s ε i ρ b i b ρ h ω i ρ b 0 h ω i ρ b ρ h c c o n s ε c i b c b i h ω c i b 0 h ω c i b i h d i b i where bi refers to the biomass of species i the basal i 3 species increase is described by the logistic growth model where ki and ri are the carrying capacity and the intrinsic growth rate respectively the consumption of the consumers is characterized by a holling type iii functional response where b0 refers to the half saturation density the relative consumption rates ωiρ are set to be inversely proportional to the number of resources ωiρ 1 ni where n refers to the number of prey species of i the increase and decrease of the biomass of the consumer species i 3 depend only on the strength of their own and their predators consumption ri 0 and the external mortality rate di our aim was to focus on the impact of network topology on dynamics thus we did not model explicitly the conversion and consumption rates but the strength of a predator prey link ε was assumed inversely proportional to the number of its prey εci εpi 1 ni for the sake of the same cause the parameters were fixed h 2 b0 0 5 rbasals kbasals 1 dconsumers 0 1 only the different distributions of the links between the nodes determine the topology as well as the system s dynamics in the course of network composition not only the structural features mentioned above but also the dynamical stability was an important criterion it is meant by the coexistence of all the 15 species on the one hand but on the other hand we had required the network s robustness against perturbations affecting single species or their pairs see below thus we integrated the system hindmarsh et al 2005 until it settled to a fixed point if any of the species were extinct the integration was terminated and the network adjacency matrix was neglected all initial biomass values were set to 1 and the system was integrated over t 20 000 time steps if the abundance of any species decreased below the threshold of 10 6 we considered it to be extinct and the integration was terminated if all species reached a fixed point and coexisted we made a preliminary stability analysis by arbitrary changing the biomass values of all species pulse perturbation 2 1 3 perturbation after the system returned to the original equilibrium after this pulse perturbation event meaning local stability we made a systematic perturbation process on all consumers the producers were part of the dynamical system but their community effects were not evaluated in practice we simulated the external perturbations by changing the mortality rate di of the species in question increasing it by 10 this analysis can be considered as a press perturbation experiment sensu bender et al 1984 following the single species perturbations 12 per web we perturbed the mortality rates of the consumers in all possible pairwise combinations 12 11 2 66 per web as well in that case the perturbations of species i and j were parallel in time and were of equal strength 10 increase of di and dj if the system is robust against all perturbation events no extinction happens we use the adjacency matrix of the network and also the biomass values before and after perturbation see fig 1 we run this process until collecting 1000 proper networks fulfilling all structural and dynamical criteria using the adjacency matrices of the networks we i calculated several structural indices of the consumers ii categorised all species pairs based on the interspecific interactions between them with the help of the biomass values of each species registered before and after perturbation we calculated the i community response values caused by the species pairs and ii the measure of additivity of the single species perturbations see details below 2 2 structural network indices in order to quantify the position of individual species in food webs we calculated several structural network indices the calculated indices are collected in table 1 here we give a short summary of their most important features for more detailed descriptions see references in table 1 2 2 1 centrality indices d wd bc cc the degree di of a species is the number of other nodes connected directly to it thus in other words the sum of its predators and preys if a network is weighted the weighted degree wdi is the sum of the weights of the links adjacent to the species in question these are the most local network index not considering indirect effects spreading in the web betweenness centrality bci is a measure of positional importance it quantifies how frequently is a node i on the shortest path between every other node pairs j and k this index measures the centrality of a node in the sense of being an element of many shortest paths in the web if it is large for a group it means that if we delete this group it will more affect many rapidly spreading effects in the network the other centrality index we used closeness centrality cci quantifies how short are the minimal paths from a given node to all others or in other words how close a node is to others larger cci values means that deleting node i will affect the majority of other nodes more directly 2 2 2 positional importance based on indirect chain effects tit wit trophic effects can spread in a network assumed with undirected links in many directions without bias indirect effects do spread in both top down and bottom up directions and as a result horizontally too considering either binary or weighted networks indirect chain effects up to a t threshold maximum indirect chain length can be expressed by tit and wit respectively see jordán et al 2003 we considered various interaction ranges t 1 3 5 2 2 3 status indices and its components s s s these indices have been introduced in sociometry harary 1959 and applied soon to ecological problems too harary 1961 the status s of node i is the sum of its dij distance values to all other j nodes in the web the contra status s is the same calculated after reversing the sign of all links in the graph the net status s is the difference of the two former indices 2 2 4 keystone index and its components k kbu ktd kdir kindir while the degree d of a node gives only the number of its connected nodes thus its neighbours the keystone index gives information also on how these neighbours are connected to their neighbours since it separates indirect from direct k kindir kdir as well as top down from bottom up k ktd kbu effects in food webs it quantifies only vertical interactions like trophic cascades without considering horizontal ones apparent competition 2 3 classification of node pairs while centrality indices quantify the position of single nodes in a network the position of node pairs can be characterized in two ways first the ecological relationship between species belongs to five categories 1 predator prey interaction 2 intra guild predation 3 trophic cascade interaction 4 exploitative competition 5 none of the above fig 2 second the combinations of single node topological indices their average and difference characterize the positional importance of the species pair for example if there are two poorly connected nodes i and j their pair is characterized by the combination of low average and small difference of degree values 2 4 community response cr and the measure of non additivity na the effects of species extinctions may be highly selective ives and cardinale 2004 so we decided to perturb each consumer non producer species in the dynamical model one by one then each pair of consumer species one by one we are interested in the effect of these perturbations on the whole ecosystem perturbation effects cascade in the interaction network provoking answers in the remaining n 1 single species or n 2 pairwise species of the community the community response cr to the perturbation of species i or the ij pair of species cri or crij can be determined as the sum of these answers pairwise perturbations were performed in parallel so we did not consider studying the effect of synchrony vasseur and fox 2007 for determining the response of a community to any kind of perturbations more different approaches i e formulas exist and are used in parallel paine 1992 power et al 1996 hurlbert 1997 okey 2004 livi et al 2011 based on móréh and jordán 2019 where the different formulas are collected and compared we decided to take neither the sign of changes nor self loops into account we use the absolute value of the differences between the species biomass values from 1 all in all the community response to the single species perturbation on species i is c r i k 1 n b k a f t b k b e f 1 k i while in the pairwise case the parallel perturbation of species i and j frames this formula into the following c r i j k 1 n b k a f t b k b e f 1 k i j where n 15 we do not perturb basal species but also these respond to the perturbations of consumer species bk bef and bk aft are the biomass values of the species in the equilibrium states before and after the perturbation events respectively note that we do not take into account the self effect the change of biomass of the perturbed species itself by comparing the effects of single species and pairwise perturbations by the formula n a i j c r i c r j c r i j we can quantify the measure of non additivity of the perturbing species i and j in parallel the smaller the values of naij the larger the measure of additivity we consider the effects non additive if the small effects of the single species perturbations are escalated or the large effects are dampened in the pairwise cases for making the results more interpretable we expressed na in percentages n a i j n a i j m 1 66 n a i j 100 i j and j i where m refers to the 66 consumer pairs in each network i and j 3 i j and j i 3 results 3 1 correlations of network indices and single species community response the correlation coefficients spearman s ρ between community importance quantified by the various network indices and community importance quantified by the effects of single species perturbations are given in table 2 we were interested in only the strength of correlations ρ we did not take the sign of the correlations into account we considered a connection stronger if ρ 0 5 the wd and wit indices the status indices and the kbu and ktd indices of the perturbed species correlate strongly ρ 0 5 with community response this is in agreement with earlier results jordán et al 2008 suggesting that indices sensitive to indirect effects should be calculated in weighted networks in order to maximize predictability between structure and dynamics we considered as much as 18 centrality indices but there exist many more for example also throughflow centrality borrett 2013 would probably give results similar to wd 3 2 the measure of non additivity the frequency distribution of the na values fig 3 b is unimodal strongly right skewed distribution the most frequent value of the deviation of na values from zero is about 1 this means that highly non additive pairwise effects are rare this is understandable if we take into account the small original value of the perturbed di the small intensity of perturbations 10 of di small changes result in mainly additive results the summed community responses to perturbing species i and j do not necessarily predict the community response to ij perturbations these are the less additive cases in fig 3a we can see how pairwise effects and single effects are related to each other on the y axis we denote the pairwise community response values crij while on the x axis we can see the sum of the single species community response values cri crj it can be seen that the dots are either on the x y line additive effects or below it dampening effects it is quite exceptional to see dots above the line escalating effects note that taking the sign of each biomass changes into account in the course of calculating the cr values the frequencies of non additive dampening and escalating effects are similar for more details see móréh and jordán 2019 nevertheless we used the formula without the sign of changes because its correlation is higher with some the structural indices than the formulas taking the sign into account móréh and jordán 2019 thus in this study we did not deal with the escalating or dampening effects separately we investigated only the possible relationships between the measure of non additivity and the topological features of species pairs 3 3 the topological background of non additivity fig 3b shows that the frequency distribution of na values is strongly right skewed meaning that results with smaller non additivity are more frequent to investigate the proportions of non additive effects in different node pair categories fig 2 we created smaller ranges according to the na values the definition of range borders considered the frequency distribution of na values ranges are more narrow for more frequent na values in order to increase the resolution of the plot we show the proportions of the five node pair categories in the total of 66 000 results fig 4 a and related to only each other fig 4b curves in figs 3b and 4a suggest that non additivity distributions largely follow the pattern for the whole set of node pairs but the relative frequency of node pair categories changes within the ranges fig 4b the proportions of the prey predator relationship pp and exploitative competition exc are increasing while it is decreasing for trophic cascade trc and no effect no for intra guild predation igp it is low and slowly increases this means that perturbing a prey and a predator or two competitors will probably result in less additive effects considering topological positions of species pairs we used the average and the difference of their centrality indices for the 66 000 simulated species pairs after finding the minimum and maximum of average and difference values we created 50 categories between them thus we got an 50 50 matrix with 2500 possible categories for each index we calculated in all these categories the median of na values because it is less sensitive to the extreme values than the mean of course there were empty categories the results are demonstrated in heat maps corresponding the certain indices fig 5 there are visible trends in case of wd the keystone the status and wi indices note that these indices have stronger correlation in the pairwise case for the wd kbu s s and wit indices community responses are less additive if both the average and the difference are small small and similar index values for the ktd kdir kindir k and s indices the crs of single species indices are less additive if the averages of these indices are higher in these case the differences of the indices less matter 4 conclusions our results reinforce earlier findings suggesting that weighting trophic interactions is crucial for higher correlations between structure and dynamics jordán et al 2008 zhao et al 2016 as table 2 shows the highest correlations are all found for weighted structural indices wd wit while the lowest correlations characterize binary ones d cc tit bc interestingly the strongest correlation among the weighted indices is seen for the direct wd index but for the indirect indices the longer the better one compare wi5 wi3 and wi1 based on pairwise combinations of perturbed species fig 4 shows that their topological position clearly influences whether their combined effect is additive this might have implications for fisheries management or systems based conservation management perturbing species at different trophic level has been suggested to result in non additive effects both dampening and escalation hansen et al 2019 since various centrality indices show different and typically not very strong correlations between structure and dynamics there is need to combine a small but efficiently chosen set of centrality indices in order to maximize the predictability gouveia et al 2020 submitted better understanding the limits of predictability will contribute to more applicable food web research in case of conflicting single species conservation programs or multi species fishing efforts food web analysis can help to assess the chance for additive predictable management in an optimal case wisely selected pairs of species can be chosen for management if their food web topology supports additivity the higher predictability is advantageous for strategic planning if non additive effects are expected either dampening or escalating outcomes can be used strategically for example dampening may mean that two overfished stocks can partly balancing each other s negative effects and escalation may mean the mutually higher success of two parallel single species conservation efforts the philosophical implications are clear calculating community response with using absolute values means that we prefer small effects even if negative thus we do not want to make an impact on nature instead focusing on the signed effect means that we prefer positive effects even if small thus we want to help nature accordingly the preferred response function can be used credit author

24703,contrasting reductionistic versus holistic views it is a general question whether adding the parts equals the sum in the time of multiple drivers of anthropogenic change it is a crucial issue and better understanding additivity is critical for strategy and management more particular research questions ask what are the community effects of the extinction of a single species and whether multiple local effects on different species will generate additive community responses here we perform food web simulations and study the community response to perturbing each species one by one and perturbing each possible pairwise combination of species by comparing the two we quantify additivity and analyze how does it depend on the topological positions of perturbed species pairs results increase the predictability of food web research supporting systems based conservation management and possibly multi species maximum sustainable yield assessment in fisheries keywords food web simulation perturbation sensitivity analysis community response additivity 1 introduction in natural ecosystems various species are interconnected by a multiplicity of inter specific interactions in multi species ecological communities the perturbation of any species has direct and indirect effects on all of the others some species are better connected and indirect chain effects can spread in more directions while others are peripheric their perturbations cascade less easily across the food web it is an old question how to better understand dynamical effects based on simple topological information i e how to link structure to dynamics see pimm 1980 jordán et al 2002 2008 endrédi et al 2018 hansen et al 2019 to establish this link is not straightforward yet perturbing a single species is a major simplification during either climate change or fisheries several species are perturbed and a new question emerges are these effects additive determining the community responses of perturbing species i and j separately may not help to predict the community response of their pairwise perturbation beyond theoretical investigations also experimental results suggest high selectivity of effects the poor predictability of community response and the mutual dependence of effects on various species and interactions breitburg et al 1997 indirect effects spreading in food webs and their effects on dynamical behavior are key issues to study in a network context brose et al 2005 borrett 2013 lau et al 2017 cirtwill et al 2018 this issue was raised in a surprisingly few papers for several reasons the difference and the relationship between short term and long term effects is hard to understand so community response itself is not easy to quantify and predict yodzis 1988 this is true for single species effects and even harder for multi species scenarios see yodzis 2000 as an example for maximum sustainable yield estimations in multi species context the complications have been richly discussed may et al 1979 legovic and gecek 2010 legovic et al 2010 2012 following a simple pilot study on this issue focusing on a single network móréh et al 2018 here we scale up that previous analysis by dramatically increasing the number of food webs and enriching the analysis in this paper we study a large number of model food webs 1 we quantify the topological importance of particular species and their pairs 2 we define community dynamics and perform food web simulations 3 we quantify community response for single species and pairwise perturbations 4 we quantify the level of additivity and 5 we analyze which topological combinations of perturbed species pairs lead to additive or non additive community responses the main question to understand if central network position generates larger dynamical effects and if network position has an effect on the additivity of pairwise perturbations 2 methods 2 1 networks dynamical simulations and perturbations the whole process of the preparatory work generating proper networks simulating their dynamics and the systematic perturbations of consumers and their pairs is summarized in fig 1 2 1 1 random networks the investigated networks were created randomly by fixing the total number of species nodes s 15 and the number of basal species sb 3 the links between the nodes were drawn randomly taking some restrictions into account i consumers can consume only from lower levels cannibalism and loops are excluded ii we defined the maximum number of trophic levels maxtl 4 and top predators maxtop 3 iii the number of trophic links was constant nl 36 thus connectance c nl s2 0 16 and iv the graph was connected i e composed of a single component if a randomly created network did not meet these requirements it was rejected the suitable ones were used in dynamical simulations these topological features are based on observations in a real food web lin et al 2004 jordán et al 2009 and are used in an earlier pilot study móréh et al 2018 making the results comparable with those ones 2 1 2 dynamical simulations the dynamical behavior of the webs followed an earlier model móréh et al 2018 a system of odes describes the dynamics of each species in the webs as follows d b i d t r i b i 1 b i k i ρ r e s ε i ρ b i b ρ h ω i ρ b 0 h ω i ρ b ρ h c c o n s ε c i b c b i h ω c i b 0 h ω c i b i h d i b i where bi refers to the biomass of species i the basal i 3 species increase is described by the logistic growth model where ki and ri are the carrying capacity and the intrinsic growth rate respectively the consumption of the consumers is characterized by a holling type iii functional response where b0 refers to the half saturation density the relative consumption rates ωiρ are set to be inversely proportional to the number of resources ωiρ 1 ni where n refers to the number of prey species of i the increase and decrease of the biomass of the consumer species i 3 depend only on the strength of their own and their predators consumption ri 0 and the external mortality rate di our aim was to focus on the impact of network topology on dynamics thus we did not model explicitly the conversion and consumption rates but the strength of a predator prey link ε was assumed inversely proportional to the number of its prey εci εpi 1 ni for the sake of the same cause the parameters were fixed h 2 b0 0 5 rbasals kbasals 1 dconsumers 0 1 only the different distributions of the links between the nodes determine the topology as well as the system s dynamics in the course of network composition not only the structural features mentioned above but also the dynamical stability was an important criterion it is meant by the coexistence of all the 15 species on the one hand but on the other hand we had required the network s robustness against perturbations affecting single species or their pairs see below thus we integrated the system hindmarsh et al 2005 until it settled to a fixed point if any of the species were extinct the integration was terminated and the network adjacency matrix was neglected all initial biomass values were set to 1 and the system was integrated over t 20 000 time steps if the abundance of any species decreased below the threshold of 10 6 we considered it to be extinct and the integration was terminated if all species reached a fixed point and coexisted we made a preliminary stability analysis by arbitrary changing the biomass values of all species pulse perturbation 2 1 3 perturbation after the system returned to the original equilibrium after this pulse perturbation event meaning local stability we made a systematic perturbation process on all consumers the producers were part of the dynamical system but their community effects were not evaluated in practice we simulated the external perturbations by changing the mortality rate di of the species in question increasing it by 10 this analysis can be considered as a press perturbation experiment sensu bender et al 1984 following the single species perturbations 12 per web we perturbed the mortality rates of the consumers in all possible pairwise combinations 12 11 2 66 per web as well in that case the perturbations of species i and j were parallel in time and were of equal strength 10 increase of di and dj if the system is robust against all perturbation events no extinction happens we use the adjacency matrix of the network and also the biomass values before and after perturbation see fig 1 we run this process until collecting 1000 proper networks fulfilling all structural and dynamical criteria using the adjacency matrices of the networks we i calculated several structural indices of the consumers ii categorised all species pairs based on the interspecific interactions between them with the help of the biomass values of each species registered before and after perturbation we calculated the i community response values caused by the species pairs and ii the measure of additivity of the single species perturbations see details below 2 2 structural network indices in order to quantify the position of individual species in food webs we calculated several structural network indices the calculated indices are collected in table 1 here we give a short summary of their most important features for more detailed descriptions see references in table 1 2 2 1 centrality indices d wd bc cc the degree di of a species is the number of other nodes connected directly to it thus in other words the sum of its predators and preys if a network is weighted the weighted degree wdi is the sum of the weights of the links adjacent to the species in question these are the most local network index not considering indirect effects spreading in the web betweenness centrality bci is a measure of positional importance it quantifies how frequently is a node i on the shortest path between every other node pairs j and k this index measures the centrality of a node in the sense of being an element of many shortest paths in the web if it is large for a group it means that if we delete this group it will more affect many rapidly spreading effects in the network the other centrality index we used closeness centrality cci quantifies how short are the minimal paths from a given node to all others or in other words how close a node is to others larger cci values means that deleting node i will affect the majority of other nodes more directly 2 2 2 positional importance based on indirect chain effects tit wit trophic effects can spread in a network assumed with undirected links in many directions without bias indirect effects do spread in both top down and bottom up directions and as a result horizontally too considering either binary or weighted networks indirect chain effects up to a t threshold maximum indirect chain length can be expressed by tit and wit respectively see jordán et al 2003 we considered various interaction ranges t 1 3 5 2 2 3 status indices and its components s s s these indices have been introduced in sociometry harary 1959 and applied soon to ecological problems too harary 1961 the status s of node i is the sum of its dij distance values to all other j nodes in the web the contra status s is the same calculated after reversing the sign of all links in the graph the net status s is the difference of the two former indices 2 2 4 keystone index and its components k kbu ktd kdir kindir while the degree d of a node gives only the number of its connected nodes thus its neighbours the keystone index gives information also on how these neighbours are connected to their neighbours since it separates indirect from direct k kindir kdir as well as top down from bottom up k ktd kbu effects in food webs it quantifies only vertical interactions like trophic cascades without considering horizontal ones apparent competition 2 3 classification of node pairs while centrality indices quantify the position of single nodes in a network the position of node pairs can be characterized in two ways first the ecological relationship between species belongs to five categories 1 predator prey interaction 2 intra guild predation 3 trophic cascade interaction 4 exploitative competition 5 none of the above fig 2 second the combinations of single node topological indices their average and difference characterize the positional importance of the species pair for example if there are two poorly connected nodes i and j their pair is characterized by the combination of low average and small difference of degree values 2 4 community response cr and the measure of non additivity na the effects of species extinctions may be highly selective ives and cardinale 2004 so we decided to perturb each consumer non producer species in the dynamical model one by one then each pair of consumer species one by one we are interested in the effect of these perturbations on the whole ecosystem perturbation effects cascade in the interaction network provoking answers in the remaining n 1 single species or n 2 pairwise species of the community the community response cr to the perturbation of species i or the ij pair of species cri or crij can be determined as the sum of these answers pairwise perturbations were performed in parallel so we did not consider studying the effect of synchrony

the absolute value of the differences between the species biomass values from 1 all in all the community response to the single species perturbation on species i is c r i k 1 n b k a f t b k b e f 1 k i while in the pairwise case the parallel perturbation of species i and j frames this formula into the following c r i j k 1 n b k a f t b k b e f 1 k i j where n 15 we do not perturb basal species but also these respond to the perturbations of consumer species bk bef and bk aft are the biomass values of the species in the equilibrium states before and after the perturbation events respectively note that we do not take into account the self effect the change of biomass of the perturbed species itself by comparing the effects of single species and pairwise perturbations by the formula n a i j c r i c r j c r i j we can quantify the measure of non additivity of the perturbing species i and j in parallel the smaller the values of naij the larger the measure of additivity we consider the effects non additive if the small effects of the single species perturbations are escalated or the large effects are dampened in the pairwise cases for making the results more interpretable we expressed na in percentages n a i j n a i j m 1 66 n a i j 100 i j and j i where m refers to the 66 consumer pairs in each network i and j 3 i j and j i 3 results 3 1 correlations of network indices

24704,self organization is a process of establishing and reinforcing local structures through feedbacks between internal population dynamics and external factors in reef building systems substrate is collectively engineered by individuals that also occupy it and compete for space reefs are constrained spatially by the physical environment and by mortality which reduces production but exposes substrate for recruits reef self organization therefore depends on efficient balancing of production and occupancy of substrate to examine this we develop a three dimensional individual based model ibm of oyster reef mechanics shell substrate is grown by individuals as valves accumulates at the reef level and degrades following mortality single restoration events and subsequent dynamics are simulated for a case study in south carolina usa variability in model processes is included on recruitment spatial environmental constraints and predation over multiple independent runs and five predator community scenarios the main goal for this study is to summarize trends in dynamics that are robust across this uncertainty and from these generate new hypotheses and predictions for future studies simulation results demonstrate three phases following restoration initial transient dynamics with considerable shell loss followed by growth and saturation of the live population and then saturation of settlement habitat several years later over half of simulations recoup initial shell losses as populations grow while others continue in decline the balance between population density substrate supporting the reef and exposed surfaces for settlement is mediated by overall population size and size structure presence of predators and relative amounts of live individuals and intact dead shells the efficiency of settlement substrate production improves through time as population size structure becomes more complex and the population of dead valves accumulates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords self organization oyster reef substrate living shorelines restoration prediction 1 introduction self organization in natural systems is a process of establishing and maintaining a global pattern or structure through many cumulative interactions among individual agents of the system which operate at a local level without information regarding the broader global dynamic camazine et al 2001 these agents follow a limited set of rules grimm and railsback 2005 and are not governed by an overall plan or steering mechanism young 2017 instead multiple positive and negative feedbacks reinforce their location and population dynamics these include proximal drivers such as recruitment and interactions with substrate and distal factors such as environmental conditions which impose external constraints on local resources klausmeier 1999 organized aggregations form through collective activity of the agents imposing negative feedback on adjacent areas by concentrating resources locally and impeding resource flows externally this leads to spatial patterning which emerges from finer to larger scales levin 1992 examples of self organization include patterned geomorphology in mussel beds liu et al 2014 arid land vegetation klausmeier 1999 wetland vegetation watts et al 2010 and savannahs jeltsch et al 1998 signaling networks in termites and slime molds bignell et al 2010 camazine et al 2001 murmuration in birds reynolds 1987 and shoaling in fish huth and wissel 1992 in the example of mussel beds dispersal and aggregation of mussels are the main drivers determining bed geomorphology but exogeneous factors of sediment and wave energy also influence the pattern set by the mussels as the beds concentrate sediment and absorb wave inputs leading to regularly spaced linear beds in this study we focus on self organization of the reef building system of the eastern oyster crassostrea virginica which is native to the atlantic and gulf of mexico coasts of the united states our main goal is to examine mechanical properties of the evolved reef system that are shared across locales although oysters are traditionally valued as an important economic commodity reef ecosystems are gaining increasing attention for their resilience and self maintenance properties which provide significant ecological and conservation value reefs function as foundation habitats supporting aquatic food webs and potentially provide numerous other ecosystem services such as nutrient regulation storage and wave attenuation coen et al 2007 grabowski et al 2012 these services likely benefit adjacent habitats such as salt marsh by mitigating erosion and stabilizing shorelines arkema et al 2013 piazza et al 2005 scyphers et al 2011 for these reasons restoration of reefs for ecosystem based management is growing in practice currin et al 2010 frederick et al 2016 the success of these restorations hinges on the ability to understand and predict the mechanisms that lead to self organizing and self sustaining reefs the key proximal drivers for generating oyster reef structure are production of calcareous shell substrate by oysters and recruitment of oyster larvae to the reef the key external factors are wave energy food predation sedimentation and environmental conditions such as water temperature and salinity which influence individual metabolism growth reproductive output and survival shell is grown by individuals as articulating valves and accumulates at the population level following individual mortality where it begins to break down settlement patterns of larvae represent positive feedbacks that reinforce the reef structural pattern bartol and mann 1997 larvae are attracted to the reef by chemical and auditory cues lillis et al 2015 settling on previously deposited substrate or other live oysters and forming clusters which grow in volume both vertically and horizontally feedbacks between external factors and internal processes are possible for example as the oyster population and reef increase in size the combined surface area of shell serving as settlement habitat increases representing positive feedback however the community of predators attracted to the reef also increases imposing negative feedback but at the same time exposes shell surfaces for new recruits larger adult oysters impede settlement to some extent by occupying a portion of reef substrate but also themselves serve as substrate for recruits thus the balance between individual competition for space on the reef and collective generation of new space at the population level is complex particularly given the spatial and environmental limits on reef growth similar interactions with hydrology are possible water becomes channeled as it flows over and around the reef which increases the flux of food particles lenihan 1999 but negatively impacts settlement conditions such as through increased turbulence bahr and lanier 1981 these feedbacks act on different components of the reef i e adults larvae shell and when maintained in balance ensure that sufficient materials and energy are exchanged among components the primary ecological question for oyster reef self organization concerns how proximal drivers and external factors combine to maintain a net balance of reef shell positive negative or zero and whether this coincides with growth or decline of the live population powell and klinck 2007 shell degrades through natural physical erosion and chemical dissolution powell et al 2006 which must be offset by production of shell by live individuals mortality of live individuals negatively impacts shell production but positively supports both larval settlement by opening up interstitial surfaces and substrate accumulation as shell breaks down and consolidates this successional dynamic of shell and reef structure driven by oyster mortality can be considered a chain of multiple interacting feedbacks another important condition is that oyster reefs occur in highly dynamic spatially constrained environments thus the volumes attained by both the crushed shell foundation layer i e degraded oyster valves and productive outer live layer are limited the shell foundation is limited by external factors such as water depth and shoreline geomorphology while the live population is limited by the ability of oysters to aggregate and form clusters when either of these limits are reached and growth of the reef ceases mortality may play a key role in renewing the chain of feedbacks by opening up space for new recruits the question then is what balance of these dynamic mechanisms is required to sustain the live population while also maintaining shell accumulation on the reef we examine this question by developing an individual based model ibm of oyster reef building dynamics that specifically considers reef three dimensional structure our overall goal is to gain insights into how the live oyster population reef structure and larval recruits interact through time as a coupled system to converge on stable dynamics that sustain the reef we specifically focus on the successional process of shell habitat generation from live production and growth to accumulation of valve and crushed shell from dead oysters we consider two somewhat distinct roles of habitat one supporting the live population elevating it above the sea floor and the other supporting reproduction through exposed settlement substrate since the mechanics of these are quite different consolidating biomass at the reef scale versus exposing individual shell surfaces we explicitly represent each process in the model at its respective scale we then develop hypotheses and predictions on how the live population might interact with habitat through time at these two scales particularly under environmental spatial constraints we first assume that reef self organization generally hinges on the efficiency of the reef to generate both types of shell habitat cycling shell through its roles as settlement area and then reef substrate we then assume that demographic structure is also important since larger individuals produce more larvae and larger longer lasting shell however in both cases we make no assumptions on what dynamics or patterns emerge at the population and reef level to our knowledge this is the first attempt to model the three dimensional structure of oyster reefs as a function of individual dynamics similar to previous studies on corals sleeman et al 2005 and macroalgae yniguez et al 2008 we apply the oyster reef ibm to simulate reef restoration at a study location in north inlet winyah bay sc usa using a time series of environmental conditions which vary seasonally and interannually we first validate model results against an empirical growth study conducted at this site dame et al 2000 and then develop a biological ensemble modeling approach gårdmark et al 2013 to evaluate restoration performance where single restoration events and their ensuing dynamics are simulated over multiple runs with variation included on select model assumptions and processes variability in larval settlement rate predation and a constraint on live population volume are applied within ranges that sustain populations and do not force extinction which is beyond the scope of this study predation is represented in five scenarios where community membership and the sizes of oyster prey targeted by each predator group are varied including a scenario with no predators model dynamics are then summarized across simulations as population level measures of individual density total biomass and habitat settlement area through time providing a quantitative evaluation of restoration performance with associated ranges of uncertainty finally the role of population demography in stock recruitment dynamics is examined by comparing availability of settlement habitat to population level measures of live biomass and density of larger individuals across simulations 2 methods the oyster reef individual based model is described following the odd protocol overview design concepts and details grimm et al 2006 2010 railsback and grimm 2019 this format begins with a plain language description of model processes interactions and scales followed by additional details the full odd is given in supplement 1 here we present a summary version with some wording repeated following odd recommendations 2 1 overview to simulate oyster reef building dynamics we develop an integrated model that separately tracks the life cycles of individual oysters somatic tissue gonad and shell the half lives of shell valves following mortality and the accumulation of crushed shell matter all together these combine to form a three dimensional reef in this way dynamics of the model self organize across levels of the individual population and reef structure the model also demonstrates the importance of predation in sustaining recruitment and habitat availability and thus stable development of the reef system there are two sets of entities i e autonomous objects or actors individual live oysters and shell valves fig 1 live oysters grow shells which remain as substrate when the oyster dies here valve indicates only the dead state the dynamics of these two entities are described by state variables of volume cm3 energy j age years and vertical location on the reef cm following mortality physical state variables carry over from live oyster to valve and the valve then begins to degrade through erosion and dissolution eventually reaching a size where concavity is assumed to be lost and it is no longer considered an individual 5 cm chosen arbitrarily these shell remnants constitute another single state variable of crushed oyster shell material tracked as a total biomass pool external factors impacting individuals are salinity temperature food availability predators and burial population and reef level variables are observed as aggregates of individual state variables the spatial extent is the reef itself tens of m2 which is a dynamic entity with rectangular three dimensional morphology and sloping vertical sides fig 2 crushed shell comprises the bulk of the physical volume of the reef while the live oysters and valves lie on the outer surface top and sides see fig 2 temporal extent of simulations is 22 years and temporal resolution is in daily time steps discrete difference equations model dynamics at this time scale approximating dynamics at the weekly to monthly scale which is generally the resolution at which these resources are monitored table 1 2 2 design concepts and selected details the main processes in the model are the life cycle dynamics of the live population growth of tissue and shell reproduction and mortality and substrate dynamics accumulation and degradation which together determine the emergent property of reef morphology and structure live individuals grow according to rules of energy acquisition and allocation defined by dynamic energy budget theory kooijman 2010 lavaud et al 2017 energy is first assimilated into reserve and then partitioned between somatic growth and reproduction equations 1 8 a1 14 supplement 2 these dynamics are modeled on discrete time steps of one day approximating continuous growth at the scale of weeks over time individuals transition through phases of birth metamorphosis and puberty defined by maturity thresholds and experience a metabolic acceleration between birth and metamorphosis abj model in deb terms maintenance energetic costs of somatic tissues and maturity must be met before the remaining energy can fuel structural growth or gamete production all energy fluxes are mediated by temperature which generally increases metabolism and food intake is additionally mediated by salinity where feeding rates decline to zero from 10 to 3 psu lavaud et al 2017 physiological variability among individuals is introduced by applying stochastic variation to selected metabolic parameters ṗam ṗm and xk tables 2 and s1 the survival or mortality of all individual live oysters at each time step is described by a set of equations relating probability of survival to individual size or elevation on the reef equations 9 10 28 34 also described later reproduction is modeled as linked processes of spawning maintenance of a pelagic larval population and settlement from this population to the reef equations 15 27 these are tracked respectively as aggregated variables of eggs released larvae and settlers per time without individual attributes together they simulate pelagic dynamics of the oyster population at the time scale of 20 days dekshenieks et al 2000 the larval population is maintained as the net balance of input from spawning and export through settlement with a fixed population level decay rate in this study it functions as a closed auto recruiting system spawning is generally a short term event days to weeks and events can recur as long as temperature and gamete production are sufficient spawning is initiated when thresholds of temperature and population level gonado somatic index gsi are exceeded gametes are released by individuals through the deb submodel and total eggs are summed and input to the larval population settlement represents a transient phase during which recruits enter the live population and become specified as individual oysters settlement involves two collectives or subsets of agents with unique actions settlers a subset of the live population and available settlement habitat a subset of shell types live valve and crushed input of settlers from the larval to the live population is described by the settlement rate ρ multiplied by the summed area of exposed shell surfaces not occupied by other entities in this way the settler collective is conditioned by the settlement habitat collective natural variability in settlement i e larvae locating and navigating to the reef is represented by varying rate ρ in simulations for each spawning event and at the daily scale see section 2 4 and supplement s1 15 settlement continues until larvae or settlement substrate are expended generally days to weeks following spawning the net balance of crushed shell is determined by two processes of gain of new crushed shell material through degradation of valves and losses through degradation of existing crushed shell equations 11 12 the gradual degradation of valves into crushed shell is described by a rate linked to salinity variance which is a proxy for exposure to estuarine processes e g redox reactions dissolution erosion day et al 2012 powell and klinck 2007 loss of crushed shell is described similarly although only shell along the outer surface of the reef not covered by other oysters or valves is considered exposed to degradation see supplement 1 in this way the total shell budget is tracked through time concurrently for all three shell types equations 9 11 reef geomorphology is a generalized trapezoidal volume comprised of crushed shell fig 2 solid lines with live oysters and valves occupying the upper surface dotted lines reef dimensions are derived by converting crushed shell weight to volume and solving for height assuming fixed base dimensions x1 x2 and a triangular overflow volume with angle of repose θ and width proportional to height equations 13 14 the volume of the live layer occupied by oysters and valves is limited by an assumed hydrodynamic constraint described by vertical parameter ξ multiplied by the surface area of the reef trapezoid equations 21 26 27 settlement ceases whenever this volumetric limit is reached the individual volume of each live oyster and valve is described by a cylinder live oysters are assumed to have a zone of influence extending beyond their physical dimensions which implicitly represents natural spacing maintained among oyster individuals when taken collectively at the population level this also represents spacing among oyster clusters the live layer is therefore not entirely filled with oyster and shell biomass but has some empty space valves have a radius equal to only their physical width the demographic size structure of the live population is observed by taking daily measures of individual density number m 2 binned within four size classes used by wang et al 2008 spat 25 mm juvenile 25 50 mm adult 50 75 mm and sack 75 mm the sack class represents market size oysters although no harvest is assumed here note these designations are for observation only and are not used in model processes variables describing dynamics at the reef level are total shell biomass kg reef height cm volume m3 and exposed surface area for settlement m2 reef performance and uncertainty across simulations are observed as daily means and quantiles τ 0 1 0 5 0 75 0 9 0 98 of these variables taken at each time step predation in this study represents an external driver that facilitates turnover of shell from live to dead valves exposing shell surfaces for settlement and initiating shell degradation predation is thus a design concept that affects mechanics at the reef scale and individual fitness through survival importantly predation is intended as the collective action of a community of predators and not any single species predators are therefore represented as characterizations of foraging behavior types i e guilds with similar foraging traits which have different levels of activity related to environmental conditions and which target different sized oyster prey holling 1959 thereby exposing varying sizes of valves on the reef equations 31 36 in this way the predator community responds dynamically to changes in oyster population abundance and size structure as well as to changes in environmental conditions table 3 describes four foraging types applied in this study derived from field and laboratory studies brown and richardson 1988 brown et al 2008 butler 1985 eggleston 1990 grabowski et al 2008 haller bull et al 2019 hesterberg et al 2017 kennedy et al 2009 newell et al 2007 o connor et al 2008 speights and mccoy 2017 stephenson et al 2013 stempien 2007 total prey consumed by each predator group is determined by predator occurrence density and functional response taken together predator occurrence is related to temperature and salinity through sigmoid equations lord 2014 menzel and nichy 1958 predator densities are related to their oyster prey density by saturating functions per predator extraction of prey is described by functional response equations beddington 1975 deangelis et al 1975 holling 1959 parameter values for occurrence and functional response are selected so that feeding activity of the groups are somewhat uncorrelated these are based on specific studies when available and descriptive life history otherwise see supplement s1 10 our goal is to represent reasonable ranges of predation that impact dynamics of the system but do not drive the population to extinction natural variability in predator use of the reef is represented in simulations by varying parameter predmax which determines the magnitude of densities equation 32 this is implemented concurrently with variation in settlement parameter ρ but independently producing partially decoupled dynamics in the predator prey function see section 2 4 supplement s1 15 and figure s1 1 in addition to predation other mortality factors include natural mortality i e survival to adulthood probability of burial implicitly representing sedimentation and terminal age equations 28 30 in which survival is related to individual size or elevation on the reef harding et al 2008 lorenzen 2000 nestlerode et al 2007 camp et al 2015 powell et al 1994 2 3 initialization in this study the model is initialized to simulate restoration actions for an example location in north inlet winyah bay sc usa a coastal estuarine and salt marsh ecosystem with regular tides and low freshwater input dame et al 2000 single restoration events are simulated at the beginning of runs and restoration performance is tracked over subsequent decades 1996 2018 no further management actions are taken following the initial restoration reefs are stocked on the initial time step of runs with crushed shell equivalent to a height of 40 cm 5 158 103 kg individuals are stocked at a density of 400 individuals m 2 with initial individual deb volume at birth vi of 8 10 9 cm3 reef base dimensions x1 x2 fig 2 are fixed at 10 2 m inputs for simulations are time series of salinity psu temperature c and chlorophyll a µg l 1 representing physical environmental conditions and food source these were recorded at oyster landing ol 33 349 n 79 189 w in north inlet sc from january 1 1996 to august 1 2018 fig 3 and supplement 1 due to limited availability of chlorophyll data a derived single year time series is applied equally across years these data sets are managed by the university of south carolina s baruch institute for marine and coastal science as part of the noaa national estuarine research reserve system neer http cdmo baruch sc edu dges 2 4 ensemble modeling and parameter variation in simulation runs the oyster reef ibm is implemented in an ensemble modeling framework in which underlying processes that determine reef dynamics are varied over multiple simulation runs with a goal of identifying long term trends in the reef that are robust over model uncertainty and natural variability in these processes here variation is applied on predation larval settlement and the hydrodynamic constraint on the reef live layer functions describing these processes are varied by drawing key parameters from probability distributions which generally adjusts the magnitude of the function but not its form see supplement s1 15 this approach characterizes both natural variability of the ecosystem through the behavior of the distributions and parametric uncertainty of model functions by drawing select parameter values from distributions the hydrodynamic constraint is varied by drawing parameter ξ which regulates live layer depth equation 17 from a uniform distribution truncated between 10 and 30 cm note that this constraint is implemented as a volume based threshold values below 10 cm generally lead to reef decline in the model settlement patterns are varied across runs by adjusting the overall magnitude of rate parameter ρ equation 16 in addition to variation within runs as described earlier predator densities are varied similarly to settlement but only within runs finally effects of predator community composition are examined by developing five scenarios with varying predator membership all predators no predators predators 2 and 3 only predators 1 3 and predators 2 4 a total of 1 200 separate simulation runs are conducted for each scenario 2 5 model validation and sensitivity analysis the individual based modeling approach is designed to avoid biases of population level assumptions by simulating individual level mechanistic processes in detail whenever possible however assumptions at this level are necessary we examine these with two separate sets of simulations a model validation and sensitivity analysis individual growth in our deb submodel is validated against actual growth measurements collected during a comprehensive two year field study of tidal creek ecology creek dame et al 2000 which commenced the neer research program in north inlet in this study eight sites in clambank and town creeks adjacent to ol were sampled and growth was measured as change in shell length mm over regular 30 day intervals data portal https www baruch sc edu biological databases our simulations follow the same deployment and retrieval schedule of the creek study see supplement 3 using physical data from the nearby nerr clambank creek station cc 33 334 n 79 193 w the sensitivity of simulated oyster reef dynamics to key modeled underlying processes is also examined these include predation settlement and the hydrodynamic constraint which are varied in the ensemble framework and additionally the assumption that the surface area available for settlement on valves is greater than on live oysters this analysis is structured following the same methods as the ensemble modeling implementing multiple simulations with variability across and within runs however in the sensitivity analysis each function is additionally varied independently for the first three processes the parameters governing the probability distributions e g shape and scale parameters from which key function parameters are drawn are alternately increased and decreased thereby shifting the range of the function parameters without changing functional form this preserves the modeled variability in these underlying processes while testing sensitivity of the model to the assumptions of the distributions see supplement s1 15 for details parameters of the gamma and rayleigh distributions are adjusted by 20 and the range of the uniform distribution is shifted by 25 sensitivity to valve settlement area is examined by using the same constant of 2 in both equations 22 and 23 replacing 4 in the equation for valves only the scenario with all predators is considered for these sensitivity analyses totaling seven separate ensembles i e three processes varied in two directions modeled oyster reef dynamics of the sensitivity analyses are then compared to the original results 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions the temperature time series used in simulations fig 3 has considerable interannual variability with several abrupt changes between adjacent years most notably in winter e g 2002 2012 2017 interestingly the coldest winter in 2011 is preceded by one of the hottest summers in 2010 the overall salinity regime for this estuary is generally euhaline 30 40 psu with intermittent polyhaline 18 30 psu and infrequent mesohaline periods 5 18 psu note that the experimental salinity levels used to calibrate the deb model parameters in louisiana focus on the mesohaline range 3 25 psu lavaud et al 2017 which is not prevalent in north inlet sc thus the salinity correction on deb processes in simulations has minimal effect here 3 2 oyster reef dynamics single example an example of simulated dynamics for a single oyster reef are shown in fig 4 crushed shell settlement area dark line middle panel is highest at the beginning of runs when it is largely unoccupied 1996 gradually declines as the live oyster population grows and covers it and stabilizes around 2000 in the following years 2000 2013 settlement area on live oysters and valves increases as these populations increase total settlement habitat on valves fluctuates annually attaining approximately 3 to 6 times that of live oysters toward the end of runs 2010 to 2018 note that calculations of individual surface area differ only by a factor of two equations 22 23 settlement area on valves and live oysters stabilizes between 2010 and 2015 beginning in 2006 all values of settlement area fall to zero when the total volume determined by parameter ξ multipied by reef surface area is exceeded dotted line top panel to visualize this threshold ξ is shown here as an approximate height derived from this dynamic volume however it is not entirely analogous to other heights shown cohort dynamics of the live population bottom row are observed as changes in densities within size classes number m 2 in this example larger individuals adult sack remain relatively stable across years as they are replenished by recruits although recruitment varies considerably across years and within seasons for example see large peaks of spat in 2009 2014 and 2015 3 3 reef ensemble modeling predator community scenarios include variation in settlement rate ρ and volume constraint ξ over simulations the predominant difference by far is between scenarios with and without predators the absence of predators results in entirely different settlement and reef dynamics than the four scenarios with predators some differences among predator scenarios are present and these results are shown in supplement 4 for the remainder of results presented here we partition the output data into two groups one compiled across the four predator scenarios figs 5 6 and the other without predators figs 7 8 3 3 1 scenarios with predators simulations of biomass settlement habitat and observed population demography with predators show some multi year trends figs 5 6 the overall pattern is an initial loss of crushed shell in the first several years while the live population establishes followed by growth and saturation of the live population and then accumulation of valves and settlement habitat which also stabilize several years later total biomass on reefs varies considerably across simulations in some simulations the initial shell loss is recovered through live production the demographic structure of the population also passes through similar phases live oyster biomass gradually accumulates over the first ten years of simulations fig 5 second row then stabilizes between 2003 and 2009 for lower and upper quantiles respectively maintaining these levels until the end of runs in 2018 this timing difference indicates that some simulations reach volumetric capacity earlier than others valve biomass third row follows a similar pattern but does not stabilize until approximately 2013 and shows pronounced seasonal variation crushed shell biomass first row decreases considerably in the first seven to ten years from initial restored levels down to approximately 4 6 103 kg due to shell degradation exceeding production by the live population from this point on the trajectories of crushed shell diverge across simulations some continue along the declining trend while others show some recovery approaching restored levels by the end of runs this trend is also reflected in total reef biomass fig 5 bottom row which is comprised predominantly of crushed shell an order of magnitude higher than live oyster and valve biomass settlement habitat area fig 5 right column follows similar dynamics between shell types but with some differences across quantile ranges crushed shell settlement habitat first row declines in the initial years 1996 2002 similar to crushed biomass but remains at similar levels until the end of the simulation with some seasonal and annual fluctuation exceedance of threshold ξ indicated by zero values first occurs in simulations around 2002 although this limit is not reached in all runs settlement habitat on live oysters second row initially increases on average black line until 2002 where it stabilizes and then fluctuates similar to crushed shell the upper quantile for this variable gradually increases throughout runs although at a low rate compared to other variables settlement area on valves third row initially grows at a slower rate than live oysters but then exceeds it in 2000 and attains much higher levels overall toward the end of runs total settlement habitat on valves is approximately four times the amount on crushed shell or live oysters finally settlement habitat summed together across shell types bottom row shows an initial dip and recovery over the first six years as the live population is establishing settlement habitat is exceptionally high in 2012 and 2016 densities of live individuals under the predator scenario follow four approximate phases fig 6 these were the initial transient dynamics of the seed stock 1996 2000 followed by increase in densities of all size classes 2000 2005 then continued increase in lower size class densities and leveling off of upper classes 2005 2012 and finally culmination in a large recruitment year in 2012 with considerable interannual variability following it 2012 2018 during the first four years settlement is strongly coupled to spawning with two distinct settlement cohorts the initial cohort of oysters stocked in 1996 reaches the sack class in 1998 bottom row and the first reproductive cycle is completed with the arrival of new settlers in 1997 top row which reaches sack size in 2000 following this time spawning and settlement become more continuous throughout the season and cohorts become less distinguishable beginning in 2005 densities of the adult and sack classes remain at similar levels with noticeable spikes in 2008 2009 and 2013 due to increased settlement in years following milder winters these increases in larger size classes appear to be somewhat stepwise 3 3 2 scenarios with no predators scenarios with no predators figs 7 8 show three overall differences compared to those with predators none of the simulations recover the initial loss of crushed shell biomass incurred from 1996 to 2003 fig 7 left column and all continue along the trajectory of decline until the end of runs in 2018 settlement habitat is only intermittently available at much lower levels than in scenarios with predators and falls to zero every year for all simulations i e none maintain continuous availability finally individual densities are dominated by larger individuals see sack class fig 8 and settlement dynamics occur as single pulsed events each year the overall temporal pattern of whole live and valve biomass fig 7 second and third rows is similar to the scenario with predators however these variables reach the volume limit ξ much earlier whole live in 2000 and valve in 2006 and their levels relative to each other are inverted live biomass is consistently higher than valve and higher than levels with predators included valve biomass without predators does not exceed 100 kg in more than half of the simulations fig 5 in contrast to the predator scenarios the initial transient stocking period extends until approximately 2002 as indicated by the settlement habitat dynamics without predators fig 7 which is four years later than with predators consistent annual settlement cohorts are also delayed until then fig 8 finally densities of spat juvenile and adult classes are highly correlated with settlement dynamics suggesting that the system has no buffer for variability in settlement habitat when there are no predators interestingly some recruitment pulses come in regularly spaced two year couplets for example in 2002 2003 and 2009 2010 3 3 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of simulated oyster reef dynamics to the ensemble modeling assumptions are summarized in fig 9 each sensitivity ensemble columns 2 8 is compared to the original base ensemble column 1 by taking the mean median and quantiles τ 0 1 0 9 of the reef variables represented in figs 5 8 and calculating differences from equivalent base values this analysis uses only the latter years of simulations 2015 2018 when reefs have generally reached equilibrium base ensemble values are given in absolute units column 1 and all other columns list differences from the base colors and shading of the table indicate relative sensitivity computed as differences divided by the standard deviation of each base ensemble variable the four biomass variables kg and five individual density variables m 2 are generally most sensitive to changes in settlement rate ρ and to a lesser extent constraint parameter ξ one exception is live oyster whole biomass which is primarily sensitive to ξ and predator density the upper quantiles of individual density are particularly sensitive to ρ the four variables representing available settlement habitat area m2 have mixed responses the lower quantile τ 0 1 is most sensitive to increases in predation and parameter ξ both of which contribute to maintaining the live population below the volumetric limit the mean median and 0 9 quantile of valve and total settlement area are most sensitive intuitively to the ensemble where individual valve and live exposed surface areas are assumed equal column 8 sensitivity of biomass and individual densities to this ensemble are moderate but considerably less than to ρ note that the ratios of total valve settlement area to live for this ensemble are approximately double 1 7 1 9 2 0 and 2 2 for each metric respectively despite using the same constant corresponding measures for the base ensemble are 0 4 2 4 4 and 4 7 interestingly individual densities are not particularly sensitive to predator density but are somewhat elevated at the mean and upper quantile of the terminal sack size class 3 3 4 settlement habitat availability and live population the relationship between settlement habitat availability and the live population is shown in fig 10 this resembles a stock recruitment relationship insofar as it represents settlement potential based on habitat but does not account for recruit survival each light gray point in the figure indicates a single time step of simulation runs collectively they summarize trends across and within simulations total available settlement area per unit biomass top row and per individual density adult and sack class bottom row together represent the efficiency of the live population for generating settlement habitat under volumetric constraints given that total surface area and volume of the population vary with population size structure settlement area per live biomass top left panel is highest around 150 kg live biomass and abruptly converges to zero above this level this upper limit may be due to the population volume exceeding the limit ξ or settlement surfaces becoming completely covered or both settlement area is much higher for ratios of live to valve biomass above 1 top right panel lines indicating mean and median settlement area increase nonlinearly for values above 1 the relationship of settlement area to adult density bottom left is dome shaped with maxima around 200 individuals m 2 while the same relationship for the sack class bottom right resembles a sigmoidal or other saturating curve which increases between 50 and 100 individuals m 2 when sack densities are high high levels of settlement habitat are usually maintained in contrast settlement habitat falls to zero in nearly all simulations when adult densities are high as indicated by the divergence between the mean and median above 300 individuals m 2 this suggests that the exposed surface areas or volume of the population relative to ξ are saturated by many smaller individuals which taken together are less efficient at producing and exposing shell for settlement than larger individuals 4 discussion we developed an individual based model of oyster reef mechanics to simulate interacting effects of metabolism growth mortality predation and environmental conditions on the engineering and maintenance of reef structure by oyster populations the modeled reef functions as a complex adaptive system railsback 2001 with interrelated dynamics between the live population and reef shell across multiple scales of individuals population and physical habitat together these determine reef self organization key results of this study include new insights into the role of predators and mortality on the rates of shell production and turnover by the oyster reef system an important mechanism for generating settlement habitat in this model these include the overall amount of shell produced by the population the size of individual shells and their longevity on the reef and the transfer of shell to become settlement habitat all three of these aspects are determined by oyster growth and size at the individual level the overall population size and demographic size structure and mortality imposed externally through predation and other sources results of this study represent new hypotheses and predictions for how internal proximal drivers of the oyster population interact with external factors to determine reef self organization our oyster reef model can be broadly adapted to test these and other hypotheses and predictions in field studies it requires only three input data sets salinity temperature and food source and reasonable assumptions on predator dynamics mortality shell degradation and settlement which can be updated when better estimates become available three phases of reef dynamics that are robust across simulations are identified in the ensemble modeling 1 initial shell loss concurrent with live population growth 2 saturation of the live population and 3 saturation of settlement habitat the timing of these phases varies with levels of predation activity particularly the length of time required for the population to establish and overcome the initial transient stocking dynamics simulated reefs vary considerably in their ability to maintain sufficient shell biomass to support accretion and continuous availability of settlement habitat importantly accretion and settlement are linked mechanically through shell production in all simulations without predators reefs fall into decline and demonstrate highly correlated spawning and settlement due to intermittent settlement habitat availability the only mortality factors for this scenario are natural mortality burial and terminal age suggesting that larger sized oysters obstruct settlement by suppressing the exposure of valves simulations with predators show varying degrees of settlement habitat availability more than half provide continuous habitat for at least a large portion of simulation runs these results suggest that strongly correlated spawning stock recruitment cycles may indicate instability through discontinuous habitat availability and insufficient recruitment to sustain the population in contrast the somewhat decoupled continuous settlement habitat associated with more complex population size structures may mediate reef stability figs 5 6 10 also powell and klinck 2007 kuykendall et al 2015 we urge caution when interpreting the role of predators in this study our focus is on how oysters have evolved to interact with predators in a way that supports their long term persistence and not identify levels that drive the population to extinction in developing this ibm we draw from several previous modeling studies powell et al 1992 and hofmann et al 1994 developed a comprehensive suite of models which pioneered the examination of population level processes that emerge from individual physiology we follow a similar approach but replace their empirically derived filtration rates with the more mechanistic deb approach powell et al 2006 and powell and klinck 2007 developed mathematical equations for deriving rates of shell persistence on reefs wilberg et al 2013 developed a system of equations representing coupled dynamics of oyster and shell habitat at the population level and soniat et al 2012 developed a mathematical model which specified objectives for maintaining net balance of shell we incorporate these concepts of shell persistence net balance and coupled dynamics into a single platform additionally including properties of shell surface area which requires building up dynamics mechanistically from individuals through shell growth mortality and biomass accumulation we also allow for age and size to be somewhat independent insofar as they determine cohort dynamics moore et al 2016 found this distinction important in their integral projection model although it is often not included in matrix based modeling by explicitly tracking valves with individual variation we can examine the complex shell surfaces available for settlement with respect to population size and demographic size structure fig 10 our results showing that settlement area increases with both of these measures agree with those of schulte et al 2009 for restored high relief reefs see their fig 4 which were considerably more successful than low relief interestingly that study found a similar quadratic relationship between recruits and the adult population the results of our study are contingent on several limitations of the model assumed for the present application first mortality is applied generally at low levels we acknowledge that in real reefs mortality is a key agent for population decline particularly when stressors act in combination such as disease ford et al 2006 predation grabowski 2004 depletion of shell resources camp et al 2015 colden et al 2017 frederick et al 2016 limitation in food supply sedimentation colden et al 2017 jordan cooley et al 2011 and extreme and episodic environmental conditions la peyre et al 2016 lowe et al 2017 puckett and eggleston 2012 our focus here is to examine how mortality facilitates availability of settlement habitat thus we do not address this complexity of factors we model predation only as intermittent events and not as persistent and overwhelming predator outbreaks similarly we describe sedimentation implicitly as a probability of burial and keep the natural mortality function constant over time to simulate low levels of these mortalities which provide background regulation of the live oyster population material contribution of sedimentation is not examined here since this is highly variable across watersheds and time isphording and imsand 1991 liu and huang 2009 and research suggests that mortality from sedimentation only occurs when it exceeds 30 mm total and is maintained for over 28 days i e colden et al 2017 we do not allow any individuals to expire through loss of energy reserves in the deb routine which only occurs infrequently at very young ages 2 weeks finally we do not include anthropogenic harvest although we acknowledge that it can strongly determine oyster reef persistence camp et al 2015 modeling a complete oyster reef system including whole organisms and shell requires integrating information across field kuykendall et al 2015 powell et al 2006 powell and klinck 2007 and modeling studies hofmann et al 1994 lavaud et al 2017 w e pine et al 2015 powell et al 1992 that span several populations in the atlantic and gulf of mexico coasts usa we acknowledge that these populations may differ in genetics phenotype systems dynamics and other traits that could alter modeled outcomes our goal here is to develop a holistic model that sets testable predictions for any population of interest nichols and williams 2006 and not necessarily to describe a specific population we focus on developing a model based on mechanical principles that are common among populations e g energy flux shell surface area and whenever possible minimize assumptions of empirically derived parameters that may be population specific for example our modeled shell degradation is based on a population level annual rate determined for a delaware bay usa population powell and klinck 2007 we generalize this rate with respect to individual shell mechanics by modeling degradation at the daily scale as a function of individual shell biomass which is determined by individual growth in the deb model these individual degradation dynamics then combine in the model at the population level approximating the annual rates of powell klinck 2007 several physical constraints on reef geomorphology are applied in this study which may be more variable in real reef systems reef morphological dynamics are governed primarily by change in total volume of the assumed trapezoidal shaped reef the base horizontal dimensions x1 x2 fig 2 are fixed across simulations the constraint on live oyster volume ξ is fixed during runs and reef height h is assumed static across the spatial extent of the reef in real reefs these vary spatiotemporally as reef morphology interacts with dynamic landscape conditions and spatial heterogeneity in reef composition is likely a key property contributing to reef resilience this has been demonstrated for mussel beds liu et al 2014 and coral reefs toth et al 2019 but remains relatively unexamined for oyster reefs allowing for spatial expansion of shell habitat in future modeling studies may reduce the cumulative effect of the constraints imposed here for example the assumption of fixed base dimensions in our model precludes horizontal expansion which taken together with ξ imposes both vertical and horizontal limitations which may have facilitated the stepwise increases in individual density observed in later years of simulations nonetheless it is reasonable to assume that both types of constraints could be present in high wave energy or hydrodynamic environments it is also possible that ξ is dynamic on real reefs considering that changes in reef elevation or shell drag can attenuate wave energy allen and webb 2011 threshold effects of reef elevation are also possible such as found by colden et al 2017 however we do not include these here finally real reefs take many complex forms including elongated fringing winding or mounding bars which are determined largely by local bathymetry and hydrodynamics we do not assume any specific landscape effects in this study although factors such as reef elevation and location with respect to the tidal prism are known to impact growth and survival rates of oysters dame 1971 1972 despite these assumptions we believe that the present model achieves a reasonable compromise between simplification and complexity of the complicated reef building system and sets appropriate baselines for more targeted studies our oyster reef model can be applied to support restoration decision making oyster reefs are gaining increasing attention for their potential value for supporting shoreline stabilization for example through wave attenuation allen and webb 2011 currin et al 2010 piazza et al 2005 scyphers et al 2011 and for their self maintaining resilience properties bahr and lanier 1981 these ecosystem services could greatly reduce investment and maintenance costs allen and webb 2011 and greatly increase overall restoration value considering the ability of populations to stabilize themselves over large fluctuations in the physical environment e g drought flooding sea level change and their secondary benefits for ecosystems coen et al 2007 grabowski et al 2012 lipcius et al 2019 however the history of oyster reef restoration shows considerable uncertainty for example la peyre et al 2014 found that 27 of northern gulf of mexico restorations failed to maintain targets for live oyster density 0 oysters m 2 and 18 lacked elevational relief 0 l substrate m 2 such failures could be due to the inability of the reef to develop self organizing resilience properties therefore it is critical to know which conditions may contribute to the establishment of such resilience so that the correct information can be conveyed to restoration practitioners one of the chief concerns for restoration decision making is risk of investment losses due to various sources of uncertainty in this study we attempted to explain some of the uncertainty associated with reef resilience which is often extoled but poorly described in simulating single restorations we represented a management objective of investing in habitat and stock in the short term to promote long term population self maintenance which could considerably reduce overall costs our modeling shows some lags in the response of the reef to restorations which extends from five to eight years suggesting that return on investment may not become evident until later than expected during this time reefs may be particularly vulnerable as they recover from initial transient conditions we acknowledge that modeled outcomes show considerable variability across simulations our goal for this study is not to identify exact conditions that optimize restoration investment but to identify robust trends across simulations that improve scientific understanding of key mechanistic processes and thus offer insight into how restorations may be valued through time in this way predictions made by the reef model can support future studies in both ecology and decision analysis 5 conclusion this individual based model advances oyster modeling by representing reef dynamics as three dimensional mechanical processes internal drivers and external factors interact to determine reef self organization the model tracks these dynamics as they transfer across individual population and reef scales shell habitat functions as both material supporting reef geomorphology and as substrate regulating larval settlement results from the model show that the reef system maintains organization through efficient generation of settlement habitat measured with respect to live biomass and density of larger sized individuals this suggests that individual production population size structure and physical environmental constraints all contribute to reef self organization results also show important multi year lags in reef dynamics following restoration suggesting that a period of five to eight years may be necessary for the reef to recover and equilibrate before it maintains efficient production this modeling framework could be applied to support restoration decision making and to examine other self organizing systems such as coral or

24704,self organization is a process of establishing and reinforcing local structures through feedbacks between internal population dynamics and external factors in reef building systems substrate is collectively engineered by individuals that also occupy it and compete for space reefs are constrained spatially by the physical environment and by mortality which reduces production but exposes substrate for recruits reef self organization therefore depends on efficient balancing of production and occupancy of substrate to examine this we develop a three dimensional individual based model ibm of oyster reef mechanics shell substrate is grown by individuals as valves accumulates at the reef level and degrades following mortality single restoration events and subsequent dynamics are simulated for a case study in south carolina usa variability in model processes is included on recruitment spatial environmental constraints and predation over multiple independent runs and five predator community scenarios the main goal for this study is to summarize trends in dynamics that are robust across this uncertainty and from these generate new hypotheses and predictions for future studies simulation results demonstrate three phases following restoration initial transient dynamics with considerable shell loss followed by growth and saturation of the live population and then saturation of settlement habitat several years later over half of simulations recoup initial shell losses as populations grow while others continue in decline the balance between population density substrate supporting the reef and exposed surfaces for settlement is mediated by overall population size and size structure presence of predators and relative amounts of live individuals and intact dead shells the efficiency of settlement substrate production improves through time as population size structure becomes more complex and the population of dead valves accumulates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords self organization oyster reef substrate living shorelines restoration prediction 1 introduction self organization in natural systems is a process of establishing and maintaining a global pattern or structure through many cumulative interactions among individual agents of the system which operate at a local level without information regarding the broader global dynamic camazine et al 2001 these agents follow a limited set of rules grimm and railsback 2005 and are not governed by an overall plan or steering mechanism young 2017 instead multiple positive and negative feedbacks reinforce their location and population dynamics these include proximal drivers such as recruitment and interactions with substrate and distal factors such as environmental conditions which impose external constraints on local resources klausmeier 1999 organized aggregations form through collective activity of the agents imposing negative feedback on adjacent areas by concentrating resources locally and impeding resource flows externally this leads to spatial patterning which emerges from finer to larger scales levin 1992 examples of self organization include patterned geomorphology in mussel beds liu et al 2014 arid land vegetation klausmeier 1999 wetland vegetation watts et al 2010 and savannahs jeltsch et al 1998 signaling networks in termites and slime molds bignell et al 2010 camazine et al 2001 murmuration in birds reynolds 1987 and shoaling in fish huth and wissel 1992 in the example of mussel beds dispersal and aggregation of mussels are the main drivers determining bed geomorphology but exogeneous factors of sediment and wave energy also influence the pattern set by the mussels as the beds concentrate sediment and absorb wave inputs leading to regularly spaced linear beds in this study we focus on self organization of the reef building system of the eastern oyster crassostrea virginica which is native to the atlantic and gulf of mexico coasts of the united states our main goal is to examine mechanical properties of the evolved reef system that are shared across locales although oysters are traditionally valued as an important economic commodity reef ecosystems are gaining increasing attention for their resilience and self maintenance properties which provide significant ecological and conservation value reefs function as foundation habitats supporting aquatic food webs and potentially provide numerous other ecosystem services such as nutrient regulation storage and wave attenuation coen et al 2007 grabowski et al 2012 these services likely benefit adjacent habitats such as salt marsh by mitigating erosion and stabilizing shorelines arkema et al 2013 piazza et al 2005 scyphers et al 2011 for these reasons restoration of reefs for ecosystem based management is growing in practice currin et al 2010 frederick et al 2016 the success of these restorations hinges on the ability to understand and predict the mechanisms that lead to self organizing and self sustaining reefs the key proximal drivers for generating oyster reef structure are production of calcareous shell substrate by oysters and recruitment of oyster larvae to the reef the key external factors are wave energy food predation sedimentation and environmental conditions such as water temperature and salinity which influence individual metabolism growth reproductive output and survival shell is grown by individuals as articulating valves and accumulates at the population level following individual mortality where it begins to break down settlement patterns of larvae represent positive feedbacks that reinforce the reef structural pattern bartol and mann 1997 larvae are attracted to the reef by chemical and auditory cues lillis et al 2015 settling on previously deposited substrate or other live oysters and forming clusters which grow in volume both vertically and horizontally feedbacks between external factors and internal processes are possible for example as the oyster population and reef increase in size the combined surface area of shell serving as settlement habitat increases representing positive feedback however the community of predators attracted to the reef also increases imposing negative feedback but at the same time exposes shell surfaces for new recruits larger adult oysters impede settlement to some extent by occupying a portion of reef substrate but also themselves serve as substrate for recruits thus the balance between individual competition for space on the reef and collective generation of new space at the population level is complex particularly given the spatial and environmental limits on reef growth similar interactions with hydrology are possible water becomes channeled as it flows over and around the reef which increases the flux of food particles lenihan 1999 but negatively impacts settlement conditions such as through increased turbulence bahr and lanier 1981 these feedbacks act on different components of the reef i e adults larvae shell and when maintained in balance ensure that sufficient materials and energy are exchanged among components the primary ecological question for oyster reef self organization concerns how proximal drivers and external factors combine to maintain a net balance of reef shell positive negative or zero and whether this coincides with growth or decline of the live population powell and klinck 2007 shell degrades through natural physical erosion and chemical dissolution powell et al 2006 which must be offset by production of shell by live individuals mortality of live individuals negatively impacts shell production but positively supports both larval settlement by opening up interstitial surfaces and substrate accumulation as shell breaks down and consolidates this successional dynamic of shell and reef structure driven by oyster mortality can be considered a chain of multiple interacting feedbacks another important condition is that oyster reefs occur in highly dynamic spatially constrained environments thus the volumes attained by both the crushed shell foundation layer i e degraded oyster valves and productive outer live layer are limited the shell foundation is limited by external factors such as water depth and shoreline geomorphology while the live population is limited by the ability of oysters to aggregate and form clusters when either of these limits are reached and growth of the reef ceases mortality may play a key role in renewing the chain of feedbacks by opening up space for new recruits the question then is what balance of these dynamic mechanisms is required to sustain the live population while also maintaining shell accumulation on the reef we examine this question by developing an individual based model ibm of oyster reef building dynamics that specifically considers reef three dimensional structure our overall goal is to gain insights into how the live oyster population reef structure and larval recruits interact through time as a coupled system to converge on stable dynamics that sustain the reef we specifically focus on the successional process of shell habitat generation from live production and growth to accumulation of valve and crushed shell from dead oysters we consider two somewhat distinct roles of habitat one supporting the live population elevating it above the sea floor and the other supporting reproduction through exposed settlement substrate since the mechanics of these are quite different consolidating biomass at the reef scale versus exposing individual shell surfaces we explicitly represent each process in the model at its respective scale we then develop hypotheses and predictions on how the live population might interact with habitat through time at these two scales particularly under environmental spatial constraints we first assume that reef self organization generally hinges on the efficiency of the reef to generate both types of shell habitat cycling shell through its roles as settlement area and then reef substrate we then assume that demographic structure is also important since larger individuals produce more larvae and larger longer lasting shell however in both cases we make no assumptions on what dynamics or patterns emerge at the population and reef level to our knowledge this is the first attempt to model the three dimensional structure of oyster reefs as a function of individual dynamics similar to previous studies on corals sleeman et al 2005 and macroalgae yniguez et al 2008 we apply the oyster reef ibm to simulate reef restoration at a study location in north inlet winyah bay sc usa using a time series of environmental conditions which vary seasonally and interannually we first validate model results against an empirical growth study conducted at this site dame et al 2000 and then develop a biological ensemble modeling approach gårdmark et al 2013 to evaluate restoration performance where single restoration events and their ensuing dynamics are simulated over multiple runs with variation included on select model assumptions and processes variability in larval settlement rate predation and a constraint on live population volume are applied within ranges that sustain populations and do not force extinction which is beyond the scope of this study predation is represented in five scenarios where community membership and the sizes of oyster prey targeted by each predator group are varied including a scenario with no predators model dynamics are then summarized across simulations as population level measures of individual density total biomass and habitat settlement area through time providing a quantitative evaluation of restoration performance with associated ranges of uncertainty finally the role of population demography in stock recruitment dynamics is examined by comparing availability of settlement habitat to population level measures of live biomass and density of larger individuals across simulations 2 methods the oyster reef individual based model is described following the odd protocol overview design concepts and details grimm et al 2006 2010 railsback and grimm 2019 this format begins with a plain language description of model processes interactions and scales followed by additional details the full odd is given in supplement 1 here we present a summary version with some wording repeated following odd recommendations 2 1 overview to simulate oyster reef building dynamics we develop an integrated model that separately tracks the life cycles of individual oysters somatic tissue gonad and shell the half lives of shell valves following mortality and the accumulation of crushed shell matter all together these combine to form a three dimensional reef in this way dynamics of the model self organize across levels of the individual population and reef structure the model also demonstrates the importance of predation in sustaining recruitment and habitat availability and thus stable development of the reef system there are two sets of entities i e autonomous objects or actors individual live oysters and shell valves fig 1 live oysters grow shells which remain as substrate when the oyster dies here valve indicates only the dead state the dynamics of these two entities are described by state variables of volume cm3 energy j age years and vertical location on the reef cm following mortality physical state variables carry over from live oyster to valve and the valve then begins to degrade through erosion and dissolution eventually reaching a size where concavity is assumed to be lost and it is no longer considered an individual 5 cm chosen arbitrarily these shell remnants constitute another single state variable of crushed oyster shell material tracked as a total biomass pool external factors impacting individuals are salinity temperature food availability predators and burial population and reef level variables are observed as aggregates of individual state variables the spatial extent is the reef itself tens of m2 which is a dynamic entity with rectangular three dimensional morphology and sloping vertical sides fig 2 crushed shell comprises the bulk of the physical volume of the reef while the live oysters and valves lie on the outer surface top and sides see fig 2 temporal extent of simulations is 22 years and temporal resolution is in daily time steps discrete difference equations model dynamics at this time scale approximating dynamics at the weekly to monthly scale which is generally the resolution at which these resources are monitored table 1 2 2 design concepts and selected details the main processes in the model are the life cycle dynamics of the live population growth of tissue and shell reproduction and mortality and substrate dynamics accumulation and degradation which together determine the emergent property of reef morphology and structure live individuals grow according to rules of energy acquisition and allocation defined by dynamic energy budget theory kooijman 2010 lavaud et al 2017 energy is first assimilated into reserve and then partitioned between somatic growth and reproduction equations 1 8 a1 14 supplement 2 these dynamics are modeled on discrete time steps of one day approximating continuous growth at the scale of weeks over time individuals transition through phases of birth metamorphosis and puberty defined by maturity thresholds and experience a metabolic acceleration between birth and metamorphosis abj model in deb terms maintenance energetic costs of somatic tissues and maturity must be met before the remaining energy can fuel structural growth or gamete production all energy fluxes are mediated by temperature which generally increases metabolism and food intake is additionally mediated by salinity where feeding rates decline to zero from 10 to 3 psu lavaud et al 2017 physiological variability among individuals is introduced by applying stochastic variation to selected metabolic parameters ṗam ṗm and xk tables 2 and s1 the survival or mortality of all individual live oysters at each time step is described by a set of equations relating probability of survival to individual size or elevation on the reef equations 9 10 28 34 also described later reproduction is modeled as linked processes of spawning maintenance of a pelagic larval population and settlement from this population to the reef equations 15 27 these are tracked respectively as aggregated variables of eggs released larvae and settlers per time without individual attributes together they simulate pelagic dynamics of the oyster population at the time scale of 20 days dekshenieks et al 2000 the larval population is maintained as the net balance of input from spawning and export through settlement with a fixed population level decay rate in this study it functions as a closed auto recruiting system spawning is generally a short term event days to weeks and events can recur as long as temperature and gamete production are sufficient spawning is initiated when thresholds of temperature and population level gonado somatic index gsi are exceeded gametes are released by individuals through the deb submodel and total eggs are summed and input to the larval population settlement represents a transient phase during which recruits enter the live population and become specified as individual oysters settlement involves two collectives or subsets of agents with unique actions settlers a subset of the live population and available settlement habitat a subset of shell types live valve and crushed input of settlers from the larval to the live population is described by the settlement rate ρ multiplied by the summed area of exposed shell surfaces not occupied by other entities in this way the settler collective is conditioned by the settlement habitat collective natural variability in settlement i e larvae locating and navigating to the reef is represented by varying rate ρ in simulations for each spawning event and at the daily scale see section 2 4 and supplement s1 15 settlement continues until larvae or settlement substrate are expended generally days to weeks following spawning the net balance of crushed shell is determined by two processes of gain of new crushed shell material through degradation of valves and losses through degradation of existing crushed shell equations 11 12 the gradual degradation of valves into crushed shell is described by a rate linked to salinity variance which is a proxy for exposure to estuarine processes e g redox reactions dissolution erosion day et al 2012 powell and klinck 2007 loss of crushed shell is described similarly although only shell along the outer surface of the reef not covered by other oysters or valves is considered exposed to degradation see supplement 1 in this way the total shell budget is tracked through time concurrently for all three shell types equations 9 11 reef geomorphology is a generalized trapezoidal volume comprised of crushed shell fig 2 solid lines with live oysters and valves occupying the upper surface dotted lines reef dimensions are derived by converting crushed shell weight to volume and solving for height assuming fixed base dimensions x1 x2 and a triangular overflow volume with angle of repose θ and width proportional to height equations 13 14 the volume of the live layer occupied by oysters and valves is limited by an assumed hydrodynamic constraint described by vertical parameter ξ multiplied by the surface area of the reef trapezoid equations 21 26 27 settlement ceases whenever this volumetric limit is reached the individual volume of each live oyster and valve is described by a cylinder live oysters are assumed to have a zone of influence extending beyond their physical dimensions which implicitly represents natural spacing maintained among oyster individuals when taken collectively at the population level this also represents spacing among oyster clusters the live layer is therefore not entirely filled with oyster and shell biomass but has some empty space valves have a radius equal to only their physical width the demographic size structure of the live population is observed by taking daily measures of individual density number m 2 binned within four size classes used by wang et al 2008 spat 25 mm juvenile 25 50 mm adult 50 75 mm and sack 75 mm the sack class represents market size oysters although no harvest is assumed here note these designations are for observation only and are not used in model processes variables describing dynamics at the reef level are total shell biomass kg reef height cm volume m3 and exposed surface area for settlement m2 reef performance and uncertainty across simulations are observed as daily means and quantiles τ 0 1 0 5 0 75 0 9 0 98 of these variables taken at each time step predation in this study represents an external driver that facilitates turnover of shell from live to dead valves exposing shell surfaces for settlement and initiating shell degradation predation is thus a design concept that affects mechanics at the reef scale and individual fitness through survival importantly predation is intended as the collective action of a community of predators and not any single species predators are therefore represented as characterizations of foraging behavior types i e guilds with similar foraging traits which have different levels of activity related to environmental conditions and which target different sized oyster prey holling 1959 thereby exposing varying sizes of valves on the reef equations 31 36 in this way the predator community responds dynamically to changes in oyster population abundance and size structure as well as to changes in environmental conditions table 3 describes four foraging types applied in this study derived from field and laboratory studies brown and richardson 1988 brown et al 2008 butler 1985 eggleston 1990 grabowski et al 2008 haller bull et al 2019 hesterberg et al 2017 kennedy et al 2009 newell et al 2007 o connor et al 2008 speights and mccoy 2017 stephenson et al 2013 stempien 2007 total prey consumed by each predator group is determined by predator occurrence density and functional response taken together predator occurrence is related to temperature and salinity through sigmoid equations lord 2014 menzel and nichy 1958 predator densities are related to their oyster prey density by saturating functions per predator extraction of prey is described by functional response equations beddington 1975 deangelis et al 1975 holling 1959 parameter values for occurrence and functional response are selected so that feeding activity of the groups are somewhat uncorrelated these are based on specific studies when available and descriptive life history otherwise see supplement s1 10 our goal is to represent reasonable ranges of predation that impact dynamics of the system but do not drive the population to extinction natural variability in predator use of the reef is represented in simulations by varying parameter predmax which determines the magnitude of densities equation 32 this is implemented concurrently with variation in settlement parameter ρ but independently producing partially decoupled dynamics in the predator prey function see section 2 4 supplement s1 15 and figure s1 1 in addition to predation other mortality factors include natural mortality i e survival to adulthood probability of burial implicitly representing sedimentation and terminal age equations 28 30 in which survival is related to individual size or elevation on the reef harding et al 2008 lorenzen 2000 nestlerode et al 2007 camp et al 2015 powell et al 1994 2 3 initialization in this study the model is initialized to simulate restoration actions for an example location in north inlet winyah bay sc usa a coastal estuarine and salt marsh ecosystem with regular tides and low freshwater input dame et al 2000 single restoration events are simulated at the beginning of runs and restoration performance is tracked over subsequent decades 1996 2018 no further management actions are taken following the initial restoration reefs are stocked on the initial time step of runs with crushed shell equivalent to a height of 40 cm 5 158 103 kg individuals are stocked at a density of 400 individuals m 2 with initial individual deb volume at birth vi of 8 10 9 cm3 reef base dimensions x1 x2 fig 2 are fixed at 10 2 m inputs for simulations are time series of salinity psu temperature c and chlorophyll a µg l 1 representing physical environmental conditions and food source these were recorded at oyster landing ol 33 349 n 79 189 w in north inlet sc from january 1 1996 to august 1 2018 fig 3 and supplement 1 due to limited availability of chlorophyll data a derived single year time series is applied equally across years these data sets are managed by the university of south carolina s baruch institute for marine and coastal science as part of the noaa national estuarine research reserve system neer http cdmo baruch sc edu dges 2 4 ensemble modeling and parameter variation in simulation runs the oyster reef ibm is implemented in an ensemble modeling framework in which underlying processes that determine reef dynamics are varied over multiple simulation runs with a goal of identifying long term trends in the reef that are robust over model uncertainty and natural variability in these processes here variation is applied on predation larval settlement and the hydrodynamic constraint on the reef live layer functions describing these processes are varied by drawing key parameters from probability distributions which generally adjusts the magnitude of the function but not its form see supplement s1 15 this approach characterizes both natural variability of the ecosystem through the behavior of the distributions and parametric uncertainty of model functions by drawing select parameter values from distributions the hydrodynamic constraint is varied by drawing parameter ξ which regulates live layer depth equation 17 from a uniform distribution truncated between 10 and 30 cm note that this constraint is implemented as a volume based threshold values below 10 cm generally lead to reef decline in the model settlement patterns are varied across runs by adjusting the overall magnitude of rate parameter ρ equation 16 in addition to variation within runs as described earlier predator densities are varied similarly to settlement but only within runs finally effects of predator community composition are examined by developing five scenarios with varying predator membership all predators no predators predators 2 and 3 only predators 1 3 and predators 2 4 a total of 1 200 separate simulation runs are conducted for each scenario 2 5 model validation and sensitivity analysis the individual based modeling approach is designed to avoid biases of population level assumptions by simulating individual level mechanistic processes in detail whenever possible however assumptions at this level are necessary we examine these with two separate sets of simulations a model validation and sensitivity analysis individual growth in our deb submodel is validated against actual growth measurements collected during a comprehensive two year field study of tidal creek ecology creek dame et al 2000 which commenced the neer research program in north inlet in this study eight sites in clambank and town creeks adjacent to ol were sampled and growth was measured as change in shell length mm over regular 30 day intervals data portal https www baruch sc edu biological databases our simulations follow the same deployment and retrieval schedule of the creek study see supplement 3 using physical data from the nearby nerr clambank creek station cc 33 334 n 79 193 w the sensitivity of simulated oyster reef dynamics to key modeled underlying processes is also examined these include predation settlement and the hydrodynamic constraint which are varied in the ensemble framework and additionally the assumption that the surface area available for settlement on valves is greater than on live oysters this analysis is structured following the same methods as the ensemble modeling implementing multiple simulations with variability across and within runs however in the sensitivity analysis each function is additionally varied independently for the first three processes the parameters governing the probability distributions e g shape and scale parameters from which key function parameters are drawn are alternately increased and decreased thereby shifting the range of the function parameters without changing functional form this preserves the modeled variability in these underlying processes while testing sensitivity of the model to the assumptions of the distributions see supplement s1 15 for details parameters of the gamma and rayleigh distributions are adjusted by 20 and the range of the uniform distribution is shifted by 25 sensitivity to valve settlement area is examined by using the same constant of 2 in both equations 22 and 23 replacing 4 in the equation for valves only the scenario with all predators is considered for these sensitivity analyses totaling seven separate ensembles i e three processes varied in two directions modeled oyster reef dynamics of the sensitivity analyses are then compared to the original results 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions the temperature time series used in simulations fig 3 has considerable interannual variability with several abrupt changes between adjacent years most notably in winter e g 2002 2012 2017 interestingly the coldest winter in 2011 is preceded by one of the hottest summers in 2010 the overall salinity regime for this estuary is generally euhaline 30 40 psu with intermittent polyhaline 18 30 psu and infrequent mesohaline periods 5 18 psu note that the experimental salinity levels used to calibrate the deb model parameters in louisiana focus on the mesohaline range 3 25 psu lavaud et al 2017 which is not prevalent in north inlet sc thus the salinity correction on deb processes in simulations has minimal effect here 3 2 oyster reef dynamics single example an example of simulated dynamics for a single oyster reef are shown in fig 4 crushed shell settlement area dark line middle panel is highest at the beginning of runs when it is largely unoccupied 1996 gradually declines as the live oyster population grows and covers it and stabilizes around 2000 in the following years 2000 2013 settlement area on live oysters and valves increases as these populations increase total settlement habitat on valves fluctuates annually attaining approximately 3 to 6 times that of live oysters toward the end of runs 2010 to 2018 note that calculations of individual surface area differ only by a factor of two equations 22 23 settlement area on valves and live oysters stabilizes between 2010 and 2015 beginning in 2006 all values of settlement area fall to zero when the total volume determined by parameter ξ multipied by reef surface area is exceeded dotted line top panel to visualize this threshold ξ is shown here as an approximate height derived from this dynamic volume however it is not entirely analogous to other heights shown cohort dynamics of the live population bottom row are observed as changes in densities within size classes number m 2 in this example larger individuals adult sack remain relatively stable across years as they are replenished by recruits although recruitment varies considerably across years and within seasons for example see large peaks of spat in 2009 2014 and 2015 3 3 reef ensemble modeling predator community scenarios include variation in settlement rate ρ and volume constraint ξ over simulations the predominant difference by far is between scenarios with and without predators the absence of predators results in entirely different settlement and reef dynamics than the four scenarios with predators some differences among predator scenarios are present and these results are shown in supplement 4 for the remainder of results presented here we partition the output data into two groups one compiled across the four predator scenarios figs 5 6 and the other without predators figs 7 8 3 3 1 scenarios with predators simulations of biomass settlement habitat and observed population demography with predators show some multi year trends figs 5 6 the overall pattern is an initial loss of crushed shell in the first several years while the live population establishes followed by growth and saturation of the live population and then accumulation of valves and settlement habitat which also stabilize several years later total biomass on reefs varies considerably across simulations in some simulations the initial shell loss is recovered through live production the demographic structure of the population also passes through similar phases live oyster biomass gradually accumulates over the first ten years of simulations fig 5 second row then stabilizes between 2003 and 2009 for lower and upper quantiles respectively maintaining these levels until the end of runs in 2018 this timing difference indicates that some simulations reach volumetric capacity earlier than others valve biomass third row follows a similar pattern but does not stabilize until approximately 2013 and shows pronounced seasonal variation crushed shell biomass first row decreases considerably in the first seven to ten years from initial restored levels down to approximately 4 6 103 kg due to shell degradation exceeding production by the live population from this point on the trajectories of crushed shell diverge across simulations some continue along the declining trend while others show some recovery approaching restored levels by the end of runs this trend is also reflected in total reef biomass fig 5 bottom row which is comprised predominantly of crushed shell an order of magnitude higher than live oyster and valve biomass settlement habitat area fig 5 right column follows similar dynamics between shell types but with some differences across quantile ranges crushed shell settlement habitat first row declines in the initial years 1996 2002 similar to crushed biomass but remains at similar levels until the end of the simulation with some seasonal and annual fluctuation exceedance of threshold ξ indicated by zero values first occurs in simulations around 2002 although this limit is not reached in all runs settlement habitat on live oysters second row initially increases on average black line until 2002 where it stabilizes and then fluctuates similar to crushed shell the upper quantile for this variable gradually increases throughout runs although at a low rate compared to other variables settlement area on valves third row initially grows at a slower rate than live oysters but then exceeds it in 2000 and attains much higher levels overall toward the end of runs total settlement habitat on valves is approximately four times the amount on crushed shell or live oysters finally settlement habitat summed together across shell types bottom row shows an initial dip and recovery over the first six years as the live population is establishing settlement habitat is exceptionally high in 2012 and 2016 densities of live individuals under the predator scenario follow four approximate phases fig 6 these were the initial transient dynamics of the seed stock 1996 2000 followed by increase in densities of all size classes 2000 2005 then continued increase in lower size class densities and leveling off of upper classes 2005 2012 and finally culmination in a large recruitment year in 2012 with considerable interannual variability following it 2012 2018 during the first four years settlement is strongly coupled to spawning with two distinct settlement cohorts the initial cohort of oysters stocked in 1996 reaches the sack class in 1998 bottom row and the first reproductive cycle is completed with the arrival of new settlers in 1997 top row which reaches sack size in 2000 following this time spawning and settlement become more continuous throughout the season and cohorts become less distinguishable beginning in 2005 densities of the adult and sack classes remain at similar levels with noticeable spikes in 2008 2009 and 2013 due to increased settlement in years following milder winters these increases in larger size classes appear to be somewhat stepwise 3 3 2 scenarios with no predators scenarios with no predators figs 7 8 show three overall differences compared to those with predators none of the simulations recover the initial loss of crushed shell biomass incurred from 1996 to 2003 fig 7 left column and all continue along the trajectory of decline until the end of runs in 2018 settlement habitat is only intermittently available at much lower levels than in scenarios with predators and falls to zero every year for all simulations i e none maintain continuous availability finally individual densities are dominated by larger individuals see sack class fig 8 and settlement dynamics occur as single pulsed events each year the overall temporal pattern of whole live and valve biomass fig 7 second and third rows is similar to the scenario with predators however these variables reach the volume limit ξ much earlier whole live in 2000 and valve in 2006 and their levels relative to each other are inverted live biomass is consistently higher than valve and higher than levels with predators included valve biomass without predators does not exceed 100 kg in more than half of the simulations fig 5 in contrast to the predator scenarios the initial transient stocking period extends until approximately 2002 as indicated by the settlement habitat dynamics without predators fig 7 which is four years later than with predators consistent annual settlement cohorts are also delayed until then fig 8 finally densities of spat juvenile and adult classes are highly correlated with settlement dynamics suggesting that the system has no buffer for variability in settlement habitat when there are no predators interestingly some recruitment pulses come in regularly spaced two year couplets for example in 2002 2003 and 2009 2010 3 3 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of simulated oyster reef dynamics to the ensemble modeling assumptions are summarized in fig 9 each sensitivity ensemble columns 2 8 is compared to the original base ensemble column 1 by taking the mean median and quantiles τ 0 1 0 9 of the reef variables represented in figs 5 8 and calculating differences from equivalent base values this analysis uses only the latter years of simulations 2015 2018 when reefs have generally reached equilibrium base ensemble values are given in absolute units column 1 and all other columns list differences from the base colors and shading of the table indicate relative sensitivity computed as differences divided by the standard deviation of each base ensemble variable the four biomass variables kg and five individual density variables m 2 are generally most sensitive to changes in settlement rate ρ and to a lesser extent constraint parameter ξ one exception is live oyster whole biomass which is primarily sensitive to ξ and predator density the upper quantiles of individual density are particularly sensitive to ρ the four variables representing available settlement habitat area m2 have mixed responses the lower quantile τ 0 1 is most sensitive to increases in predation and parameter ξ both of which contribute to maintaining the live population below the volumetric limit the mean median and 0 9 quantile of valve and total settlement area are most sensitive intuitively to the ensemble where individual valve and live exposed surface areas are assumed equal column 8 sensitivity of biomass and individual densities to this ensemble are moderate but considerably less than to ρ note that the ratios of total valve settlement area to live for this ensemble are approximately double 1 7 1 9 2 0 and 2 2 for each metric respectively despite using the same constant corresponding measures for the base ensemble are 0 4 2 4 4 and 4 7 interestingly individual densities are not particularly sensitive to predator density but are somewhat elevated at the mean and upper quantile of the terminal sack size class 3 3 4 settlement habitat availability and live population the relationship between settlement habitat availability and the live population is shown in fig 10 this resembles a stock recruitment relationship insofar as it represents settlement potential based on habitat but does not account for recruit survival each light gray point in the figure indicates a single time step of simulation runs collectively they summarize trends across and within simulations total available settlement area per unit biomass top row and per individual density adult and sack class bottom row together represent the efficiency of the live population for generating settlement habitat under volumetric constraints given that total surface area and volume of the population vary with population size structure settlement area per live biomass top left panel is highest around 150 kg live biomass and abruptly converges to zero above this level this upper limit may be due to the population volume exceeding the limit ξ or settlement surfaces becoming completely covered or both settlement area is much higher for ratios of live to valve biomass above 1 top right panel lines indicating mean and median settlement area increase nonlinearly for values above 1 the relationship of settlement area to adult density bottom left is dome shaped with maxima around 200 individuals m 2 while the same relationship for the sack class bottom right resembles a sigmoidal or other saturating curve which increases between 50 and 100 individuals m 2 when sack densities are high high levels of settlement habitat are usually maintained in contrast settlement habitat falls to zero in nearly all simulations when adult densities are high as indicated by the divergence between the mean and median above 300 individuals m 2 this suggests that the exposed surface areas or volume of the population relative to ξ are saturated by many smaller individuals which taken together are less efficient at producing and exposing shell for settlement than larger individuals 4 discussion we developed an individual based model of oyster reef mechanics to simulate interacting effects of metabolism growth mortality predation and environmental conditions on the engineering and maintenance of reef structure by oyster populations the modeled reef functions as a complex adaptive system railsback 2001 with interrelated dynamics between the live population and reef shell across multiple scales of individuals population and physical habitat together these determine reef self organization key results of this study include new insights into the role of predators and mortality on the rates of shell production and turnover by the oyster reef system an important mechanism for generating settlement habitat in this model these include the overall amount of shell produced by the population the size of individual shells and their longevity on the reef and the transfer of shell to become settlement habitat all three of these aspects are determined by oyster growth and size at the individual level the overall population size and demographic size structure and mortality imposed externally through predation and other sources results of this study represent new hypotheses and predictions for how internal proximal drivers of the oyster population interact with external factors to determine reef self organization our oyster reef model can be broadly adapted to test these and other hypotheses and predictions in field studies it requires only three input data sets salinity temperature and food source and reasonable assumptions on predator dynamics mortality shell degradation and settlement which can be updated when better estimates become available three phases of reef dynamics that are robust across simulations are identified in the ensemble modeling 1 initial shell loss concurrent with live population growth 2 saturation of the live population and 3 saturation of settlement habitat the timing of these phases varies with levels of predation activity particularly the length of time required for the population to establish and overcome the initial transient stocking dynamics simulated reefs vary considerably in their ability to maintain sufficient shell biomass to support accretion and continuous availability of settlement habitat importantly accretion and settlement are linked mechanically through shell production in all simulations without predators reefs fall into decline and demonstrate highly correlated spawning and settlement due to intermittent settlement habitat availability the only mortality factors for this scenario are natural mortality burial and terminal age suggesting that larger sized oysters obstruct settlement by suppressing the exposure of valves simulations with predators show varying degrees of settlement habitat availability more than half provide continuous habitat for at least a large portion of simulation runs these results suggest that strongly correlated spawning stock recruitment cycles may indicate instability through discontinuous habitat availability and insufficient recruitment to sustain the population in contrast the somewhat decoupled continuous settlement habitat associated with more complex population size structures may mediate reef stability figs 5 6 10 also powell and klinck 2007 kuykendall et al 2015 we urge caution when interpreting the role of predators in this study our focus is on how oysters have evolved to interact with predators in a way that supports their long term persistence and not identify levels that drive the population to extinction in developing this ibm we draw from several previous modeling studies powell et al 1992 and hofmann et al 1994 developed a comprehensive suite of models which pioneered the examination of population level processes that emerge from individual physiology we follow a similar approach but replace their empirically derived filtration rates with the more mechanistic deb approach powell et al 2006 and powell and klinck 2007 developed mathematical equations for deriving rates of shell persistence on reefs wilberg et al 2013 developed a system of equations representing coupled dynamics of oyster and shell habitat at the population level and soniat et al 2012 developed a mathematical model which specified objectives for maintaining net balance of shell we incorporate these concepts of shell persistence net balance and coupled dynamics into a single platform additionally including properties of shell surface area which requires building up dynamics mechanistically from individuals through shell growth mortality and biomass accumulation we also allow for age and size to be somewhat independent insofar as they determine cohort dynamics moore et al 2016 found this distinction important in their integral projection model although it is often not included in matrix based modeling by explicitly tracking valves with individual variation we can examine the complex shell surfaces available for settlement with respect to population size and demographic size structure fig 10 our results showing that settlement area increases with both of these measures agree with those of schulte et al 2009 for restored high relief reefs see their fig 4 which were considerably more successful than low relief interestingly that study found a similar quadratic relationship between recruits and the adult population the results of our study are contingent on several limitations of the model assumed for the present application first mortality is applied generally at low levels we acknowledge that in real reefs mortality is a key agent for population decline particularly when stressors act in combination such as disease ford et al 2006 predation grabowski 2004 depletion of shell resources camp et al 2015 colden et al 2017 frederick et al 2016 limitation in food supply sedimentation colden et al 2017 jordan cooley et al 2011 and extreme and episodic environmental conditions la peyre et al 2016 lowe et al 2017 puckett and eggleston 2012 our focus here is to examine how mortality facilitates availability of settlement habitat thus we do not address this complexity of factors we model predation only as intermittent events and not as persistent and overwhelming predator outbreaks similarly we describe sedimentation implicitly as a probability of burial and keep the natural mortality function constant over time to simulate low levels of these mortalities which provide background regulation of the live oyster population material contribution of sedimentation is not examined here since this is highly variable across watersheds and time isphording and imsand 1991 liu and huang 2009 and research suggests that mortality from sedimentation only occurs when it exceeds 30 mm total and is maintained for over 28 days i e colden et al 2017 we do not allow any individuals to expire through loss of energy reserves in the deb routine which only occurs infrequently at very young ages 2 weeks finally we do not include anthropogenic harvest although we acknowledge that it can strongly determine oyster reef persistence camp et al 2015 modeling a complete oyster reef system including whole organisms and shell requires integrating information across field kuykendall et al 2015 powell et al 2006 powell and klinck 2007 and modeling studies hofmann et al 1994 lavaud et al 2017 w e pine et al 2015 powell et al 1992 that span several populations in the atlantic and gulf of mexico coasts usa we acknowledge that these populations may differ in genetics phenotype systems dynamics and other traits that could alter modeled outcomes our goal here is to develop a holistic model that sets testable predictions for any population of interest nichols and williams 2006 and not necessarily to describe a specific population we focus on developing a model based on mechanical principles that are common among populations e g energy flux shell surface area and whenever possible minimize assumptions of empirically derived parameters that may be population specific for example our modeled shell degradation is based on a population level annual rate determined for a delaware bay usa population powell and klinck 2007 we generalize this rate with respect to individual shell mechanics by modeling degradation at the daily scale as a function of individual shell biomass which is determined by individual growth in the deb model these individual degradation dynamics then combine in the model at the population level approximating the annual rates of powell klinck 2007 several physical constraints on reef geomorphology are applied in this study which may be more variable in real reef systems reef morphological dynamics are governed primarily by change in total volume of the assumed trapezoidal shaped reef the base horizontal dimensions x1 x2 fig 2 are fixed across simulations the constraint on live oyster volume ξ is fixed during runs and reef height h is assumed static across the spatial extent of the reef in real reefs these vary spatiotemporally as reef morphology interacts with dynamic landscape conditions and spatial heterogeneity in reef composition is likely a key property contributing to reef resilience this has been demonstrated for mussel beds liu et al 2014 and coral reefs toth et al 2019 but remains relatively unexamined for oyster reefs allowing for spatial expansion of shell habitat in future modeling studies may reduce the cumulative effect of the constraints imposed here for example the assumption of fixed base dimensions in our model precludes horizontal expansion which taken together with ξ imposes both vertical and horizontal limitations which may have facilitated the stepwise increases in individual density observed in later years of simulations nonetheless it is reasonable to assume that both types of constraints could be present in high wave energy or hydrodynamic environments it is also possible that ξ is dynamic on real reefs considering that changes in reef elevation or shell drag can attenuate wave energy allen and webb 2011 threshold effects of reef elevation are also possible such as found by colden et al 2017 however we do not include these here finally real reefs take many complex forms including elongated fringing winding or mounding bars which are determined largely by local bathymetry and hydrodynamics we do not assume any specific landscape effects in this study although factors such as reef elevation and location with respect to the tidal prism are known to impact growth and survival rates of oysters dame 1971 1972 despite these assumptions we believe that the present model achieves a reasonable compromise between simplification and complexity of the complicated reef building system and sets appropriate baselines for more targeted studies our oyster reef model can be applied to support restoration decision making oyster reefs are gaining increasing attention for their potential value for supporting shoreline stabilization for example through wave attenuation allen and webb 2011 currin et al 2010 piazza et al 2005 scyphers et al 2011 and for their self maintaining resilience properties bahr and lanier 1981 these ecosystem services could greatly reduce investment and maintenance costs allen and webb 2011 and greatly increase overall restoration value considering the ability of populations to stabilize themselves over large fluctuations in the physical environment e g drought flooding sea level change and their secondary benefits for ecosystems coen et al 2007 grabowski et al 2012 lipcius et al 2019 however the history of oyster reef restoration shows considerable uncertainty for example la peyre et al 2014 found that 27 of northern gulf of mexico restorations failed to maintain targets for live oyster density 0 oysters m 2 and 18 lacked elevational relief 0 l substrate m 2 such failures could be due to the inability of the reef to develop self organizing resilience properties therefore it is critical to know which conditions may contribute to the establishment of such resilience so that the correct information can be conveyed to restoration practitioners one of the chief concerns for restoration decision making is risk of investment losses due to various sources of uncertainty in this study we attempted to explain some of the uncertainty associated with reef resilience which is often extoled but poorly described in simulating single restorations we represented a management objective of investing in habitat and stock in the short term to promote long term population self maintenance which could considerably reduce overall costs our modeling shows some lags in the response of the reef to restorations which extends from five to eight years suggesting that return on investment may not become evident until later than expected during this time reefs may be particularly vulnerable as they recover from initial transient conditions we acknowledge that modeled outcomes show considerable variability across simulations our goal for this study is not to identify exact conditions that optimize restoration investment but to identify robust trends across simulations that improve scientific understanding of key mechanistic processes and thus offer insight into how restorations may be valued through time in this way predictions made by the reef model can support future studies in both ecology and decision analysis 5 conclusion this individual based model advances oyster modeling by representing reef dynamics as three dimensional mechanical processes internal drivers and external factors interact to determine reef self organization the model tracks these dynamics as they transfer across individual population and reef scales shell habitat functions as both material supporting reef geomorphology and as substrate regulating larval settlement results from the model show that the reef system maintains organization through efficient generation of settlement habitat measured with respect to live biomass and density of larger sized individuals this suggests that individual production population size structure and physical environmental constraints all contribute to reef self organization results also show important multi year lags in reef dynamics following restoration suggesting that a period of five to eight years may be necessary for the reef to recover and equilibrate before it maintains efficient production this modeling framework could be applied to support restoration decision making and to examine other self organizing systems such as coral or
