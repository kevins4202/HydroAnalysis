introduction wetlands serve human society in many ways such as through ecological restoration water purification irrigation and so on costanza et al 1989 1997 meanwhile as a unique hydrological landscape wetlands are considered ecologically sensitive and adaptive much attention has been given to the sustainable management of wetlands turner et al 2000 as for wetland flows analyzing the contaminant transport process is indispensable to wastewater treatment and environmental risk assessment associated with either natural or constructed wetlands carvalho et al 2009 costanza et al 1997 us epa 1999 many studies on the environmental dispersion in wetland flows have been made nepf and ghisalberti 2008 analyzed dispersivity in a wetland with emergent vegetation as the wetland is considered a kind of porous media in the field of wetland science based on taylor s analysis on dispersivity 1953 the environmental dispersion in wetland flows focused on the macroscopic scale and thus far the contaminant transport process has been analyzed with the phase average method rajagopal and tao 1995 liu and masliyah 2005 in many past studies chen et al 2010 wu et al 2011a b zeng and chen 2011 2012 chen 2013 however these studies only considered the velocity profile and contaminant dispersion with the absence of wind effect which typically exists in natural wetland flows zeng et al 2012 nevertheless the effect of wind force on environmental dispersion should also be considered in analysis of environmental dispersion in wetland flows wind stress has been analyzed in the movement of water masses in the ocean smith 1980 munk 1950 the wind is also found as an important factor for circulation in the estuary and plume maccready et al 2009 besides wind effect has been considered in sediment dispersion pattern in a shallow lake by sheng and lick 1979 what s more the wind can even lead to sediment resuspension when the wind velocity exceeds the critical value carper and bachmann 1984 given that the wind can create a drag on the free surface of wetland flows the velocity profile and concentration distribution of the free surface can be directly influenced by the wind force the wind can even cause an inverse layer when the upstream wind force is big enough moreover both wind force and wind direction can change the velocity structure and affect the environmental dispersion luo et al 2017 given that wind force and direction can indirectly influence environmental dispersion wu 1969 understanding its effect is essential in environmental dispersion analysis by considering wind force and direction zeng et al 2012 analyzed the contaminant transport process in wetland flows under the effect of wind based on the concentration moments method proposed by aris 1956 1960 they obtained the mean longitudinal concentration distribution by adopting up to 2nd order moments on the basis of gill s theory gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 gill 1967 luo et al 2017 analyzed environmental dispersion in wetland flows by considering wind effect via asymptotic analysis in which they omitted the third and higher order derivative terms of the average concentration however the higher order concentration moments illustrating skewness 3rd concentration moment and kurtosis 4th concentration moment of the mean concentration distribution the asymmetry and derivations occurring at the initial stage were not taken into account once the effect of wind is considered the accuracy of approximation obtained by up to the 2nd gill expansion cannot be satisfied considering the effect of wind the dispersion model becomes too complicated when only the taylor dispersion model is adopted in this case the higher order expansion based on gill s theory should be used to improve accuracy at the initial stage in order to improve accuracy wang 2016 and wang and chen 2016 combined the concentration moments method proposed by aris 1956 and gill s expansion resulting in an approach called the aris gill method jiang et al 2017 the current work adopts up to 4th order concentration moments and gill expansions to analyze the environmental dispersion in wetland flows this method not only significantly enhance the accuracy in the small time scale it can also derive the vertical concentration distribution with the effect of wind although zeng et al 2012 and luo et al 2017 have analyzed the vertical concentration distribution in wetland flows under wind effect they only gave the average vertical concentration distribution by adopting the 1st order expansion of gill s method gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 gill 1967 wu et al 2015 analyzed the multi dimensional concentration distribution in the present work which aims to improve the order of solution the two dimensional 2d concentration distribution is obtained this work also examines the wind effect on the derivation of the local free surface concentration dispersion and the local bed surface concentration dispersion from mean contaminant dispersion furthermore this study analyzes the two dimensional contaminant concentration distribution in wetland flows under wind effect we extended the findings of a prior research wu et al 2015 in order to investigate the wind effect on the complete contaminant process especially at the initial time scale we adopted the dimensionless parameters er and ω to illustrate the wind force and wind direction respectively through the aris gill expansion method the following objectives have been achieved a to discuss the effect of wind on the skewness and kurtosis b to obtain the wind effect on the mean concentration distribution at the initial stage by using up to fourth hermite polynomials expansion c to illustrate the complete vertical concentration distribution by adopting up to the fourth expansion of gill s method d to represent the derivation between the concentration distribution at the boundaries and the mean concentration distribution and e to provide the two dimensional concentration distribution 2 materials and methods 2 1 formulation 1 ϕ c t u c κ λ ϕ c κ k c in the equation above c represents the concentration kg m 3 t is the time s φ is the porosity dimensionless u is the velocity m s 1 κ is the tortuosity illustrating the spatial structure of the porous media dimensionless λ represents concentration diffusivity m2s 1 and k is the concentration dispersivity tensor m2s 1 considering that the flow is unidirectional and fully developed in a wetland as illustrated in fig 1 eq 1 can be simplified into 2 c t u ϕ c x κ λ k ϕ 2 c x 2 2 c y 2 x 0 y h t 0 in eq 1 h represents the depth of the wetland the boundary conditions considering the non penetrate bed and free surface are given by 3 c y y 0 0 c y y h 0 as the finite amount release of contaminant the upstream and downstream concentration condition can be written as 4 c x 0 with the instantaneous and uniform release of contaminant the initial contaminant condition in which mass q is at t 0 and at the cross section x 0 can be written as 5 c x y t t 0 q δ x ϕ h where δ x is the dirac delta function applying the dimensionless method to the parameters we arrive at ζ y h ψ u u c u c dp dx h 2 κ μ l v pe u c h ϕ κ λ k ϕ τ κ λ k ϕ h 2 t ω ϕ h 2 q c ξ x u c ψ t ϕ h x u t ϕ h the vertical average operation is defined as 6 f 0 1 f d ζ thus eq 1 turns into 7 ω τ pe ψ ω ξ 2 ω ξ 2 2 ω ζ 2 ξ 0 ζ 1 τ 0 where ψ ψ ψ and ψ is the derivation of vertical velocity the boundary conditions can be rewritten as 8 ω ζ ζ 0 ω ζ ζ 1 0 the contaminant conditions turn to 9 ω ξ 0 ω τ 0 0 considering the effect of wind on the wetland flow with free surface a previous research has provided the derivation of vertical velocity profile zeng et al 2012 which is expressed as 10 ψ sinh α α cosh α 1 ζ α 3 cosh α ω er α sinh α ζ 1 cosh α α 2 cosh α where α μ fh 2 κ μ l yy er c d ρ air u wind 2 2 h d p d x we note that the derivation of velocity ψ is affected by the parameters α and er apart from the ratio of location and depth ζ parameter α represents the combined effect including the viscous friction of vegetation f the curvature of flow κ the viscosity μ the depth of wetland h and the effect of velocity difference on a micro scale lyy meanwhile er represents the effect of wind it is inversely proportional with pressure gradient and is proportional with the relative strength of wind force the value of er is affected by the wind drag coefficient cd the density of air ρ air the wind velocity ud and the depth of the wetland h the vertical fluctuating velocity profiles with different wind directions are illustrated in fig 2 in which ω 1 the absolute value of ψ at free surface and bed surface becomes larger as er increases meanwhile as ω 1 the variation of ψ absolute value does not strictly monotonically increase and the moderate absolute value of ψ is the minimum at the boundary surfaces therefore wind can produce a drag on the free surface and can thus affect the whole velocity structure in the wetland flows 2 2 extension of the aris gill theory for analyzing concentration distribution 2 2 1 aris moments based mean concentration distribution in order to reduce the space dimension and obtain the asymptotic solution of eq 7 we adopt the theory of aris 1956 which is based on concentration moments here the asymptotic solution of mean concentration is obtained with the application of the 4th order hermite polynomials expansion andersson and berglin 1981 mazumder and das 1992 the p th order concentration moment defined by aris 1956 is given by 11 ω p ζ τ ξ p ω ξ ζ τ d ξ p 0 1 the cross sectional mean concentration moment is expressed as 12 m p τ 0 1 ω p ζ τ d ζ ω p p 0 1 as demonstrated by aris in 1956 eq 1 turns into 13 ω p τ 2 ω p ζ 2 ppe ψ ω p 1 p p 1 ω p 2 0 η 1 τ 0 p 0 1 the initial conditions are as follows 14 ω 0 ζ τ τ 0 1 15 ω p ζ τ τ 0 0 p 1 2 3 where ω 1 ω 2 0 given that eq 13 is a partial differential equation parameter ω p can be solved by the method of green s function one after another at this point ω p can be constructed as 16 ω p ζ τ 0 τ 0 1 gs p ζ τ d ζ d τ 0 1 g ω p ζ τ τ 0 d ζ 0 τ g ω p ζ τ ζ ζ 0 ζ 1 according to the boundary condition ω p can be reduced to 17 ω p ζ τ 0 τ 0 1 gs p ζ τ d ζ d τ where g ζ τ ζ τ is the green s function and sp is the source term 18 g τ 2 g ζ 2 δ τ τ δ ζ ζ 0 η 1 τ 0 19 g ζ ζ 0 g ζ ζ 1 0 g 0 τ τ the green s function can be obtained via integral transformation as follows 20 g ζ τ ζ τ 1 2 n 1 e n 2 π 2 τ τ cos n π ζ cos n π ζ 21 s p ζ τ ppe ψ ω p 1 p p 1 ω p 2 p 0 1 in this paper we have 22 ω 0 ζ τ 1 p 0 23 ω p ζ τ 0 τ 0 1 gs p ζ τ d ζ d τ p 1 2 3 the p th order central concentration moment is defined as 24 ν p τ ξ ν p ω d ξ ω d ξ p 0 1 2 in this case we have 25 m 1 0 26 ν m 1 m 0 0 thus we obtain 27 ν p m p m 0 based on the hermite polynomials expansion we obtain the approximate solution of mean concentration distribution with non gaussian curves mehta et al 1974 andersson and berglin 1981 mazumder and das 1992 in order to illustrate the mean concentration distribution especially in earlier stage during which the effects of skewness and kurtosis cannot be neglected the 4th order hermite polynomials is expressed as 28 ω ξ τ ν 0 e ξ 1 2 n 0 a n τ h n ξ 1 where 29 ξ 1 ξ ν 2 ν 2 ξ 2 ν 2 the hermite polynomials hi are expressed by a recurrence relation as 30 h i 1 x 2 xh i x 2 ih i 1 x i 0 1 2 where h 0 x 1 and the values of a i are given as a 0 1 2 π ν 2 a 1 0 a 2 0 a 3 2 a 0 ν 3 24 ν 2 3 2 a 4 a 0 96 ν 4 ν 2 2 3 2 2 2 extension of gill s series expansion for concentration distribution the two dimensional concentration distribution can be obtained by adopting the extension of gill s series expansion gill 1967 gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 based on the solution of mean concentration provided by the method of concentration moments wang 2016 wang and chen 2016 the expression of the 4th order two dimensional concentration distribution is given by 31 ω ξ ζ τ k 0 f k ζ τ k ω ξ τ ξ k k 0 1 and 32 ω ξ τ τ i 1 a i τ i ω ξ τ ξ i i 1 2 in order to obtain the two dimensional concentration distribution we must first obtain the solution of f k ζ τ one after another by comparing the corresponding coefficient of k ω ξ k we have 33 f k τ 2 f k ζ 2 pe ψ f k 1 f k 2 i 1 k a i τ f k i k 1 2 3 where f 0 1 and f 1 f 2 0 the boundary conditions are given by 34 f k ζ ζ 0 0 f k ζ ζ 1 0 k 1 2 3 and the initial condition is expressed as 35 f k ζ τ τ 0 0 k 1 2 3 adopting the vertical average operation to eq 30 and eq 28 we arrive at 36 0 1 f k ζ τ d ζ 0 k 1 2 3 37 a 1 pe 0 1 ψ d ζ 0 38 a 2 1 pe 0 1 ψ f 1 d ζ 39 a k τ pe 0 1 ψ f k 1 d ζ k 3 4 adopting the green s function f k and a k can be obtained one after another and the source term s p ζ τ for f k ζ τ is expressed as 40 s k ζ τ pe ψ f k 1 f k 2 i 1 k a i τ f k i p 1 2 3 the f k ζ τ can be obtained as 41 f k ζ τ 0 τ 0 1 g ζ τ ζ τ s k ζ τ d ζ d τ p 1 2 3 where f 0 1 f 1 0 in a previous research on contaminant transport process in wetland flows affected by wind zeng et al 2012 provided the mean contaminant concentration distribution with standard gaussian distribution by using the method of concentration moments however the two dimensional concentration distributions have not been given luo et al 2017 meanwhile adopted gill s theory but neglected the third and higher order derivative terms nevertheless the 2nd order expansion asymptotic analysis would only be applied effectively on large time scale nevertheless the very initial stage at which the vertical concentration is non uniform is relatively long wu and chen 2014a b thus up to 4th order expansion is adopted in this paper in order to make the concentration distribution more accurate on a small time scale while considering the wind effect 3 results and discussion 3 1 skewness and kurtosis skewness and kurtosis respectively correspond to up to the 3rd and 4th order moments and both of them are essential to study the concentration distribution especially at the initial stage here skewness and kurtosis are respectively defined as 42 γ 1 τ ν 3 ν 2 3 2 43 γ 2 τ ν 4 ν 2 2 3 the skewness and kurtosis both can make effect on contaminant distribution at the initial stage as shown in fig 3 a and b the dimensionless parameter er represents the effort of wind intensity on the skewness as shown in fig 3 a skewness measures the asymmetry of distribution the negative skewness indicates that the concentration distribution in the downstream flow would be fatter than that in the upstream flow that is the concentration distribution becomes downstream oblique the values of all curves in fig 3 a are negative moreover as τ increases all the skewness gradually approaches zero and the concentration distribution becomes increasingly more symmetrical with respect to the ξ axis as shown in fig 3 a skewness increases with increments of er when ω 1 at the same time whereas the condition would be different when ω 1 skewness decreases as er increases at the given time we note that the curves with the same value of er and the reverse mark have a roughly symmetrical distribution about the curve with er 0 the discipline of kurtosis that can measure the outliers of the contaminant distribution in fig 3 b is similar the tails of platykurtic distribution would be thinner compared with the gaussian distribution as kurtosis is negative also called sub gaussian distribution as shown in fig 3 b the values of all the curves approach zero gradually with sufficient time thus indicating that the contaminant distribution tend to be the gaussian distribution as τ the curve of er 0 is in the center as ω 1 at which point the kurtosis decreases the absolute value of kurtosis increases when the er increases indicating that a bigger er can lead to more significant discrepancies on peak of the concentration distribution on the contrary when ω 1 the kurtosis increases the absolute value of kurtosis decreases with the increment of er and thus the larger er is more inclined toward the standard gaussian distribution 3 2 mean concentration distribution 3 2 1 comparison with classical gaussian distribution adopting the 4th order hermite polynomials expansion the mean concentration distribution is obtained compared with the analysis of zeng et al 2012 fig 4 illustrates the effect of parameter er on the mean concentration distributions as can be seen not only the wind force er but also the wind direction ω 1 can affect the mean concentration distribution on the small time scale in this case we adopt pe 10 000 and τ 1 in order to reduce the pe dependence we also employ the ξ pe pe ω coordinate system wu and chen 2014b wu et al 2015 as shown in fig 4 when ω 1 the symmetry of the 4th order mean concentration distribution is more significant with a bigger er we note that the two curves are almost the same when er 1 0 and the maximum of mean concentration distribution decreases as er increases indicating that the increment of wind force with the downstream direction can promote the dispersion process however when ω 1 the derivation would be more noticeable compared with that from the classical gaussian distribution under the wind with downstream direction especially with the larger er furthermore the peak of mean concentration distribution with the smaller upstream wind er 0 2 is considerably higher than that with no wind nevertheless the larger upstream wind er 1 0 lowers the peak value of mean concentration under no wind condition generally the results of the mean longitudinal concentration distribution agree with those presented in previous works zeng et al 2012 luo et al 2017 3 2 2 contaminant transport process analysis the mean concentration distributions at different times are shown in fig 5 as can be seen the peak of each curve representing concentration distribution with the same wind intensity is lowered with the increment of time regardless of the wind direction that is the concentration distribution would be more uniform as time passes as ω 1 0 the maximum of concentration distribution decreases when wind force becomes stronger at one point as shown in the results the increment of er tends to make the time at which the taylor s dispersion model holds ahead when the wind direction is the same as that of the wetland flows ω 1 in contrast as the wind is in the reverse direction the less wind force er 0 2 maintains the peak that is higher than the maximum of concentration distribution without the wind effect er 0 at a certain point however with the larger er er 1 0 the distribution becomes more uniform in order to analyze the complex effect of upstream wind on environmental dispersion as shown in table 1 we make a research on the maximums of ω which can represent the environmental dispersion condition with different er at three time states the result shows that the value of maximums first increases to the crest value and then decreases as the increment of er the value can be even lower than that of the mean concentration distribution s maximum with no wind er 0 when the upstream wind force is large enough er 1 0 indicating that the large upstream wind force can promote the dipsersivity in addition the largest value among these average concentration maximums always comes around er 0 5 under the same time condition indicating that the moderate upstream wind force can make the most significant effect on restraining the procession of environmental dispersion the wind effect on dispersion is associated with the velocity profile of wetland flows for the wind force would make a drag on the free surface directly and then the whole velocity profile would be changed zeng et al 2012 the velocity profile in the wetland flow under the upstream wind has been studied by zeng et al 2012 the absolute value of velocity first decreases to nearly zero and then increases as the upstream forces rises thus the peak of concentration distribution would be higher with smaller wind force er 0 2 than that with no wind as a result of the reduction in absolute value of velocity apparently the moderate upstream wind force leads to the least absolute value of velocity resulting in the most suppression on the dispersivity and the promotion only happens as the upstream wind force is huge er 1 0 for only the absolute value of velocity under the upstream wind increases to be large enough can the upstream wind lead to the lower peak value compared with that under no wind er 0 3 3 two dimensional concentration distribution analysis 3 3 1 vertical concentration distribution the vertical concentration is derived by using up to the 4th order expansion of gill s expansion method fig 6 illustrates the variation of vertical concentration distribution from the 0th to the 4th order expansion with er 0 0 2 1 and ω 1 in the vertical section ξ 0 at the same time τ 1 as can be seen the derivation of higher order expansion is considerable thus the mean concentration distribution f 0 zeng et al 2012 is rough on a small time scale however the derivation of f 1 is the most significant and the contributions of derivation made by f 2 to f 4 are not so noticeable as the effect of the higher order expansion on the asymmetry of distribution is discussed in terms of mean concentration distribution the higher order expansion can lead to different efforts on vertical concentration distribution when the force and direction of the wind change as shown in fig 6 the concentration with the 1st to 4th order expansion would decrease with the increment of ζ as ω 1 moreover the derivation between the higher order distribution and the mean concentration distribution tends to decline with the larger wind force er nevertheless the condition would be more complicated when ω 1 as er 0 2 the concentration still decreases with ζ increases however the tendency of concentration distribution with the increment of ζ is totally different when er 1 0 thus indicating that the concentration increases when ζ increases as the wind force with upstream direction becomes enough furthermore the derivation between the vertical concentration and mean concentration is significant with the gentle wind er 0 2 however this becomes faint with the larger er er 1 0 generally with the same value of er the derivation is more significant when ω 1 and we can remark that the concentration with higher order expansion is roughly the same with the mean concentration at about ζ 0 5 the result indicates that previous analysis of mean concentration cannot illustrate the vertical concentration distribution precisely at the initial condition therefore the higher order expansion can help produce more accurate concentration distributions with accounting for the existence of the wind force 3 3 2 longitudinal concentration distribution in order to analyze the longitudinal concentration distribution at different heights the longitudinal concentration distributions at the bottom the depth of h 2 and the free surface of wetland ζ 0 ζ 0 5 ζ 1 0 are compared with the mean concentration distribution with τ 1 as illustrated in fig 7 all the concentration distributions with the effect of different values of er and ω at ζ 0 5 completely agree with the mean concentration distributions this finding indicates that the mean concentration distribution can predict the longitudinal concentration distribution at the center depth of the wetland however the maximums of concentration distributions at the bed and the surface of the wetland are larger than those of the mean concentration distributions as for ω 1 0 the maximums of surface concentration distributions are bigger than those of bed concentration distributions and the difference between them is reduced with the larger er fig 7 also represents the deviation of concentration distribution from gaussian distribution at different depths of the wetland as can be seen asymmetry exists in both the longitudinal concentration distribution of the surface and the bed ζ 1 0 ζ 0 however the feature of the two boundary surface concentration distributions are different under the downstream wind the downstream concentration of the free surface ζ 1 0 would be more uniform than that of upstream concentration on the contrary the bed concentration distribution would be fatter in the upstream flow thus indicating that the concentration distribution there would be more uniform in the upstream flow the differences among the surface concentration distributions the bed concentration distribution and the concentration distribution at 0 5h surface become less significant with the larger er indicating that the wind with downstream direction is a push factor of the contaminant dispersion process meanwhile with ω 1 0 the free surface concentration distribution of the upstream flow is more uniform than that of upstream flow and the downstream concentration distribution is less uniform at the bed with er 0 2 however when the wind force with the upstream direction is big enough the case would be the opposite the concentration distribution of the downstream flow becomes more uniform than that of upstream flow at the free surface inversely the concentration distribution of the bed is downstream oblique and the peak of the bed concentration distribution becomes even higher than that of free surface concentration distribution the result also indicates that when the intensity of upstream wind is big enough the drag force can promote environmental dispersion 3 3 3 two dimensional concentration distribution the two dimensional concentration distributions at the same time τ 1 are illustrated in fig 8 along with the effect of different wind forces as shown in fig 8 a c and e the maximum of the two dimensional concentration distribution decreases with the increment of er with ω 1 this result agrees with that of the mean concentration distribution analysis with the larger downstream wind force er 1 0 the peak of concentration distribution becomes lower indicating that dispersivity is facilitated meanwhile when ω 1 fig 8 a b and d the maximum of two dimensional concentrations does not monotonically increase with the increment of er rather the peak of the two dimensional distribution is higher when er 0 2 moreover the peak of concentration distribution remains higher with the smaller upstream wind during the process of advection diffussion indicating that the slow decaying transient effect is caused by the smaller upstream wind wu and chen 2014a as for the maximum of two dimensional concentration distribution under stronger upstream wind er 1 0 it becomes smaller than that with no wind thus illustrating the accelerating function during the contaminant transport process which also agrees with the result of the mean concentration analysis the local maximum of two dimensional concentration distribution as shown in fig 8 can be found at the boundaries which agrees with the result of vertical concentration distribution analysis as the wind is downstream ω 1 the maximum of vertical concentration at the free surface ζ 1 is larger than that at the bottom indicating that the local contaminant dispersion process is stronger at the free surface for the lower velocity shear rate and that the non penetration bed allows the vertical diffusion in one direction jiang et al 2017 meanwhile the maximum of local vertical concentration distributions at the bottom is smaller than that at the free surface however when the upstream wind force is big enough the local vertical concentration maximum at the bottom is larger than that at the free surface thus indicating that the larger intensity of the upstream wind promotes the process of contaminant dispersion 4 applications in this application an instantaneous release of plumbum pb with q 1 kg m 1 in wetland flows is considered we focus on the evolution of the two dimensional concentration distributions in this case considering the typical parameters of the wetland flow as ϕ 0 9 us epa 1999 mean diameter of stem d 2 0 10 2 m mitsch and gosselink 1993 h 1 0 m and u 0 2 m s 1 the tortuosity of a porous medium for systems with high porosity can be calculated by the bruggeman equation liu and masliyah 2005 as 44 κ ϕ the shear factor f is derived ergun 1952 as 45 f 150 1 ϕ 2 d 2 ϕ 3 ambient water properties are ρ 1 0 10 3 kgm 3 μ 1 0 10 3 kgm 1 s 1 and λ 1 0 10 5

vertical concentration dispersivity can be expressed liu and masliyah 2005 as 46 l 160 re d μ ϕ 11 3 1 ϕ 2 3 4 0 25 re d 100 re d 1 2 10 6 re d 1 47 k 160 pe d λ ϕ 11 3 1 ϕ 2 3 4 0 25 pe d 100 pe d 1 2 10 6 pe d 1 then we have κ 0 95 f 5 14 10 3 m 2 l 3 32 kgm 1 s 1 k 3 91 10 3 m 2 s 1 the evolution of the mean concentration distribution is illustrated as fig 9 the mean concentration distribution of pb decreases as the increment of time under both upstream wind and downstream wind it is apparently that the mean longitudinal concentration distribution is not gaussian distribution and maximums of the mean concentration distribution under the upstream wind are larger than those under the downstream wind at the same time the evolution of the vertical concentration distribution of pb at ξ 0 m is shown in fig 10 the derivations of the vertical concentration distribution can be significant at the initial stage and the vertical concentration distribution becomes uniform when time is large enough and the derivation of the vertical concentration distribution under the upstream wind is more significant than that with the effect of the downstream wind at the same time which is consist with the analysis of vertical concentration distribution the vertical concentration distribution of contaminant was not obtained by previous models 5 conclusions based on the combination of concentration moments method by aris and gill s theory this work analyzes the wind effect on contaminant dispersion in wetland flows with higher order expansions which can produce more accurate results on a small time scale in addition we analyzed the two dimensional concentration distributions with the effect of wind the dimensionless parameter er is used to illustrate wind force whereas the dimensionless parameter ω illustrates the wind direction the impact of both wind force and wind direction on dispersivity have been demonstrated as shown in the results when the direction of the wind is downstream the larger wind force can strengthen the symmetry of the mean concentration distribution promote the uniformity of vertical concentration distribution and decrease the longitudinal concentration distribution the downstream wind can promote the dispersivity as a result in addition with the downstream wind the local concentration maximum of boundaries in the two dimensional concentration distribution occurs at the free surface of the wetland in comparison with the upstream wind the asymmetry of mean concentration distribution turn is reinforced and the uniformity of vertical concentration distribution and the maximum of longitudinal distribution no longer monotonically change with the increment of wind intensity furthermore the environmental dispersion can be weakened with the small wind force whereas the contaminant dispersion can be reinforced as the wind force becomes big enough finally the local maximum of boundaries can even occur at the non penetration bottom when the upstream wind force is sufficient acknowledgement this work was financially supported by the natural science foundation of china nos 51439007 11172218 and 11372232

and bachmann 1984 given that the wind can create a drag on the free surface of wetland flows the velocity profile and concentration distribution of the free surface can be directly influenced by the wind force the wind can even cause an inverse layer when the upstream wind force is big enough moreover both wind force and wind direction can change the velocity structure and affect the environmental dispersion luo et al 2017 given that wind force and direction can indirectly influence environmental dispersion wu 1969 understanding its effect is essential in environmental dispersion analysis by considering wind force and direction zeng et al 2012 analyzed the contaminant transport process in wetland flows under the effect of wind based on the concentration moments method proposed by aris 1956 1960 they obtained the mean longitudinal concentration distribution by adopting up to 2nd order moments on the basis of gill s theory gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 gill 1967 luo et al 2017 analyzed environmental dispersion in wetland flows by considering wind effect via asymptotic analysis in which they omitted the third and higher order derivative terms of the average concentration however the higher order concentration moments illustrating skewness 3rd concentration moment and kurtosis 4th concentration moment of the mean concentration distribution the asymmetry and derivations occurring at the initial stage were not taken into account once the effect of wind is considered the accuracy of approximation obtained by up to the 2nd gill expansion cannot be satisfied considering the effect of wind the dispersion model becomes too complicated when only the taylor dispersion model is adopted in this case the higher order expansion based on gill s theory should be used to improve accuracy at the initial stage in order to improve accuracy wang 2016 and wang and chen 2016 combined the concentration moments method proposed by aris 1956 and gill s expansion resulting in an approach called the aris gill method jiang et al 2017 the current work adopts up to 4th order concentration moments and gill expansions to analyze the environmental dispersion in wetland flows this method not only significantly enhance the accuracy in the small time scale it can also derive the vertical concentration distribution with the effect of wind although zeng et al 2012 and luo et al 2017 have analyzed the vertical concentration distribution in wetland flows under wind effect they only gave the average vertical concentration distribution by adopting the 1st order expansion of gill s method gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 gill 1967 wu et al 2015 analyzed the multi dimensional concentration distribution in the present work which aims to improve the order of solution the two dimensional 2d concentration distribution is obtained this work also examines the wind effect on the derivation of the local free surface concentration dispersion and the local bed surface concentration dispersion from mean contaminant dispersion furthermore this study analyzes the two dimensional contaminant concentration distribution in wetland flows under wind effect we extended the findings of a prior research wu et al 2015 in order to investigate the wind effect on the complete contaminant process especially at the initial time scale we adopted the dimensionless parameters er and ω to illustrate the wind force and wind direction respectively through the aris gill expansion method the following objectives have been achieved a to discuss the effect of wind on the skewness and kurtosis b to obtain the wind effect on the mean concentration distribution at the initial stage by using up to fourth hermite polynomials expansion c to illustrate the complete vertical concentration distribution by adopting up to the fourth expansion of gill s method d to represent the derivation between the concentration distribution at the boundaries and the mean concentration distribution and e to provide the two dimensional concentration distribution 2 materials and methods 2 1 formulation 1 ϕ c t u c κ λ ϕ c κ k c in the equation above c represents the concentration kg m 3 t is the time s φ is the porosity dimensionless u is the velocity m s 1 κ is the tortuosity illustrating the spatial structure of the porous media dimensionless λ represents concentration diffusivity m2s 1 and k is the concentration dispersivity tensor m2s 1 considering that the flow is unidirectional and fully developed in a wetland as illustrated in fig 1 eq 1 can be simplified into 2 c t u ϕ c x κ λ k ϕ 2 c x 2 2 c y 2 x 0 y h t 0 in eq 1 h represents the depth of the wetland the boundary conditions considering the non penetrate bed and free surface are given by 3 c y y 0 0 c y y h 0 as the finite amount release of contaminant the upstream and downstream concentration condition can be written as 4 c x 0 with the instantaneous and uniform release of contaminant the initial contaminant condition in which mass q is at t 0 and at the cross section x 0 can be written as 5 c x y t t 0 q δ x ϕ h where δ x is the dirac delta function applying the

defined as 6 f 0 1 f d ζ thus eq 1 turns into 7 ω τ pe ψ ω ξ 2 ω ξ 2 2 ω ζ 2 ξ 0 ζ 1 τ 0 where ψ ψ ψ and ψ is the derivation of vertical velocity the boundary conditions can be rewritten as 8 ω ζ ζ 0 ω ζ ζ 1 0 the contaminant conditions turn to 9 ω ξ 0 ω τ 0 0 considering the effect of wind on the wetland flow with free surface a previous research has provided the derivation of vertical velocity profile zeng et al 2012 which is expressed as 10 ψ sinh α α cosh α 1 ζ α 3 cosh α ω er α sinh α ζ 1 cosh α α 2 cosh α where α μ fh 2 κ μ l yy er c d ρ air u wind 2 2 h d p d x we note that the derivation of velocity ψ is affected by the parameters α and er apart from the ratio of location and depth ζ parameter α represents the combined effect including the viscous friction of vegetation f the curvature of flow κ the viscosity μ the depth of wetland h and the effect of velocity difference on a micro scale lyy meanwhile er represents the effect of wind it is inversely proportional with pressure gradient and is proportional with the relative strength of wind force the value of er is affected by the wind drag coefficient cd the density of air ρ air the wind velocity ud and the depth of the wetland h the vertical fluctuating velocity profiles with different wind directions are illustrated in fig 2 in which ω 1 the absolute value of ψ at free surface and bed surface becomes larger as er increases meanwhile as ω 1 the variation of ψ absolute value does not strictly monotonically increase and the moderate absolute value of ψ is the minimum at the boundary surfaces therefore wind can produce a drag on the free surface and can thus affect the whole velocity structure in the wetland flows 2 2 extension of the aris gill theory for analyzing concentration distribution 2 2 1 aris moments based mean concentration distribution in order to reduce the space dimension and obtain the asymptotic solution of eq 7 we adopt the theory of aris 1956 which is based on concentration moments here the asymptotic solution of mean concentration is obtained with the application of the 4th order hermite polynomials expansion andersson and berglin 1981 mazumder and das 1992 the p th order concentration moment defined by aris 1956 is given by 11 ω p ζ τ ξ p ω ξ ζ τ d ξ p 0 1 the cross sectional mean concentration moment is expressed as 12 m p τ 0 1 ω p ζ τ d ζ ω p p 0 1 as demonstrated by aris in 1956 eq 1 turns into 13 ω p τ 2 ω p ζ 2 ppe ψ ω p 1 p p 1 ω p 2 0 η 1 τ 0 p 0 1 the initial conditions are as follows 14 ω 0 ζ τ τ 0 1 15 ω p ζ τ τ 0 0 p 1 2 3 where ω 1 ω 2 0 given that eq

ω d ξ p 0 1 2 in this case we have 25 m 1 0 26 ν m 1 m 0 0 thus we obtain 27 ν p m p m 0 based on the hermite polynomials expansion we obtain the approximate solution of mean concentration distribution with non gaussian curves mehta et al 1974 andersson and berglin 1981 mazumder and das 1992 in order to illustrate the mean concentration distribution especially in earlier stage during which the effects of skewness and kurtosis cannot be neglected the 4th order hermite polynomials is expressed as 28 ω ξ τ ν 0 e ξ 1 2 n 0 a n τ h n ξ 1 where 29 ξ 1 ξ ν 2 ν 2 ξ 2 ν 2 the hermite polynomials hi are expressed by a recurrence relation as 30 h i 1 x 2 xh i x 2 ih i 1 x i 0 1 2 where h 0 x 1 and the values of a i are given as a 0 1 2 π ν 2 a 1 0 a 2 0 a 3 2 a 0 ν 3 24 ν 2 3 2 a 4 a 0 96 ν 4 ν 2 2 3 2 2 2 extension of gill s series expansion for concentration distribution the two dimensional concentration distribution can be obtained by adopting the extension of gill s series expansion gill 1967 gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 based on the solution of mean concentration provided by the method of concentration moments wang 2016 wang and chen 2016 the expression of the 4th order two dimensional concentration distribution is given by 31 ω ξ ζ τ k 0 f k ζ τ k ω ξ τ ξ k k 0 1 and 32 ω ξ τ τ i 1 a i τ i ω ξ τ ξ i i 1 2 in order to obtain the two dimensional concentration distribution we must first obtain the solution of f k ζ τ one after another by comparing the corresponding coefficient of k ω ξ k we have 33 f k τ 2 f k ζ 2 pe ψ f k 1 f k 2 i 1 k a i τ f k i k 1 2 3 where f 0 1 and f 1 f 2 0 the boundary conditions are given by 34 f k ζ ζ 0 0 f k ζ ζ 1 0 k 1 2 3 and the initial condition is expressed as 35 f k ζ τ τ 0 0 k 1 2 3 adopting the vertical average

be obtained one after another and the source term s p ζ τ for f k ζ τ is expressed as 40 s k ζ τ pe ψ f k 1 f k 2 i 1 k a i τ f k i p 1 2 3 the f k ζ τ can be obtained as 41 f k ζ τ 0 τ 0 1 g ζ τ ζ τ s k ζ τ d ζ d τ p 1 2 3 where f 0 1 f 1 0 in a previous research on contaminant transport process in wetland flows affected by wind zeng et al 2012 provided the mean contaminant concentration distribution with standard gaussian distribution by using the method of concentration moments however the two dimensional concentration distributions have not been given luo et al 2017 meanwhile adopted gill s theory but neglected the third and higher order derivative terms nevertheless the 2nd order expansion asymptotic analysis would only be applied effectively on large time scale nevertheless the very initial stage at which the vertical concentration is non uniform is relatively long wu and chen 2014a b thus up to 4th order expansion is adopted in this paper in order to make the concentration distribution more accurate on a small time scale while considering the wind effect 3 results and discussion 3 1 skewness and kurtosis skewness and kurtosis respectively correspond to up to the 3rd and 4th order moments and both of them are essential to study the concentration distribution especially at the initial stage here skewness and kurtosis are respectively defined as 42 γ 1 τ ν 3 ν 2 3 2 43 γ 2 τ ν 4 ν 2 2 3 the skewness and kurtosis both can make effect on contaminant distribution at the initial stage as shown in fig 3 a and b the dimensionless parameter er represents the effort of wind intensity on the skewness as shown in fig 3 a skewness measures the asymmetry of distribution the negative skewness indicates that the concentration distribution in the downstream flow would be fatter than that in the upstream flow that is the concentration distribution becomes downstream oblique the values of all curves in fig 3 a are negative moreover as τ increases all the skewness gradually approaches zero and the concentration distribution becomes increasingly more symmetrical with respect to the ξ axis as shown in fig 3 a skewness increases with increments of er when ω 1 at the same time whereas the condition would be different when ω 1 skewness decreases as er increases at the given time we note that the curves with the same value of er and the reverse mark have a roughly symmetrical distribution about the curve with er 0 the discipline of kurtosis that can measure the outliers of the contaminant distribution in fig 3 b is similar the tails of platykurtic distribution would be thinner compared with the gaussian distribution as kurtosis is negative also called sub gaussian distribution as shown in fig 3 b the values of all the curves approach zero gradually with sufficient time thus indicating that the contaminant distribution tend to be the gaussian distribution as τ the curve of er 0 is in the center as ω 1 at which point the kurtosis decreases the absolute value of kurtosis increases when the er increases indicating that a bigger er can lead to more significant discrepancies on peak of the concentration distribution on the contrary when ω 1 the kurtosis increases the absolute value of kurtosis decreases with the increment of er and thus the larger er is more inclined toward the standard gaussian distribution 3 2 mean concentration distribution 3 2 1 comparison with classical gaussian distribution adopting the 4th order hermite polynomials expansion the mean concentration distribution is obtained compared with the analysis of zeng et al 2012 fig 4 illustrates the effect of parameter er on the mean concentration distributions as can be seen not only the wind force er but also the wind direction ω 1 can affect the mean concentration distribution on the small time scale in this case we adopt pe 10 000 and τ 1 in order to reduce the pe dependence we also employ the ξ pe pe ω coordinate system wu and chen 2014b wu et al 2015 as shown in fig 4 when ω 1 the symmetry of the 4th order mean concentration distribution is more significant with a bigger er we note that the two curves are almost the same when er 1 0 and the maximum of mean concentration distribution decreases as er increases indicating that the increment of wind force with the downstream direction can promote the dispersion process however when ω 1 the derivation would be more noticeable compared with that from the classical gaussian distribution under the wind with downstream direction especially with the larger er furthermore the peak of mean concentration distribution with the smaller upstream wind er 0 2 is considerably higher than that with no wind nevertheless the larger upstream wind er 1 0 lowers the peak value of mean concentration under no wind condition generally the results of the mean longitudinal concentration distribution agree with those presented in previous works zeng et al 2012 luo et al 2017 3 2 2 contaminant transport process analysis the mean concentration distributions at different times are shown in fig 5 as can be seen the peak of each curve representing concentration distribution with the same wind intensity is lowered with the increment of time regardless of the wind direction that is the concentration distribution would be more uniform as time passes as ω 1 0 the maximum of concentration distribution decreases when wind force becomes stronger at one point as shown in the results the increment of er tends to make the time at which the taylor s dispersion model holds ahead when the wind direction is the same as that of the wetland flows ω 1 in contrast as the wind is in the reverse direction the less wind force er 0 2 maintains the peak that is higher than the maximum of concentration distribution without the wind effect er 0 at a certain point however with the larger er er 1 0 the distribution becomes more uniform in order to analyze the complex effect of upstream wind on environmental dispersion as shown in table 1 we make a research on the maximums of ω which can represent the environmental dispersion condition with different er at three time states the result shows that the value of maximums first increases to the crest value and then decreases as the increment of er the value can be even lower than that of the mean concentration distribution s maximum with no wind er 0 when the upstream wind force is large enough er 1 0 indicating that the large upstream wind force can promote the dipsersivity in addition the largest value among these average concentration maximums always comes around er 0 5 under the same time condition indicating that the moderate upstream wind force can make the most significant effect on restraining the procession of environmental dispersion the wind effect on dispersion is associated with the velocity profile of wetland flows for the wind force would make a drag on the free surface directly and then the whole velocity profile would be changed zeng et al 2012 the velocity profile in the wetland flow under the upstream wind has been studied by zeng et al 2012 the absolute value of velocity first decreases to nearly zero and then increases as the upstream forces rises thus the peak of concentration distribution would be higher with smaller wind force er 0 2 than that with no wind as a result of the reduction in absolute value of velocity apparently the moderate upstream wind force leads to the least absolute value of velocity resulting in the most suppression on the dispersivity and the promotion only happens as the upstream wind force is huge er 1 0 for only the absolute value of velocity under the upstream wind increases to be large enough can the upstream wind lead to the lower peak value compared with that under no wind er 0 3 3 two dimensional concentration distribution analysis 3 3 1 vertical concentration distribution the vertical concentration is derived by using up to the 4th order expansion of gill s expansion method fig 6 illustrates the variation of vertical concentration distribution from the 0th to the 4th order expansion with er 0 0 2 1 and ω 1 in the vertical section ξ 0 at the same time τ 1 as can be seen the derivation of higher order expansion is considerable thus the mean concentration distribution f 0 zeng et al 2012 is rough on a small time scale however the derivation of f 1 is the most significant and the contributions of derivation made by f 2 to f 4 are not so noticeable as the effect of the higher order expansion on the asymmetry of distribution is discussed in terms of mean concentration distribution the higher order expansion can lead to different efforts on vertical concentration distribution when the force and direction of the wind change as shown in fig 6 the concentration with the 1st to 4th order expansion would decrease with the increment of ζ as ω 1 moreover the derivation between the higher order distribution and the mean concentration distribution tends to decline with the larger wind force er nevertheless the condition would be more complicated when ω 1 as er 0 2 the concentration still decreases with ζ increases however the tendency of concentration distribution with the increment of ζ is totally different when er 1 0 thus indicating that the concentration increases when ζ increases as the wind force with upstream direction becomes enough furthermore the derivation between the vertical concentration and mean concentration is significant with the gentle wind er 0 2 however this becomes faint with the larger er er 1 0 generally with the same value of er the derivation is more significant when ω 1 and we can remark that the concentration with higher order expansion is roughly the same with the mean concentration at about ζ 0 5 the result indicates that previous analysis of mean concentration cannot illustrate the vertical concentration distribution precisely at the initial condition therefore the higher order expansion can help produce more accurate concentration distributions with accounting for the existence of the wind force 3 3 2 longitudinal concentration distribution in order to analyze the longitudinal concentration distribution at different heights the longitudinal concentration distributions at the bottom the depth of h 2 and the free surface of wetland ζ 0 ζ 0 5 ζ 1 0 are compared with the mean concentration distribution with τ 1 as illustrated in fig 7 all the concentration distributions with the effect of different values of er and ω at ζ 0 5 completely agree with the mean concentration distributions this finding indicates that the mean concentration distribution can predict the longitudinal concentration distribution at the center depth of the wetland however the maximums of concentration distributions at the bed and the surface of the wetland are larger than those of the mean concentration distributions as for ω 1 0 the maximums of surface concentration distributions are bigger than those of bed concentration distributions and the difference between them is reduced with the larger er fig 7 also represents the deviation of concentration distribution from gaussian distribution at different depths of the wetland as can be seen asymmetry exists in both the longitudinal concentration distribution of the surface and the bed ζ 1 0 ζ 0 however the feature of the two boundary surface concentration distributions are different under the downstream wind the downstream concentration of the free surface ζ 1 0 would be more uniform than that of upstream concentration on the contrary the bed concentration distribution would be fatter in the upstream flow thus indicating that the concentration distribution there would be more uniform in the upstream flow the differences among the surface concentration distributions the bed concentration distribution and the concentration distribution at 0 5h surface become less significant with the larger er indicating that the wind with downstream direction is a push factor of the contaminant dispersion process meanwhile with ω 1 0 the free surface concentration distribution of the upstream flow is more uniform than that of upstream flow and the downstream concentration distribution is less uniform at the bed with er 0 2 however when the wind force with the upstream direction is big enough the case would be the opposite the concentration distribution of the downstream flow becomes more uniform than that of upstream flow at the free surface inversely the concentration distribution of the bed is downstream oblique and the peak of the bed concentration distribution becomes even higher than that of free surface concentration distribution the result also indicates that when the intensity of upstream wind is big enough the drag force can promote environmental dispersion 3 3 3 two dimensional concentration distribution the two dimensional concentration distributions at the same time τ 1 are illustrated in fig 8 along with the effect of different wind forces as shown in fig 8 a c and e the maximum of the two dimensional concentration distribution decreases with the increment of er with ω 1 this result agrees with that of the mean concentration distribution analysis with the larger downstream wind force er 1 0 the peak of concentration distribution becomes lower indicating that dispersivity is facilitated meanwhile when ω 1 fig 8 a b and d the maximum of two dimensional concentrations does not monotonically increase with the increment of er rather the peak of the two dimensional distribution is higher when er 0 2 moreover the peak of concentration distribution remains higher with the smaller upstream wind during the process of advection diffussion indicating that the slow decaying transient effect is caused by the smaller upstream wind wu and chen 2014a as for the maximum of two dimensional concentration distribution under stronger upstream wind er 1 0 it becomes smaller than that with no wind thus illustrating the accelerating function during the contaminant transport process which also agrees with the result of the mean concentration analysis the local maximum of two dimensional concentration distribution as shown in fig 8 can be found at the boundaries which agrees with the result of vertical concentration distribution analysis as the wind is downstream ω 1 the maximum of vertical concentration at the free surface ζ 1 is larger than that at the bottom indicating that the local contaminant dispersion process is stronger at the free surface for the lower velocity shear rate and that the non penetration bed allows the vertical diffusion in one direction jiang et al 2017 meanwhile the maximum of local vertical concentration distributions at the bottom is smaller than that at the free surface however when the upstream wind force is big enough the local vertical concentration maximum at the bottom is larger than that at the free surface thus indicating that the larger intensity of the upstream wind promotes the process of contaminant dispersion 4 applications in this application an instantaneous release of plumbum pb with q 1 kg m 1 in wetland flows is considered we focus on the evolution of the two dimensional concentration distributions in this case considering the typical parameters of the wetland flow as ϕ 0 9 us epa 1999 mean diameter of stem d 2 0 10 2 m mitsch and gosselink 1993 h 1 0 m and u 0 2 m s 1 the tortuosity of a porous medium for systems with high porosity can be calculated by the

2 10 6 pe d 1 then we have κ 0 95 f 5 14 10 3 m 2 l 3 32 kgm 1 s 1 k 3 91 10 3 m 2 s 1 the evolution of the mean concentration distribution is illustrated as fig 9 the mean concentration distribution of pb decreases as the increment of time under both upstream wind and downstream wind it is apparently that the mean longitudinal concentration distribution is not gaussian distribution and maximums of the mean concentration distribution under the upstream wind are larger than those under the downstream wind at the same time the evolution of the vertical concentration distribution of pb at ξ 0 m is shown in fig 10 the derivations of the vertical concentration distribution can be significant at the initial stage and the vertical concentration distribution becomes uniform when time is large enough and the derivation of the vertical concentration distribution under the upstream wind is more significant than that with the effect of the downstream wind at the same time which is consist with the analysis of vertical concentration distribution the vertical concentration distribution of contaminant was not obtained by previous models 5 conclusions based on the combination of concentration moments method by aris and gill s theory this work analyzes the wind effect on contaminant dispersion in wetland flows with higher order expansions which can produce more accurate results on a small time scale in addition we analyzed the two dimensional concentration distributions with the effect of wind the dimensionless parameter er is used to illustrate wind force whereas the dimensionless parameter ω illustrates the wind direction the impact of both wind force and wind direction on dispersivity have been demonstrated as shown in the results when the direction of the wind is downstream the larger wind force can strengthen the symmetry of the mean concentration distribution promote the uniformity of vertical concentration distribution and decrease the longitudinal concentration distribution the downstream wind can promote the dispersivity as a result in addition with the downstream wind the local concentration maximum of boundaries in the two dimensional concentration distribution occurs at the free surface of the wetland in comparison with the upstream wind the asymmetry of mean concentration distribution turn is reinforced and the uniformity of vertical concentration distribution and the maximum of longitudinal distribution no longer monotonically change with the increment of wind intensity furthermore the environmental dispersion can be weakened with the small wind force whereas the contaminant dispersion can be reinforced as the wind force becomes big enough finally the local maximum of boundaries can even occur at the non penetration bottom when the upstream wind force is sufficient acknowledgement this work was financially supported by the natural science foundation of china nos 51439007 11172218 and 11372232 
7481,prewhitening the process of eliminating or reducing short term stochastic persistence to enable detection of deterministic change has been extensively applied to time series analysis of a range of geophysical variables despite the controversy around its utility methodologies for prewhitening time series continue to be a critical feature of a variety of analyses including trend detection of hydroclimatic variables and reconstruction of climate and or hydrology through proxy records such as tree rings with a focus on the latter this paper presents a generalized approach to exploring the impact of a wide range of stochastic structures of short and long term persistence on the variability of hydroclimatic time series through this approach we examine the impact of prewhitening on the inferred variability of time series across time scales we document how a focus on prewhitened residual time series can be misleading as it can drastically distort or remove the structure of variability across time scales through examples with actual data we show how such loss of information in prewhitened time series of tree rings so called residual chronologies can lead to the underestimation of extreme conditions in climate and hydrology particularly droughts reconstructed for centuries preceding the historical period keywords prewhitening time series analysis hurst effect tree rings paleo hydrology residual chronology climate variability autoregressive ar models 1 introduction and objective prewhitening consists of fitting time series models such as autoregressive ar or autoregressive moving average arma models to an original time series and separating out the time series of residuals from the original series which becomes the prewhitened series the difference between the underlying original presumably true process and a prescribed model process will result in a realisation of some new process which inherits some properties from the original process excluding partly or fully the short term persistence which was removed by fitting and effectively removing the ar or arma process the question is whether or not the properties of the prewhitened series still carry the important information of interest embedded in the respective original time series including signals at a range of frequencies or time scales the importance of this question cannot be understated as the prewhitened or residual time series form the foundation for various types of analyses such as trend analysis and paleo reconstruction based on dendrochronology and other proxy records in this paper we investigate how prewhitening changes the properties of a time series in ways other than short term persistence i e the intended change we assess the implications of prewhitening for our inferences on variability of time series across a range of time scales which relates to the magnitude and significance of trends and cycles at different frequencies for this purpose we utilize examples based on long tree ring time series collected in the headwaters of saskatchewan river basin canada that exhibit significant cross correlation with streamflows the context and focus of this work is tailored to applications in reconstruction of paleo climate and paleo hydrology however our findings may also be of relevance for other types of analyses using prewhitening such as in trend detection of hydroclimatic variables with the mann kendall and other tests bayazit and önöz 2007 douglas et al 2000 von storch 1995 yue and wang 2002 we note that the analyses and implications discussed in this study are not intended to undermine the general utility of prewhitenning in the full range of its applications instead this paper attempts to highlight some possible caveats and pitfalls that one might need to consider when using prewhitenning 2 applications of prewhitening the status quo 2 1 prewhitening in trend analysis trend analysis of time series aims to identify a deterministic trend that has a physical basis and is likely to continue in the future the mann kendall mk trend test named after mann 1945 and kendall 1975 is a widely used means for trend detection in a range of hydroclimatic and other variables ideally this test would only be used when there is a sound physical basis and understanding for the deterministic drivers that may be causing the trend it is a rank based nonparametric test with a null hypothesis that the time series under investigation has no trend independent and identically distributed data and with the alternative hypothesis that a monotonic upward or downward trend exists in the time series an underlying assumption in this test is that the time series is not serially correlated whereas this assumption is frequently violated in practice when dealing with hydroclimatic time series a positive serial correlation increases the likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis when it might be true the probability of type 1 error would become larger than what the attained significance level indicates prewhitening was proposed by von storch 1995 as a remedy to this issue and since then has been used extensively with the mk test hamed 2009 lacombe et al 2012 zhang et al 2000 yue et al 2002 and matalas and sankarasubramanian 2003 examined the interaction between a linear trend and an ar 1 process and showed how the existence of serial correlation alters the variance of the estimate of the mk and linear regression tests respectively yue and wang 2002 asserted that the use of prewhitening with the mk test is based on an implied but strong assumption that prewhitening could remove the ar process from a time series without affecting the existing trend while it would seriously distort the test result this led to a debate about the impact of prewhitening on trend detection and whether or not it should be applied bayazit 2015 bayazit and önöz 2007 zhang and zwiers 2004 yue and wang 2002 showed that removing a positive ar 1 process will remove a portion of the underlying trend and hence reduce the likelihood of accepting the null hypothesis when it may be false type 2 error thereby lowering the power of the test despite these implications prewhitening continues to be a critical feature of trend analysis studies and the use of more advanced time series models such as fgn farma

droughts e g woodhouse and lukas 2006a b 3 structure of variability across time scales the structure of variability across time scales svats herein refers to the way in which the variance rate of variability of a process changes with respect to changes in the time scale of analysis suppose k denotes the time scale in years and σ 2 k denotes the variance of a given time series i e a realization of a process at time scale k for example σ 2 1 is the variance of the time series on the annual scale σ 2 2 is the variance of the two year time series derived from that annual time series by averaging every two consecutive years and σ 2 k is the variance of its derived k year scale time series when the number of data values in the annual time series is t for t years the number of data values in its two and k year scale time series are t 2 and t k in general the variance σ 2 k is expected to decrease as the time scale k increases the rate and pattern of such a decrease in variance however are different for different geophysical time series 3 1 illustrative example to illustrate the svats in time series fig 1 a and b show variance vs time scale plots on the log log scale for two different tree ring time series standard chronologies called sfr and cab for periods 1038 2008 and 1440 2003 respectively these chronologies are located in saskatchewan river basin canada and exhibit significant positive correlations with their local streamflows details of these chronologies are available in razavi et al 2015 with no loss of generality in this figure all of the time series shown are standardized at the annual time scale base time scale so that they all have an annual variance of unity i e σ 2 1 1 the points shown in fig 1 correspond to the behavior of the original time series and the residuals after fitting an ar 1 ar 3 and arma 1 1 model the curves correspond to the ar 1 ar 2 ar 3 and arma 1 1 models fitted to the original time series section 3 2 presents the modelling details and section 3 3 discusses the properties of the resulting residuals evidently in both cases σ 2 k of the original time series decreases with the increase in k at rates smaller than that of a purely random process i e white noise this behaviour is a manifestation of the stochastic structure as a function of time scale irregular long term changes and trends at a range of frequencies such difference from a random process is also commonly attributed to persistence in geophysical time series at a range of time scales particularly long term persistence and the hurst phenomenon hurst 1951 klemeš 1974 mudelsee 2007 salas et al 1979 the slope of a line passing though the points not shown here on the variance vs time scale plot is known to be 2h 2 where h is called the hurst exponent and is 0 5 for white noise see beran 1994 page 92 3 2 performance of ar and arma models in reproducing svats ar models are models of short term persistence with a memory length controlled directly by the model order because of their short memory length these models have been commonly assumed to be appropriate to capture and remove short term persistence autocorrelation in time series to generate the curves representing the ar and arma processes on fig 1a and b we fitted ar p and arma p q models to the time series with p ranging from 1 to 6 and q 1 using sams software sveinsson et al 2007 and used the corrected akaike information criterion hurvich and tsai 1993 for their ranking accordingly arma 1 1 and ar 3 were the best and second best models for both of the time series evidently the different ar and arma processes can reproduce the underlying svats in the time series at different time scale ranges from multi annual to multi decadal and longer depending on their orders i e the values of p and q for example ar 1 can accurately reproduce the underlying structure of variability up to approximately 5 year scale while for larger time scales the rate of decrease in variance approaches that of a random process however ar 3 and arma 1 1 can reproduce the structure of variability for a wide range of time scales even multi decadal stated differently a visual inspection of the plot suggests that in these cases the slope of ar 1 asymptotically approaches that of the random process between 5 and 10 year time scales ar 2 does so between 10 and 20 year time scales and ar 3 and arma 1 1 do so at time scales of greater than 20 years we note that ar and arma processes with higher orders can reproduce this svats even at longer time scales not shown 3 3 svats in prewhitened time series we showed above that the ar and arma models are capable of capturing and reproducing svats across a range of time scales this capability directly affects the resulting prewhitened time series and limits the statistical properties that the prewhitened residual time series will inherit from the original time series to assess how and to what extent the resulting residual time series preserve the svats of the respective original time series let s look at the points already shown on fig 1a and b that represent residual time series resulting from fitting the ar 1 ar 3 and arma 1 1 processes as can be seen the svat within the residual time series are drastically distorted or completely lost in the time scale range shown such a loss of variance corresponds to a complete loss in information to the extent that the variability of the residual time series obtained from ar 3 and arma 1 1 is quite similar to that of a random process no signal this suggests that the effect of prewhitening on the residual time series goes well beyond removing short term persistence auto correlation as is so often assumed see section 2 4 implications and discussion the possible distortion or loss of the svat can have serious implications that risk the credibility of any resulting statistical inferences performed on the residual time series to further clarify these implications we provide an alternative representation of the behaviour shown in the previous section fig 2 a shows the original sfr time series along with the respective residual time series obtained by fitting an ar 3 model both of the time series are standardized to have identical average and variance at the annual time scale this figure also shows 15 and 50 year moving average time series of the annual time series fig 2b focuses on a sub period 1600 2000 of fig 2a to better visually compare the original and residual time series at the annual time scale although the original and residual time series at the annual time scale possess identical variance and may seem consistent with each other over time their respective moving averages are significantly different in other words there is a significant reduction in information resulting from the removal of irregular trends and cycles in the residual time series as a result of the removal of the persistent component the difference is particularly significant in the periods of consecutive dry or wet years e g see periods 1460 1520 and 1650 1700 this indicates that the residual time series significantly underestimates the duration and extent of extreme dry or wet periods fig 2c and d compare the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the original and residual time series at the annual and 15 year time scales respectively the annual scale cdfs of the two time series are alike on the 15 year time scale however the cdfs of the two are significantly different the residual time series possesses only about one quarter of the variability of the original time series at the same time scale σ residual 2 15 σ original 2 15 0 07 0 28 0 25 we note that the implications shown in the analyses above are general and can be seen for any other time series this may have significant implications for the reconstruction of paleo hydrology the point is any reconstruction of climate or hydrologic variables for the centuries preceding the historical period inherits the statistical properties including the svats from its predictors therefore if such residual time series residual chronologies are used the resulting reconstructions or inferences can be misleading in particular in terms of the magnitude of extreme events e g the magnitude of extreme droughts would be underestimated in the context of trend analysis the observations in fig 2 reinforce the need to carefully distinguish the effects of trends and auto correlation in trend detection yue et al 2002 suggested the removal of a trend component from a time series prior to prewhitening as a first step and then adding the trend back to prewhitened time series for the mann kendall test this approach has been frequently used in the literature as a way to separate the two effects it often requires the user to pre specify a form for a presumably existing trend e g linear or other monotonic forms which could lead to problems if there is no actual trend a deeper question underpinning our analysis would ask what information can a residual time series be expected to provide in an ideal world where the correct form of the time series model is known the resulting prewhitened residual time series based on that model would be a white noise exhibiting no information resulting from a deterministic process whatsoever in the real world however prewhitened residual time series represent only that portion of the original time series which cannot be described by the assumed time series model used to create those residuals alternatively stated the possible existence of some information signals left in prewhitened time series is due to the inability of the assumed time series models to perfectly describe the underlying deterministic processes exhibited within the data the message is that the quality and quantity of such information depend on the model used and cannot be easily interpreted especially for complex time series models in spite of this there are examples in the literature that used more complex models which exhibit longer memory such as autoregressive integrated moving average arima and fractional gaussian noise fgn models for prewhitening lastly the autocorrelation structure of geophysical variables may be significantly non stationary razavi et al 2015 such possible non stationary behavior further complicates the impact of any prewhitening process that assumes a stationary process in original time series the variance vs time scale plot shown in fig 1 is a powerful tool to investigate the serial dependencies in time series across the range of time scales using this tool fig 3 compares the behaviour of 15 time series of tree growth rates chronologies and naturalized river flow in the oldman river a tributary of saskatchewan river canada over the historical period 1912 2001 the maximum time scale considered on the abscissa of fig 3 is short 8 years relative to the much longer time scale considered in fig 1 because the length of the time series in fig 3 is relatively short 89 years the short lengths of record associated with the series in fig 3 result in much more scatter than was observed for the much longer time series used to develop fig 1 as expected in fig 3 the variance decreases as the time scale increases for all the time series however the slope of the linear function that is fit to the tree ring and streamflow series are quite different the difference in slope at a time scale is attributable to the difference in persistence within the time series at that time scale though these differences are also confounded by the short record lengths somewhat as can be seen for short time scales shorter than 3 years the slopes of the two flows and growth rates are considerably different with a slope associated with the flows closer to that of a random process whereas for long time scales longer than 3 years the slopes of the two series are similar this observation indicates that the short term persistence in growth rates is higher than that of the flows due to biological effects in trees while the two are very similar in terms of their long term variability the result in fig 3 suggests that although standard chronologies do not properly represent the short term persistence autocorrelation of hydro climatic variables at the annual scale they may exhibit an adequate representation of persistence and variability at longer time scales 2 or 3 year time scales and longer this is due to the reduction of the carry over effects associated with the growth of trees at longer time scales as a result of this finding instead of the conventional approach we recommend focusing initial attention on reconstructing paleo time series at multi year time scales e g 2 or 3 year time series instead of annual time series and then disaggregating them into the annual time scale guided by the annual variability information in the tree ring time series see the initial attempt described by razavi et al 2016 for more analysis and discussion of the challenge of reconstructing multi year scale paleo hydrologic series razavi et al 2016 showed that not only can this approach better represent the underlying svats but also has a higher reconstruction power which explains a higher percentage of the variance in the hydro climatic variable of interest than the series based on shorter time scales 5 final remarks since the recommendation by cook 1985 to use prewhitening to remove short term persistence from long records of tree rings prewhitening of hydroclimatic time series has proliferated in both courses and research as the solution to remove or diminish the impact of short term persistence prior to paleo reconstruction see citations in section 2 we have provided evidence and reasoning which documents why focusing one s attention on prewhitened hydroclimatic time series can be misleading because it leads to a loss of important information contained in a time series we have documented that prewhitened time series will generally not carry important stochastic properties embedded in respective original time series resulting from persistence and seasonality and thus cannot preserve the svats structure of variability across time scales it was shown that prewhitening has impacts which may go well beyond the intended goal of only eliminating reducing short term persistence and in fact prewhitening distorts our ability to detect trends and cycles in time series and can also diminish their magnitude and significance this is very important as hydroclimatic time series possess a multitude of irregular trends and cycles at a range of frequencies and such information are essential for a variety of studies in particular those relating to water resource management the implications of prewhitening are of course different for different applications and this paper suggests that the analyst be mindful of potential implications discussed perhaps the most important negative implications of prewhitening are for paleo reconstruction where the prewhitening leads to a distortion of the time series which is then be transferred directly to the reconstructed time series of hydroclimatic variables this indicates that resulting statistical inferences concerning paleo climatic conditions may not be credible and or should be interpreted with caution for example the magnitude and duration of paleo extremes such as droughts can be significantly underestimated when prewhitened time series are used for hydroclimatic reconstruction note that the amount of the information loss due to prewhitening for a given time series depends on the extent of its svats significance of signals at different frequencies and the time series model used and therefore can be variable from one case study to another although the phenomenon of inflated short term persistence in tree ring records standard chronologies appears to persist in recent literature see citations in section 2 it does not necessarily undermine the value of paleo reconstructions based on standard chronologies to address concerns over the fact that annual records of numerous geophysical records exhibit short term persistence an alternative would be to perform analysis over longer time scales e g two or three year time series to effectively remove some of the short term persistence see the approach proposed in razavi et al 2016 tools such as those illustrated in the examples provided in fig 1 provide a generalized approach to exploring the impact of a very wide range of stochastic structures of short and long term persistence on the variability of hydroclimatic records in addition future studies should consider the use of long pseudo proxy data obtained from climate model simulations over the past millennium which may be useful in further characterizing the svats in climatic time series and the implications of prewhitening such data can be used in the evaluation of the performance of paleo reconstruction methods using controlled and systematic experiments known as pseudoproxy experiments smerdon 2012 lastly the analyses and implications discussed in this study were not intended to undermine the general utility of prewhitenning in the full range of its applications including trend detection instead this paper attempted to highlight some possible caveats and pitfalls that one might need to consider when using prewhitenning in an application acknowledgments this work was supported in part of by the first author s nserc natural sciences and engineering

7481,prewhitening the process of eliminating or reducing short term stochastic persistence to enable detection of deterministic change has been extensively applied to time series analysis of a range of geophysical variables despite the controversy around its utility methodologies for prewhitening time series continue to be a critical feature of a variety of analyses including trend detection of hydroclimatic variables and reconstruction of climate and or hydrology through proxy records such as tree rings with a focus on the latter this paper presents a generalized approach to exploring the impact of a wide range of stochastic structures of short and long term persistence on the variability of hydroclimatic time series through this approach we examine the impact of prewhitening on the inferred variability of time series across time scales we document how a focus on prewhitened residual time series can be misleading as it can drastically distort or remove the structure of variability across time scales through examples with actual data we show how such loss of information in prewhitened time series of tree rings so called residual chronologies can lead to the underestimation of extreme conditions in climate and hydrology particularly droughts reconstructed for centuries preceding the historical period keywords prewhitening time series analysis hurst effect tree rings paleo hydrology residual chronology climate variability autoregressive ar models 1 introduction and objective prewhitening consists of fitting time series models such as autoregressive ar or autoregressive moving average arma models to an original time series and separating out the time series of residuals from the original series which becomes the prewhitened series the difference between the underlying original presumably true process and a prescribed model process will result in a realisation of some new process which inherits some properties from the original process excluding partly or fully the short term persistence which was removed by fitting and effectively removing the ar or arma process the question is whether or not the properties of the prewhitened series still carry the important information of interest embedded in the respective original time series including signals at a range of frequencies or time scales the importance of this question cannot be understated as the prewhitened or residual time series form the foundation for various types of analyses such as trend analysis and paleo reconstruction based on dendrochronology and other proxy records in this paper we investigate how prewhitening changes the properties of a time series in ways other than short term persistence i e the intended change we assess the implications of prewhitening for our inferences on variability of time series across a range of time scales which relates to the magnitude and significance of trends and cycles at different frequencies for this purpose we utilize examples based on long tree ring time series collected in the headwaters of saskatchewan river basin canada that exhibit significant cross correlation with streamflows the context and focus of this work is tailored to applications in reconstruction of paleo climate and paleo hydrology however our findings may also be of relevance for other types of analyses using prewhitening such as in trend detection of hydroclimatic variables with the mann kendall and other tests bayazit and önöz 2007 douglas et al 2000 von storch 1995 yue and wang 2002 we note that the analyses and implications discussed in this study are not intended to undermine the general utility of prewhitenning in the full range of its applications instead this paper attempts to highlight some possible caveats and pitfalls that one might need to consider when using prewhitenning 2 applications of prewhitening the status quo 2 1 prewhitening in trend analysis trend analysis of time series aims to identify a deterministic trend that has a physical basis and is likely to continue in the future the mann kendall mk trend test named after mann 1945 and kendall 1975 is a widely used means for trend detection in a range of hydroclimatic and other variables ideally this test would only be used when there is a sound physical basis and understanding for the deterministic drivers that may be causing the trend it is a rank based nonparametric test with a null hypothesis that the time series under investigation has no trend independent and identically distributed data and with the alternative hypothesis that a monotonic upward or downward trend exists in the time series an underlying assumption in this test is that the time series is not serially correlated whereas this assumption is frequently violated in practice when dealing with hydroclimatic time series a positive serial correlation increases the likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis when it might be true the probability of type 1 error would become larger than what the attained significance level indicates prewhitening was proposed by von storch 1995 as a remedy to this issue and since then has been used extensively with the mk test hamed 2009 lacombe et al 2012 zhang et al 2000 yue et al 2002 and matalas and sankarasubramanian 2003 examined the interaction between a linear trend and an ar 1 process and showed how the existence of serial correlation alters the variance of the estimate of the mk and linear regression tests respectively yue and wang 2002 asserted that the use of prewhitening with the mk test is based on an implied but strong assumption that prewhitening could remove the ar process from a time series without affecting the existing trend while it would seriously distort the test result this led to a debate about the impact of prewhitening on trend detection and whether or not it should be applied bayazit 2015 bayazit and önöz 2007 zhang and zwiers 2004 yue and wang 2002 showed that removing a positive ar 1 process will remove a portion of the underlying trend and hence reduce the likelihood of accepting the null hypothesis when it may be false type 2 error thereby lowering the power of the test despite these implications prewhitening continues to be a critical feature of trend analysis studies and the use of more advanced time series models such as fgn farma

range of time scales using this tool fig 3 compares the behaviour of 15 time series of tree growth rates chronologies and naturalized river flow in the oldman river a tributary of saskatchewan river canada over the historical period 1912 2001 the maximum time scale considered on the abscissa of fig 3 is short 8 years relative to the much longer time scale considered in fig 1 because the length of the time series in fig 3 is relatively short 89 years the short lengths of record associated with the series in fig 3 result in much more scatter than was observed for the much longer time series used to develop fig 1 as expected in fig 3 the variance decreases as the time scale increases for all the time series however the slope of the linear function that is fit to the tree ring and streamflow series are quite different the difference in slope at a time scale is attributable to the difference in persistence within the time series at that time scale though these differences are also confounded by the short record lengths somewhat as can be seen for short time scales shorter than 3 years the slopes of the two flows and growth rates are considerably different with a slope associated with the flows closer to that of a random process whereas for long time scales longer than 3 years the slopes of the two series are similar this observation indicates that the short term persistence in growth rates is higher than that of the flows due to biological effects in trees while the two are very similar in terms of their long term variability the result in fig 3 suggests that although standard chronologies do not properly represent the short term persistence autocorrelation of hydro climatic variables at the annual scale they may exhibit an adequate representation of persistence and variability at longer time scales 2 or 3 year time scales and longer this is due to the reduction of the carry over effects associated with the growth of trees at longer time scales as a result of this finding instead of the conventional approach we recommend focusing initial attention on reconstructing paleo time series at multi year time scales e g 2 or 3 year time series instead of annual time series and then disaggregating them into the annual time scale guided by the annual variability information in the tree ring time series see the initial attempt described by razavi et al 2016 for more analysis and discussion of the challenge of reconstructing multi year scale paleo hydrologic series razavi et al 2016 showed that not only can this approach better represent the underlying svats but also has a higher reconstruction power which explains a higher percentage of the variance in the hydro climatic variable of interest than the series based on shorter time scales 5 final remarks since the recommendation by cook 1985 to use prewhitening to remove short term persistence from long records of tree rings prewhitening of hydroclimatic time series has proliferated in both courses and research as the solution to remove or diminish the impact of short term persistence prior to paleo reconstruction see citations in section 2 we have provided evidence and reasoning which documents why focusing one s attention on prewhitened hydroclimatic time series can be misleading because it leads to a loss of important information contained in a time series we have documented that prewhitened time series will generally not carry important stochastic properties embedded in respective original time series resulting from persistence and seasonality and thus cannot preserve the svats structure of variability across time scales it was shown that prewhitening has impacts which may go well beyond the intended goal of only eliminating reducing short term persistence and in fact prewhitening distorts our ability to detect trends and cycles in time series and can also diminish their magnitude and significance this is very important as hydroclimatic time series possess a multitude of irregular trends and cycles at a range of frequencies and such information are essential for a variety of studies in particular those relating to water resource management the implications of prewhitening are of course different for different applications and this paper suggests that the analyst be mindful of potential implications discussed perhaps the most important negative implications of prewhitening are for paleo reconstruction where the prewhitening leads to a distortion of the time series which is then be transferred directly to the reconstructed time series of hydroclimatic variables this indicates that resulting statistical inferences concerning paleo climatic conditions may not be credible and or should be interpreted with caution for example the magnitude and duration of paleo extremes such as droughts can be significantly underestimated when prewhitened time series are used for hydroclimatic reconstruction note that the amount of the information loss due to prewhitening for a given time series depends on the extent of its svats significance of signals at different frequencies and the time series model used and therefore can be variable from one case study to another although the phenomenon of inflated short term persistence in tree ring records standard chronologies appears to persist in recent literature see citations in section 2 it does not necessarily undermine the value of paleo reconstructions based on standard chronologies to address concerns over the fact that annual records of numerous geophysical records exhibit short term persistence an alternative would be to perform analysis over longer time scales e g two or three year time series to effectively remove some of the short term persistence see the approach proposed in razavi et al 2016 tools such as those illustrated in the examples provided in fig 1 provide a generalized approach to exploring the impact of a very wide range of stochastic structures of short and long term persistence on the variability of hydroclimatic records in addition future studies should consider the use of long pseudo proxy data obtained from climate model simulations over the past millennium which may be useful in further characterizing the svats in climatic time series and the implications of prewhitening such data can be used in the evaluation of the performance of paleo reconstruction methods using controlled and systematic experiments known as pseudoproxy experiments smerdon 2012 lastly the analyses and implications discussed in this study were not intended to undermine the general utility of prewhitenning in the full range of its applications including trend detection instead this paper attempted to highlight some possible caveats and pitfalls that one might need to consider when using prewhitenning in an application acknowledgments this work was supported in part of by the first author s nserc natural sciences and engineering

7482,the vietnamese mekong delta vmd is a region of utmost importance to vietnam s national food security however the availability of required freshwater resources from both surface and groundwater sources is currently under great threats due to dry season salinity intrusion surface water pollution and over exploitation of groundwater global climate change sea level rise and upstream and in situ development activities may worsen the situation assuming that adaptive management could be a promising strategy to address the increasingly complex and unpredictable water related problems in the vmd we design and apply a framework to identify the extent to which the governance regime in this region exhibits conditions that are likely to promote adaptive freshwater management using both primary and secondary data our analysis reveals that the prospects for adaptive water management in the study area are limited since several conditions were not present we observe among others limitations in vertical and horizontal integration and public participation restraints in knowledge and information sharing inadequate policy development and implementation and insufficient diversification of financial resources following our findings we conclude the paper with recommendations both for national regional and local policy interventions and for future research keywords adaptive management water governance salinity intrusion groundwater land subsidence vietnam 1 introduction the vietnamese mekong delta vmd 12 of vietnam s total area is of utmost importance to vietnam s national food security cosslett and cosslett 2014 anthony et al 2015 smajgl et al 2015 the delta home to approximately 17 6 million people representing one fifth of the vietnamese population gsov 2015 is characterized by a tropical monsoon climate with a wet season from june to november and a dry season from december to may cosslett and cosslett 2014 paddy rice production and aquaculture are dominant economic activities in the vmd approximately 65 of the land 2 6 million ha in the delta is used for agriculture of which 2 million ha is used for rice paddies between 1995 and 2014 the vmd contributed more than 50 annually to vietnam s total outputs in rice and fishery production gsov 2015 in 2013 vietnam s rice export accounted for 8 7 of the global rice market positioning the country as one of the major global rice exporters fao 2016 according to hoanh et al 2014 the delta s contribution in rice production was even more significant about 70 in recent years agriculture in the vmd has been sustained by an abundant availability of freshwater and riverine sediment from the mekong river rice based farming systems account for more than 65 of total freshwater demands in the delta cosslett and cosslett 2014 however freshwater availability in the vmd is increasingly threatened by global climate change rising sea level and upstream and in situ development activities smajgl et al 2015 problems affecting freshwater resources in coastal areas of the vmd are interrelated they include dry season salinity intrusion cosslett and cosslett 2014 trung and tri 2014 smajgl et al 2015 which may negatively impact rice production kotera et al 2008 chen et al 2012 surface water pollution moglia et al 2012 wilbers et al 2014 chau et al 2015 giang et al 2015 and over exploitation of groundwater erban et al 2014 dang et al 2016 groundwater resources in the middle and lower vmd are already systematically depleted governments of vietnam and the netherlands 2013 ha et al 2015 an average decline of 26 cm y was detected erban et al 2014 and reductions will continue shrestha et al 2016 unless sufficient strategies to restrict groundwater use are implemented iucn 2011 declines in groundwater levels introduce another significant challenge since accelerated groundwater extraction has also been linked to compaction based land subsidence averaged at 1 6 cm y hak et al 2016 in the next decades land subsidence may increase the risks associated with sea level rise hak et al 2016 with greater magnitudes ingebritsen and galloway 2014 moreover pump induced land subsidence has also been connected to the release and spread of arsenic to deep aquifers erban et al 2013 erban and gorelick 2016 huang et al 2016 considering the growing complexities and unpredictability of freshwater problems in the vmd adaptive management may be a promising strategy for sustaining the region s freshwater resources traditionally water management has been a top down state led process characterized by a command and control approach which mainly resorts to technical and engineering solutions folke 2006 ostrom 2009 biswas and tortajada 2010 and neglects the complexities of the human dimension pahl wostl et al 2010 engle et al 2011 in the past decades adaptive management has emerged as a new paradigm castro 2007 pahl wostl et al 2012 and has been strongly advocated as an appropriate approach to address water issues pahl wostl 2007 2008 bogardi et al 2012 the ability to deal with uncertainties is an essential requirement for sustainable water management in times of global climate change pahl wostl et al 2007b an adaptive management strategy however must be embedded in and supported by the existing water governance regime so far studies exploring water governance issues in the vmd are limited existing research has shed light on the legal framework for water management nguyen 2012 institutional structures and prominent actors evers and benedikter 2015 sajor and thu 2009 irrigation policy development hoanh et al 2014 and river basin management molle and hoanh 2009 none of these studies has comprehensively investigated the prospects for adaptive water management in this region our study therefore addresses this knowledge gap by identifying the extent to which the freshwater governance regime in the vmd exhibits conditions that are likely to promote adaptive management for coping with growing future uncertainties by doing this our study also provides a comprehensive overview of this region s water governance regime that can guide more in depth future research 2 promoting adaptive management an assessment framework adaptive management which originated in holling s resilience theory as mentioned by folke et al 2005 can be defined as a systematic process for continually improving management policies and practices by learning from the outcomes of implemented management strategies pahl wostl 2007 adaptive management explicitly acknowledges the inherently complex non linear and unpredictable nature of ecosystems folke et al 2004 folke 2006 and emphasizes learning experimentation and flexibility as means of developing the capacity for managing uncertainties and changes folke et al 2005 huitema et al 2009 central to adaptive management is the concept of social learning a multi scale process in which diverse stakeholder groups are involved to generate and communicate knowledge and to share values and perspectives in order to collectively improve their situations bouwen and taillieu 2004 pahl wostl et al 2007a an adaptive governance regime refers to the broader social and institutional contexts that enable adaptive management of ecosystems dietz et al 2003 specifically to the structures and processes by which actors in societies share power deliberate coordinate and make decisions lebel et al 2006 in order to support successful adaptive management a governance regime must i promote multi party interaction to enable collaboration and social learning bouwen and taillieu 2004 folke et al 2005 pahl wostl et al 2007a ii facilitate the involvement of various actors in knowledge production to improve the diversity of knowledge and perspectives folke et al 2005 lebel et al 2006 iii allow for the integration of learning and knowledge into policy and management processes to continually improve them folke et al 2005 and iv support measures to spread risks to tackle uncertainties folke et al 2005 huntjens et al 2010 based on the works of pahl wostl 2008 and huntjens et al 2010 we have developed an assessment framework table 1 that consists of conditions that are grouped under five dimensions i governance and structure ii leadership iii knowledge and information management iv policy development and implementation and v financial management according to pahl wostl 2008 the governance structure of an adaptive water governance regime must be polycentric and horizontal with broad stakeholder participation polycentric governance arrangements are best understood as structures consisting of many nested or sometimes partly overlapping semi autonomous decision making centres ostrom 1996 mcginnis 1999 they are assumed to have a high adaptive capacity due to their potential to self organize and to change like complex adaptive systems i e organisms or nervous and immune systems pahl wostl 2009 furthermore the multiple relatively independent decision making centres within a polycentric structure allow the development of context appropriate institutions that may enable the implementation of adaptive measures at suitable levels lebel et al 2006 however coordination and collaboration can be challenging in polycentric systems huitema et al 2009 thus the multiple decision making centres in these systems must be well integrated both vertically and horizontally to ensure a good flow of information and good social collaboration ostrom 2005 pahl wostl 2008 2009 public participation and informal networks also contribute to building social capital for social learning and collaboration folke et al 2005 olsson et al 2006 pahl wostl 2008 vertical integration refers to the interplay and cooperation between different hierarchical levels of administration involved in water management i e local regional national and international levels and the distribution of authorities among these hierarchies pahl wostl 2009 a lack of vertical integration tends to result in policy failures if different management levels are disconnected gaps between policy development and implementation are most likely to arise ostrom 2005 pahl wostl 2009 examples of failures resulting from a lack of vertical integration include the failed attempts to reform water institutions in south africa varady et al 2013 and the ineffectiveness of many groundwater user associations in spain lopez gunn 2003 lopez gunn and cortina 2006 horizontal integration refers to the integration between water related sectors like agriculture transportation and environmental management knüppe and pahl wostl 2011 2013 adaptive water management requires a high level of sectoral integration to identify inconsistencies and emerging issues and to ensure unified adaptive responses to changes pahl wostl 2008 pahl wostl et al 2010 horizontal integration can be achieved through processes of network governance rather than through bureaucratic hierarchies and centralized policy development and implementation pahl wostl et al 2007a horizontal integration was found to be crucial in resolving land subsidence problems in taiwan tang and tang 2006 and in reducing groundwater extraction in gujarat india shah et al 2008 public participation may contribute to a better use of available information and enhance the quality of decision making huitema et al 2009 by opening up access to different types of knowledge and perspectives public participation facilitates information exchange lebel et al 2006 knüppe and pahl wostl 2013 moreover repeated interactions among stakeholders can contribute to building trust improving shared understanding of management issues at stake and enabling social learning lebel et al 2006 huitema et al 2009 although in reality public participation is not without drawbacks i e stakeholders with more resources can exert more influence huitema et al 2009 its benefits or the management failures due to the lack thereof are well documented in numerous case studies these include the rezoning of marine conservation areas in the great barrier reef australia lédée et al 2012 the water sharing plan for the namoi basin australia ross and martinez santos 2010 and the water reuse projects in california georgia and texas usa lebel et al 2006 informal or shadow policy networks refer to informal governance systems across organizational levels with an interest in influencing and implementing policies in a given resource area folke et al 2005 p 450 informal networks can help stimulate information exchange and collaboration build trust and consensus and provide novelty and innovation to deal with changes these networks operate within rather than replace the formal bureaucratic structures folke et al 2005 whether informal networks contribute to adaptive management ultimately depends on the dominant interest they represent informal networks may also be counterproductive however in the case of noble crayfish conservation in sweden informal networks played a crucial role in the realization of successful outcomes olsson et al 2006 leadership is another important dimension of an adaptive governance regime olsson and folke 2004 folke et al 2005 leadership is key to establishing links within and between organizations to facilitate information flows and help build social capital and social linkages that nurture collaboration and social learning folke et al 2005 leadership is also essential for interpreting and making sense of information and knowledge in order to act on it olsson and folke 2004 folke et al 2005 gupta et al 2010 make a distinction between i visionary leadership to set long term visions and objectives ii entrepreneurial leadership to stimulate actions and undertaking and iii collaborative leadership to bring various stakeholders together in the cases of the coulburn broken catchment and the kristianstad water realm leadership appeared crucial for overcoming institutional scale and other barriers and establishing social links that enabled the formation of ideas skills and other capitals for adaptive management lebel et al 2006 knowledge and information management is critical to achieving adaptive management since social learning knowledge exchange and value sharing is at the heart of adaptive management an adaptive water governance regime must actively support i collaborative knowledge production ii diversity in knowledge iii knowledge and information sharing and iv knowledge and information utilization the inclusion of diverse actor groups in knowledge generation and incorporation of different kinds of knowledge may aid in finding innovative solutions that are widely supported by the stakeholders berkes and folke 2002 olsson and folke 2004 similarly active sharing of knowledge and information help empower different social groups pahl wostl et al 2012 furthermore knowledge and information must be utilized to continually improve policies and management practices huntjens et al 2010 in adaptive management policy development and implementation is considered a process of on going experimentation reflection and adjustment in which i uncertainties are tackled to prepare for change folke et al 2005 ii small scale experiments are systematically supported to explore alternatives folke et al 2005 huntjens et al 2010 iii existing policies and plans are fully implemented huntjens et al 2010 and iv policy evaluation programs and feedback mechanisms are executed to continually fine tune and improve future policies pahl wostl et al 2007b huntjens et al 2010 finally financial management is critical since the availability of financial resources is required for any management actions an adaptive governance regime should therefore i contain mechanisms for recovering the costs of solving problems i e users taxes ii diversify its financial resources using various private and public financial instruments to lower risks should one or more instruments fail pahl wostl 2008 pahl wostl et al 2007b huntjens et al 2010 and iii set up efficient protocols for mobilizing funding for emergency situations drawing from water management and adaptive water governance literature we have operationalized all variables into more specific conditions for adaptive management as shown in table 1 in the next section we clarify how we use this framework to assess the governance conditions for adaptive freshwater management in a coastal province of the vietnamese mekong delta however the applicability of the assessment framework is not necessarily restricted to this area 3 research methods 3 1 case selection to analyse the prospects for adaptive management in the vmd we have conducted an in depth study of the presence of the conditions discussed in section 2 in soc trang province fig 1 where we can find typical natural and socio economic characteristics of the vmd s southeastern coastal region of the five provinces in this region soc trang has a medium landmass 331 165 ha and population density 395 persons km2 agricultural and aquaculture production remain the primary economic activities that demand most land 83 and freshwater use soc trang statistics office 2014 due to its relatively low land surface elevation its extensive coastlines and expansive networks of rivers and canals surface water resources in soc trang are vulnerable to saltwater intrusion cosslett and cosslett 2014 surface water sources also suffer from domestic and industrial waste discharges and the run off of chemical residues from agricultural and aquaculture activities soc trang donre 2010 groundwater is currently the primary source for drinking water and other domestic consumptions in the province but groundwater tables have been detected to steadily decrease at average rates of 10 50 cm y since the 1990s an et al 2014 3 2 data collection we utilized a combination of primary and secondary data from different sources including document analysis in depth interviews and surveys we first studied over 100 legal and policy documents including laws decrees circulars resolutions decisions plans and reports pertaining to salinity intrusion surface water pollution groundwater and environmental protection and climate change issued by vietnamese state agencies at the national provincial and district levels in the vietnamese top down hierarchical system legal documents issued at lower levels cannot deviate from those issued at higher levels thus we selected a combination of nationally and locally issued documents based on their relevancy and applicability to the area under study with regards to each specific condition outlined in the assessment framework we also analysed reports brochures policy briefs and websites on water related projects implemented in soc trang as well as publications of research conducted in the province to evaluate the conditions relating to informal networks knowledge and information management and finance management in addition to the document analysis in april 2016 the first author of this paper conducted 18 in depth face to face and 3 email and telephone interviews which were semi structured according to the conditions mentioned in table 1 interviewees were asked questions on topics that are relevant to the functions and authorities of their agencies each interview took about 45 min interviewees included representatives from government agencies education and research institutes and a state owned water supply company table 2 that were pre selected by their superiors summaries of the interviews were sent to the interviewees for validation for the assessment of the conditions relating to public participation knowledge and information sharing between state and non state actors policy implementation and cost recovery we used a survey involving sixty local resource users paddy rice aquaculture vegetable and fruit farmers the users were members of households 1 the people that participated in the survey were either the heads of or the persons available in the households that the first author randomly entered 1 that were randomly selected from different communes in ke sach nga nam and vinh chau districts fig 1 with the help of local guides these districts represent different levels of susceptibility to salinity intrusion in soc trang ke sach located in the northern most part of the province next to the bassac river has abundant freshwater availability and three seasons of rice crops per year nga nam is a part of the central depression where rice crop is only cultivated in two seasons due to seasonal salinity intrusion from the neighbouring bac lieu province vinh chau directly faces the east sea and suffers from saline water intrusion almost year round due to a limited access to freshwater the main economic activity in this area is saline based aquaculture complemented by one rain fed paddy rice crop in the wet season and vegetable farming utilizing groundwater during the dry season to the extent possible data on most of the conditions were triangulated using multiple sources of information i e different interviewees or combination of interviews and document analysis discrepancies among different sources of data are explicitly mentioned under the result section 3 3 data analysis data from the reviewed documents and in depth interviews are coded into categories corresponding to the conditions specified in table 1 and analysed using the nvivo v 10 software the microsoft excel program is used to analyse the data from the survey with local resource users for each condition the analysis results are compared to the prescribed conditions in the assessment framework to determine whether a condition is i absent ii partially or moderately present 0 or iii fully present 4 results 4 1 governance structure overall soc trang province has a top down governance structure with limited vertical and horizontal integration and little public participation table 3 regarding vertical integration analysis of relevant policy documents 2 decree 36 2012 nd

and authorities concerning freshwater management including policy formulation planning research and international cooperation are concentrated at the national and provincial levels few are transferred to the district and commune levels district and commune governments are mainly responsible for specific implementation tasks such as observing groundwater licensing and pollution prevention regulations sealing idle groundwater wells and managing small water infrastructures i e tertiary canals sluices and pumping stations while all government representatives at the provincial district and commune levels confirmed in the interviews that they had access to decision making processes at higher levels they could provide little evidence supporting their contributions to those processes most respondents also stated that actors from different administrative levels often met and interacted to work on specific projects or issues such as land use planning or agricultural restructuring concerning horizontal integration freshwater issues were not integrated into either soc trang s land use plans or economic development plans such as the social and economic development master plan decision 423 2012 qd ttg in fact per decree 92 2006 nd cp social and economic development master plans and sectoral master plans form the foundation for developing land use plans considerations for water conservation were partly reflected in the restructuring plan on rice paddy land program of the ministry of agriculture rural development mard decision 3367 2014 qd bnn tt and the agricultural restructuring scheme of nga nam district which promoted the planting of more salt tolerant and less water intensive varieties however our respondents from dard and oards commented that the funds for these programs were too limited to incentivize large scale implementation all respondents from the environmental and agricultural agencies also acknowledged that actors from these sectors did not meet regularly but only interacted and collaborated for specific tasks such as land use planning or environmental audits the people s committees are in charge of solving potential cross sectoral conflicts at the provincial district and local levels in some cases they can keep the balance between the water needs for both freshwater based agriculture and saline water based aquaculture cosslett and cosslett 2014 but in other cases water conflicts between different sectors still exist eucker 2011 we however lack the data for a more elaborate assessment of the presence of this condition the laws on the issuance of legal documents law 17 2008 qh12 and law 80 2015 qh13 contain several provisions supporting public participation in policy making however neither these laws nor other associated legal documents include any mechanisms or guidelines for enforcing these provisions indeed all local water users participating in our study confirmed that they were never asked by the local governments to provide inputs for any policies or regulations that apply to their localities while 85 per cent of the participants were aware of the freshwater problems in their neighbourhoods few were proactive in planning adaptive measures or long term solutions as confirmed both by local resource users and representatives from different government agencies the agricultural cooperatives the only form of civic organizations in soc trang are mainly platforms for joint investments for reducing irrigation costs they do not promote innovative solutions to freshwater problems it is difficult to identify the presence of an informal policy network from the available data some freshwater and climate change partnerships are present in soc trang key actors in these partnerships include can tho university ctu the southern institute of water resources research siwrr the division for water resources planning and investigation for the south of vietnam dwrpi soc trang people s committee soc trang pc soc trang department of agriculture and rural development dard soc trang department of natural resources and environment donre and the world bank a few other international organizations such as gesellschaft für internationale zusammenarbeit giz german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation bgr and japan international cooperation agency jica are also active on the periphery it is however not clear whether those entities form a stable network and if so which role this network plays especially in improving water management locally 4 2 leadership table 4 shows the assessment results of the conditions related to leadership water management in vietnam involves various ministries and agencies but the ministries of natural resources and environment monre and agriculture and rural development mard are the most dominant players fig 2 both ministries play leadership roles in water resources management while monre is responsible for the overall planning and management of water resources and is solely in charge of managing groundwater resources mard is responsible for the overall planning implementation and management of hydraulic structures for irrigation flood control and salinity intrusion prevention both monre and mard have subsidiary agencies resp donre and dard at the provincial and district levels the government of vietnam has instituted a planning system that starts with the elaboration of visions into the future based on a vision for 2030 an integrated socio economic development plan for the mekong delta 2014 2020 was developed additionally an informal mekong delta plan mdp containing a long term vision and strategy for a safe prosperous and sustainable delta has been elaborated in cooperation with the dutch government the time horizon of the mdp until 2050 is longer than the average timespan of 20 years in the vietnamese planning system most water related plans of the vietnamese system however contain only short term visions until 2020 the positive score for entrepreneurial leadership is based on the observation that m d onre and m d ard are formally in charge of taking the lead to stimulate actions related water issues i e decree 36 2017 nd cp and decree 15 2017 nd cp moreover the presence of entrepreneurial leadership can also be motivated by observations regarding the economic domain in which the vietnamese government has realized high growth rates by raising awareness brokering specific conditions and engaging the market moreover independent shrimp and rice farmer cooperatives have shown that they are able to take actions to bring different actors together to address problems tinmientay 2016a b although governmental documents call for collaboration between relevant ministries and departments i e law on water resources 17 2012 qh13 our interview results reveal that actual collaboration between water related agencies seems to be limited 4 3 knowledge and information management the presence of the conditions related to knowledge and information management is assessed in table 5 a total of thirty seven studies concerning natural resources and environmental management conducted in soc trang were analysed sixteen of these studies deal with water eight address agro systems five concern soil two examine natural ecosystems and the remaining investigate resource ownership climate change livelihood and adaptation these studies are published in national journals and international peer reviewed journals our review of these studies indicates that various actors including vietnamese universities and state research institutes government agencies international research institutes and universities and foreign private companies are involved in collaborative knowledge production however no local civic organizations are identified to produce or co produce any of these studies local knowledge on ecosystem dynamics is hardly mentioned in these studies knowledge and information sharing in soc trang appear to be limited although various respondents at different levels of administration confirmed that during the last five years public awareness programs on water resources and the environment had been implemented annually in soc trang our survey results however indicate that only 13 3 per cent of the local users have heard of these programs on television and radio also the outreach of project specific public disclosures seems to be limited public consultation workshops are often organized in a later phase of a project mainly for meeting donor s requirements interviews with government representatives at all levels showed that while new policy documents data on salinity intrusion and data serving aquaculture activities were proactively shared among state actors data on water resources in particular and the environment in general was mainly accessible on request information concerning salinity intrusion was proactively and effectively shared with the public but the dissemination of other information including contents of water resource policies and data on water and environmental qualities was rather poor only 5 of local users were aware of the requirement that they have to register the groundwater they extract for household consumption as specified in decision 11 2008 qd ubnd none was knowledgeable about the requirements of decision 33 2010 qd ubnd to pay surface water or groundwater taxes on the contrary our survey data showed that all aqua farmers were aware of the regulations against discharging sludge from shrimp ponds into water sources decision 09 2012 qd ubnd and decision 46 2015 qd ubnd while evidence corroborating systematic utilization of new knowledge and information could not be detected available data indicated that existing policies and plans have to some extent incorporated available knowledge specifically climate change issues have been taken into consideration in several national programs and master plans i e decision 158 2008 qd ttg decision 1824 2014 qd ttg and decision 120 2015 qd ttg in soc trang data from groundwater resource investigations conducted by the division of water resources planning and investment for the south of viet nam has formed the basis for the provincial groundwater resource planning furthermore the design of the seasonal planting calendars and the operations of water control structures depended entirely on salinity intrusion forecasts and daily salinity intrusion records which were manually collected 4 4 policy development and implementation uncertainties were somewhat tackled in the policy development process but not in a systematic manner as shown in table 6 although alternative scenarios were outlined for climate change and rising sea level they were not developed into specific pathways to systematically navigate an uncertain future in particular these scenarios only included preliminary assessments of impacts on different sectors and regions in soc trang long term mitigation and adaptive measures were not consistently integrated into existing policies or spatial and economic development planning moreover most projects and programs designed to address climate change issues have not been implemented during the period of our research although several solutions to freshwater problems were executed and planned structural solutions remain predominant dikes and sluice gates are primary solutions to address salinity intrusion soc trang has a total of 93 8 km of sea dikes 301 2 km of river dikes and 136 sluice gates to reduce pressures on groundwater resources a surface water plant 3 an nghiep water plant in chau thanh district 3 was constructed in soc trang and larger facilities for the entire vmd are currently being planned decision 2140 qđ ttg issued in 2016 non structural measures such as early warning systems and seasonal planting calendars only complement the use of the structural solutions on paper two projects were planned for developing salt tolerant and drought resistant crop varieties but respondents from dard at both provincial and district levels confirmed that such adaptive varieties were not yet developed a respondent from can tho university ctu however shared that bac lieu the neighbouring province of soc trang has contracted the college of agriculture and applied biology at ctu to carry out experiments with salt tolerant rice varieties only a few integrated solutions combining small scale infrastructure with adaptive measures were commissioned by international organizations and foreign government agencies the mangrove reforestation project by giz 4 for details see https www giz de en worldwide 18 661 html 4 is a typical example analysis of future plans and interviews with government representatives indicated that irreversible solutions such as large scale structural installations remained the dominant choice for preventing salinity intrusion and groundwater overexploitation some interviewees including the representatives of environmental agencies at provincial and district levels however acknowledged that regulatory measures are also necessary small scale experiments were not systematically supported in soc trang various respondents reported that several small scale experiments were carried out throughout the province including the planting of salt tolerant soursop trees in nga nam and water saving upland crops in long phu cu lao dung and my xuyen the others districts in soc trang and installations of water saving irrigation models in vinh chau but the funds allocated to these experiments were highly limited except for regulations against discharges of sludge directly from shrimp ponds into water sources most policies were poorly enforced only 16 7 per cent of the local users confirmed that their domestic wells were registered all respondents indicated that the local authorities did not inspect their groundwater extraction activities they also reported that they did not pay any surface water or groundwater taxes similarly all respondents who were not connected to the municipal water networks shared that they did not pay any wastewater discharge fee the remaining respondents were not sure whether the fee was included in their monthly water bills in contrast all aqua farmers reported compliance with the sludge discharge policy as they had witnessed or heard of their neighbours being fined for violations of the regulation most interviewees from environmental agencies claimed that many challenges stood in the way of implementing and enforcing groundwater policies first local users were accustomed to obtaining groundwater resources freely secondly the district and commune governments did not have sufficient manpower to inspect all the drilling sites and so they mostly relied on the leaders of hamlets to monitor and report instances of violations however information flow from the hamlets to commune and district governments was said to be poor the new law on water resources law 17 2012 qh13 came into force in 2012 but some current provincial policies have not been fully updated and were still based on the old law law 08 1998 qh10 two representatives also stated that implementation and enforcement of water policies were also challenging because many local households were too poor to pay water taxes evidence of the presence of mechanisms for a systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of existing policies and plans could not be found 4 5 financial management the assessment of the conditions pertaining to financial management in the study area is presented in table 7 several mechanisms are officially in place to recover costs of investing in water infrastructures and solutions including irrigation and water fees decision 33 2007 qd ubnd and decision 15 2015 qd ubnd wastewater discharge fees decision 06 2014 qd ubnd surface water and groundwater taxes decision 33 2010 qd ubnd and administrative fees relating to water resources decision 20 2014 qd ubnd however both interviews and survey data showed that most of these fees and taxes were not collected data obtained from the interviews with relevant agencies and reports brochures and websites pertaining to water and climate change related projects 5 management of natural resources in the coastal zone of soc trang province by giz building resilience to climate change impacts in southeast asia project by european union saline intrusion prevention for the left bank of the saintard river project by mard scaling up community based adaptation in nga nam district by australian aid coastal ecosystem research water quality integration analysis by yeosun foundation climate change water supply in the mekong delta project by vitens evides international and mekong delta integrated climate change resilience sustainable livelihood project by mard 5 implemented in soc trang after 2008 showed that the primary sources of capital for freshwater management and climate change adaptation mainly came from the state budgets approximately 20 and world bank loans approximately 78 non refundable international development aids only contributed a limited amount 2 contingency funds were included in the annual budgets allocated to the provincial district and commune governments they could be mobilized at the full disposal of the governments at these levels according to the law on state budgets law 01 2002 qh11 and law 83 2015 qh13 and related regulations decree 60 2003 nd cp and circular 59 2003 tt btc these funds were capped at small amounts 2 5 of the total annual budget procedures for mobilizing funds for emergencies beyond these capped amounts were not clearly instituted 5 discussion our study indicates that the freshwater governance regime in the vmd only partially exhibits the conditions that are likely to promote adaptive management especially vertical and horizontal integration are limited while public participation is almost non existent except for salinity intrusion data most knowledge and information are not proactively shared among actors and knowledge and information are not systematically fed into policy development moreover the policy development and implementation process neither thoroughly tackle uncertainties nor contain mechanisms for evaluating policy effectiveness and incorporating feedbacks for future improvement most policies are also poorly implemented financial resources are not strongly diversified and cost recovery mechanisms are rarely implemented we therefore argue that the prospects for adaptive water management in this region are still limited several factors however might have biased above mentioned results first due to the highly compartmentalized nature of the administrative bureaucracy in vietnam the officials who took part in the interviews might not have been familiar with all the aspects of the organizations additionally since most of the interviews took place in non private settings our respondents might have been deterred from discussing certain issues openly second since agriculture including aquaculture is the main economic activity in soc trang we have not included perceptions of other non state stakeholder groups such as commercial businesses or urban dwellers our findings concerning the implementation of surface water and groundwater taxes might change if perceptions from commercial businesses were also included in the survey urban dwellers may have different perceptions on the collection of wastewater discharge fees third the low rate of exposure to public awareness programs may be explained by the fact that most respondents resided in rural areas and are between 30 and 69 years of age whereas the programs are only hosted in the centre of districts and mostly targeted younger populations i e high school and middle school students fourth our analysis involves interpretation that might result in biases since undisputable benchmarks for each of the conditions so far are not available in existing literature notwithstanding these possible biases some of our findings are supported by existing research in particular the lack of public participation we found is consistent with the conclusions by biggs et al 2009 sajor and thu 2009 and hoanh et al 2014 the lack of proactive resolution or adaptation effort among the local users is supported by dang et al 2014 6 conclusions based on our analysis we conclude that the prospects for adaptive management in the vmd so far are limited since its freshwater governance regime only partially exhibits the conditions that are likely to promote adaptive management we have identified several challenges and accordingly would like to make the following recommendations first the national government should institute principles or mechanisms through regulations so that water issues steer economic and spatial development planning rather than the other way around the national government should also develop frameworks for systematically monitoring policy implementation and effectiveness second the provincial government should enhance the involvement of local actors in particular the officials of district and commune governments and local resource users in the policy formulation and management processes delegating more responsibilities and authority to these actors can help instil a sense of resources ownership encourage social learning and invoke incentives for actions the provincial government should also allocate more funds for small scale experiments to support the development of potential adaptive measures such as adaptive and water saving crop varieties to diversify solutions and spread risks third both provincial district and commune governments should invest more financial resources and institute mechanisms to enhance policy implementation specifically they must strengthen information sharing across bureaucratic levels and sectors as well as between the government and the public improvement of public awareness of freshwater issues and pertinent regulations can enhance resource stewardship support public participation and bolster policy implementation fourth the science policy interface can be improved by establishing communities of practice and research national research institutes and universities like can tho university ctu are well connected to many international and domestic actors these organizations can play a critical role in generating long term visions influencing values producing knowledge fostering collaboration and social learning among different actors and brokering solutions to specific issues they should continue to capitalize on their position as important players in the fresh water policy arena fifth to further understand the freshwater governance regime of the vmd and facilitate the transition to adaptive management we recommend to conduct additional in depth and large n studies to determine i the factors preventing local actors from participating in decision making at higher levels ii the institutional barriers to integrated planning iii the effectiveness of each type of communication channel i e television radio and word of mouth iv the existing mechanisms and processes of information exchange between scientists and policymakers vi the elements enabling and impeding social learning and v the factors influencing innovation and the application of innovation sixth next research steps are needed to further elaborate on the assessment framework our assessment framework consists of conditions that do have impact on the adaptive water management as studies in australia lebel et al 2006 india shah et al 2008 south africa varady et al 2013 sweden olsson et al 2006 spain lopez gunn 2003 lopez gunn and cortina 2006 knüppe and pahl wostl 2011 2013 taiwan tang and tang 2006 hungary netherlands portugal and ukraine see huntjens et al 2010 have shown we therefore believe that our framework can be used to study a range of political systems and capture meaningful variations in governance conditions that are relevant to adaptive management the framework has shown its usefulness in our case study but can still be improved by conducting more case studies vietnam s political system is characterized by a state led market economy it may be an option to further tailor our framework and define more specific benchmarks by incorporating features of the political system our general operationalization of the conditions may be refined by studying water governance regimes in other parts of the vmd or in countries like cambodia china laos and thailand that also have a state led market economy moreover the practicality of our approach can be further tested by applying it to cases with other political systems as well in theory this would allow us to further discuss which of the conditions of our framework really matter in promoting adaptive management we believe that our framework allows us to capture relevant variations in governance conditions but further applications must clarify what the limitations of our approach are since recent projections of groundwater use and related land subsidence indicate that further depletion of the groundwater resources will occur and that cities are also likely to experience more frequent and prolonged inundation periods minderhoud et al 2017 we think that the political momentum for effectuating our suggestions has arrived the changes we propose do match with the contents of the dominant strategic plans for the area the mekong development plan and the master plan on the socio economic development of focal areas in the mekong delta decision 1005

7482,the vietnamese mekong delta vmd is a region of utmost importance to vietnam s national food security however the availability of required freshwater resources from both surface and groundwater sources is currently under great threats due to dry season salinity intrusion surface water pollution and over exploitation of groundwater global climate change sea level rise and upstream and in situ development activities may worsen the situation assuming that adaptive management could be a promising strategy to address the increasingly complex and unpredictable water related problems in the vmd we design and apply a framework to identify the extent to which the governance regime in this region exhibits conditions that are likely to promote adaptive freshwater management using both primary and secondary data our analysis reveals that the prospects for adaptive water management in the study area are limited since several conditions were not present we observe among others limitations in vertical and horizontal integration and public participation restraints in knowledge and information sharing inadequate policy development and implementation and insufficient diversification of financial resources following our findings we conclude the paper with recommendations both for national regional and local policy interventions and for future research keywords adaptive management water governance salinity intrusion groundwater land subsidence vietnam 1 introduction the vietnamese mekong delta vmd 12 of vietnam s total area is of utmost importance to vietnam s national food security cosslett and cosslett 2014 anthony et al 2015 smajgl et al 2015 the delta home to approximately 17 6 million people representing one fifth of the vietnamese population gsov 2015 is characterized by a tropical monsoon climate with a wet season from june to november and a dry season from december to may cosslett and cosslett 2014 paddy rice production and aquaculture are dominant economic activities in the vmd approximately 65 of the land 2 6 million ha in the delta is used for agriculture of which 2 million ha is used for rice paddies between 1995 and 2014 the vmd contributed more than 50 annually to vietnam s total outputs in rice and fishery production gsov 2015 in 2013 vietnam s rice export accounted for 8 7 of the global rice market positioning the country as one of the major global rice exporters fao 2016 according to hoanh et al 2014 the delta s contribution in rice production was even more significant about 70 in recent years agriculture in the vmd has been sustained by an abundant availability of freshwater and riverine sediment from the mekong river rice based farming systems account for more than 65 of total freshwater demands in the delta cosslett and cosslett 2014 however freshwater availability in the vmd is increasingly threatened by global climate change rising sea level and upstream and in situ development activities smajgl et al 2015 problems affecting freshwater resources in coastal areas of the vmd are interrelated they include dry season salinity intrusion cosslett and cosslett 2014 trung and tri 2014 smajgl et al 2015 which may negatively impact rice production kotera et al 2008 chen et al 2012 surface water pollution moglia et al 2012 wilbers et al 2014 chau et al 2015 giang et al 2015 and over exploitation of groundwater erban et al 2014 dang et al 2016 groundwater resources in the middle and lower vmd are already systematically depleted governments of vietnam and the netherlands 2013 ha et al 2015 an average decline of 26 cm y was detected erban et al 2014 and reductions will continue shrestha et al 2016 unless sufficient strategies to restrict groundwater use are implemented iucn 2011 declines in groundwater levels introduce another significant challenge since accelerated groundwater extraction has also been linked to compaction based land subsidence averaged at 1 6 cm y hak et al 2016 in the next decades land subsidence may increase the risks associated with sea level rise hak et al 2016 with greater magnitudes ingebritsen and galloway 2014 moreover pump induced land subsidence has also been connected to the release and spread of arsenic to deep aquifers erban et al 2013 erban and gorelick 2016 huang et al 2016 considering the growing complexities and unpredictability of freshwater problems in the vmd adaptive management may be a promising strategy for sustaining the region s freshwater resources traditionally water management has been a top down state led process characterized by a command and control approach which mainly resorts to technical and engineering solutions folke 2006 ostrom 2009 biswas and tortajada 2010 and neglects the complexities of the human dimension pahl wostl et al 2010 engle et al 2011 in the past decades adaptive management has emerged as a new paradigm castro 2007 pahl wostl et al 2012 and has been strongly advocated as an appropriate approach to address water issues pahl wostl 2007 2008 bogardi et al 2012 the ability to deal with uncertainties is an essential requirement for sustainable water management in times of global climate change pahl wostl et al 2007b an adaptive management strategy however must be embedded in and supported by the existing water governance regime so far studies exploring water governance issues in the vmd are limited existing research has shed light on the legal framework for water management nguyen 2012 institutional structures and prominent actors evers and benedikter 2015 sajor and thu 2009 irrigation policy development hoanh et al 2014 and river basin management molle and hoanh 2009 none of these studies has comprehensively investigated the prospects for adaptive water management in this region our study therefore addresses this knowledge gap by identifying the extent to which the freshwater governance regime in the vmd exhibits conditions that are likely to promote adaptive management for coping with growing future uncertainties by doing this our study also provides a comprehensive overview of this region s water governance regime that can guide more in depth future research 2 promoting adaptive management an assessment framework adaptive management which originated in holling s resilience theory as mentioned by folke et al 2005 can be defined as a systematic process for continually improving management policies and practices by learning from the outcomes of implemented management strategies pahl wostl 2007 adaptive management explicitly acknowledges the inherently complex non linear and unpredictable nature of ecosystems folke et al 2004 folke 2006 and emphasizes learning experimentation and flexibility as means of developing the capacity for managing uncertainties and changes folke et al 2005 huitema et al 2009 central to adaptive management is the concept of social learning a multi scale process in which diverse stakeholder groups are involved to generate and communicate knowledge and to share values and perspectives in order to collectively improve their situations bouwen and taillieu 2004 pahl wostl et al 2007a an adaptive governance regime refers to the broader social and institutional contexts that enable adaptive management of ecosystems dietz et al 2003 specifically to the structures and processes by which actors in societies share power deliberate coordinate and make decisions lebel et al 2006 in order to support successful adaptive management a governance regime must i promote multi party interaction to enable collaboration and social learning bouwen and taillieu 2004 folke et al 2005 pahl wostl et al 2007a ii facilitate the involvement of various actors in knowledge production to improve the diversity of knowledge and perspectives folke et al 2005 lebel et al 2006 iii allow for the integration of learning and knowledge into policy and management processes to continually improve them folke et al 2005 and iv support measures to spread risks to tackle uncertainties folke et al 2005 huntjens et al 2010 based on the works of pahl wostl 2008 and huntjens et al 2010 we have developed an assessment framework table 1 that consists of conditions that are grouped under five dimensions i governance and structure ii leadership iii knowledge and information management iv policy development and implementation and v financial management according to pahl wostl 2008 the governance structure of an adaptive water governance regime must be polycentric and horizontal with broad stakeholder participation polycentric governance arrangements are best understood as structures consisting of many nested or sometimes partly overlapping semi autonomous decision making centres ostrom 1996 mcginnis 1999 they are assumed to have a high adaptive capacity due to their potential to self organize and to change like complex adaptive systems i e organisms or nervous and immune systems pahl wostl 2009 furthermore the multiple relatively independent decision making centres within a polycentric structure allow the development of context appropriate institutions that may enable the implementation of adaptive measures at suitable levels lebel et al 2006 however coordination and collaboration can be challenging in polycentric systems huitema et al 2009 thus the multiple decision making centres in these systems must be well integrated both vertically and horizontally to ensure a good flow of information and good social collaboration ostrom 2005 pahl wostl 2008 2009 public participation and informal networks also contribute to building social capital for social learning and collaboration folke et al 2005 olsson et al 2006 pahl wostl 2008 vertical integration refers to the interplay and cooperation between different hierarchical levels of administration involved in water management i e local regional national and international levels and the distribution of authorities among these hierarchies pahl wostl 2009 a lack of vertical integration tends to result in policy failures if different management levels are disconnected gaps between policy development and implementation are most likely to arise ostrom 2005 pahl wostl 2009 examples of failures resulting from a lack of vertical integration include the failed attempts to reform water institutions in south africa varady et al 2013 and the ineffectiveness of many groundwater user associations in spain lopez gunn 2003 lopez gunn and cortina 2006 horizontal integration refers to the integration between water related sectors like agriculture transportation and environmental management knüppe and pahl wostl 2011 2013 adaptive water management requires a high level of sectoral integration to identify inconsistencies and emerging issues and to ensure unified adaptive responses to changes pahl wostl 2008 pahl wostl et al 2010 horizontal integration can be achieved through processes of network governance rather than through bureaucratic hierarchies and centralized policy development and implementation pahl wostl et al 2007a horizontal integration was found to be crucial in resolving land subsidence problems in taiwan tang and tang 2006 and in reducing groundwater extraction in gujarat india shah et al 2008 public participation may contribute to a better use of available information and enhance the quality of decision making huitema et al 2009 by opening up access to different types of knowledge and perspectives public participation facilitates information exchange lebel et al 2006 knüppe and pahl wostl 2013 moreover repeated interactions among stakeholders can contribute to building trust improving shared understanding of management issues at stake and enabling social learning lebel et al 2006 huitema et al 2009 although in reality public participation is not without drawbacks i e stakeholders with more resources can exert more influence huitema et al 2009 its benefits or the management failures due to the lack thereof are well documented in numerous case studies these include the rezoning of marine conservation areas in the great barrier reef australia lédée et al 2012 the water sharing plan for the namoi basin australia ross and martinez santos 2010 and the water reuse projects in california georgia and texas usa lebel et al 2006 informal or shadow policy networks refer to informal governance systems across organizational levels with an interest in influencing and implementing policies in a given resource area folke et al 2005 p 450 informal networks can help stimulate information exchange and collaboration build trust and consensus and provide novelty and innovation to deal with changes these networks operate within rather than replace the formal bureaucratic structures folke et al 2005 whether informal networks contribute to adaptive management ultimately depends on the dominant interest they represent informal networks may also be counterproductive however in the case of noble crayfish conservation in sweden informal networks played a crucial role in the realization of successful outcomes olsson et al 2006 leadership is another important dimension of an adaptive governance regime olsson and folke 2004 folke et al 2005 leadership is key to establishing links within and between organizations to facilitate information flows and help build social capital and social linkages that nurture collaboration and social learning folke et al 2005 leadership is also essential for interpreting and making sense of information and knowledge in order to act on it olsson and folke 2004 folke et al 2005 gupta et al 2010 make a distinction between i visionary leadership to set long term visions and objectives ii entrepreneurial leadership to stimulate actions and undertaking and iii collaborative leadership to bring various stakeholders together in the cases of the coulburn broken catchment and the kristianstad water realm leadership appeared crucial for overcoming institutional scale and other barriers and establishing social links that enabled the formation of ideas skills and other capitals for adaptive management lebel et al 2006 knowledge and information management is critical to achieving adaptive management since social learning knowledge exchange and value sharing is at the heart of adaptive management an adaptive water governance regime must actively support i collaborative knowledge production ii diversity in knowledge iii knowledge and information sharing and iv knowledge and information utilization the inclusion of diverse actor groups in knowledge generation and incorporation of different kinds of knowledge may aid in finding innovative solutions that are widely supported by the stakeholders berkes and folke 2002 olsson and folke 2004 similarly active sharing of knowledge and information help empower different social groups pahl wostl et al 2012 furthermore knowledge and information must be utilized to continually improve policies and management practices huntjens et al 2010 in adaptive management policy development and implementation is considered a process of on going experimentation reflection and adjustment in which i uncertainties are tackled to prepare for change folke et al 2005 ii small scale experiments are systematically supported to explore alternatives folke et al 2005 huntjens et al 2010 iii existing policies and plans are fully implemented huntjens et al 2010 and iv policy evaluation programs and feedback mechanisms are executed to continually fine tune and improve future policies pahl wostl et al 2007b huntjens et al 2010 finally financial management is critical since the availability of financial resources is required for any management actions an adaptive governance regime should therefore i contain mechanisms for recovering the costs of solving problems i e users taxes ii diversify its financial resources using various private and public financial instruments to lower risks should one or more instruments fail pahl wostl 2008 pahl wostl et al 2007b huntjens et al 2010 and iii set up efficient protocols for mobilizing funding for emergency situations drawing from water management and adaptive water governance literature we have operationalized all variables into more specific conditions for adaptive management as shown in table 1 in the next section we clarify how we use this framework to assess the governance conditions for adaptive freshwater management in a coastal province of the vietnamese mekong delta however the applicability of the assessment framework is not necessarily restricted to this area 3 research methods 3 1 case selection to analyse the prospects for adaptive management in the vmd we have conducted an in depth study of the presence of the conditions discussed in section 2 in soc trang province fig 1 where we can find typical natural and socio economic characteristics of the vmd s southeastern coastal region of the five provinces in this region soc trang has a medium landmass 331 165 ha and population density 395 persons km2 agricultural and aquaculture production remain the primary economic activities that demand most land 83 and freshwater use soc trang statistics office 2014 due to its relatively low land surface elevation its extensive coastlines and expansive networks of rivers and canals surface water resources in soc trang are vulnerable to saltwater intrusion cosslett and cosslett 2014 surface water sources also suffer from domestic and industrial waste discharges and the run off of chemical residues from agricultural and aquaculture activities soc trang donre 2010 groundwater is currently the primary source for drinking water and other domestic consumptions in the province but groundwater tables have been detected to steadily decrease at average rates of 10 50 cm y since the 1990s an et al 2014 3 2 data collection we utilized a combination of primary and secondary data from different sources including document analysis in depth interviews and surveys we first studied over 100 legal and policy documents including laws decrees circulars resolutions decisions plans and reports pertaining to salinity intrusion surface water pollution groundwater and environmental protection and climate change issued by vietnamese state agencies at the national provincial and district levels in the vietnamese top down hierarchical system legal documents issued at lower levels cannot deviate from those issued at higher levels thus we selected a combination of nationally and locally issued documents based on their relevancy and applicability to the area under study with regards to each specific condition outlined in the assessment framework we also analysed reports brochures policy briefs and websites on water related projects implemented in soc trang as well as publications of research conducted in the province to evaluate the conditions relating to informal networks knowledge and information management and finance management in addition to the document analysis in april 2016 the first author of this paper conducted 18 in depth face to face and 3 email and telephone interviews which were semi structured according to the conditions mentioned in table 1 interviewees were asked questions on topics that are relevant to the functions and authorities of their agencies each interview took about 45 min interviewees included representatives from government agencies education and research institutes and a state owned water supply company table 2 that were pre selected by their superiors summaries of the interviews were sent to the interviewees for validation for the assessment of the conditions relating to public participation knowledge and information sharing between state and non state actors policy implementation and cost recovery we used a survey involving sixty local resource users paddy rice aquaculture vegetable and fruit farmers the users were members of households 1 the people that participated in the survey were either the heads of or the persons available in the households that the first author randomly entered 1 that were randomly selected from different communes in ke sach nga nam and vinh chau districts fig 1 with the help of local guides these districts represent different levels of susceptibility to salinity intrusion in soc trang ke sach located in the northern most part of the province next to the bassac river has abundant freshwater availability and three seasons of rice crops per year nga nam is a part of the central depression where rice crop is only cultivated in two seasons due to seasonal salinity intrusion from the neighbouring bac lieu province vinh chau directly faces the east sea and suffers from saline water intrusion almost year round due to a limited access to freshwater the main economic activity in this area is saline based aquaculture complemented by one rain fed paddy rice crop in the wet season and vegetable farming utilizing groundwater during the dry season to the extent possible data on most of the conditions were triangulated using multiple sources of information i e different interviewees or combination of interviews and document analysis discrepancies among different sources of data are explicitly mentioned under the result section 3 3 data analysis data from the reviewed documents and in depth interviews are coded into categories corresponding to the conditions specified in table 1 and analysed using the nvivo v 10 software the microsoft excel program is used to analyse the data from the survey with local resource users for each condition the analysis results are compared to the prescribed conditions in the assessment framework to determine whether a condition is i absent ii partially or moderately present 0 or iii fully present 4 results 4 1 governance structure overall soc trang province has a top down governance structure with limited vertical and horizontal integration and little public participation table 3 regarding vertical integration analysis of relevant policy documents 2 decree 36 2012 nd

and authorities concerning freshwater management including policy formulation planning research and international cooperation are concentrated at the national and provincial levels few are transferred to the district and commune levels district and commune governments are mainly responsible for specific implementation tasks such as observing groundwater licensing and pollution prevention regulations sealing idle groundwater wells and managing small water infrastructures i e tertiary canals sluices and pumping stations while all government representatives at the provincial district and commune levels confirmed in the interviews that they had access to decision making processes at higher levels they could provide little evidence supporting their contributions to those processes most respondents also stated that actors from different administrative levels often met and interacted to work on specific projects or issues such as land use planning or agricultural restructuring concerning horizontal integration freshwater issues were not integrated into either soc trang s land use plans or economic development plans such as the social and economic development master plan decision 423 2012 qd ttg in fact per decree 92 2006 nd cp social and economic development master plans and sectoral master plans form the foundation for developing land use plans considerations for water conservation were partly reflected in the restructuring plan on rice paddy land program of the ministry of agriculture rural development mard decision 3367 2014 qd bnn tt and the agricultural restructuring scheme of nga nam district which promoted the planting of more salt tolerant and less water intensive varieties however our respondents from dard and oards commented that the funds for these programs were too limited to incentivize large scale implementation all respondents from the environmental and agricultural agencies also acknowledged that actors from these sectors did not meet regularly but only interacted and collaborated for specific tasks such as land use planning or environmental audits the people s committees are in charge of solving potential cross sectoral conflicts at the provincial district and local levels in some cases they can keep the balance between the water needs for both freshwater based agriculture and saline water based aquaculture cosslett and cosslett 2014 but in other cases water conflicts between different sectors still exist eucker 2011 we however lack the data for a more elaborate assessment of the presence of this condition the laws on the issuance of legal documents law 17 2008 qh12 and law 80 2015 qh13 contain several provisions supporting public participation in policy making however neither these laws nor other associated legal documents include any mechanisms or guidelines for enforcing these provisions indeed all local water users participating in our study confirmed that they were never asked by the local governments to provide inputs for any policies or regulations that apply to their localities while 85 per cent of the participants were aware of the freshwater problems in their neighbourhoods few were proactive in planning adaptive measures or long term solutions as confirmed both by local resource users and representatives from different government agencies the agricultural cooperatives the only form of civic organizations in soc trang are mainly platforms for joint investments for reducing irrigation costs they do not promote innovative solutions to freshwater problems it is difficult to identify the presence of an informal policy network from the available data some freshwater and climate change partnerships are present in soc trang key actors in these partnerships include can tho

periphery it is however not clear whether those entities form a stable network and if so which role this network plays especially in improving water management locally 4 2 leadership table 4 shows the assessment results of the conditions related to leadership water management in vietnam involves various ministries and agencies but the ministries of natural resources and environment monre and agriculture and rural development mard are the most dominant players fig 2 both ministries play leadership roles in water resources management while monre is responsible for the overall planning and management of water resources and is solely in charge of managing groundwater resources mard is responsible for the overall planning implementation and management of hydraulic structures for irrigation flood control and salinity intrusion prevention both monre and mard have subsidiary agencies resp donre and dard at the provincial and district levels the government of vietnam has instituted a planning system that starts with the elaboration of visions into the future based on a vision for 2030 an integrated socio economic development plan for the mekong delta 2014 2020 was developed additionally an informal mekong delta plan mdp containing a long term vision and strategy for a safe prosperous and sustainable delta has been elaborated in cooperation with the dutch government the time horizon of the mdp until 2050 is longer than the average timespan of 20 years in the vietnamese planning system most water related plans of the vietnamese system however contain only short term visions until 2020 the positive score for entrepreneurial leadership is based on the observation that m d onre and m d ard are formally in charge of taking the lead to stimulate actions related water issues i e decree 36 2017 nd cp and decree 15 2017 nd cp moreover the presence of entrepreneurial leadership can also be motivated by observations regarding the economic domain in which the vietnamese government has realized high growth rates by raising awareness brokering specific conditions and engaging the market moreover independent shrimp and rice farmer cooperatives have shown that they are able to take actions to bring different actors together to address problems tinmientay 2016a b although governmental documents call for collaboration between relevant ministries and departments i e law on water resources 17 2012 qh13 our interview results reveal that actual collaboration between water related agencies seems to be limited 4 3 knowledge and information management the presence of the conditions related to knowledge and information management is assessed in table 5 a total of thirty seven studies concerning natural resources and environmental management conducted in soc trang were analysed sixteen of these studies deal with water eight address agro systems five concern soil two examine natural ecosystems and the remaining investigate resource ownership climate change livelihood and adaptation these studies are published in national journals and international peer reviewed journals our review of these studies indicates that various actors including vietnamese universities and state research institutes government agencies international research institutes and universities and foreign private companies are involved in collaborative knowledge production however no local civic organizations are identified to produce or co produce any of these studies local knowledge on ecosystem dynamics is hardly mentioned in these studies knowledge and information sharing in soc trang appear to be limited although various respondents at different levels of administration confirmed that during the last five years public awareness programs on water resources and the environment had been implemented annually in soc trang our survey results however indicate that only 13 3 per cent of the local users have heard of these programs on television and radio also the outreach of project specific public disclosures seems to be limited public consultation workshops are often organized in a later phase of a project mainly for meeting donor s requirements interviews with government representatives at all levels showed that while new policy documents data on salinity intrusion and data serving aquaculture activities were proactively shared among state actors data on water resources in particular and the environment in general was mainly accessible on request information concerning salinity intrusion was proactively and effectively shared with the public but the dissemination of other information including contents of water resource policies and data on water and environmental qualities was rather poor only 5 of local users were aware of the requirement that they have to register the groundwater they extract for household consumption as specified in decision 11 2008 qd ubnd none was knowledgeable about the requirements of decision 33 2010 qd ubnd to pay surface water or groundwater taxes on the contrary our survey data showed that all aqua farmers were aware of the regulations against discharging sludge from shrimp ponds into water sources decision 09 2012 qd ubnd and decision 46 2015 qd ubnd while evidence corroborating systematic utilization of new knowledge and information could not be detected available data indicated that existing policies and plans have to some extent incorporated available knowledge specifically climate change issues have been taken into consideration in several national programs and master plans i e decision 158 2008 qd ttg decision 1824 2014 qd ttg and decision 120 2015 qd ttg in soc trang data from groundwater resource investigations conducted by the division of water resources planning and investment for the south of viet nam has formed the basis for the provincial groundwater resource planning furthermore the design of the seasonal planting calendars and the operations of water control structures depended entirely on salinity intrusion forecasts and daily salinity intrusion records which were manually collected 4 4 policy development and implementation uncertainties were somewhat tackled in the policy development process but not in a systematic manner as shown in table 6 although alternative scenarios were outlined for climate change and rising sea level they were not developed into specific pathways to systematically navigate an uncertain future in particular these scenarios only included preliminary assessments of impacts on different sectors and regions in soc trang long term mitigation and adaptive measures were not consistently integrated into existing policies or spatial and economic development planning moreover most projects and programs designed to address climate change issues have not been implemented during the period of our research although several solutions to freshwater problems were executed and planned structural solutions remain predominant dikes and sluice gates are primary solutions to address salinity intrusion soc trang has a total of 93 8 km of sea dikes 301 2 km of river dikes and 136 sluice gates to reduce pressures on groundwater resources a surface water plant 3 an nghiep water plant in chau thanh district 3 was constructed in soc trang and larger facilities for the entire vmd are currently being planned decision 2140 qđ ttg issued in 2016 non structural measures such as early warning systems and seasonal planting calendars only complement the use of the structural solutions on paper two projects were planned for developing salt tolerant and drought resistant crop varieties but respondents from dard at both provincial and district levels confirmed that such adaptive varieties were not yet developed a respondent from can tho university ctu however shared that bac lieu the neighbouring province of soc trang has contracted the college of agriculture and applied biology at ctu to carry out experiments with salt tolerant rice varieties only a few integrated solutions combining small scale infrastructure with adaptive measures were commissioned by international organizations and foreign government agencies the mangrove reforestation project by giz 4 for details see https www giz de en worldwide 18 661 html 4 is a typical example analysis of future plans and interviews with government representatives indicated that irreversible solutions such as large scale structural installations remained the dominant choice for preventing salinity intrusion and groundwater overexploitation some interviewees including the representatives of environmental agencies at provincial and district levels however acknowledged that regulatory measures are also necessary small scale experiments were not systematically supported in soc trang various respondents reported that several small scale experiments were carried out throughout the province including the planting of salt tolerant soursop trees in nga nam and water saving upland crops in long phu cu lao dung and my xuyen the others districts in soc trang and installations of water saving irrigation models in vinh chau but the funds allocated to these experiments were highly limited except for regulations against discharges of sludge directly from shrimp ponds into water sources most policies were poorly enforced only 16 7 per cent of the local users confirmed that their domestic wells were registered all respondents indicated that the local authorities did not inspect their groundwater extraction activities they also reported that they did not pay any surface water or groundwater taxes similarly all respondents who were not connected to the municipal water networks shared that they did not pay any wastewater discharge fee the remaining respondents were not sure whether the fee was included in their monthly water bills in contrast all aqua farmers reported compliance with the sludge discharge policy as they had witnessed or heard of their neighbours being fined for violations of the regulation most interviewees from environmental agencies claimed that many challenges stood in the way of implementing and enforcing groundwater policies first local users were accustomed to obtaining groundwater resources freely secondly the district and commune governments did not have sufficient manpower to inspect all the drilling sites and so they mostly relied on the leaders of hamlets to monitor and report instances of violations however information flow from the hamlets to commune and district governments was said to be poor the new law on water resources law 17 2012 qh13 came into force in 2012 but some current provincial policies have not been fully updated and were still based on the old law law 08 1998 qh10 two representatives also stated that implementation and enforcement of water policies were also challenging because many local households were too poor to pay water taxes evidence of the presence of mechanisms for a systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of existing policies and plans could not be found 4 5 financial management the assessment of the conditions pertaining to financial management in the study area is presented in table 7 several mechanisms are officially in place to recover costs of investing in water infrastructures and solutions including irrigation and water fees decision 33 2007 qd ubnd and decision 15 2015 qd ubnd wastewater discharge fees decision 06 2014 qd ubnd surface water and groundwater taxes decision 33 2010 qd ubnd and administrative fees relating to water resources decision 20 2014 qd ubnd however both interviews and survey data showed that most of these fees and taxes were not collected data obtained from the interviews with relevant agencies and reports brochures and websites pertaining to water and climate change related projects 5 management of natural resources in the coastal zone of soc trang province by giz building resilience to climate change impacts in southeast asia project by european union saline intrusion prevention for the left bank of the saintard river project by mard scaling up community based adaptation in nga nam district by australian aid coastal ecosystem research water quality integration analysis by yeosun foundation climate change water supply in the mekong delta project by vitens evides international and mekong delta integrated climate change resilience sustainable livelihood project by mard 5 implemented in soc trang after 2008 showed that the primary sources of capital for freshwater management and climate change adaptation mainly came from the state budgets approximately 20 and world bank loans approximately 78 non refundable international development aids only contributed a limited amount 2 contingency funds were included in the annual budgets allocated to the provincial district and commune governments they could be mobilized at the full disposal of the governments at these levels according to the law on state budgets law 01 2002 qh11 and law 83 2015 qh13 and related regulations decree 60 2003 nd cp and circular 59 2003 tt btc these funds were capped at small amounts 2 5 of the total annual budget procedures for mobilizing funds for emergencies beyond these capped amounts were not clearly instituted 5 discussion our study indicates that the freshwater governance regime in the vmd only partially exhibits the conditions that are likely to promote adaptive management especially vertical and horizontal integration are limited while public participation is almost non existent except for salinity intrusion data most knowledge and information are not proactively shared among actors and knowledge and information are not systematically fed into policy development moreover the policy development and implementation process neither thoroughly tackle uncertainties nor contain mechanisms for evaluating policy effectiveness and incorporating feedbacks for future improvement most policies are also poorly implemented financial resources are not strongly diversified and cost recovery mechanisms are rarely implemented we therefore argue that the prospects for adaptive water management in this region are still limited several factors however might have biased above mentioned results first due to the highly compartmentalized nature of the administrative bureaucracy in vietnam the officials who took part in the interviews might not have been familiar with all the aspects of the organizations additionally since most of the interviews took place in non private settings our respondents might have been deterred from discussing certain issues openly second since agriculture including aquaculture is the main economic activity in soc trang we have not included perceptions of other non state stakeholder groups such as commercial businesses or urban dwellers our findings concerning the implementation of surface water and groundwater taxes might change if perceptions from commercial businesses were also included in the survey urban dwellers may have different perceptions on the collection of wastewater discharge fees third the low rate of exposure to public awareness programs may be explained by the fact that most respondents resided in rural areas and are between 30 and 69 years of age whereas the programs are only hosted in the centre of districts and mostly targeted younger populations i e high school and middle school students fourth our analysis involves interpretation that might result in biases since undisputable benchmarks for each of the conditions so far are not available in existing literature notwithstanding these possible biases some of our findings are supported by existing research in particular the lack of public participation we found is consistent with the conclusions by biggs et al 2009 sajor and thu 2009 and hoanh et al 2014 the lack of proactive resolution or adaptation effort among the local users is supported by dang et al 2014 6 conclusions based on our analysis we conclude that the prospects for adaptive management in the vmd so far are limited since its freshwater governance regime only partially exhibits the conditions that are likely to promote adaptive management we have identified several challenges and accordingly would like to make the following recommendations first the national government should institute principles or mechanisms through regulations so that water issues steer economic and spatial development planning rather than the other way around the national government should also develop frameworks for systematically monitoring policy implementation and effectiveness second the provincial government should enhance the involvement of local actors in particular the officials of district and commune governments and local resource users in the policy formulation and management processes delegating more responsibilities and authority to these actors can help instil a sense of resources ownership encourage social learning and invoke incentives for actions the provincial government should also allocate more funds for small scale experiments to support the development of potential adaptive measures such as adaptive and water saving crop varieties to diversify solutions and spread risks third both provincial district and commune governments should invest more financial resources and institute mechanisms to enhance policy implementation specifically they must strengthen information sharing across bureaucratic levels and sectors as well as between the government and the public improvement of public awareness of freshwater issues and pertinent regulations can enhance resource stewardship support public participation and bolster policy implementation fourth the science policy interface can be improved by establishing communities of practice and research national research institutes and universities like can tho university ctu are well connected to many international and domestic actors these organizations can play a critical role in generating long term visions influencing values producing knowledge fostering collaboration and social learning among different actors and brokering solutions to specific issues they should continue to capitalize on their position as important players in the fresh water policy arena fifth to further understand the freshwater governance regime of the vmd and facilitate the transition to adaptive management we recommend to conduct additional in depth and large n studies to determine i the factors preventing local actors from participating in decision making at higher levels ii the institutional barriers to integrated planning iii the effectiveness of each type of communication channel i e television radio and word of mouth iv the existing mechanisms and processes of information exchange between scientists and policymakers vi the elements enabling and impeding social learning and v the factors influencing innovation and the application of innovation sixth next research steps are needed to further elaborate on the assessment framework our assessment framework consists of conditions that do have impact on the adaptive water management as studies in australia lebel et al 2006 india shah et al 2008 south africa varady et al 2013 sweden olsson et al 2006 spain lopez gunn 2003 lopez gunn and cortina 2006 knüppe and pahl wostl 2011 2013 taiwan tang and tang 2006 hungary netherlands portugal and ukraine see huntjens et al 2010 have shown we therefore believe that our framework can be used to study a range of political systems and capture meaningful variations in governance conditions that are relevant to adaptive management the framework has shown its usefulness in our case study but can still be improved by conducting more case studies vietnam s political system is characterized by a state led market economy it may be an option to further tailor our framework and define more specific benchmarks by incorporating features of the political system our general operationalization of the conditions may be refined by studying water governance regimes in other parts of the vmd or in countries like cambodia china laos and thailand that also have a state led market economy moreover the practicality of our approach can be further tested by applying it to cases with other political systems as well in theory this would allow us to further discuss which of the conditions of our framework really matter in promoting adaptive management we believe that our framework allows us to capture relevant variations in governance conditions but further applications must clarify what the limitations of our approach are since recent projections of groundwater use and related land subsidence indicate that further depletion of the groundwater resources will occur and that cities are also likely to experience more frequent and prolonged inundation periods minderhoud et al 2017 we think that the political momentum for effectuating our suggestions has arrived the changes we propose do match with the contents of the dominant strategic plans for the area the mekong development plan and the master plan on the socio economic development of focal areas in the mekong delta decision 1005

7483,for most of aquifers with abundant groundwater resource quantifications of tortuosity and corresponding representative elementary volume rev are very essential to improve the understanding of groundwater and contaminant transfers in porous media in this study a mathematical model of tortuosity based on the three dimensional 3d microstructure of regular tetrahedron rtm is proposed to quantify tortuosity and corresponding rev of granular porous media the calculated tortuosity using the new 3d rtm model agrees well with the measured tortuosity in experiment indicating that the new 3d microstructure model is more appropriate to precisely delineate the tortuosity of granular porous media afterward the new model is utilized to quantify the tortuosity of heterogeneous translucent silica moreover corresponding rev is estimated using a criterion of relative gradient error ε g i results suggest minimum τ rev sizes most distribute in 0 0 5 0 mm and the bound of cumulative frequency above 80 is larger than 3 00 mm the rev scale of tortuosity has its own rationality and superiority over that estimated by two dimensional 2d tortuosity model implying the proposed 3d tortuosity model of rtm is helpful for understanding the tortuosity of flow paths in granular porous media and corresponding rev estimation of tortuosity keywords granular porous media tortuosity flow

industrial and ecosystem water consumption all rely on groundwater bakshevskaia and pozdniakov 2016 cui et al 2016 liu et al 2016 wu et al 2017a b usually abundant groundwater resources are stored in aquifer composed of granular porous media like coastal and river bank aquifers with the development of industry and agriculture groundwater overexploitation caused by human beings become more and more

of groundwater overexploitation the granular aquifer also is contaminated by various contaminants released from human activities tye and lapworth 2016 the macroscopic transport of water and contaminant in granular porous media are related to the tortuosity which is the ratio of the actual length of flow path to the straight length along the macroscopic pressure gradient scheidegger 1974 sahimi 1993 koponen et al 1996 clennell 1997 yu and cheng 2002 yu et al 2003 yun et al 2006 matyka et al 2008 as a consequence a quantitative understanding of tortuosity of granular porous media is crucial to improve the understanding of water and contaminants transport in porous media and designing associated remediation scheme the flow path of water and contaminant transfer in granular porous media is very complex which makes the tortuosity hard to be characterized carman 1937 carman 1956 kubik 1986 adler 1992 koponen et al 1996 lovell and harvey 1997 yun et al 2005 yun et al 2006 cieszko 2009 tortuosity is a ratio which characterizes tortuous flow path of fluid diffusion and electrical conduction the complexity of flow path in porous media leads to different transport phenomena and various definitions of tortuosity such as diffusive electrical and acoustic tortuosity definitions clennell 1997 matyka et al 2008 the tortuosity of porous media is significant which related to groundwater transport and contaminants migration some experiments were conducted to measure tortuosity of porous media and obtain the experimental correlation equation between tortuosity and some empirical parameters wyllie and gregory 1955 comiti and renaud 1989 to achieve the mechanism of tortuosity of flow path in porous media numerical methods koponen et al 1996 and analytical models yun

tortuosity of porous media yun et al 2005 also proposed a tortuosity model of tortuosity based on 2d microstructures of regular triangle arrangement rta and square pitch arrangement spa to estimate the representative elementary volume rev brown and hsieh 2000 zhang et al 2000 matthäi and belayneh 2004 costanza robinson et al 2011 yoon and dewers 2013 of tortuosity for translucent granular porous media a 2d model of tortuosity was proposed by wu et al 2017a b c d to calculate tortuosity and quantify the rev of tortuosity however most of previous models of tortuosity were idealized of which the ability of determining tortuosity were not very suitable for realistic granular porous media yun et al 2006 developed a three dimensional 3d model to determine tortuosity of porous media composed of spherical particles while the 3d microstructure of porous media used to derive the mathematical model of tortuosity is too idealized and can be regarded as a pseudo 3d microstructure therefore previous models are only suitable for 2d porous media while tortuosity of realistic 3d porous media is still needed to be explored and delineated further to overcome the limitations of previous tortuosity models for granular porous media this study develops a new 3d tortuosity model based on regular tetrahedron microstructure rtm composed of spherical solid particles and pores among them the analytical tortuosity model of flow path in 3d granular porous media is derived by mathematics experimental correlation equation for tortuosity in porous media composed of spherical particles is used to verity the tortuosity model proposed in this study moreover tortuosity model is also compared against experiment data of tortuosity furthermore an experiment is conducted to measure the tortuosity of granular porous media heterogeneous translucent silica is packed in a 2d sandbox and porosity is achieved using light transmission micro tomography ltm technique wu et al 2017a b c d afterward the tortuosity of experimental heterogeneous translucent silica is derived using the 3d tortuosity model of rtm by the help of a criterion of relative gradient error ε g i the rev of tortuosity of the heterogeneous translucent silica is quantified and associated statistical assessment on rev sizes is conducted 2 geometry models for tortuosity of streamlines in 3d porous media 2 1 a new geometry model for tortuosity of streamlines in 3d porous media tortuosity is defined as the ratio of the actual length of tortuous flow path to the straight length of flow path along the pressure gradient

obtained as comiti and renaud 1989 14 τ 1 c ln 1 n where c is the fitted parameter obtained by experimental data for porous media composed of spherical particles c 0 41 a quantitative comparison between experimental correlation equation comiti and renaud 1989 and different tortuosity models avrtaspa srta and rtm are presented in fig 3 a d for tortuosity model avrtaspa the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae and determination coefficient r2 are 0 108 0 083 and 0 398 respectively fig 3b tortuosity model srta achieves rmse mae and r2 with the values of 0 127 0 093 and 0 617 it is obvious that avrtaspa and srta all have apparent errors compared to experimental correlation equation the tortuosity model rtm is verified satisfactorily that there is a fairly close agreement the rmse mae and r2 values of rtm are 0 009 0 008 and 0 998 respectively indicating that tortuosity model of rtm has the best validity in delineating tortuosity of 3d granular porous media moreover the experimental data of tortuosity wyllie and gregory 1955 comiti and renaud 1989 based on granular porous media and different tortuosity models are compared in fig 4 a d in fig 4d 3d tortuosity model of rtm presents the best agreement with experimental data whose values of rmse mae and r2 reach 0 031 0 027 and 0 922 respectively nevertheless tortuosity models avrtaspa and srta present unreasonable results in fig 4b and c implying the 2d tortuosity models are not suitable to calculate the tortuosity of factual granular porous media composed of spherical particles the comparison between different tortuosity models and experiment verifies the validity of 3d tortuosity model of rtm proposed in this study tortuosity model of rtm achieves best effect and can be used to accurately calculate tortuosity of granular porous media 3 application to rev quantification of tortuosity in granular porous media an experiment is conducted to apply the 3d tortuosity model of rtm proposed in this study to quantify tortuosity of granular porous media and estimate corresponding rev an 2d sandbox with dimensions of 60 cm width 45 cm height 1 6 cm thickness is composed of three aluminum frames and two tempered glass walls different kinds of translucent silica are used to pack the sandbox simultaneously thin capillary barriers composed of 70 80 mesh silica are set at top and bottom of sandbox fig 5 a the properties of all kinds of translucent silica used to pack the 2d sandbox in experiment are illustrated in table 1 to apply the tortuosity model rtm to calculate tortuosity the porosity of heterogeneous silica in 2d sandbox is required as a matter of fact a new ltm technique wu et al 2017a b c d is used in experiment to accurately quantify the porosity of translucent silica in ltm the porosity is obtained using the following equation 15 n lni s β γ where is is the emergent light intensity after light transmitting the 2d translucent porous media saturated by water β and γ are parameters derived from fitting experimental data of emergent light intensity to keep the 2d heterogeneous translucent silica being saturated by water in experiment water flows from the right inlets of sandbox to the left outlets at a constant rate of 0 5 m d which is close to natural groundwater velocities vary from a few centimeters per day to 1 m day erning et al 2012 afterward the 2d sandbox is placed before a light source to let light penetrate through heterogeneous translucent silica in sandbox emergent light intensity fig 6 a is captured by a thermoelectrically air cooled charge coupled device ccd camera the emergent light intensity is shown in fig 6a and porosity is calculated using ltm based on porosity of heterogeneous translucent silica corresponding tortuosity is obtained using 3d tortuosity model of rtm distribution of tortuosity fig 6b reflects heterogeneity of granular materials is widely existed for translucent silica

7483,for most of aquifers with abundant groundwater resource quantifications of tortuosity and corresponding representative elementary volume rev are very essential to improve the understanding of groundwater and contaminant transfers in porous media in this study a mathematical model of tortuosity based on the three dimensional 3d microstructure of regular tetrahedron rtm is proposed to quantify tortuosity and corresponding rev of granular porous media the calculated tortuosity using the new 3d rtm model agrees well with the measured tortuosity in experiment indicating that the new

crucial to improve the understanding of water and contaminants transport in porous media and designing associated remediation scheme the flow path of water and contaminant transfer in granular porous

media a 2d model of tortuosity was proposed by wu et al 2017a b c d to calculate tortuosity and quantify the rev of tortuosity however most of previous models of tortuosity were idealized of which the ability of determining tortuosity were not very suitable for realistic granular porous media yun et al 2006 developed a three dimensional 3d model to determine tortuosity of porous media composed of spherical particles while the 3d microstructure of porous media used to derive the mathematical model of tortuosity is too idealized and can be regarded as a pseudo 3d microstructure therefore previous models are only suitable for 2d porous media while tortuosity of realistic 3d porous media is still needed to be explored and delineated further to overcome the limitations of previous

agreement the rmse mae and r2 values of rtm are 0 009 0 008 and 0 998 respectively indicating that tortuosity model of rtm has the best validity in delineating tortuosity of 3d granular porous media moreover the experimental data of tortuosity wyllie and gregory 1955 comiti and renaud 1989 based on granular porous media and different tortuosity models are compared in fig 4 a d in fig 4d 3d tortuosity model of rtm presents the best agreement with experimental data whose values of rmse mae and r2 reach 0 031 0 027 and 0 922 respectively nevertheless tortuosity models avrtaspa and srta present unreasonable results in fig 4b and c implying the 2d tortuosity models are not suitable to calculate the tortuosity of factual granular porous media composed of spherical particles the comparison between different tortuosity models and experiment verifies the validity of 3d tortuosity model of rtm proposed in this study tortuosity model of rtm achieves best effect and can be used to

example the volume of water maintained at the peak of a drought can be tripled if the available roof areas for the rwcs are guttered design curves which provide a set of roof area tank volume combinations that achieve specified levels of reliability were created and can be used to plan new rwcs besides offering insights into community wide water storage and usage patterns and resiliency

volcanic high islands yap chuuk pohnpei kosrae and 33 atoll and isolated low lying islands in the caroline islands archipelago of the western pacific fig 1b most atolls contain several coral islands perched on the barrier reef that surrounds a shallow lagoon the islands are small 1 km in width and have communities of only a few hundred inhabitants according to the 2010 census the combined population of all atolls in the fsm is approximately 4000 people fsm national government 2014 the region has a tropical climate with precipitation ranging 3 4 ms annually anthony 1997 and average daily temperatures exceeding 27 c fig 2 a shows 4 month totals of rainfall mm from 1994 to 2005 with rainfall summed for january april may august and september december as seen from the data a dry season extends typically from november to june and a wet season from july to october northeasterly trade winds dominate the dry season and the wet season occurs when the trade winds subside creating more variable wind patterns at the intertropical convergence zone itcz arnow 1955 anthony 1997 average rainfall depths for each month during 1994 2005 are shown in fig 2b along with the minimum depth during the 12 year period and the coefficient of variation cv for each month the extreme minimum depths and high cv values during the dry season months of february may indicate significant year to year variability and hence potential challenges for relying exclusively on harvested rainwater quigley et al 2016 this highlights the need to analyze community wide rwcs storage droughts occur

subsurface consists of a holocene age sand aquifer overlying a pleistocene age limestone aquifer with a body of freshwater freshwater lens typically contained in the sand aquifer ayers and vacher 1986 this body of freshwater can be used in combination with rainwater stored by rwcs to meet domestic water needs dillaha and zolan 1985 detay et al 1989 a typical rwcs fig 3a consists of three components a catchment usually the roof which intercepts rain a gutter downspout system that captures runoff from the roof and a storage tank or cistern commonly used materials for catchments in island communities are aluminum and corrugated sheet metal tanks typically are cast in place concrete or manufactured plastic rwcs require periodic cleaning dillaha and zolan 1985 as animal feces leaf litter dust and other particulate matter collect on the catchments and in the gutters gutters and entrances to tanks are often screened to limit entrance of these materials particularly during the foul flush or first run off after a rain event usaid 1982 examples of existing rwcs on ifalik are shown in fig 3 b d the size of the gutter is also an important system parameter as narrow gutters can spill water during intense storm events although catchment water is often preferred over groundwater for the residents of many pacific islands biological contamination often is present in rwcs storage tanks one study in the fsm dillaha and zolan 1985 found that 46 and 69 of sampled tanks on yap islands yap island ulithi atoll tested positive for fecal coliform and total coliform respectively coconut water is frequently used for drinking depending on the available supply recognizing the potential for groundwater contamination residents generally use it only to water animals pigs and chickens or for washing laundry or dishes stephenson 1984 maccracken et al 2007 bailey et al 2008 taboroši 2015 when catchment storage and coconut supplies are inadequate boiled groundwater is used to supplement drinking water supplies anthony 1997 2 3 study site ifalik atoll yap state the island selected for rwcs analysis in this study is the largest and the only inhabited island on ifalik atoll it is located on the atoll s windward side and was chosen because of a sizeable population 580 residents in 2010 fsm national government 2014 its geographic remoteness and a large network of rwcs ifalik atoll fig 4 a is 750 km southeast of yap and 690 km west of chuuk lagoon tracey et al 1961 richmond et al 1997 see location in fig 1b atoll islands are regarded as low islands as they have a maximum elevation between 2 and 3 m above mean sea level m s 1 pernetta 1992 richmond et al 1997 spatial area is less than 1 5 km2 the population remained near 300 from 1925 to 1973 and increased to a maximum of 653 in 1994 but stabilized to roughly 570 people by the year 2000 water supply comes from hand dug shallow groundwater wells and rainwater captured by rwcs with locations of wells and rwcs storage tanks documented in the field survey see next section and shown in fig 4b similar to the water usage patterns of other atoll island communities in the fsm see section 2 1 rwcs water is preferred over groundwater for drinking and cooking needs 3 methodology this section describes the study which consists of 1 a survey of the rwcs on ifalik 2 using results of the survey and a daily water balance model to assess the sustainability of ifalik s rwcs individually and collectively and 3 using results of the survey and the daily water balance model to construct design curves for assessment and planning of current and future rwcs for the ifalik community and communities on islands with similar climatic patterns the results of the survey will be presented in this section to provide context for the modeling methodology 3 1 survey of rainwater catchment systems of ifalik a survey of rwcs on ifalik atoll was conducted from august 15 2015 to august 22 2015 the objectives were to collect a detailed inventory of infrastructure roof area guttered area storage tank size number of residents and number of residents for each rwcs document locations and general appearance conduct water quality testing and interview resident households on water collection and usage in total 152 systems were surveyed with locations and classification concrete type a type b type c makeshift shown in fig 4c types a b and c are based on storage and refer to standard plastic 2000 l cylindrical tanks other standard cylindrical plastic tanks of varying sizes and other plastic tanks of varying dimensions respectively tanks were located at homes schools the dispensary and community buildings besides plastic other materials for storage tanks include concrete and stainless steel for analysis and modeling see section 3 2 only the 100 rwcs using standard tanks types a b and c and barrels are included inventory of each rwcs consisted of measuring the effective or guttered roof area total potential roof area that could be guttered volume of the storage tank and qualitative assessment of the efficiency of the gutter downspout system a laser distance meter tuirel t100 was used to measure roof dimensions for most tanks the laser also was used to measure dimensions for smaller dimensions a rigid metal measuring tape was used latitude and longitude coordinates were mapped for each catchment structure and storage tank using a trimble juno 5 gps unit photographs of each rwcs were taken using an olympus tg2 camera household interviews were conducted to collect information on the main sources of drinking water general water demand and concerns due to quality or availability water quality testing was conducted for 10 rwcs that were used most frequently by the residents water was sampled for e coli as an indicator for bacteriological contamination in 6 storage tanks using a presence absence kit with 5 testing positive ph of the storage tank water was between 6 and 7 a more detailed account of the survey can be found in kottermair et al 2016 a table with complete details of the inventory for each rwcs is provided in supplementary data table s1 a summary will be provided here even though most houses are traditional huts with thatched roofs many small structures e g cooking storage huts have tin roofs where rainwater is collected most storage tanks are provided by the yap state government except makeshift containers which are privately acquired by individual families and also are very common most large community tanks are old and have substantial leaking and therefore are no longer in use summaries of guttered roof area and storage tank size for the 100 rwcs are shown in fig 5 fig 5a shows a histogram of actual and potential guttered roof area m2 with potential corresponding to the roof catchment area if the entire roof were guttered average actual guttered roof area is 14 5 m2 although most rwcs have a catchment area of less than 10 m2 the average potential area is 21 3 m2 an increase of 48 compared to the current catchment area fig 5b shows actual guttered roof area plotted against the size l of the associated storage tank for each rwcs in general a larger roof catchment area is associated with a large storage tank although 37 of the rwcs have the government issued 2000 l black plastic tank regarding gutter leakage and efficiency 2 systems were deemed to be very good 92 were good 2 were fair and 2 were poor this classification is used to specify efficiency in water balance modeling see section 3 2 the number of residents using each rwcs was provided by the household interviews 63 of the 100 rwcs included in the analysis having 5 residents or less per capita daily water use was estimated based on interviews with residents from 7 compounds groups of houses belonging to the same extended family who indicated the typical time required to deplete either half or all of the storage tank water results are shown in table 1 estimated per capita use l day ranges from 6 8 l day to 15 6 l day for an average of 12 l day which is similar to the minimum of 20 l day recommended by the united nations un world water assessment program wwap to fulfill basic needs for drinking cooking and cleaning rationing was not directly observed however residents indicated that use of neighboring storage tanks occurs if water in their own tank is depleted 3 2 assessing performance of ifalik rainwater catchment systems assessment of rwcs performance is determined in this study using a daily water balance model the model is used to estimate what performance i e daily stored water and associated daily water usage by residents would be were another drought as severe as the 1997 1999 el nino drought to occur and also to construct design curves for individual rwcs 3 2 1 rainwater catchment system water balance model a daily water balance model is used in this study to estimate end of day stored volume of rainwater within the storage tank of a rwcs the model is based on the algorithm proposed by jenkins et al 1978 and uses system parameters guttered roof catchment area storage tank volume system efficiency input daily rainfall and output daily water use to determine the change in stored rainwater volume and resulting end of day water volume 1 v t max v t 1 min ap t ε s v t 1 o t 0 where vt is the volume of rainwater stored at the end of the current day t l3 v t 1 is the volume of rainwater in the storage tank at the end of the previous day t 1 l3 a is guttered rooftop catchment area l2 pt is the depth of rainfall during the current day l ε is the system efficiency defined as the percentage of rain captured by the roof that reaches the storage tank included to account for water lost during conveyance from the roof to the tank and also any leakage from the storage tanks s is the volume of the storage tank l3 and o t is the water demand water use from the storage tank for the current day l3 the variables of eq 1 are shown in fig 3a the product apε is the potential volume of rainwater added to the tank during the day limited to the available tank space s v t 1 the max function limits the daily output ot to the available stored volume the community wide volume of stored rainfall v t comm can be estimated using eq 1 for each rwcs 2 v t comm i 1 n max v t i 1 min a i p t ε i s i v t i 1 o t i 0 where n is the number of individual rwcs for the island community and the subscript i denotes the system variable for the i th rwcs daily rainfall pt is assumed to be uniform across the community note that the size of the gutter is not included as a parameter in the water balance model and therefore gutter leakage condition is assumed to be the only limitation to conveying rainwater from the roof to the storage tank 3 2 2 ifalik water storage assessment the water balance model of eq 1 is applied to 100 rwcs of ifalik to determine performance in storing water during 1997 1999 this period was selected due to the occurrence of an el niño drought during the first half of 1998 see fig 2c the system parameters for each rwcs model eq 1 see fig 3a are obtained from the survey inventory results see table s1 system efficiency ε values are specified as follows 0 8 0 7 0 55 and 0 4 for very good good fair and poor categories respectively for the initial model simulation initial conditions fraction of tank that is full on 1 january 1997 are set to 30 since residents feel they are running out of water when tank is less than half full and typically there is very little water at the beginning of the year per capita daily water use is set at 12 l day based on water demand questionnaire results see section 3 1 and per capita daily water use is set to 75 9 l day of total demand once the water volume decreases to less than half of the storage tank size to include the effects of rationing the model is run for each rwcs using both actual current roof area and potential roof area to determine the effect of maximizing roof catchment area as an example the model is run for 3 rwcs with the characteristics shown in table 2 for each rwcs the potential roof area is also shown e g rwcs has an actual area of 12 m2 and a potential area of 24 m2 subsequent simulations were run to determine the influence of non measured model parameters daily per capita water use 8 l day to 16 l day initial conditions 0 full or 50 full on 1 january 1997 model output used to assess rwcs performance and compare scenarios includes end of day water volume and the reliability of the system with the latter defined as the percent of days for which adequate water is available in the storage tank to satisfy household water demand rwcs performance also is assessed at the community level since there is sharing between households and therefore provides a good estimate of rwcs sustainability on ifalik atoll 3 2 3 design and reliability of rainwater catchment systems besides providing assessment of rwcs performance in a forward run simulation the daily water balance model also can be used to create design curves which provide combinations of roof catchment area and tank volume that satisfy a specified level of reliability i e the percentage of days with adequate storage to meet full demand for design curve construction daily per capita water demand and system efficiency are set to 12 l day and 70 as with the forward run simulations described in section 3 2 2 design curves were created for the western fsm region by wallace et al 2015 for both historical and future climate conditions but were limited to rwcs with four users and a demand rate of 30 l day for the design curves the combinations for a given reliability level are found as follows for a given roof catchment area m2 the storage tank volume is modified in a succession of model runs until the reliability level is met thus providing a catchment area tank volume combination that satisfies the desired reliability this is repeated for many roof catchment areas thus establishing a set of combinations that satisfy the desired reliability plotted on a chart of tank volume vs roof catchment area these combinations provide data points through which a curve design curve can be drawn this process can be repeated for varying levels of reliability thereby producing a set of design curves for the rwcs which can be used to assess performance of an existing rwcs or to design a new rwcs if the roof area is set the required volume of storage tank to yield a desired reliability level can be determined and vice versa 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance under severe drought conditions the simulated time series of end of day volume for the three rwcs listed in table 2 is shown in fig 6 a the solid and dotted lines represent results for the simulations using actual and potential roof area respectively for each rwcs the effect of the daily rainfall patterns can be seen with rapid depletion occurring during the dry season of 1997 and the drought period of 1998 highlighted in gray rwcs 3 with a tank volume of 3000 l 3 m3 is often full due to a large guttered roof area 43 3 m2 and a smaller number of residents 3 only 1 75 m3 of the tank was depleted during the 1998 drought in contrast complete depletion likely occurred for rwcs 1 and rwcs 2 during both 1997 and 1998 with depletion also in 1999 for rwcs 2 due to a smaller roof catchment area 7 9 m2 see table 2 and more residents 6 reliability for the three systems is 0 92 0 72 and 1 0 respectively if the entire roof area were guttered reliability would increase to 0 97 0 92 and 1 0 table 2 with no depletion occurring for rwcs 2 during 1999 results in fig 6a also indicate that a high volume of water was spilled during the 1997 1999 period for rwcs 3 the stored rainwater volume if often near full capacity of 3 m3 meaning that additional captured rainfall often spills and cannot be used by the residents the total communal water supply v t comm estimated using eq 2 is shown in fig 6b for conditions of actual guttered roof area and potential guttered roof area the minimum community daily water requirements 10 6 m3 20 l day for 532 residents also is shown on the chart for current roof conditions the total water supply decreases to about double 19 m3 during early may 1998 of the minimum required 10 6 m3 during the 1998 drought average reliability is 80 with 26 of the 100 rwcs having a reliability of 100 fig 7 shows the percent of rwcs without adequate water for each day of the simulation period for actual and potential guttered roof conditions at the peak of the drought about 75 of the rwcs do not have adequate water for the residents these results are consistent with accounts from the community which had adequate water storage during the drought despite many rwcs becoming depleted indicating that residents shared water during this period on average 88 m3 of stored rainwater was available on a given day these results are compared to the minimum of 72 m3 and an overall average of 158 m3 if the potential roof area is guttered increases of 275 and 80 respectively if potential roof area is used even intense el niño droughts will not pose a threat to the island community fig 8 shows plots of reliability vs system parameters tank volume guttered area efficiency number of residents for the 100 rwcs reliability is most sensitivity to guttered area indicating that roof catchment area should be targeted as the best means to increase reliability for a given rwcs the effect of the other system inputs initial conditions and demand rates on reliability is explored using scenario analysis summary of the scenarios is shown in table 3 with initial conditions for the tanks ranging from 0 and 50 full on 1 january 1997 and daily per capita demand rate ranging from 8 l day and 40 l day fig 9 shows results for the three scenarios with 16 l day demand rate the gray line shows results using potential roof area whereas the black and dotted black lines show results for actual roof area assuming a tank half full and an empty tank on 1 january 1997 respectively for the latter two the effects of the initial conditions are eliminated within the first six months of 1997 and thus the initial conditions chosen have no bearing on drought period results demand rate has a strong influence on stored rainwater volume fig 10 although v t comm is not that much different between the 12 l day and 16 l day scenarios which are the most likely demand rates for the community see table 2 for these two scenarios average reliability is about 70 and 80 respectively table 3 with the of rwcs without water at the peak of the drought decreasing from 75 to 67 4 2 design curves for local rainfall conditions design curves for the ifalik community are presented in fig 11 four levels of reliability 80 90 95 99 were considered with sets of curves constructed for rwcs with 3 residents fig 11a 6 residents b 9 residents c and 12 residents d each curve represents a combination of tank volume and roof catchment area that satisfies the reliability level and therefore an inverse relationship is found between the two i e a large roof catchment 50 m2 area requires a small tank 2 4 m3 to satisfy the desired reliability the existing 100 rwcs are also plotted in fig 11 according to current guttered roof area and associated tank volume with each rwcs plotted on the chart corresponding to the number of current residents as seen from fig 11a most rwcs with 3 residents have a reliability of between 80 and 99 with a few below 80 and a few above 99 for rwcs with 6 12 residents however the vast majority of rwcs have a reliability below 80 however these charts not only provide an assessment of current reliability but also provide insights into how higher reliability can be achieved i e the increase in roof catchment area or tank volume that is required results using potential roof areas also are plotted indicating an increase in reliability shift to the right on the charts however 99 reliability will be achieved only with increases in both roof area and tank size we note that these design curves were created using historical rainfall data specific to the western pacific region therefore using these curves to design rwcs for future years assumes that rainfall patterns and magnitudes will be similar to historical patterns and magnitudes design curves for other regions can be constructed using the methodology presented in this study 4 3 future performance using potential roof area using the available roof area for conveying water to storage tanks can significantly improve rwcs performance in future drought periods for ifalik and other atoll communities as indicated by the baseline results in fig 6b and the scenario results in table 3 the volume of water available at the peak of a drought can be increased three to fourfold if the potential area were used and no other changes to the systems e g increasing storage tank size for example for a demand rate of 16 l day the water at peak drought could increase from about 16 m3 to about 72 m3 table 3 the importance of roof catchment area is confirmed by the plots in fig 8 which show that guttered roof area has the strongest influence on rwcs reliability residents can use the design curves in fig 11 to determine the extent to which the guttered roof area should be increased to achieve a desired level of reliability 5 summary and conclusions this study assessed the performance of rainwater catchment systems rwcs for an island community in the western north pacific a field survey was conducted for all rwcs on ifalik atoll in yap state federated states of micronesia the survey included documenting and measuring rwcs features guttered roof area potential roof area gutter leaking storage tank size number of users conducting in person interviews to determine average water demand and water quality sampling for ph and e coli guttered roof area and storage tank size range from 2 m2 to 60 m2 and from 24 l to 65 000 l respectively with the majority deemed to have good system efficiency i e minimal leakage daily per capita water use is between 8 and 16 l day close to the minimum recommended 20 l day by the united nations of the 6 storage tanks sampled for e coli 5 tested positive ph values were between 6 and 7 a water balance model was used to assess end of day volumes of stored rainwater for each day during 1997 1999 this period was selected due to an el niño drought that occurred during the first few months of 1998 results indicate that the community is resilient to drought with adequate water supplies maintained during the peak of the drought however individual rwcs are not resilient with 75 of the 100 individual rwcs being depleted of rainwater at the peak of the drought these results indicate that water sharing is prevalent throughout the community scenario analysis demonstrates that increasing guttered roof area is the best method for increasing performance if potential roof area for each rwcs is guttered the volume of water maintained during a peak drought period can be tripled compared to current guttered roof areas design curves are presented to guide residents and water resource managers on the sizing of guttered roof areas and storage tanks to achieve certain levels 80 90 95 99 of reliability the methods presented herein are applicable elsewhere particularly for all atoll nations such as the republic of the marshall islands the republic of

7484,communities living on atolls and similar low lying islands in the tropical pacific rely on rainwater and shallow groundwater to meet domestic water needs rainwater generally captured and stored using rooftop rainwater catchment systems is the preferred water source due to higher quality and convenience of access this study assesses the performance of rainwater catchment systems rwcs on ifalik atoll located in yap state federated states of micronesia in the western pacific a field survey was conducted in august 2015 to evaluate rwcs features guttered roof area storage tank size gutter leakage conditions determine numbers of users and estimate daily water use via household surveys all 152 rwcs were surveyed water balance modeling was applied to the rwcs to estimate end of day stored rainwater volumes for each day of the 1997 1999 time period during which an el niño induced drought occurred results indicate that the community is resilient to drought although the majority of rwcs were depleted of rainwater and hence community sharing was required scenario testing indicates that increasing guttered roof area is the optimal strategy for enhancing system reliability for example the volume of water maintained at the peak of a drought can be tripled if the available roof areas for the rwcs are guttered design curves which provide a set of roof area tank volume combinations that achieve specified levels of reliability were created and can be used to plan new rwcs besides offering insights into community wide water storage and usage patterns and resiliency

volcanic high islands yap chuuk pohnpei kosrae and 33 atoll and isolated low lying islands in the caroline islands archipelago of the western pacific fig 1b most atolls contain several coral islands perched on the barrier reef that surrounds a shallow lagoon the islands are small 1 km in width and have communities of only a few hundred inhabitants according to the 2010 census the combined population of all atolls in the fsm is approximately 4000 people fsm national government 2014 the region has a tropical climate with precipitation ranging 3 4 ms annually anthony 1997 and average daily temperatures exceeding 27 c fig 2 a shows 4 month totals of rainfall mm from 1994 to 2005 with rainfall summed for january april may august and september december as seen from the data a dry season extends typically from november to june and a wet season from july to october northeasterly trade winds dominate the dry season and the wet season occurs when the trade winds subside creating more variable wind patterns at the intertropical convergence zone itcz arnow 1955 anthony 1997 average rainfall depths for each month during 1994 2005 are shown in fig 2b along with the minimum depth during the 12 year period and the coefficient of variation cv for each month the extreme minimum depths and high cv values during the dry season months of february may indicate significant year to year variability and hence potential challenges for relying exclusively on harvested rainwater quigley et al 2016 this highlights the need to analyze community wide rwcs storage droughts occur typically every 6 7 years white et al 2007 during the dry season of el niño southern oscillation enso events white et al 1999 for example fig 2c shows the measured daily rainfall during the 1997 1998 el niño drought for the state of yap measured at the yap island airport severe droughts occur in the months following the start of an intense el niño event lander and khosrowpanah 2004 with extremes of 5 of typical monthly precipitation and 28 of normal dry season precipitation van der brug 1986 2 2 water use of atoll communities a schematic cross section of an atoll island is shown in fig 1c the subsurface consists of a holocene age sand aquifer overlying a pleistocene age limestone aquifer with a body of freshwater freshwater lens typically contained in the sand aquifer ayers and vacher 1986 this body of freshwater can be used in combination with rainwater stored by rwcs to meet domestic water needs dillaha and zolan 1985 detay et al 1989 a typical rwcs fig 3a consists of three components a catchment usually the roof which intercepts rain a gutter downspout system that captures runoff from the roof and a storage tank or cistern commonly used materials for catchments in island communities are aluminum and corrugated sheet metal tanks typically are cast in place concrete or manufactured plastic rwcs require periodic cleaning dillaha and zolan 1985 as animal feces leaf litter dust and other particulate matter collect on the catchments and in the gutters gutters and entrances to tanks are often screened to limit entrance of these materials particularly during the foul flush or first run off after a rain event usaid 1982 examples of existing rwcs on ifalik are shown in fig 3 b d the size of the gutter is also an important system parameter as narrow gutters can spill water during intense storm events although catchment water is often preferred over groundwater for the residents of many pacific islands biological contamination often is present in rwcs storage tanks one study in the fsm dillaha and zolan 1985 found that 46 and 69 of sampled tanks on yap islands yap island ulithi atoll tested positive for fecal coliform and total coliform respectively coconut water is frequently used for drinking depending on the available supply recognizing the potential for groundwater contamination residents generally use it only to water animals pigs and chickens or for washing laundry or dishes stephenson 1984 maccracken et al 2007 bailey et al 2008 taboroši 2015 when catchment storage and coconut supplies are inadequate boiled groundwater is used to supplement drinking water supplies anthony 1997 2 3 study site ifalik atoll yap state the island selected for rwcs analysis in this study is the largest and the only inhabited island on ifalik atoll it is located on the atoll s windward side and was chosen because of a sizeable population 580 residents in 2010 fsm national government 2014 its geographic remoteness and a large network of rwcs ifalik atoll fig 4 a is 750 km southeast of yap and 690 km west of chuuk lagoon tracey et al 1961 richmond et al 1997 see location in fig 1b atoll islands are regarded as low islands as they have a maximum elevation between 2 and 3 m above mean sea level m s 1 pernetta 1992 richmond et al 1997 spatial area is less than 1 5 km2 the population remained near 300 from 1925 to 1973 and increased to a maximum of 653 in 1994 but stabilized to roughly 570 people by the year 2000 water supply comes from hand dug shallow groundwater wells and rainwater captured by rwcs with locations of wells and rwcs storage tanks documented in the field survey see next section and shown in fig 4b similar to the water usage patterns of other atoll island communities in the fsm see section 2 1 rwcs water is preferred over groundwater for drinking and cooking needs 3 methodology this section describes the study which consists of 1 a survey of the rwcs on ifalik 2 using results of the survey and a daily water balance model to assess the sustainability of ifalik s rwcs individually and collectively and 3 using results of the survey and the daily water balance model to construct design curves for assessment and planning of current and future rwcs for the ifalik community and communities on islands with similar climatic patterns the results of the survey will be presented in this section to provide context for the modeling methodology 3 1 survey of rainwater catchment systems of ifalik a survey of rwcs on ifalik atoll was conducted from august 15 2015 to august 22 2015 the objectives were to collect a detailed inventory of infrastructure roof area guttered area storage tank size number of residents and number of residents for each rwcs document locations and general appearance conduct water quality testing and interview resident households on water collection and usage in total 152 systems were surveyed with locations and classification concrete type a type b type c makeshift shown in fig 4c types a b and c are based on storage and refer to standard plastic 2000 l cylindrical tanks other standard cylindrical plastic tanks of varying sizes and other plastic tanks of varying dimensions respectively tanks were located at homes schools the dispensary and community buildings besides plastic other materials for storage tanks include concrete and stainless steel for analysis and modeling see section 3 2 only the 100 rwcs using standard tanks types a b and c and barrels are included inventory of each rwcs consisted of measuring the effective or guttered roof area total potential roof area that could be guttered volume of the storage tank and qualitative assessment of the efficiency of the gutter downspout system a laser distance meter tuirel t100 was used to measure roof dimensions for most tanks the laser also was used to measure dimensions for smaller dimensions a rigid metal measuring tape was used latitude and longitude coordinates were mapped for each catchment structure and storage tank using a trimble juno 5 gps unit photographs of each rwcs were taken using an olympus tg2 camera household interviews were conducted to collect information on the main sources of drinking water general water demand and concerns due to quality or availability water quality testing was conducted for 10 rwcs that were used most frequently by the residents water was sampled for e coli as an indicator for bacteriological contamination in 6 storage tanks using a presence absence kit with 5 testing positive ph of the storage tank water was between 6 and 7 a more detailed account of the survey can be found in kottermair et al 2016 a table with complete details of the inventory for each rwcs is provided in supplementary data table s1 a summary will be provided here even though most houses are traditional huts with thatched roofs many small structures e g cooking storage huts have tin roofs where rainwater is collected most storage tanks are provided by the yap state government except makeshift containers which are privately acquired by individual families and also are very common most large community tanks are old and have substantial leaking and therefore are no longer in use summaries of guttered roof area and storage tank size for the 100 rwcs are shown in fig 5 fig 5a shows a histogram of actual and potential guttered roof area m2 with potential corresponding to the roof catchment area if the entire roof were guttered average actual guttered roof area is 14 5 m2 although most rwcs have a catchment area of less than 10 m2 the average potential area is 21 3 m2 an increase of 48 compared to the current catchment area fig 5b shows actual guttered roof area plotted against the size l of the associated storage tank for each rwcs in general a larger roof catchment area is associated with a large storage tank although 37 of the rwcs have the government issued 2000 l black plastic tank regarding gutter leakage and efficiency 2 systems were deemed to be very good 92 were good 2 were fair and 2 were poor this classification is used to specify efficiency in water balance modeling see section 3 2 the number of residents using each rwcs was provided by the household interviews 63 of the 100 rwcs included in the analysis having 5 residents or less per capita daily water use was estimated based on interviews with residents from 7 compounds groups of houses belonging to the same extended family who indicated the typical time required to deplete either half or all of the storage tank water results are shown in table 1 estimated per capita use l day ranges from 6 8 l day to 15 6 l day for an average of 12 l day which is similar to the minimum of 20 l day recommended by the united nations un world water assessment program wwap to fulfill basic needs for drinking cooking and cleaning rationing was not directly observed however residents indicated that use of neighboring storage tanks occurs if water in their own tank is depleted 3 2 assessing performance of ifalik rainwater catchment systems assessment of rwcs performance is determined in this study using a daily water balance model the model is used to estimate what performance i e daily stored water and associated daily water usage by residents would be were another drought as severe as the 1997 1999 el nino drought to occur and also to construct design curves for individual rwcs 3 2 1 rainwater catchment system water balance model a daily water balance model is used in this study to estimate end of day stored volume of rainwater within the storage tank of a rwcs the model is based on the algorithm proposed by jenkins et al 1978 and uses system parameters guttered roof catchment area storage tank volume system efficiency input daily rainfall and output daily water use to determine the change in stored rainwater volume and resulting end of day water volume 1 v t max v t 1 min ap t ε s v t 1 o t 0 where vt is the volume of rainwater stored at the end of the current day t l3 v t 1 is the volume of rainwater in the storage tank at the end of the previous day t 1 l3 a is guttered rooftop catchment area l2 pt is the depth of rainfall during the current day l ε is the system efficiency defined as the percentage of rain captured by the roof that reaches the storage tank included to account for water lost during conveyance from the roof to the tank and also any leakage from the storage tanks s is the volume of the storage tank l3 and o t is the water demand water use from the storage tank for the current day l3 the variables of eq 1 are shown in fig 3a the product apε is the potential volume of rainwater added to the tank during the day limited to the available tank space s v t 1 the max function limits the daily output ot to the available stored volume the community wide volume of stored rainfall v t comm can be estimated using eq 1 for each rwcs 2 v t comm i 1 n max v t i 1 min a i p t ε i s i v t i 1 o t i 0 where n is the number of individual rwcs for the island community and the subscript i denotes the system variable for the i th rwcs daily rainfall pt is assumed to be uniform across the community note that the size of the gutter is not included as a parameter in the water balance model and therefore gutter leakage condition is assumed to be the only limitation to conveying rainwater from the roof to the storage tank 3 2 2 ifalik water storage assessment the water balance model of eq 1 is applied to 100 rwcs of ifalik to determine performance in storing water during 1997 1999 this period was selected due to the occurrence of an el niño drought during the first half of 1998 see fig 2c the system parameters for each rwcs model eq 1 see fig 3a are obtained from the survey inventory results see table s1 system efficiency ε values are specified as follows 0 8 0 7 0 55 and 0 4 for very good good fair and poor categories respectively for the initial model simulation initial conditions fraction of tank that is full on 1 january 1997 are set to 30 since residents feel they are running out of water when tank is less than half full and typically there is very little water at the beginning of the year per capita daily water use is set at 12 l day based on water demand questionnaire results see section 3 1 and per capita daily water use is set to 75 9 l day of total demand once the water volume decreases to less than half of the storage tank size to include the effects of rationing the model is run for each rwcs using both actual current roof area and potential roof area to determine the effect of maximizing roof catchment area as an example the model is run for 3 rwcs with the characteristics shown in table 2 for each rwcs the potential roof area is also shown e g rwcs has an actual area of 12 m2 and a potential area of 24 m2 subsequent simulations were run to determine the influence of non measured model parameters daily per capita water use 8 l day to 16 l day initial conditions 0 full or 50 full on 1 january 1997 model output used to assess rwcs performance and compare scenarios includes end of day water volume and the reliability of the system with the latter defined as the percent of days for which adequate water is available in the storage tank to satisfy household water demand rwcs performance also is assessed at the community level since there is sharing between households and therefore provides a good estimate of rwcs sustainability on ifalik atoll 3 2 3 design and reliability of rainwater catchment systems besides providing assessment of rwcs performance in a forward run simulation the daily water balance model also can be used to create design curves which provide combinations of roof catchment area and tank volume that satisfy a specified level of reliability i e the percentage of days with adequate storage to meet full demand for design curve construction daily per capita water demand and system efficiency are set to 12 l day and 70 as with the forward run simulations described in section 3 2 2 design curves were created for the western fsm region by wallace et al 2015 for both historical and future climate conditions but were limited to rwcs with four users and a demand rate of 30 l day for the design curves the combinations for a given reliability level are found as follows for a given roof catchment area m2 the storage tank volume is modified in a succession of model runs until the reliability level is met thus providing a catchment area tank volume combination that satisfies the desired reliability this is repeated for many roof catchment areas thus establishing a set of combinations that satisfy the desired reliability plotted on a chart of tank volume vs roof catchment area these combinations provide data points through which a curve design curve can be drawn this process can be repeated for varying levels of reliability thereby producing a set of design curves for the rwcs which can be used to assess performance of an existing rwcs or to design a new rwcs if the roof area is set the required volume of storage tank to yield a desired reliability level can be determined and vice versa 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance under severe drought conditions the simulated time series of end of day volume for the three rwcs listed in table 2 is shown in fig 6 a the solid and dotted lines represent results for the simulations using actual and potential roof area respectively for each rwcs the effect of the daily rainfall patterns can be seen with rapid depletion occurring during the dry season of 1997 and the drought period of 1998 highlighted in gray rwcs 3 with a tank volume of 3000 l 3 m3 is often full due to a large guttered roof area 43 3 m2 and a smaller number of residents 3 only 1 75 m3 of the tank was depleted during the 1998 drought in contrast complete depletion likely occurred for rwcs 1 and rwcs 2 during both 1997 and 1998 with depletion also in 1999 for rwcs 2 due to a smaller roof catchment area 7 9 m2 see table 2 and more residents 6 reliability for the three systems is 0 92 0 72 and 1 0 respectively if the entire roof area were guttered reliability would increase to 0 97 0 92 and 1 0 table 2 with no depletion occurring for rwcs 2 during 1999 results in fig 6a also indicate that a high volume of water was spilled during the 1997 1999 period for rwcs 3 the stored rainwater volume if often near full capacity of 3 m3 meaning that additional captured rainfall often spills and cannot be used by the residents the total communal water supply v t comm estimated using eq 2 is shown in fig 6b for conditions of actual guttered roof area and potential guttered roof area the minimum community daily water requirements 10 6 m3 20 l day for 532 residents also is shown on the chart for current roof conditions the total water supply decreases to about double 19 m3 during early may 1998 of the minimum required 10 6 m3 during the 1998 drought average reliability is 80 with 26 of the 100 rwcs having a reliability of 100 fig 7 shows the percent of rwcs without adequate water for each day of the simulation period for actual and potential guttered roof conditions at the peak of the drought about 75 of the rwcs do not have adequate water for the residents these results are consistent with accounts from the community which had adequate water storage during the drought despite many rwcs becoming depleted indicating that residents shared water during this period on average 88 m3 of stored rainwater was available on a given day these results are compared to the minimum of 72 m3 and an overall average of 158 m3 if the potential roof area is guttered increases of 275 and 80 respectively if potential roof area is used even intense el niño droughts will not pose a threat to the island community fig 8 shows plots of reliability vs system parameters tank volume guttered area efficiency number of residents for the 100 rwcs reliability is most sensitivity to guttered area indicating that roof catchment area should be targeted as the best means to increase reliability for a given rwcs the effect of the other system inputs initial conditions and demand rates on reliability is explored using scenario analysis summary of the scenarios is shown in table 3 with initial conditions for the tanks ranging from 0 and 50 full on 1 january 1997 and daily per capita demand rate ranging from 8 l day and 40 l day fig 9 shows results for the three scenarios with 16 l day demand rate the gray line shows results using potential roof area whereas the black and dotted black lines show results for actual roof area assuming a tank half full and an empty tank on 1 january 1997 respectively for the latter two the effects of the initial conditions are eliminated within the first six months of 1997 and thus the initial conditions chosen have no bearing on drought period results demand rate has a strong influence on stored rainwater volume fig 10 although v t comm is not that much different between the 12 l day and 16 l day scenarios which are the most likely demand rates for the community see table 2 for these two scenarios average reliability is about 70 and 80 respectively table 3 with the of rwcs without water at the peak of the drought decreasing from 75 to 67 4 2 design curves for local rainfall conditions design curves for the ifalik community are presented in fig 11 four levels of reliability 80 90 95 99 were considered with sets of curves constructed for rwcs with 3 residents fig 11a 6 residents b 9 residents c and 12 residents d each curve represents a combination of tank volume and roof catchment area that satisfies the reliability level and therefore an inverse relationship is found between the two i e a large roof catchment 50 m2 area requires a small tank 2 4 m3 to satisfy the desired reliability the existing 100 rwcs are also plotted in fig 11 according to current guttered roof area and associated tank volume with each rwcs plotted on the chart corresponding to the number of current residents as seen from fig 11a most rwcs with 3 residents have a reliability of between 80 and 99 with a few below 80 and a few above 99 for rwcs with 6 12 residents however the vast majority of rwcs have a reliability below 80 however these charts not only provide an assessment of current reliability but also provide insights into how higher reliability can be achieved i e the increase in roof catchment area or tank volume that is required results using potential roof areas also are plotted indicating an increase in reliability shift to the right on the charts however 99 reliability will be achieved only with increases in both roof area and tank size we note that these design curves were created using historical rainfall data specific to the western pacific region therefore using these curves to design rwcs for future years assumes that rainfall patterns and magnitudes will be similar to historical patterns and magnitudes design curves for other regions can be constructed using the methodology presented in this study 4 3 future performance using potential roof area using the available roof area for conveying water to storage tanks can significantly improve rwcs performance in future drought periods for ifalik and other atoll communities as indicated by the baseline results in fig 6b and the scenario results in table 3 the volume of water available at the peak of a drought can be increased three to fourfold if the potential area were used and no other changes to the systems e g increasing storage tank size for example for a demand rate of 16 l day the water at peak drought could increase from about 16 m3 to about 72 m3 table 3 the importance of roof catchment area is confirmed by the plots in fig 8 which show that guttered roof area has the strongest influence on rwcs reliability residents can use the design curves in fig 11 to determine the extent to which the guttered roof area should be increased to achieve a desired level of reliability 5 summary and conclusions this study assessed the performance of rainwater catchment systems rwcs for an island community in the western north pacific a field survey was conducted for all rwcs on ifalik atoll in yap state federated states of micronesia the survey included documenting and measuring rwcs features guttered roof area potential roof area gutter leaking storage tank size number of users conducting in person interviews to determine average water demand and water quality sampling for ph and e coli guttered roof area and storage tank size range from 2 m2 to 60 m2 and from 24 l to 65 000 l respectively with the majority deemed to have good system efficiency i e minimal leakage daily per capita water use is between 8 and 16 l day close to the minimum recommended 20 l day by the united nations of the 6 storage tanks sampled for e coli 5 tested positive ph values were between 6 and 7 a water balance model was used to assess end of day volumes of stored rainwater for each day during 1997 1999 this period was selected due to an el niño drought that occurred during the first few months of 1998 results indicate that the community is resilient to drought with adequate water supplies maintained during the peak of the drought however individual rwcs are not resilient with 75 of the 100 individual rwcs being depleted of rainwater at the peak of the drought these results indicate that water sharing is prevalent throughout the community scenario analysis demonstrates that increasing guttered roof area is the best method for increasing performance if potential roof area for each rwcs is guttered the volume of water maintained during a peak drought period can be tripled compared to current guttered roof areas design curves are presented to guide residents and water resource managers on the sizing of guttered roof areas and storage tanks to achieve certain levels 80 90 95 99 of reliability the methods presented herein are applicable elsewhere particularly for all atoll nations such as the republic of the marshall islands the republic of
