12435,constructed wetlands cws have been employed for treatment of perfluoroalkyl substances containing wastewater however suppression on operation performances of cws was inevitable particularly on nitrogen removal in this study 10 30 mg l nano zero valent iron nzvi was introduced into cws because of its potential for driving effective nitrogen removal via promoting functional microbes perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa exposure led to reduction of ammonia nh4 n transformation but stimulated nitrate no3 n removal by up to 83 12 with pfoa exposure 10 mg l nzvi caused the most significant improvement on nh4 n removal with maximum increase of 3 65 by contrast 30 mg l nzvi was prone to alleviate no3 n accumulation by 14 19 24 22 compared to control group lower dosage of nzvi 10 20 mg l increased activity of five nitrogen cycling enzymes by 31 42 315 18 in maximum whereas 30 mg l nzvi led to limited promotion or even inhibition on these enzymes analogously stimulation on nitrifying anammox and denitrifying bacteria as well as functional key genes were more obvious by nzvi at lower concentration besides nzvi reduced functional gene of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and related bacteria increasing nh4 n removal indirectly the most promotion on nitrate dependent fe oxidation bacteria like paracoccus could explain improvement on no3 n removal by 30 mg l nzvi graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pfoa nzvi constructed wetlands nitrogen transformation dosage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl substances pfass with its satisfied physical and chemical properties have been of widespread use in industrial agricultural and personal care products 1 2 they were reported to cause ecological toxicity after being released and accumulated in environment media 3 4 which have attracted much concern perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa is a typical long chain pfass that belongs to perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas higher detection concentration and rate in environment of pfoa are often discovered than other categories of pfass which may exert more severe ecological risk owing to its good water solubility therefore appreciate treatment to remove pfoa from environmental media particularly from water is undoubtedly necessary as a major sink of pfoa domestic and international wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been reported with a high detection rate of 99 5 and low removal efficiency of 2067 0 for pfoa 6 8 it seems that pfoa in municipal sewage cannot be removed by conventional wwtps which could be discharged into water body through effluent later causing potential ecological risk therefore some novel treatment technologies have been taken into consideration for enhancement of pfoa removal constructed wetlands cws are considered as robust eco technology with low construction and operation costs they were widely utilized in purification and decontamination of domestic sewage industrial and agricultural wastewater mine drainage and landfill leachate 9 12 with the combination of macrophytes microorganisms and substrates therefore cws can efficiently remove emerging contaminants which cannot be easily degraded in conventional wwtps on account of plant uptake bacterial bioaccumulation and substrate adsorption 13 some researches demonstrated that cws performed satisfied removal efficiency of 96 99 for metal nanoparticles 14 15 79 91 95 51 for phenanthrene 16 and 77 88 99 for pfass 17 18 it was confirmed that cws played greater role in treating pfoa compared to traditional wwtps unfortunately as an ecological wastewater treatment system operation performances of cws may be easily influenced by these emerging pollutants especially nitrogen removal due to the toxicity to plants and microbes as is reported in previous studies nitrogen removal efficiency seemed to be limited some in cws in 15 field scale cws of guangdong province average tn removal efficiency was only 40 19 and 23 88 51 53 of tn removal was uncovered in cws in middle eastern china over a six year assessment which possessed strong seasonality 20 similar results were reported in foreigner studies in which only 37 and 38 3 52 6 of tn removal was observed in korean 21 and czech cws 22 even worse limited nitrogen removal efficiency could be easily affected by environmental factors suppression on nitrogen transformation could take place due to exposure of emerging contaminants like pfass resulting from hazards on nitrifying denitrifying bacteria and enzyme activity mainly drop of functional microbes abundance such as hydrogenophaga and pseudomonas were discovered under 0 05 mg l pfoa exposure resulting in drop of tn removal by 3 49 6 52 23 reduction on microbial richness and decrease of tn removal for 15 was also revealed under 10 mg l pfos exposure 24 inhibition on ammonia monooxygenase amo activity was reported with stress of 1 10 mg l pfoa further leading to decrease of ammonium nh4 n removal by 10 20 25 analogously our previous study has also demonstrated the inhibition by pfoa on nitrification enzymes and reduction on nh4 n removal 26 whereas few in depth discussions have been performed about influence on nitrogen transformation and metabolism under stress of pfoa in cw systems currently and treatment for reinforcing nitrogen removal which was inhibited by pfoa was also lacking iron fe is a non toxic and non polluting element with widespread distribution in natural environment recently iron materials such as zero valent iron zvi have been employed for wastewater treatment due to its superior environmental protection and cost effectiveness 27 28 with regard to nitrogen removal it has been verified that zvi especially nanoscale can improve removal efficiency of nitrogen compounds in aqueous solution due to its strong redox potential 29 30 simultaneously eljamal et al 31 reported enhancement of nh4 n removal via mechanisms of ion exchange electrostatic attraction and adsorption based on a kind of nzvi zeolite composite on the other hand ecological improvement caused by zvi could be another contribution to strengthen removal rate of nitrogen it was microbial nitrogen removal rather than chemical degradation that was confirmed to be major reinforcement pathway by nzvi in aerobic conditions 32 nzvi addition in microbial fuel cells mfc systems was demonstrated to raise number of colonies to improve biodegradation as well as production and transport of electron 33 iron scraps was also reported to increase nh4 n removal via stimulating activity of nitrifying enzymes such as amo and nitrite oxidoreductase nor and via raising abundance of related bacteria covering nitrospira and chloroflexi 32 34 in view of positive influence on nitrogen removal performance caused by iron it has been used in cw systems for alleviating application bottleneck of conventional cws and enhancing their operation performances with novel contaminants 35 iron filings added in cws were stated to enhance nitrification and denitrification with increase of nh4 n and tn removal rate 36 37 coupling of zvi and activated carbon in cws could promote denitrification process and increase tn removal to 82 38 nevertheless microbial nitrogen metabolism that stimulated by iron still require investigation on various dosages in cws for the most effective treatment which was insufficient in studies at present on the other hand cyclic effect mechanism of both nitrogen and iron in cws with pfoa exposure still needs further clarification in order to fill up the gap between microbial nitrogen metabolism in cw systems and iron introduction under pfoa stress three cws were established with pfoa exposure and nzvi was gradually introduced at 10 30 mg l the main objectives of present study were 1 to estimate potential of nzvi on enhancing nitrogen removal with pfoa exposure 2 to investigate variations of nitrogen cycling enzyme activities with nzvi addition under pfoa stress 3 to illustrate promotions of nzvi on functional bacteria and genes with pfoa exposure this study is expected to explore the best dosage of nzvi to reinforce nitrogen removal in cws treating wastewater that containing pfass 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental devices and operational process three plexiglass cws wrapped with tin foil were constructed and named as cw1 cw2 and cw3 in subsequence these cws were set up in the laboratory of 55 building at campus of southeast university in nanjing and their operation diagram can be found in supplementary materials diameter and height of each cw were respectively 10 and 35 cm substrates filled in cws were quartz sand φ 1 2 mm and the whole substrate layer was 30 cm high an outlet was set at the bottom of device to drainage there were 3 5 rhizomes of iris pseudacorus planted in each cw in order to obtain effective treating performance cws was fed sequentially once every three days by means of manual operation the feeding was with common synthetic sewage 25 until stable effluent quality was observed next 1 mg l pfoa was mixed completely with influent and added in both cw2 and cw3 later after long time exposure for about nine months nzvi with concentration of 10 30 mg l was dosed in cw3 in turn since 10 mg l nzvi had been added for around 60 days and stability of cw3 effluent was found formal experiments started periods were divided considering dosage of nzvi and the test duration was 150 days in whole nzvi was also added via influent with its dispersion liquid prepared with sterilized di water every time before feeding ultrasonic treatment was performed at 70 hz to make sure uniformly dispersion as far as possible concrete methods for their addition and stockpile were illustrated in our previous study 26 2 2 performance estimation of sewage treatment water samples of influent and effluent were collected on the first day morning of each batch for duration of our study next all samples were determined for analyzing parameters of water quality which were closely related to nitrogen transformation including nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn according to standard methods 39 2 3 assays of nitrogen cycling enzyme activity substrates of each cw were collected twice a month for assaying activity of enzymes involving in nitrogen transformation firstly ure activity was measured for estimation of urea hydrolysis efficiency and capacity of nitrogen removal in general thereafter enzymes that catalyze nitrification and denitrification including ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrite oxidoreductase nor nitrate reductase nar and nitrite reductase nir were all detected considering the measures in other researches 40 41 more details can be found in supplementary materials 2 4 analysis of microbial community substrates of each cw were sampled in 60 and 150 d of duration from the surface layer to 10 cm in depth all samples were collected from at least three different sites and mixed fully in order for convincing representation of samples for various cws high throughput sequencing was performed to investigate and analyze variations on bacterial community after dna was extracted with omega soil dna kit m5635 02 omega bio tek norcross ga usa the upstream primer was 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and downstream primer was 806r 5 ggactachvgggwtctaat 3 what is more v3 v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna was selected as taxonomic specific fragment and the sequencing was conducted on illumina miseq pe300 platform of personalbio shanghai china 2 5 methods for statistical analysis both one way anova and lsd test were carried on to estimate distinct between groups via spss 26 ibm usa software including parameters of water quality and enzyme activities the difference was assumed to be significant if the p value is 0 05 nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds of nitrogen cycling enzymes was performed based on r software redundancy analysis rda of functional bacteria at genus level was conducted via canoco5 software phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust2 platform https github com picrust picrust2 wiki was employed to analyze contributions of dnb to denitrification based on metacyc database and predict functional genes related to nitrogen cycling processes according to kegg database figures were mapping via software of originpro 2021 r and adobe illustrator 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations of dynamic nitrogen removal during 150 days of assay a fluctuant downward trend was observed on temperature in each group with no notable rule of ph dynamic variation fig s2 it seemed that temperature could be influence factor for dynamic alteration in cws nevertheless average ph in cw2 and cw3 were markedly higher than cw1 fig s2 indicating impacts brought by pfoa and nzvi on ph over 150 days of detection nitrogen transformation differed in various groups revealed by alterations of nh4 n no3 n and tn in effluent in conventional nitrogen cycling processes aerobic nitrification was the dominant step for nh4 n transformation 42 nh4 n removal was inhibited significantly during 0 60 d in cw2 compared to cw1 p 0 05 while no obvious difference was found over 60 150 d between two groups fig 1 a it suggested that suppression on nitrification caused by 1 mg l pfoa could be alleviated along time nzvi effectively improved nh4 n removal in cw3 on the whole in which average removal efficiency of 150 days was the same level as cw1 consistent to our previous study 26 positive correlation between iron oxidation and nh4 n removal was pronounced in some research so that iron could be used for regulating bacterial activity and stimulating nitrification 43 in this work the most significant enhancement on nitrification was uncovered with nzvi addition at 10 mg l with the maximum increase by 3 65 compared to cw2 no3 n accumulation in cw1 was observed which was more obvious over time fig 1 b owing to lower temperature and weaker sunlight especially in later periods 44 45 pfoa led to promotion of no3 n removal in cw2 compared with cw1 with increase of 55 44 p 0 05 and 71 89 83 12 p 0 05 respectively in 0 30 d and 90 150 d it was resulted from inhibition of nh4 n transformation as well as stimulation on no3 n reduction by pfoa 46 47 nzvi failed to raise no3 n removal in cw3 in relation to cw2 and cw1 with dosage of 10 and 20 mg l in aligned with high nh4 n transformation at same condition however 30 mg l nzvi brought about significant decline of no3 n accumulation by 14 19 p 0 05 and 24 22 p 0 05 in cw3 than cw1 during 90 120 and 120 150 d revealing the alleviation on no3 n accumulation by nzvi at 30 mg l it was also stated in some studies that iron material had potential for improving denitrification process since iron could serve as electron donor and promoting nitrogen transformation 35 48 since the high proportion of no3 n in total content of nitrogen fig 1 d tn removal showed the similar trend of no3 n tn removal gradually decreased along duration which might be due to the drop of temperature activity of nitrogen cycling microbes was confirmed to grow with temperature increase from 0 to 35 c and pose improvement on tn removal 49 high concentration of nh4 n in influent could be another reason for relative low tn removal efficiency 50 which mean more nh4 n oxidation and no3 n accumulation in this study only 30 mg l nzvi could raise tn removal by 3 12 5 51 p 0 05 in cw3 compared to cw1 fig 1 c due to improvement of no3 n reduction no2 n had the lowest proportion in nitrogen mass in effluent fig 1 d and dropped to almost zero over 30 150 d due to the extraordinary high nitrification efficiency and more suppression on no3 n removal along time relative concentration of cw3 cw2 indicated different effects of nzvi on nitrogen transformation at various dosages fig 2 a relative concentration of nh4 n rose from 40 50 to 111 10 over 0 150 d in which it was 60 98 p 0 05 and 30 40 p 0 05 higher with 30 mg l nzvi addition in relation to 10 and 20 mg l it suggested notable decrease on enhancement of nitrification by nzvi with increase of its concentration and verified the best dosage for nh4 n removal within 10 30 mg l was 10 mg l relative concentration of no3 n and tn was higher than 100 all along demonstrating the more severe no3 n accumulation in cw3 than cw2 due to promotion of no3 n reduction by pfoa in cw2 as well as increase of nh4 n transformation rate contributed by nzvi in cw3 relative no2 n concentration was uncovered to exceed 100 with nzvi addition at 10 and 20 mg l 72 26 p 0 05 and 96 62 p 0 05 higher in comparison to 30 mg l 100 such phenomena were resulted from effective promotion on nh4 n removal only by 10 20 mg l nzvi similarly with increase of nzvi concentration level the upward trend of relative nh4 n concentration and downward trend of relative no3 n concentration were observed in regression curves fig s3 it suggested the greatest enhancement of 10 mg l nzvi on nitrification and the alleviation potential of no3 n accumulation by 30 mg l nzvi principal component analysis pca exhibited similarity and difference between groups visually in fig 2 b the overlap of 95 confidence ellipse between cw1 and cw2 was less than cw1 and cw3 confirming variation of nitrogen removal caused by pfoa exposure and the potential to counteract such alteration with nzvi introduction besides according to projection of different arrows onto axes no3 n and tn were the major factors for discrepancy between groups moreover there was distinct positive correlation between no3 n and tn owing to extremely small angle of their corresponding arrows 90 on account of the greatest occupation of no3 n in nitrogen content 3 2 variations of related substrate enzymes ure was adopted to evaluate activity of urea hydrolysis and ammonia production which was related to tn and no3 n removal 51 amo nor nar and nir was confirmed to be involved in nitrification denitrification it was revealed that nitrogen cycling could be suppressed through inhibition on key enzymes under pfoa stress thus resulting in decrease on nitrogen removal 52 in this study relative activity of ure in cw2 declined significantly by 57 20 74 51 p 0 05 in various periods fig 3 a compared to cw1 and nar dropped by 31 47 56 60 p 0 05 over 0 120 d and by 5 91 p 0 05 over 120 150 d fig 3 d it demonstrated generally marked suppression that pfoa posed on ure and nar nzvi addition led to increase of 13 78 71 16 on ure and 4 49 31 42 on nar except 120 150 d in cw3 compared to cw2 which was still lower than cw1 revealing that the promotion brought by nzvi on ure and nar was limited by contrast no notable side effect of pfoa was found on nor and nir over 150 days fig 3 c e however stimulation on their activity were still observed by nzvi with 9 69 315 18 on nor and 53 83 197 70 on nir in comparison to cw2 additionally relative activities of both nor and nir in cw3 were found higher than cw1 respectively by 20 15 344 67 except 120 150 d and 68 14 181 24 p 0 05 it verified the effective improvement of nzvi on oxidation and reduction of nitrite under pfoa exposure nonetheless amo activity exhibited boost of 53 54 141 62 p 0 05 and 64 06 p 0 05 during 0 90 d and 90 120 d with pfoa exposure while drop of 6 38 in relation to cw1 was discovered later 120 150 d it indicated the stimulation of pfoa on amo in earlier periods moreover significant increase of amo relative activity 46 67 p 0 05 compared to cw2 was only detected in the first period with 10 mg l nzvi addition relative activity of cw3 cw2 was further discussed for comparing different influence by nzvi at various dosage fig s4 no marked variation of cw3 cw2 was uncovered on ure with change of nzvi dosage yet all of which were above 100 demonstrating promotion of 10 30 mg l nzvi on ure as for nitrification and denitrification enzymes the higher values of cw3 cw2 were found with nzvi addition at 10 20 mg l besides 30 mg l nzvi could lead to limited stimulation on nor and nar or even inhibition on amo 100 in general nzvi introduction at lower concentration like 10 20 mg l was prone to enhance activity of nitrogen cycling enzymes compared to 30 mg l nzvi nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds was carried out to estimate general alteration among key enzymes involved in nitrogen cycling in order for illustrating responses of microbes to nzvi addition at different dosages in this study five core enzymes which was closely related to nitrogen transformation including ure amo nor nar and nir were taken into consideration for nmds analysis based on bray curtis algorithm as is shown in fig 3 f satisfied goodness of fit was observed stress 0 071 0 1 and there were significant differences between various groups r 0 4025 0 and p 0 001 0 05 large difference of enzyme activity between conditions with 10 mg l nzvi addition and that of 20 30 mg l were uncovered which stated changes of influence on nitrogen cycling enzymes caused by different dosage of nzvi moving on activity of nitrogen cycling enzymes could alter along time even with nzvi addition at the same dosage 3 3 variations of functional microbes 3 3 1 functional bacteria for nitrogen cycling since microbial nitrification and denitrification are major processes for nitrogen removal 53 functional bacteria taking part in nitrogen cycling were worth investigation to comprehend its mechanism 16s rrna sequencing was conducted for studying alterations on microbial community structure and assessing responses of related bacteria to different dosage of nzvi under pfoa stress considering nitrogen transformation processes various microbial genera were selected including bacteria of ammonia oxidizing aob nitrite oxidizing nob denitrifying dnb dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra anaerobic ammonia oxidizing anammox and nitrogen fixing nfb generally speaking pearson correlation coefficients between cw1 1 and cw2 1 as well as that between cw1 2 and cw2 2 were 0 9224 and 0 8460 respectively manifesting that functional bacteria involved in nitrogen metabolism with 1 mg l pfoa exposure were generally positively correlated to those in control group simultaneously such correlation decreased along time which might be resulted from the more impacts by pfoa on related functional bacteria over exposure time and more changes was found on nitrogen cycling microbes on addition correlation coefficient between cw3 1 and cw2 1 0 7466 was lower than that between cw3 2 and cw2 2 0 8834 it indicated the more influence that nzvi posed on bacteria with concentration of 20 mg l compared to 30 mg l which further led to more discrepancy between cw3 and cw1 with 20 mg l nzvi 3 3 1 1 nfb n2 could be utilized by nfb to produce ammonia for nitrification in this study azospira was discovered as nfb whose abundance declined since nzvi dosing in cw3 with drop of 80 00 97 50 and 77 78 97 50 in relation to cw2 and cw1 respectively 3 3 1 2 aob nob as conventional microbes participating in nitrification changes of nitrosomonas and nitrospira were similar to each other pfoa exposure led to increase of their relative abundance which was probably owing to suppression on other genera promotion on nitrifying bacteria activity was pronounced with continuous nzvi addition in some wastewater treatment system 54 in this study with nzvi introduction at 20 mg l both aob and nob were observed being promoted by 84 72 111 83 in cw3 compared to control group cw1 while only rise of 29 54 83 99 was found with 30 mg l dosage it seemed that relative lower nzvi concentration might be more conducive to nitrifying bacteria within 30 mg l with exposure of pfoa it was according with the higher enhancement on nh4 n removal by 10 20 mg l nzvi in contrast to 30 mg l 3 3 1 3 anammox sm1a02 belongs to planctomycetes which has been confirmed to take part in anammox process 55 it was demonstrated in some study that anammox process tend to occur in cws with high concentration of nh4 n in influent 50 adding nzvi in this work caused stimulation of sm1a02 in cw3 which was 400 00 and 33 33 higher than in cw2 with dosage of 20 and 30 mg l it was speculated that nzvi also contributed to enhancement on nh4 n removal via promoting anammox process aligned with previous study not only nitrification but also anammox could make contributions to nh4 n transformation in iron based subsurface flow cws or some other treatment systems 36 54 besides increase of dosage might result in weaker effectiveness with nzvi concentration no 30 mg l consistent with nh4 n transformation in fig 1 a 3 3 1 4 dnb there were more than fifty dnb found in this study table s1 and total relative abundance of dnb in cw1 cw2 and cw3 were 40 16 42 62 49 82 53 01 and 42 00 50 86 it suggested stimulation of pfoa on dnb including ferribacterium and hydrogenophaga aligned with promotion on no3 n removal by pfoa mentioned above competitive increase of dnb in groundwater exposed to pfass was also reported in previous study 56 probably due to more carbon source with pfass exposure further causing enrichment of dnb increase 2 08 and decrease 20 77 of dnb were uncovered in cw3 respectively with 20 and 30 mg l nzvi addition compared with cw2 furthermore lower abundance of dnb was even found in cw3 than control cw1 with dosage of 30 mg l which manifested inhibition by nzvi at higher concentration on dnb such as unclassified burkholderiaceae and acidovorax decline of dnb abundance was not consistent with improvement of no3 n removal by 30 mg l nzvi addition in relation to cw1 it suggested that some other pathway was possible for enhancing no3 n reduction which would be illustrated below 3 3 1 5 dnra there were 24 dnra bacteria found in this study table s2 which played role in reducing nitrate to ammonium to cut down greenhouse gases emission studies pronounced that dnra was positively correlated to temperature 57 58 and in this research relative abundance of dnra bacteria in 150 d winter was declined by 40 78 64 31 in contrast to 60 d autumn from cluster analysis in fig 4 c pfoa effect on dnra might also vary due to different exposure time what is more introduction of nzvi could bring about variation on microbial structure of dnra bacteria in consideration of large discrepancy between cw3 and cw2 as well as cw1 in the same period concretely their abundance dropped by 38 11 61 38 in cw3 with nzvi addition compared to cw2 mainly including hyphomicrobium rhodobacter and pseudomonas it might indicate that nzvi was capable of reducing risk of nitrate reduction to ammonium with dnra bacteria participating and was beneficial to nh4 n removal 3 3 2 functional bacteria for iron cycling 3 3 2 1 feammox ferric iron dependent ammonium oxidation feammox has been reported as a novel microbial nitrogen removal mechanism 59 60 with nzvi addition in cw systems feammox also played very important role in nh4 n removal which cannot be neglected 61 as shown in eqs 1 3 in this work typical feammox bacteria such as geothrix 62 was uncovered in cws obviously geothrix was found inhibited by 40 90 under pfoa stress in cw2 compared to control group cw1 which suggested that feammox microbes might also respond to toxic contaminants 63 and result in decline of nh4 n removal efficiency on the other hand geothrix in cw3 with 20 and 30 mg l nzvi was 33 33 and 900 00 higher than that in cw2 it clearly demonstrated that nzvi could raise efficiency of feammox process to promote nh4 n removal in cws exposed by pfoa which was evidently dose dependent in present work 10 mg l was the most suitable dosage for nzvi to enhance nh4 n removal capacity showing that feammox was not the major pathway for nh4 n removal 1 6fe oh 3 2 nh 4 10 h n 2 6 fe 2 18 h 2 o 2 6fe oh 3 nh 4 10 h no 2 6 fe 2 16 h 2 o 3 8fe oh 3 nh 4 14 h no 3 8 fe 2 21 h 2 o

participation of nitrate dependent fe oxidation ndfo bacteria 64 such process could be shown as eq 4 since the reaction was closely related to no3 n typical ndfo microbes also played roles in nitrogen cycling including paracoccus dechloromonas acidovorax and azospira 65 67 fig 4 b in this work paracoccus 0 78 8 88 was the most dominant bacteria in ndfo process which was 6 74 and 31 87 higher in cw3 respectively dosing 20 and 30 mg l nzvi than cw2 and was 1 81 6 67 times higher than cw1 it indicated the potential of nzvi to strengthen iron oxidation and improve no3 n reduction which explained the alleviation of no3 n accumulation with 30 mg l nzvi addition in cws analogously a study on steel slag cw emphasized the stimulation on nitrogen removal with reaction of ferrous ion and no3 n 68 si et al 69 also demonstrated the effective enhancement of no3 n removal due to ndfo process in sponge iron cw system 3 3 2 3 dirb in addition fe iii might be further reduced by dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria dirb to fe ii and form a dynamic equilibrium of iron 70 as the reduction process of fe iii shown in eq 5 dirb could work in concert with iron oxidizing microbes to form fe ii fe iii cycling and transfer electrons extracellularly to microbial cells 71 dosing nzvi in cws under pfoa stress could also lead to variations on dirb fig s5 dirb discovered in this study were anaeromyxobacter geobacter clostridium paraclostridium ruminococcus and anaerolinea in which anaeromyxobacter geobacter and clostridium belong to dnra bacteria manifesting that dnra might be related to iron cycling in cws in iron based sbr system zhang et al 72 manifested the existence of dirb like anaeromyxobacter which used fe iii as electron acceptor to promote nitrogen removal in contrast to cw2 20 mg l nzvi contributed to increase of dirb relative abundance by 77 00 in cw3 while nzvi at 30 mg l led to a drop of 2 61 it indicated that nzvi with lower concentration could be more conducive to fe iii reduction and improve nitrogen removal 3 3 3 redundancy analysis rda rda was performed at genus level to investigate relationship between functional bacterial mentioned in section 3 3 1 and other factors including nitrogen content in effluent and nzvi dosage fig 5 the largest contributions were from tn 31 1 and nzvi 29 5 indicating that tn removal efficiency and nzvi concentration were closely related to nitrogen cycling bacteria relative abundance of acinetobacter and paracoccus was positively correlated to nzvi concentration revealing that more stimulation was exerted on these genera with increase of nzvi dosage within 0 30 mg l however more bacteria were observed correlating to nzvi negatively such as unclassified burkholderiaceae pseudomonas acidovorax and allorhizobium neorhizobium pararhizobium rhizobium it manifested that 30 mg l nzvi might posed adverse influence to nitrogen cycling microbes compared to that at lower concentration no3 n was found closely correlated to tn positively due to the highest proportion of no3 n in nitrogen in effluent aligned with results mentioned in section 3 1 abundance of some genera like flavobacterium hydrogenophaga and unclassified rhodobacteraceae was negatively corelated to concentration of no3 n and tn in effluent in other words the higher removal efficiency of no3 n and tn was closely related to the higher abundance of these bacteria probably indicating the more activity and sensitivity of them in denitrification than other functional microbes negative correlation was observed between nh4 n and no3 n content in effluent because high transformation rate of nh4 n resulted in accumulation of no3 n and might lead to decline of tn removal in cws further especially in winter with lower temperature and weak sunlight in addition relative abundance of both nitrospira and nitrosomonas were negatively corelated to nh4 n concentration in effluent demonstrating the increase of aob and nob could lead to promotion on nitrification process and nh4 n removal interestingly thauera the most abundant functional microbe involving in nitrogen transformation discovered in present study was positively corelated to no2 n content and corelated to no3 n negatively as typical denitrifying bacterial genus thauera was reported to not only pose active impacts on denitrification but also promote degrading halogenated derivatives using nitrate as electron acceptor 73 consequently the more content of no2 n could result from promotion on denitrification and improvement on no3 n removal with the stimulation on thauera 3 4 variations of functional genes microbial genera participated in metabolic pathway of denitrification denitrification pwy could be predicted according to results of picrust2 fig 6 a genera of this pathway was discovered more abundant in cw2 than cw1 revealing enrichment of dnb caused by pfoa which was aligned with practical change of dnb in fig 4 b nzvi at 20 mg l further raised abundance of dnb particularly for sharp promotion of thauera in cw3 while no obvious variety was uncovered with nzvi addition at 30 mg l compared to cw2 this result demonstrated the potential of stimulating dnb under pfoa stress once more with nzvi at lower concentration removal efficiency of nitrogen depended on related key microbes which was regulated by core genes of nitrogen cycling fig 6 b depicts nitrogen transformation processes from 3 to 5 valence and relative abundance of functional genes 3 4 1 1 nitrification in the first two steps both gene amoa that encoding enzyme amo ec 1 14 99 39 and gene hao that encoding hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao ec 1 7 2 6 were raised under pfoa exposure manifesting stimulation by pfoa on amo and hao consistent to the rise of amo activity mentioned above fig 3 b slight drop of amoa and hao abundance occurred with nzvi addition which were still higher than cw1 yu et al 74 discovered the higher expression of gene amoa with iron addition in comparison to the control indicating the potential for improving nitrification process as for the third step gene nxra and nasa that encoding key enzyme ec 1 7 5 1 and ec 1 7 99 were both increased under pfoa exposure in cw2 while gene nasb decreased by 21 17 34 83 compared to cw1 group nzvi had potential for promoting no2 n oxidating to no3 n which was influenced by its dosage abundance of nxra and nasb were found increasing with 20 mg l nzvi addition while 30 mg l nzvi led to inhibition of nxra and nasa the more marked promotion on relative activity of nor in fig 3 c with nzvi at 20 mg l than 30 mg l was conformed to alterations of key genes 3 4 1 2 denitrification no3 n reducing to no2 n was the first step of denitrification covering core enzymes like ec 1 7 5 1 ec 1 7 99 ec 1 7 7 2 and ec 1 7 1 1 3 which were encoded by genes including narg narh nari narb and nr pfoa caused increase of them in cw2 except gene np demonstrating stimulation of pfoa on nitrate reduction and interpreting increases on abundance of dnb as well as denitrification efficiency nzvi led to increase of narb and decrease of nr however different effects caused by nzvi on narg narh and nari were observed with dosage changing in which nzvi at 20 mg l resulted in a rise 3 29 5 38 of them in cw3 compared to cw2 similarly increase of gene narg h i expression was reported with iron scraps addition 74 unfortunately in this study drop 38 05 39 88 of these genes took place with 30 mg l nzvi addition responses on gene level explained the probable threat on dnb with nzvi dosing at 30 mg l no2 n could be reduced to no n2o and n2 step by step in which functional enzyme ec 1 7 2 1 and ec 1 7 99 1 were encoded by nirk and nirs and enzymes of further steps like ec 1 7 2 5 and ec 1 7 2 4 were respectively encoded by gene norb and nosz gene nirk and nirs were more abundant in cw2 in contrast to cw1 which revealed that pfoa might be advantageous to no2 n reduction to no also supporting the improvement of pfoa on denitrification efficiency nzvi brought about decline of nirk abundance while impacts on nirs were dose dependent in which increase 53 68 and decrease 12 16 were uncovered respectively with 20 and 30 mg l nzvi under pfoa stress distinct between nirk and nirs might be owing to different enzymes they encoding 75 boost of norb 21 78 56 29 and nosz 24 92 52 93 in cw2 than cw1 suggested possible promotion of pfoa for no and n2o reduction increase of 7 15 8 46 was found on norb with nzvi introduction compared to cw2 nonetheless only nzvi at lower concentration led to rise of nosz 38 98 showing the effects of nzvi on n2o reduction was also dose dependent 3 4 1 3 nitrogen fixation n2 could be transformed by nfb to nh4 n which was bio utilized again key enzyme ec 1 18 6 1 in this process was encoded by gene nifd nifk nifh and anfg pfoa exposure led to changes of nifd nifk and nifh in cw2 compared with cw1 and the changes might vary along exposure time gene nifh was confirmed to overexpress under 100 μg kg pfass exposure suggesting the probable stimulation on n fixation by pfass 76 presently nzvi at 20 and 30 mg l separately caused decrease and slight increase of these three genes which was on account of different nzvi dosage whereas nzvi at different concentration resulted in decline of anfg abundance under pfoa exposure it seemed that nzvi addition in cws with pfoa exposure was adverse to nitrogen fixation with inhibition on functional genes and bacteria fig 4 b involving in this process 3 4 1 4 dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium no3 n in cws could be reduced to nh4 n since ubiquity of dnra related enzymes including ec 1 7 7 1 ec 1 7 1 15 and ec 1 7 2 2 were encoded by nira nirb nird and nrfa pfoa exposure led to various alterations of these genes in cw2 in which abundance of nira and nird were found higher than cw1 while sharp decrease 50 89 52 67 of nrfa was also uncovered all of these four genes were severally reduced by 15 99 46 07 2 19 6 35 15 87 22 60 and 20 27 61 93 with nzvi addition in cw3 in relation to cw2 it was manifested that nzvi might not conduce to dnra process which further brought about lower abundance of dnra bacteria in cw3 than other groups in fig 4 c 3 4 1 5 other processes it was noted that the reaction from nh4 n to nh2oh was reversible and enzyme ec 1 7 99 1 and ec 1 7 2 1 played roles in the inverse process which were encoded by gene hcp and nirs in contrast to cw1 drop 44 78 61 00 of hcp was observed in cw2 with pfoa exposure while nirs was raised by 25 62 27 97 nzvi caused further decrease of hcp in cw3 by 4 65 29 52 and impacts on nirs seemed to be dependent on concentration of nzvi 3 5 microbial nitrogen removal pathway and environmental significance nitrogen cycling was one of the most important metabolic pathways in cw systems which was mostly regulated by microbial activity according to dynamic variation of water quality substrate enzyme activity and functional bacteria and genes microbial nitrogen removal pathway in this study could be inferred as several processes in fig 7 firstly conventional nitrification and denitrification was the major pathway for nh4 n and no3 n removal nitrification was suppressed with pfoa exposure while nzvi effectively improve this process through stimulating aob and nob and key genes anammox was another probable process to remove nh4 n which was improved by nzvi because iron was the necessary element participating in growth and metabolism of anammox bacteria 77 inhibition on dnra bacteria by nzvi was also worth mentioning that could contribute to decrease of nh4 n in effluent indirectly as for no3 n removal since dnb could be promoted by pfoa improvement on denitrification with nzvi addition was not obvious besides some other reactions occurred with alterations of iron valence no2 n and no3 n could serve as electron acceptor and react with fe ii ions released from nzvi involving ndfo bacteria 78 which was stimulated particularly by nzvi with higher dosage it might indicate that alleviation of no3 n accumulation caused by 30 mg l nzvi resulted from improvement on ndfo rather than on denitrification moving on feammox occurred between fe iii and nh4 n which could transform nh4 n to n2 directly and dissimilatory iron reduction also happened simultaneously to keep dynamic balance of iron in previous research fe ii fe iii cycling by combination of ndfo and feammox contributed to simultaneous nh4 n and no3 n removal on wastewater treatment 79 80 in brief nzvi pose stimulation on conventional nitrifying denitrifying and anammox bacteria and additionally promote feammox and ndfo processes to increase nh4 n and no3 n removal efficiency therefore introducing nzvi could be feasible manner to drive effective nitrogen removal under pfoa stress and prevent more nitrogen emission when cws treating pfass containing wastewater which was quite important for environment protection and management 4 conclusion in this work comparative investigation on effects of nzvi at different concentration under pfoa exposure in cws was performed in order to evaluate variations on nitrogen metabolism resulting from stimulation on functional bacteria and genes nzvi improved nh4 n removal in general under pfoa stress and the greatest enhancement was found with 10 mg l nzvi increase of enzyme activity was more notable with nzvi addition at lower dosage and 30 mg l nzvi even led to suppression on amo and nar such results were owing to more stimulation on bacteria and genes of nitrification anammox and denitrification by nzvi at lower dosage moving on nzvi brought about decline on dnra genes and bacteria indirectly contributing to promotion on nh4 n removal on the contrary only nzvi at 30 mg l might alleviate no3 n accumulation in relation to the control resulting in increase of tn removal in cw3 than cw1 it clarified that improvement on no3 n removal by nzvi was mainly due to promotion on ndfo microbes other than on dnb more researches focusing on different categories and introducing modes of iron deserve further study to investigate mechanism of impacts on nitrogen metabolism with nzvi addition when treating pfass containing sewage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

12435,constructed wetlands cws have been employed for treatment of perfluoroalkyl substances containing wastewater however suppression on operation performances of cws was inevitable particularly on nitrogen removal in this study 10 30 mg l nano zero valent iron nzvi was introduced into cws because of its potential for driving effective nitrogen removal via promoting functional microbes perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa exposure led to reduction of ammonia nh4 n transformation but stimulated nitrate no3 n removal by up to 83 12 with pfoa exposure 10 mg l nzvi caused the most significant improvement on nh4 n removal with maximum increase of 3 65 by contrast 30 mg l nzvi was prone to alleviate no3 n accumulation by 14 19 24 22 compared to control group lower dosage of nzvi 10 20 mg l increased activity of five nitrogen cycling enzymes by 31 42 315 18 in maximum whereas 30 mg l nzvi led to limited promotion or even inhibition on these enzymes analogously stimulation on nitrifying anammox and denitrifying bacteria as well as functional key genes were more obvious by nzvi at lower concentration besides nzvi reduced functional gene of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and related bacteria increasing nh4 n removal indirectly the most promotion on nitrate dependent fe oxidation bacteria like paracoccus could explain improvement on no3 n removal by 30 mg l nzvi graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pfoa nzvi constructed wetlands nitrogen transformation dosage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl substances pfass with its satisfied physical and chemical properties have been of widespread use in industrial agricultural and personal care products 1 2 they were reported to cause ecological toxicity after being released and accumulated in environment media 3 4 which have attracted much concern perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa is a typical long chain pfass that belongs to perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas higher detection concentration and rate in environment of pfoa are often discovered than other categories of pfass which may exert more severe ecological risk owing to its good water solubility therefore appreciate treatment to remove pfoa from environmental media particularly from water is undoubtedly necessary as a major sink of pfoa domestic and international wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been reported with a high detection rate of 99 5 and low removal efficiency of 2067 0 for pfoa 6 8 it seems that pfoa in municipal sewage cannot be removed by conventional wwtps which could be discharged into water body through effluent later causing potential ecological risk therefore some novel treatment technologies have been taken into consideration for enhancement of pfoa removal constructed wetlands cws are considered as robust eco technology with low construction and operation costs they were widely utilized in purification and decontamination of domestic sewage industrial and agricultural wastewater mine drainage and landfill leachate 9 12 with the combination of macrophytes microorganisms and substrates therefore cws can efficiently remove emerging contaminants which cannot be easily degraded in conventional wwtps on account of plant uptake bacterial bioaccumulation and substrate adsorption 13 some researches demonstrated that cws performed satisfied removal efficiency of 96 99 for metal nanoparticles 14 15 79 91 95 51 for phenanthrene 16 and 77 88 99 for pfass 17 18 it was confirmed that cws played greater role in treating pfoa compared to traditional wwtps unfortunately as an ecological wastewater treatment system operation performances of cws may be easily influenced by these emerging pollutants especially nitrogen removal due to the toxicity to plants and microbes as is reported in previous studies nitrogen removal efficiency seemed to be limited some in cws in 15 field scale cws of guangdong province average tn removal efficiency was only 40 19 and 23 88 51 53 of tn removal was uncovered in cws in middle eastern china over a six year assessment which possessed strong seasonality 20 similar results were reported in foreigner studies in which only 37 and 38 3 52 6 of tn removal was observed in korean 21 and czech cws 22 even worse limited nitrogen removal efficiency could be easily affected by environmental factors suppression on nitrogen transformation could take place due to exposure of emerging contaminants like pfass resulting from hazards on nitrifying denitrifying bacteria and enzyme activity mainly drop of functional microbes abundance such as hydrogenophaga and pseudomonas were discovered under 0 05 mg l pfoa exposure resulting in drop of tn removal by 3 49 6 52 23 reduction on microbial richness and decrease of tn removal for 15 was also revealed under 10 mg l pfos exposure 24 inhibition on ammonia monooxygenase amo activity was reported with stress of 1 10 mg l pfoa further leading to decrease of ammonium nh4 n removal by 10 20 25 analogously our previous study has also demonstrated the inhibition by pfoa on nitrification enzymes and reduction on nh4 n removal 26 whereas few in depth discussions have been performed about influence on nitrogen transformation and metabolism under stress of pfoa in cw systems currently and treatment for reinforcing nitrogen removal which was inhibited by pfoa was also lacking iron fe is a non toxic and non polluting element with widespread distribution in natural environment recently iron materials such as zero valent iron zvi have been employed for wastewater treatment due to its superior environmental protection and cost effectiveness 27 28 with regard to nitrogen removal it has been verified that zvi especially nanoscale can improve removal efficiency of nitrogen compounds in aqueous solution due to its strong redox potential 29 30 simultaneously eljamal et al 31 reported enhancement of nh4 n removal via mechanisms of ion exchange electrostatic attraction and adsorption based on a kind of nzvi zeolite composite on the other hand ecological improvement caused by zvi could be another contribution to strengthen removal rate of nitrogen it was microbial nitrogen removal rather than chemical degradation that was confirmed to be major reinforcement pathway by nzvi in aerobic conditions 32 nzvi addition in microbial fuel cells mfc systems was demonstrated to raise number of colonies to improve biodegradation as well as production and transport of electron 33 iron scraps was also reported to increase nh4 n removal via stimulating activity of nitrifying enzymes such as amo and nitrite oxidoreductase nor and via raising abundance of related bacteria covering nitrospira and chloroflexi 32 34 in view of positive influence on nitrogen removal performance caused by iron it has been used in cw systems for alleviating application bottleneck of conventional cws and enhancing their operation performances with novel contaminants 35 iron filings added in cws were stated to enhance nitrification and denitrification with increase of nh4 n and tn removal rate 36 37 coupling of zvi and activated carbon in cws could promote denitrification process and increase tn removal to 82 38 nevertheless microbial nitrogen metabolism that stimulated by iron still require investigation on various dosages in cws for the most effective treatment which was insufficient in studies at present on the other hand cyclic effect mechanism of both nitrogen and iron in cws with pfoa exposure still needs further clarification in order to fill up the gap between microbial nitrogen metabolism in cw systems and iron introduction under pfoa stress three cws were established with pfoa exposure and nzvi was gradually introduced at 10 30 mg l the main objectives of present study were 1 to estimate potential of nzvi on enhancing nitrogen removal with pfoa exposure 2 to investigate variations of nitrogen cycling enzyme activities with nzvi addition under pfoa stress 3 to illustrate promotions of nzvi on functional bacteria and genes with pfoa exposure this study is expected to explore the best dosage of nzvi to reinforce nitrogen removal in cws treating wastewater that containing pfass 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental devices and operational process three plexiglass cws wrapped with tin foil were constructed and named as cw1 cw2 and cw3 in subsequence these cws were set up in the laboratory of 55 building at campus of southeast university in nanjing and their operation diagram can be found in supplementary materials diameter and height of each cw were respectively 10 and 35 cm substrates filled in cws were quartz sand φ 1 2 mm and the whole substrate layer was 30 cm high an outlet was set at the bottom of device to drainage there were 3 5 rhizomes of iris pseudacorus planted in each cw in order to obtain effective treating performance cws was fed sequentially once every three days by means of manual operation the feeding was with common synthetic sewage 25 until stable effluent quality was observed next 1 mg l pfoa was mixed completely with influent and added in both cw2 and cw3 later after long time exposure for about nine months nzvi with concentration of 10 30 mg l was dosed in cw3 in turn since 10 mg l nzvi had been added for around 60 days and stability of cw3 effluent was found formal experiments started periods were divided considering dosage of nzvi and the test duration was 150 days in whole nzvi was also added via influent with its dispersion liquid prepared with sterilized di water every time before feeding ultrasonic treatment was performed at 70 hz to make sure uniformly dispersion as far as possible concrete methods for their addition and stockpile were illustrated in our previous study 26 2 2 performance estimation of sewage treatment water samples of influent and effluent were collected on the first day morning of each batch for duration of our study next all samples were determined for analyzing parameters of water quality which were closely related to nitrogen transformation including nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn according to standard methods 39 2 3 assays of nitrogen cycling enzyme activity substrates of each cw were collected twice a month for assaying activity of enzymes involving in nitrogen transformation firstly ure activity was measured for estimation of urea hydrolysis efficiency and capacity of nitrogen removal in general thereafter enzymes that catalyze nitrification and denitrification including ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrite oxidoreductase nor nitrate reductase nar and nitrite reductase nir were all detected considering the measures in other researches 40 41 more details can be found in supplementary materials 2 4 analysis of microbial community substrates of each cw were sampled in 60 and 150 d of duration from the surface layer to 10 cm in depth all samples were collected from at least three different sites and mixed fully in order for convincing representation of samples for various cws high throughput sequencing was performed to investigate and analyze variations on bacterial community after dna was extracted with omega soil dna kit m5635 02 omega bio tek norcross ga usa the upstream primer was 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and downstream primer was 806r 5 ggactachvgggwtctaat 3 what is more v3 v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna was selected as taxonomic specific fragment and the sequencing was conducted on illumina miseq pe300 platform of personalbio shanghai china 2 5 methods for statistical analysis both one way anova and lsd test were carried on to estimate distinct between groups via spss 26 ibm usa software including parameters of water quality and enzyme activities the difference was assumed to be significant if the p value is 0 05 nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds of nitrogen cycling enzymes was performed based on r software redundancy analysis rda of functional bacteria at genus level was conducted via canoco5 software phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust2 platform https github com picrust picrust2 wiki was employed to analyze contributions of dnb to denitrification based on metacyc database and predict functional genes related to nitrogen cycling processes according to kegg database figures were mapping via software of originpro 2021 r and adobe illustrator 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations of dynamic nitrogen removal during 150 days of assay a fluctuant downward trend was observed on temperature in each group with no notable rule of ph dynamic variation fig s2 it seemed that temperature could be influence factor for dynamic alteration in cws nevertheless average ph in cw2 and cw3 were markedly higher than cw1 fig s2 indicating impacts brought by pfoa and nzvi on ph over 150 days of detection nitrogen transformation differed in various groups revealed by alterations of nh4 n no3 n and tn in effluent in conventional nitrogen cycling processes aerobic nitrification was the dominant step for nh4 n transformation 42 nh4 n removal was inhibited significantly during 0 60 d in cw2 compared to cw1 p 0 05 while no obvious difference was found over 60 150 d between two groups fig 1 a it suggested that suppression on nitrification caused by 1 mg l pfoa could be alleviated along time nzvi effectively improved nh4 n removal in cw3 on the whole in which average removal efficiency of 150 days was the same level as cw1 consistent to our previous study 26 positive correlation between iron oxidation and nh4 n removal was pronounced in some research so that iron could be used for regulating bacterial activity and stimulating nitrification 43 in this work the most significant enhancement on nitrification was uncovered with nzvi addition at 10 mg l with the maximum increase by 3 65 compared to cw2 no3 n accumulation in cw1 was observed which was more obvious over time fig 1 b owing to lower temperature and weaker sunlight especially in later periods 44 45 pfoa led to promotion of no3 n removal in cw2 compared with cw1 with increase of 55 44 p 0 05 and 71 89 83 12 p 0 05 respectively in 0 30 d and 90 150 d it was resulted from inhibition of nh4 n transformation as well as stimulation on no3 n reduction by pfoa 46 47 nzvi failed to raise no3 n removal in cw3 in relation to cw2 and cw1 with dosage of 10 and 20 mg l in aligned with high nh4 n transformation at same condition however 30 mg l nzvi brought about significant decline of no3 n accumulation by 14 19 p 0 05 and 24 22 p 0 05 in cw3 than cw1 during 90 120 and 120 150 d revealing the alleviation on no3 n accumulation by nzvi at 30 mg l it was also stated in some studies that iron material had potential for improving denitrification process since iron could serve as electron donor and promoting nitrogen transformation 35 48 since the high proportion of no3 n in total content of nitrogen fig 1 d tn removal showed the similar trend of no3 n tn removal gradually decreased along duration which might be due to the drop of temperature activity of nitrogen cycling microbes was confirmed to grow with temperature increase from 0 to 35 c and pose improvement on tn removal 49 high concentration of nh4 n in influent could be another reason for relative low tn removal efficiency 50 which mean more nh4 n oxidation and no3 n accumulation in this study only 30 mg l nzvi could raise tn removal by 3 12 5 51 p 0 05 in cw3 compared to cw1 fig 1 c due to improvement of no3 n reduction no2 n had the lowest proportion in nitrogen mass in effluent fig 1 d and dropped to almost zero over 30 150 d due to the extraordinary high nitrification efficiency and more suppression on no3 n removal along time relative concentration of cw3 cw2 indicated different effects of nzvi on nitrogen transformation at various dosages fig 2 a relative concentration of nh4 n rose from 40 50 to 111 10 over 0 150 d in which it was 60 98 p 0 05 and 30 40 p 0 05 higher with 30 mg l nzvi addition in relation to 10 and 20 mg l it suggested notable decrease on enhancement of nitrification by nzvi with increase of its concentration and verified the best dosage for nh4 n removal within 10 30 mg l was 10 mg l relative concentration of no3 n and tn was higher than 100 all along demonstrating the more severe no3 n accumulation in cw3 than cw2 due to promotion of no3 n reduction by pfoa in cw2 as well as increase of nh4 n transformation rate contributed by nzvi in cw3 relative no2 n concentration was uncovered to exceed 100 with nzvi addition at 10 and 20 mg l 72 26 p 0 05 and 96 62 p 0 05 higher in comparison to 30 mg l 100 such phenomena were resulted from effective promotion on nh4 n removal only by 10 20 mg l nzvi similarly with increase of nzvi concentration level the upward trend of relative nh4 n concentration and downward trend of relative no3 n concentration were observed in regression curves fig s3 it suggested the greatest enhancement of 10 mg l nzvi on nitrification and the alleviation potential of no3 n accumulation by 30 mg l nzvi principal component analysis pca exhibited similarity and difference between groups visually in fig 2 b the overlap of 95 confidence ellipse between cw1 and cw2 was less than cw1 and cw3 confirming variation of nitrogen removal caused by pfoa exposure and the potential to counteract such alteration with nzvi introduction besides according to projection of different arrows onto axes no3 n and tn were the major factors for discrepancy between groups moreover there was distinct positive correlation between no3 n and tn owing to extremely small angle of their corresponding arrows 90 on account of the greatest occupation of no3 n in nitrogen content 3 2 variations of related substrate enzymes ure was adopted to evaluate activity of urea hydrolysis and ammonia production which was related to tn and no3 n removal 51 amo nor nar and nir was confirmed to be involved in nitrification denitrification it was revealed that nitrogen cycling could be suppressed through inhibition on key enzymes under pfoa stress thus resulting in decrease on nitrogen removal 52 in this study relative activity of ure in cw2 declined significantly by 57 20 74 51 p 0 05 in various periods fig 3 a compared to cw1 and nar dropped by 31 47 56 60 p 0 05 over 0 120 d and by 5 91 p 0 05 over 120 150 d fig 3 d it demonstrated generally marked suppression that pfoa posed on ure and nar nzvi addition led to increase of 13 78 71 16 on ure and 4 49 31 42 on nar except 120 150 d in cw3 compared to cw2 which was still lower than cw1 revealing that the promotion brought by nzvi on ure and nar was limited by contrast no notable side effect of pfoa was found on nor and nir over 150 days fig 3 c e however stimulation on their activity were still observed by nzvi with 9 69 315 18 on nor and 53 83 197 70 on nir in comparison to cw2 additionally relative activities of both nor and nir in cw3 were found higher than cw1 respectively by 20 15 344 67 except 120 150 d and 68 14 181 24 p 0 05 it verified the effective improvement of nzvi on oxidation and reduction of nitrite under pfoa exposure nonetheless amo activity exhibited boost of 53 54 141 62 p 0 05 and 64 06 p 0 05 during 0 90 d and 90 120 d with pfoa exposure while drop of 6 38 in relation to cw1 was discovered later 120 150 d it indicated the stimulation of pfoa on amo in earlier periods moreover significant increase of amo relative activity 46 67 p 0 05 compared to cw2 was only detected in the first period with 10 mg l nzvi addition relative activity of cw3 cw2 was further discussed for comparing different influence by nzvi at various dosage fig s4 no marked variation of cw3 cw2 was uncovered on ure with change of nzvi dosage yet all of which were above 100 demonstrating promotion of 10 30 mg l nzvi on ure as for nitrification and denitrification enzymes the higher values of cw3 cw2 were found with nzvi addition at 10 20 mg l besides 30 mg l nzvi could lead to limited stimulation on nor and nar or even inhibition on amo 100 in general nzvi introduction at lower concentration like 10 20 mg l was prone to enhance activity of nitrogen cycling enzymes compared to 30 mg l nzvi nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds was carried out to estimate general alteration among key enzymes involved in nitrogen cycling in order for illustrating responses of microbes to nzvi addition at different dosages in this study five core enzymes which was closely related to nitrogen transformation including ure amo nor nar and nir were taken into consideration for nmds analysis based on bray curtis algorithm as is shown in fig 3 f satisfied goodness of fit was observed stress 0 071 0 1 and there were significant differences between various groups r 0 4025 0 and p 0 001 0 05 large difference of enzyme activity between conditions with 10 mg l nzvi addition and that of 20 30 mg l were uncovered which stated changes of influence on nitrogen cycling enzymes caused by different dosage of nzvi moving on activity of nitrogen cycling enzymes could alter along time even with nzvi addition at the same dosage 3 3 variations of functional microbes 3 3 1 functional bacteria for nitrogen cycling since microbial nitrification and denitrification are major processes for nitrogen removal 53 functional bacteria taking part in nitrogen cycling were worth investigation to comprehend its mechanism 16s rrna sequencing was conducted for studying alterations on microbial community structure and assessing responses of related bacteria to different dosage of nzvi under pfoa stress considering nitrogen transformation processes various microbial genera were selected including bacteria of ammonia oxidizing aob nitrite oxidizing nob denitrifying dnb dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra anaerobic ammonia oxidizing anammox and nitrogen fixing nfb generally speaking pearson correlation coefficients between cw1 1 and cw2 1 as well as that between cw1 2 and cw2 2 were 0 9224 and 0 8460 respectively manifesting that functional bacteria involved in nitrogen metabolism with 1 mg l pfoa exposure were generally positively correlated to those in control group simultaneously such correlation decreased along time which might be resulted from the more impacts by pfoa on related functional bacteria over exposure time and more changes was found on nitrogen cycling microbes on addition correlation coefficient between cw3 1 and cw2 1 0 7466 was lower than that between cw3 2 and cw2 2 0 8834 it indicated the more influence that nzvi posed on bacteria with concentration of 20 mg l compared to 30 mg l which further led to more discrepancy between cw3 and cw1 with 20 mg l nzvi 3 3 1 1 nfb n2 could be utilized by nfb to produce ammonia for nitrification in this study azospira was discovered as nfb whose abundance declined since nzvi dosing in cw3 with drop of 80 00 97 50 and 77 78 97 50 in relation to cw2 and cw1 respectively 3 3 1 2 aob nob as conventional microbes participating in nitrification changes of nitrosomonas and nitrospira were similar to each other pfoa exposure led to increase of their relative abundance which was probably owing to suppression on other genera promotion on nitrifying bacteria activity was pronounced with continuous nzvi addition in some wastewater treatment system 54 in this study with nzvi introduction at 20 mg l both aob and nob were observed being promoted by 84 72 111 83 in cw3 compared to control group cw1 while only rise of 29 54 83 99 was found with 30 mg l dosage it seemed that relative lower nzvi concentration might be more conducive to nitrifying bacteria within 30 mg l with exposure of pfoa it was according with the higher enhancement on nh4 n removal by 10 20 mg l nzvi in contrast to 30 mg l 3 3 1 3 anammox sm1a02 belongs to planctomycetes which has been confirmed to take part in anammox process 55 it was demonstrated in some study that anammox process tend to occur in cws with high concentration of nh4 n in influent 50 adding nzvi in this work caused stimulation of sm1a02 in cw3 which was 400 00 and 33 33 higher than in cw2 with dosage of 20 and 30 mg l it was speculated that nzvi also contributed to enhancement on nh4 n removal via promoting anammox process aligned with previous study not only nitrification but also anammox could make contributions to nh4 n transformation in iron based subsurface flow cws or some other treatment systems 36 54 besides increase of dosage might result in weaker effectiveness with nzvi concentration no 30 mg l consistent with nh4 n transformation in fig 1 a 3 3 1 4 dnb there were more than fifty dnb found in this study table s1 and total relative abundance of dnb in cw1 cw2 and cw3 were 40 16 42 62 49 82 53 01 and 42 00 50 86 it suggested stimulation of pfoa on dnb including ferribacterium and hydrogenophaga aligned with promotion on no3 n removal by pfoa mentioned above competitive increase of dnb in groundwater exposed to pfass was also reported in previous study 56 probably due to more carbon source with pfass exposure further causing enrichment of dnb increase 2 08 and decrease 20 77 of dnb were uncovered in cw3 respectively with 20 and 30 mg l nzvi addition compared with cw2 furthermore lower abundance of dnb was even found in cw3 than control cw1 with dosage of 30 mg l which manifested inhibition by nzvi at higher concentration on dnb such as unclassified burkholderiaceae and acidovorax decline of dnb abundance was not consistent with improvement of no3 n removal by 30 mg l nzvi addition in relation to cw1 it suggested that some other pathway was possible for enhancing no3 n reduction which would be illustrated below 3 3 1 5 dnra there were 24 dnra bacteria found in this study table s2 which played role in reducing nitrate to ammonium to cut down greenhouse gases emission studies pronounced that dnra was positively correlated to temperature 57 58 and in this research relative abundance of dnra bacteria in 150 d winter was declined by 40 78 64 31 in contrast to 60 d autumn from cluster analysis in fig 4 c pfoa effect on dnra might also vary due to different exposure time what is more introduction of nzvi could bring about variation on microbial structure of dnra bacteria in consideration of large discrepancy between cw3 and cw2 as well as cw1 in the same period concretely their abundance dropped by 38 11 61 38 in cw3 with nzvi addition compared to cw2 mainly including hyphomicrobium rhodobacter and pseudomonas it might indicate that nzvi was capable of reducing risk of nitrate reduction to ammonium with dnra bacteria participating and was beneficial to nh4 n removal 3 3 2 functional bacteria for iron cycling 3 3 2 1 feammox ferric iron dependent ammonium oxidation feammox has been reported as a novel microbial nitrogen removal mechanism 59 60 with nzvi addition in cw systems feammox also played very important role in nh4 n removal which cannot be neglected 61 as shown in eqs 1 3 in this work typical feammox bacteria such as geothrix 62 was uncovered in cws obviously geothrix was found inhibited by 40 90 under pfoa stress in cw2 compared to control group cw1 which suggested that feammox microbes might also respond to toxic contaminants 63 and result in decline of nh4 n removal efficiency on the other hand geothrix in cw3 with 20 and 30 mg l nzvi was 33 33 and 900 00 higher than that in cw2 it clearly demonstrated that nzvi could raise efficiency of feammox process to promote nh4 n removal in cws exposed by pfoa which was evidently dose dependent in present work 10 mg l was the most suitable dosage for nzvi to enhance nh4 n removal capacity showing that feammox was not the major pathway for nh4 n removal 1 6fe oh 3 2 nh 4 10 h n 2 6 fe 2 18 h 2 o 2 6fe oh 3 nh 4 10 h no 2 6 fe 2 16 h 2 o 3 8fe oh 3 nh 4 14 h no 3 8 fe 2 21 h 2 o

participation of nitrate dependent fe oxidation ndfo bacteria 64 such process could be shown as eq 4 since the reaction was closely related to no3 n typical ndfo microbes also played roles in nitrogen cycling including paracoccus dechloromonas acidovorax and azospira 65 67 fig 4 b in this work paracoccus 0 78 8 88 was the most dominant bacteria in ndfo process which was 6 74 and 31 87 higher in cw3 respectively dosing 20 and 30 mg l nzvi than cw2 and was 1 81 6 67 times higher than cw1 it indicated the potential of nzvi to strengthen iron oxidation and improve no3 n reduction which explained the alleviation of no3 n accumulation with 30 mg l nzvi addition in cws analogously a study on steel slag cw emphasized the stimulation on nitrogen removal with reaction of ferrous ion and no3 n 68 si et al 69 also demonstrated the effective enhancement of no3 n removal due to ndfo process in sponge iron cw system 3 3 2 3 dirb in addition fe iii might be further reduced by dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria dirb to fe ii and form a dynamic equilibrium of iron 70 as the reduction process of fe iii shown in eq 5 dirb could work in concert with iron oxidizing microbes to form fe ii fe iii cycling and transfer electrons extracellularly to microbial cells 71 dosing nzvi in cws under pfoa stress could also lead to variations on dirb fig s5 dirb discovered in this study were anaeromyxobacter geobacter clostridium paraclostridium ruminococcus and anaerolinea in which anaeromyxobacter geobacter and clostridium belong to dnra bacteria manifesting that dnra might be related to iron cycling in cws in iron based sbr system zhang et al 72 manifested the existence of dirb like anaeromyxobacter which used fe iii as electron acceptor to promote nitrogen removal in contrast to cw2 20 mg l nzvi contributed to increase of dirb relative abundance by 77 00 in cw3 while nzvi at 30 mg l led to a drop of 2 61 it indicated that nzvi with lower concentration could be more conducive to fe iii reduction and improve nitrogen removal 3 3 3 redundancy analysis rda rda was performed at genus level to investigate relationship between functional bacterial mentioned in section 3 3 1 and other factors including nitrogen content in effluent and nzvi dosage fig 5 the largest contributions were from tn 31 1 and nzvi 29 5 indicating that tn removal efficiency and nzvi concentration were closely related to nitrogen cycling bacteria relative abundance of acinetobacter and paracoccus was positively correlated to nzvi concentration revealing that more stimulation was exerted on these genera with increase of nzvi dosage within 0 30 mg l however more bacteria were observed correlating to nzvi negatively such as unclassified burkholderiaceae pseudomonas acidovorax and allorhizobium neorhizobium pararhizobium rhizobium it manifested that 30 mg l nzvi might posed adverse influence to nitrogen cycling microbes compared to that at lower concentration no3 n was found closely correlated to tn positively due to the highest proportion of no3 n in nitrogen in effluent aligned with results mentioned in section 3 1 abundance of some genera like flavobacterium hydrogenophaga and unclassified rhodobacteraceae was negatively corelated to concentration of no3 n and tn in effluent in other words the higher removal efficiency of no3 n and tn was closely related to the higher abundance of these bacteria probably indicating the more activity and sensitivity of them in denitrification than other functional microbes negative correlation was observed between nh4 n and no3 n content in effluent because high transformation rate of nh4 n resulted in accumulation of no3 n and might lead to decline of tn removal in cws further especially in winter with lower temperature and weak sunlight in addition relative abundance of both nitrospira and nitrosomonas were negatively corelated to nh4 n concentration in effluent demonstrating the increase of aob and nob could lead to promotion on nitrification process and nh4 n removal interestingly thauera the most abundant functional microbe involving in nitrogen transformation discovered in present study was positively corelated to no2 n content and corelated to no3 n negatively as typical denitrifying bacterial genus thauera was reported to not only pose active impacts on denitrification but also promote degrading halogenated derivatives using nitrate as electron acceptor 73 consequently the more content of no2 n could result from promotion on denitrification and improvement on no3 n removal with the stimulation on thauera 3 4 variations of functional genes microbial genera participated in metabolic pathway of denitrification denitrification pwy could be predicted according to results of picrust2 fig 6 a genera of this pathway was discovered more abundant in cw2 than cw1 revealing enrichment of dnb caused by pfoa which was aligned with practical change of dnb in fig 4 b nzvi at 20 mg l further raised abundance of dnb particularly for sharp promotion of thauera in cw3 while no obvious variety was uncovered with nzvi addition at 30 mg l compared to cw2 this result demonstrated the potential of stimulating dnb under pfoa stress once more with nzvi at lower concentration removal efficiency of nitrogen depended on related key microbes which was regulated by core genes of nitrogen cycling fig 6 b depicts nitrogen transformation processes from 3 to 5 valence and relative abundance of functional genes 3 4 1 1 nitrification in the first two steps both gene amoa that encoding enzyme amo ec 1 14 99 39 and gene hao that encoding hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao ec 1 7 2 6 were raised under pfoa exposure manifesting stimulation by pfoa on amo and hao consistent to the rise of amo activity mentioned above fig 3 b slight drop of amoa and hao abundance occurred with nzvi addition which were still higher than cw1 yu et al 74 discovered the higher expression of gene amoa with iron addition in comparison to the control indicating the potential for improving nitrification process as for the third step gene nxra and nasa that encoding key enzyme ec 1 7 5 1 and ec 1 7 99 were both increased under pfoa exposure in cw2 while gene nasb decreased by 21 17 34 83 compared to cw1 group nzvi had potential for promoting no2 n oxidating to no3 n which was influenced by its dosage abundance of nxra and nasb were found increasing with 20 mg l nzvi addition while 30 mg l nzvi led to inhibition of nxra and nasa the more marked promotion on relative activity of nor in fig 3 c with nzvi at 20 mg l than 30 mg l was conformed to alterations of key genes 3 4 1 2 denitrification no3 n reducing to no2 n was the first step of denitrification covering core enzymes like ec 1 7 5 1 ec 1 7 99 ec 1 7 7 2 and ec 1 7 1 1 3 which were encoded by genes including narg narh nari narb and nr pfoa caused increase of them in cw2 except gene np demonstrating stimulation of pfoa on nitrate reduction and interpreting increases on abundance of dnb as well as denitrification efficiency nzvi led to increase of narb and decrease of nr however different effects caused by nzvi on narg narh and nari were observed with dosage changing in which nzvi at 20 mg l resulted in a rise 3 29 5 38 of them in cw3 compared to cw2 similarly increase of gene narg h i expression was reported with iron scraps addition 74 unfortunately in this study drop 38 05 39 88 of these genes took place with 30 mg l nzvi addition responses on gene level explained the probable threat on dnb with nzvi dosing at 30 mg l no2 n could be reduced to no n2o and n2 step by step in which functional enzyme ec 1 7 2 1 and ec 1 7 99 1 were encoded by nirk and nirs and enzymes of further steps like ec 1 7 2 5 and ec 1 7 2 4 were respectively encoded by gene norb and nosz gene nirk and nirs were more abundant in cw2 in contrast to cw1 which revealed that pfoa might be advantageous to no2 n reduction to no also supporting the improvement of pfoa on denitrification efficiency nzvi brought about decline of nirk abundance while impacts on nirs were dose dependent in which increase 53 68 and decrease 12 16 were uncovered respectively with 20 and 30 mg l nzvi under pfoa stress distinct between nirk and nirs might be owing to different enzymes they encoding 75 boost of norb 21 78 56 29 and nosz 24 92 52 93 in cw2 than cw1 suggested possible promotion of pfoa for no and n2o reduction increase of 7 15 8 46 was found on norb with nzvi introduction compared to cw2 nonetheless only nzvi at lower concentration led to rise of nosz 38 98 showing the effects of nzvi on n2o reduction was also dose dependent 3 4 1 3 nitrogen fixation n2 could be transformed by nfb to nh4 n which was bio utilized again key enzyme ec 1 18 6 1 in this process was encoded by gene nifd nifk nifh and anfg pfoa exposure led to changes of nifd nifk and nifh in cw2 compared with cw1 and the changes might vary along exposure time gene nifh was confirmed to overexpress under 100 μg kg pfass exposure suggesting the probable stimulation on n fixation by pfass 76 presently nzvi at 20 and 30 mg l separately caused decrease and slight increase of these three genes which was on account of different nzvi dosage whereas nzvi at different concentration resulted in decline of anfg abundance under pfoa exposure it seemed that nzvi addition in cws with pfoa exposure was adverse to nitrogen fixation with inhibition on functional genes and bacteria fig 4 b involving in this process 3 4 1 4 dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium no3 n in cws could be reduced to nh4 n since ubiquity of dnra related enzymes including ec 1 7 7 1 ec 1 7 1 15 and ec 1 7 2 2 were encoded by nira nirb nird and nrfa pfoa exposure led to various alterations of these genes in cw2 in which abundance of nira and nird were found higher than cw1 while sharp decrease 50 89 52 67 of nrfa was also uncovered all of these four genes were severally reduced by 15 99 46 07 2 19 6 35 15 87 22 60 and 20 27 61 93 with nzvi addition in cw3 in relation to cw2 it was manifested that nzvi might not conduce to dnra process which further brought about lower abundance of dnra bacteria in cw3 than other groups in fig 4 c 3 4 1 5 other processes it was noted that the reaction from nh4 n to nh2oh was reversible and enzyme ec 1 7 99 1 and ec 1 7 2 1 played roles in the inverse process which were encoded by gene hcp and nirs in contrast to cw1 drop 44 78 61 00 of hcp was observed in cw2 with pfoa exposure while nirs was raised by 25 62 27 97 nzvi caused further decrease of hcp in cw3 by 4 65 29 52 and impacts on nirs seemed to be dependent on concentration of nzvi 3 5 microbial nitrogen removal pathway and environmental significance nitrogen cycling was one of the most important metabolic pathways in cw systems which was mostly regulated by microbial activity according to dynamic variation of water quality substrate enzyme activity and functional bacteria and genes microbial nitrogen removal pathway in this study could be inferred as several processes in fig 7 firstly conventional nitrification and denitrification was the major pathway for nh4 n and no3 n removal nitrification was suppressed with pfoa exposure while nzvi effectively improve this process through stimulating aob and nob and key genes anammox was another probable process to remove nh4 n which was improved by nzvi because iron was the necessary element participating in growth and metabolism of anammox bacteria 77 inhibition on dnra bacteria by nzvi was also worth mentioning that could contribute to decrease of nh4 n in effluent indirectly as for no3 n removal since dnb could be promoted by pfoa improvement on denitrification with nzvi addition was not obvious besides some other reactions occurred with alterations of iron valence no2 n and no3 n could serve as electron acceptor and react with fe ii ions released from nzvi involving ndfo bacteria 78 which was stimulated particularly by nzvi with higher dosage it might indicate that alleviation of no3 n accumulation caused by 30 mg l nzvi resulted from improvement on ndfo rather than on denitrification moving on feammox occurred between fe iii and nh4 n which could transform nh4 n to n2 directly and dissimilatory iron reduction also happened simultaneously to keep dynamic balance of iron in previous research fe ii fe iii cycling by combination of ndfo and feammox contributed to simultaneous nh4 n and no3 n removal on wastewater treatment 79 80 in brief nzvi pose stimulation on conventional nitrifying denitrifying and anammox bacteria and additionally promote feammox and ndfo processes to increase nh4 n and no3 n removal efficiency therefore introducing nzvi could be feasible manner to drive effective nitrogen removal under pfoa stress and prevent more nitrogen emission when cws treating pfass containing wastewater which was quite important for environment protection and management 4 conclusion in this work comparative investigation on effects of nzvi at different concentration under pfoa exposure in cws was performed in order to evaluate variations on nitrogen metabolism resulting from stimulation on functional bacteria and genes nzvi improved nh4 n removal in general under pfoa stress and the greatest enhancement was found with 10 mg l nzvi increase of enzyme activity was more notable with nzvi addition at lower dosage and 30 mg l nzvi even led to suppression on amo and nar such results were owing to more stimulation on bacteria and genes of nitrification anammox and denitrification by nzvi at lower dosage moving on nzvi brought about decline on dnra genes and bacteria indirectly contributing to promotion on nh4 n removal on the contrary only nzvi at 30 mg l might alleviate no3 n accumulation in relation to the control resulting in increase of tn removal in cw3 than cw1 it clarified that improvement on no3 n removal by nzvi was mainly due to promotion on ndfo microbes other than on dnb more researches focusing on different categories and introducing modes of iron deserve further study to investigate mechanism of impacts on nitrogen metabolism with nzvi addition when treating pfass containing sewage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

12436,this study investigated the potential of modified bentonite mb material in mitigating the negative effects of combined veterinary antibiotics cvas on anaerobic digestion ad process treating swine manure four cvas i e oxytetracycline otc tetracycline tc norfloxacin norf and sulfadiazine sdz were selected as they are most frequently detected in swine manure and anaerobically incubated for 30 days under mesophilic conditions 37 c and with addition of different mb weights 1 5 and 10 g l 1 results showed that 1 5 and 10 g l 1 of mb enhanced the removal of cvas from 61 5 no mb addition to 72 7 86 4 and 91 4 respectively cvas removal was accredited to biodegradation rather than adsorption to mb norf was rapidly transferred to solids causing an adsorption competition and decreasing co antibiotics removal while it was fast removed when mb was added when 10 g l 1 of mb were added the cvas adsorption competition diminished and their inhibition on ch4 production decreased from 27 to 1 7 mb addition lowered the impact of cvas significantly by maintaining ph stability enhanced cod removal decreased the vfas accumulation and improved the activity of bacteria and archaeal communities the cost analysis showed that mb additions to ad would reduce cost by 52 than applied methods for animal slurry pre treatment or post digestive treatment for reducing antibiotic residues these findings suggests that using mb as an environmentally friendly and commercial additive holds promise for reducing cvas and eradicating their negative impacts with safe digestate disposal to land applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords combined antibiotics modified bentonite antibiotics degradation microbial responses data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction veterinary antibiotics vas are manufactured from natural or synthetic processes and are widely used for therapeutic purposes and as growth promoters but their overuse has led to the contamination of swine manure and surrounding environments with antibiotic resistant genes arg 1 3 tetracyclines tcs fluoroquinolones fqs and sulfonamides sas are the most administered vas in swine farms due to their high activity and relatively low cost 4 these antibiotics are typically mixed with animal feed and excreted in high amounts in animal urine and feces due to their low digestibility in animal guts in ranging from 75 to 90 meanwhile tcs fqs and sas were detected frequently in swine manure by ranges from 0 2 to 183 446 0 2 to 1491 and 2 4 to 30 640 μg kg 1 respectively showing their subclasses such as otc tc norf and sdz as the highest residues concentrations 1 these excretions therefore cause a potential risk to both human and ecological health when they are exposed to the environment 5 anaerobic digestion ad process has been widely used to treat animal residues including swine manure due to its lower cost and energy consumption for removing recalcitrant pollutants 45 48 however ad process for removing vas and eradicating their negative impacts is considered non satisfactory 1 8 antibiotics such as oxytetracycline otc tetracycline tc can reduce methane production when exist at a concentration of 1024 mg l 1 by 36 and 39 respectively and negatively affect microbial richness 9 not only methane production tcs can mainly hinder the ability of hydrogenotrophic or acetoclastic methanogens to use total volatile fatty acids vfas rather than converting proteins and carbohydrates to vfas by hydrolytic fermentative bacteria resulting in methane inhibition 10 while otc concentrations between 20 and 200 mg l 1 have negatively affected microbial richness and vfa concentrations and resulting in 41 71 less in methane yield respectively 11 meanwhile ad ability to acclimatize on these raised impacts from individual antibiotics without negative effects on its performance would be possibly 12 however swine manure containing multi antibiotics represents a great challenge to ad ability to acclimatize 13 since multiple antibiotic residues can exist in the environment simultaneously the effects of a single drug cannot reflect the actual situation 49 50 50 therefore there is a gap of knowledge regarding the microbial response to the multi antibiotics during swine manure treatment practices moreover little is known about the impacts of antibiotics mixtures on ad process and their removal improvement that need considerable attention additionally ad process showed more difficulty in removing the antibiotic mixtures due to the generated antagonism effects and consequences on the process performance 5 7 14 combined veterinary antibiotics cvas might deteriorate the ability of ad for ch4 production 13 15 for instance combined otc tc norf and sdz caused a temporal inhibition to the acidogenic activity followed by partial inhibition to methanogenic by 66 8 and ch4 production declined by 70 as well as process instability i e volatile fatty acids vfas accumulation hindering cod removal ph instability and inhibiting microbial activity 13 combined otc tc and tylosin showed a negative impact on biogas production than their individual spikes 5 similarly ch4 production was worsened in the presence of combined otc and chlortetracycline 16 tang et al 4 reported that mixed antibiotics inhibited the process of methane production while single antibiotics could promote the conversion of propionic and butyric acid in contrast combined antibiotics such as florfenicol tylosin and tilmicosin had no negative impacts on biogas production 12 this contrary would increase the information deficit on the effects of antibiotic mixtures containing different antibiotic classes on ad s performance and consequences therefore further research is required to explore the impacts of combined antibiotics in ad process as well as developing the ad technology to tackle such challenges practical approaches for improving antibiotics removal during ad including enhancing microorganism activity were established in literature adding bentonite into ad reactors could stimulate the syntrophic metabolism between bacteria and methanogens and improve biogas production 17 18 bentonite is found to drowning much attention because of its constructional cations such as fe3 k na and al3 19 20 which could enrich the microbial activity against toxic compounds during ad overall bentonite has been widely used as an adsorbent agent for dyes 21 enhancing ch4 production and ad stability 22 23 and reducing antibiotics such as otc and their args accumulation in the soil 24 bentonite can adsorb antibiotics sufficiently from aqueous solution electrostatically depending on its large surface particles 25 previous studies reported that adding 5 g l 1 of bentonite had enhanced ch4 production by 56 8 and effectively mitigated the arg s abundance in biogas slurry by 80 8 19 20 wu et al 26 highlighted that 10 g l 1 of bentonite additives could refresh the ad process against inhibitors on the other hand thermal modification to bentonite mb has enhanced its characteristics and led to higher ch4 production than raw bentonite 27 however no reports have yet discussed the practicability of mb regulating ad of swine manure under combined antibiotics effects particularly from the angles of combined antibiotics degradation microbial responses their effects on ad process stability and cost analysis as an alternative choice for post treatment of digestate before land application in this study an effort was undertaken to rally the ad output in swine manure under the inhibitory effect of cvas the overall objectives of this study were as follows 1 determine the effect of mb on cvas tc otc sdz and norf removal efficiency during the ad process of swine manure 2 evaluate the effect of mb on process stability under cvas stress 3 reveal the changes in the microbial community structure under mb addition and cvas stress 4 and discuss the mb s cost analysis for scale up applications therefore this work would provide a practical basis for managing swine manure containing cvas during the ad technology helping to control the risk of cvas assessing the safe disposal of digestate utilization and reducing risks to the environment and human health by achieving these objectives the study aimed to contribute to the improvement of animal manure management practices and to promote the adoption of environmentally friendly technologies in the agriculture industry 2 material and methods 2 1 swine manure inoculum and mb preparation swine manure was used as a substrate in this study with no antibiotic treatment for three months beijing china the inoculum was obtained from a lab scale working ad reactor best lab china

in fig 1 the addition of mb to ad significantly p 0 05 improved cvas removal efficiency with an average of 91 4 for t3 compared to 86 4 72 7 and 61 5 for t2 t1 and t0 respectively within 30 days of ad

the first 2 days 80 1 70 12 53 9 and 6 6 of spiked tc migrated to sludge and within 30 days only 21 3 11 3 1 5 and 0 2 existed in sludge respectively for t0 t1 t2 and t3 these results showed that tc adsorbed fast to sludge within 2 days t0 and after that its desorption behavour was increased with time increases while accelerated with mb addition t1 t2 and t3 compared to t0 reactor t3 reactor has the highest removal performance of tc with the lowest tc residues in the sludge after 30 days of ad these results indicated that mb has enhanced the degradation of tc rather than adsorption into solids i e sludge or mb material however tc is known for its fast adsorption into sludge as can be seen with t0 also tc could be adsorbed into mb sufficiently this finding was confirmed by results in table s1 whereas tc was adsorbed into mb material by 70 7 74 1 and 74 6 for t1 t2 and t3 wang et al 19 20 reported that hydrogen bonding chances and ions exchange sites for tc a mass of oh nh2 cooh function groups with bentonite ions such as fe3 ca2 and na could be performed these bonds play a prominent role in the tc adsorption process into bentonite material therefore tc removal enhancement in the current study with mb additions could be due to the fact that mb additives are rich in fe3 ca2 and na ions these ions are essential to the microbial growth to enhance their activity and resistance against inhibitors thus probably consumed tc as a carbon source for its growth rather than sorbing it into mb surface these findings might suggest that safe environmental disposal of swine manure containing tc residues to the field can be accomplished using ad supplemented by mb additions however it can be seen that the residues of tc in the liquid fraction had no discernible trends with respect to time in all reactors this could be due to low tc degradation potential in liquid fraction 32 because of tc s unique chemical structure it may undergo abiotic degradation than biodegradation 6 33 similar finding was observed by kasumba et al 6 who reported that tc removal from liquid fraction of swine manure is relatively low otc concentration declined gradually in both fractions as mb addition doses increased as shown in fig 1b otc was removed by an average of 37 4 42 4 58 6 and 62 5 within 2 days respectively for t0 t1 t2 and t3 and by 73 3 79 7 88 7 and 91 9 respectively within 30 days mb addition significantly p 0 05 enhanced the ad ability for otc removal with 19 increase by t3 compared to control reactor t3 reactor achieved the highest otc removal efficiency with a slightly significant variance compared with t2 similarly to tc mb addition led to less otc residues in sludge with reductions of 15 5 9 01 and 6 7 respectively for t1 t2 and t3 compared to 22 1 by t0 within 30 days while otc residues in liquid fraction existed less compared to tc reflecting a high otc potential for degradation however otc can be adsorbed remarkably in mb by 71 65 with 10 g l 1 table s1 this means that otc removal from mb reactors was attributed to biodegradation mechanism rather than sorption into sludge or mb conversely no significant difference was observed between t0 and mb groups regarding sdz elimination within 2 days fig 1c however sdz concentration was declined by 71 9 70 2 72 2 and 83 1 respectively for t0 t1 t2 and t3 treatments within 30 days these results showed that no significant difference between 1 and 5 g l 1 mb on sdz removal than t0 reactor this may be due to the inability of sludge or bentonite material to adsorb sdz meanwhile sdz could be adsorbed by only 17 5 20 2 and 24 8 respectively for t1 t2 t3 table s1 this impaired adsorption capacity of sdz into sludge might be attributed to the amphoteric sdz s ability to preserve functional groups in the anionic form which makes its adsorption to sludge negligible 34 furthermore mb addition by 10 g l 1 t3 increased sdz removal by 10 9 this enhancement could be driven by enriched activity of sdz s degradation bacterial genes such as pseudomonas psychrophila section 3 3 these specific microorganisms may consume sdz as the sole carbon source and energy source and or via co metabolism 35 norf is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic which is known for its fast adsorption to sludge with low desorption performance is known for its fast adsorption to sludge with deficient desorption behaviour these features might negatively impact other co antibiotics removal efficiencies as reported by 13 within 2 days 80 of spiked norf was migrated to sludge with the t0 reactor fig 1d while within 30 days only 28 4 of spiked norf was removed and 60 remaining in sludge after 30 days this portion of norf remained in sludge is higher than that was observed for co antibiotics in the current study this residual norf may cause environmental pollution when the treated sludge is applied to agricultural fields interestingly when mb was added into ad reactors t1 t2 and t3 norf was removed by 94 6 91 3 and 6 3 respectively within 2 days and by 96 2 93 5 and 58 9 within 30 days fig 1d t1 reactor showed a gradual increase in norf removal with time increases while t2 and t3 showed no adsorption of norf into sludge with a small remains in liquid fraction after 30 days of ad however norf could be adsorbed into mb material by 83 8 85 9 and 84 6 respectively for t1 t2 and t3 reactors table s1 these results depicted that mb had enhanced the removal of norf rather than adsorption into sludge or even into mb this finding may indicate that introducing mb would eradicate the negative impact of fast norf adsorption on co antibiotics degradation previous reports that focused on examining the removal efficiency of multi pollutants such as combined antibiotics have shown that the mechanism for removing antibiotics during the anaerobic digestion ad process is reduced when antibiotics are mixed 5 13 15 36 individually the adsorption mechanism into solids can participate to remove 71 1 32 2 and 55 1 of administrated otc and tc sdz and norf respectively during ad process 1 however when these antibiotics were mixed in the current study their adsorption into solids was significantly decreased resulting in an average of 4 8 21 3 22 1 and 60 6 respectively for sdz tc otc and norf with t0 reactor fig 1e these results suggest that only norf s adsorption was enhanced while co antibiotics adsorption behaviour was declined similar finding was observed by gaballah et al 13 15 who reported that due to the fast adsorption of norf a considerable portion of the sludge s active sites is probably occupied resulting in low adsorption for co antibiotics this indicates that due to fast adsorption of norf into sludge an adsorption competition was generated when antibiotics existed as a mixture this adsorption competition might raise the un adsorbed antibiotics in the reactor putting stress on microorganisms activity this stress would be intolerable and deleteriously affect the ad performance to achieve overall lower cvas removal performance ad performance in removing individual antibiotics is around 73 as reviewed by 1 while 61 5 of the spiked cvas in the current study was removed within 30 days t0 reactor this relatively lower removal could be attributed to an antagonism effect induced by specific functional groups of each antibiotic affecting the electronegativity and thus influencing their interactions with the microbes leading to less removal efficiencies similar findings were observed when several antibiotics were combined according to 5 13 15 36 on the other hand the addition of 1 5 and 10 g l 1 of mb for t1 t2 and t3 reactors raised cvas removal by 11 2 24 9 and 29 9 respectively with less cvas remains in solid fraction as shown in fig 1e however the adsorption analysis of mb showed a high ability to adsorb tc otc and norf but was not able to adsorb sdz table s1 these results suggest that antibiotics with strong adsorption to solids i e norf might be degraded faster in the presence of mb than those with low adsorption i e sdz these findings indicate that mb promoted cvas degradation rather than adsorption into sludge this may confirm the role of mb in enhancing microbial activity against cvas inhibition impacts furthermore improvement of microbial activity could be due to the fast removal of norf that reached 96 2 with t3 compared to 28 4 with t0 therefore it is suggested that norf was the main reason for lower cvas removal in the current study particularly for t0 reactors in comparison with other additives biochar has enhanced tc removal by 24 3 158 2 wang et al 022 adding nano zero valent iron nanozvi slightly improved tc removal efficiency by 4 under tc initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 37 while adding 0 1 5 g l 1 fe3o4 to ad reactors raised tc removal efficiency by 40 4 3 compared to our study tc removal efficiency in the presence of co antibiotics was improved by 21 3 when 10 g l 1 mb was added additionally cvas degradation in this study could be driven by several pathways such as the breakdown of the parent compounds or by hydroxylation as had been observed for otc tc norf and sdz acetylation of the amino group like otc and sdz loss of n methyl group by demethylation of the dimethyl amino group at c4 position such as tc and cleavage of the piperazine ring nh forming carboxyl groups like sdz and norf 13 15 35 3 2 influences of mb on ad performance under cvas pressure 3 2 1 ch4 production as shown in fig 2 the cumulative ch4 production for all treatments was observed and statistically analysed the cumulative ch4 yield was affected negatively by cvas presence while mb addition mitigated this effect significantly p 0 05 in t0 50 mg l 1 cvas the ch4 production was delayed 9 days indicating an inhibition effect induced by cvas fig 3a the cumulative ch4 production with t0 within 30 days was 150 5 ch4 g vs against 204 10 ml ch4 g 1 vs with the control reactors compared to the control digesters t0 decreased ch4 production by 27 comparatively mb addition revealed a positive effect on ch4 production in the presence of cvas the cumulative ch4 production potential overcame the inhibition whereas the inhibition ratio decreased from 27 1 t0 to 16 7 9 3 and 1 7 respectively with t1 1 g l mb t2 5 g l mb and t3 10 g l mb in mb groups the cumulative ch4 production was enhanced to be 170 6 185 2 and 202 3 ml ch4 g 1 vs within 30 days respectively for t1 t2 and t3 fig 2b shows that the ch4 content was generated directly for control and t3 while it was delayed 2 8 and 9 days for t2 t1 and t0 respectively these results indicated that cvas caused an inhibition to the ch4 production process cvas showed an exacerbated inhabitation effects on ch4 production as reported by 13 by 73 and 76 as reported by 5 however in the current study adding 10 g l 1 mb eradicated this inhibitory effect sufficiently this finding means that mb could help microorganisms resist antibiotic stress and degrade the organic matter this may confirm the relationship between cvas removal and methane production enhancement these results were agreed with zhao et al 23 who observed an enhancement in ch4 production using bentonite material against inhibitor effects daily ch4 kept producing until the end of all treatments except t0 and t1 on day 16 control treatment had the highest average ch4 content 67 6 while t3 had the lowest 47 7 fig 2c bentonite was thermally treated in this study providing larger pores due to the loss of inter layered water molecules this could afford more active sites for microbial activity and adsorption capacity 19 20 ma et al 27 observed that mb released more ca2 and mg2 during the ad process than natural bentonite which significantly supported methanogenesis activity besides the added mb can influence the microbial and enzymatic transformations of feed substrates that result in improving methane production 27 moreover bentonite has the ability to provide methanogenic populations and feed stock with the high capacity immobilisation that cause an in close contact with each other this enhancement can play an essential role in eradicating the combined antibiotics antagonistic effect notably cvas exposure resulted in partial inhibition of ch4 production that extended to 9 days however 10 g l 1 of mb was enough to mitigate this severe effect this mitigation effect on ch4 production was consistent with the cvas removal performance reported in previous section comparatively bentonite at 5 g l 1 exhibited lower ch4 production than 3 g l 1 as reported by wang et al 19 20 in the absence of antibiotics this was due to the high concentration of bentonite consuming a large amount of vfa through ion exchange negatively affecting ch4 production however this phenomenon was not observed in the current study this could be because mb was enrolled to face the exacerbated effects of cvas rather than consuming vfas these findings indicated that ad might consume much mb in terms of antibiotics existence therefore 10 g l 1 of mb could be added to ad reactors to eradicate any inhibitory effects caused by combined antibiotics in swine manure during the anaerobic digestion of batch reactors furthermore mb can be used in continuous reactors for long term but mb needs to be kept in bags as suggested in section 3 4 for economic benefits 3 2 2 the process stability ph vfas degradation and cod antibiotics in combined conditions could cause aggravated impacts on ad steadily including ph vfas and cod removal of swine manure fig 3 exhibited the effects of high cvas levels on the digestate properties such as the ph vfa and cod during ad and associated mb regulating performances as can be shown in fig 3a ph values were dropped in all digesters after 2 days of ad run ph values for control treatment were slightly increased to the end while it declined sharply with t0 and slightly with t1 t2 and t3 within 30 days the ph of the control reactor was the highest at 7 4 while the ph of t0 was the lowest at 6 7 mb additions showed a significant change in ph values by 7 03 7 12 and 7 1 respectively for t1 t2 and t3 within 30 days li et al 38 reported that ph reduction in the ad process could be due to organic acid accumulation induced by the failure of methanogens to convert the organics to ch4 in the current study the main reason of ph reduction is organic acid accumulation that caused by cvas as can be seen in reactor t0 compared to the control reactor while high removal of cvas induced mb additions resulted in an enhancement in ph values of t1 t2 and t3 was observed compared to t0 because mb can speed up the conversion of vfas to methane 27 mb improved the ad performance stability also the highly efficient of mb in adsorption or degradation of hazardous material such as antibiotics help in buffering the ph of the reactor through h solute ion exchanging with na 2 and ca 2 cations of mb and creating a suitable environment for microbes to grow and multiply 2 19 20 24 39 40 however with the highest mb concentration t3 ph values are still lower than in the control treatment this means that mb additives are still insufficient to achieve full recovery from cvas impacts which depict the strong effect of cvas on ad process as illustrated in fig 3b vfas content in reactors was observed periodically to provide more details about the effects of cvas and mb additives regulation on the ad of swine manure interestingly the effluent vfas concentrations with t0 were increased and found to be higher than both the control and mb groups which is consistent with effluent cod fig 3c with the operation of the reactors a similar performance was observed for all groups within the first 7 days suggesting a negligible influence of cvas on hydrolysis activity of organics after then vfas concentration increased rapidly with t0 within 30 days recording 2 86 g l 1 out of the initial concentration of 2 55 g l 1 while control t1 t2 and t3 recorded 0 3 1 1 1 1 and 0 9 g l 1 respectively this accumulation of vfas could be due to the disability of methanogens to convert the organics intermediates to ch4 these results could explain the low methane production with t0 reactor while mb reactors showed an stability for vfas conversion this is consistent with cumulative ch4 production fig 2 a this implies that ch4 fermentation inhibition was eliminated in the presence of mb according to fig 3d concentrations of cod declined sharply with the control treatment by 31 4 against a slight decrease by 16 0 20 8 12 4 and 3 3 within 2 days respectively for t0 and mb treatments t1 t2 and t3 and by 22 2 32 4 42 9 and 47 4 within 30 days against 54 9 with control treatment these results indicated the lowest reduction of cod owned to t0 while a close performance was recorded between t3 and control reactors within 30 days furthermore cvas exhibited 72 79 less cod removal within 30 days by t0 this inhibition was declined significantly p 0 05 when mb added to reactors reaching 50 2 26 7 and 16 9 respectively with t1 t2 and t3 these results indicated that t3 10 g bentonite l 1 showed a better performance among other mb treatments for removing cod within 30 days of ad this removal enhancement might be mainly due to removing cvas inhibitory impact that provided better hydrolysis performance to the ad process 3 3 microbial community changes fig 4 shows the differences in microbial activity i e bacterial and archaeal communities that were retrieved on days 0 7 12 and 30 marked as initial control 7d t0 7d t1 7d t 7d t3 7d etc each group s microbial community at the phylum level and genes level was illustrated in fig 4 a b according to fig 4a firmicutes proteobacteria and unclassified bacteria were the dominant phylum in each reactor accounting for 90 2 of relative abundances in the initial group at the same time the bacterial communities at the genus level showed a dominance of unclassified bacteria clostridium ochrobactrum lactobacillus unclassified bacteroidetes and romboutsis total abundance was 42 7 22 9 4 1 3 8 and 2 8 in the initial samples respectively fig 4 b when 50 mg l 1 cvas were added t0 the relative abundance of firmicutes phylum and its relative genus clostridia decreased significantly p 0 05 from 35 6 initial sample to 16 5 within the first 7 days and illustrated the lowest relative abundance among other groups within 30 days this may indicate the negative impact of cvas on firmicutes activity firmicutes phylum and its clostridia genus are illustrated as a dominant bacterial group in the reactors they are mainly responsible for hydrolyzing proteins fats sugars and amino acids by secreting various enzymes 41 however firmicutes activity showed the potential weakness to resist cvas toxicity consequently firmicutes activity paired with t0 can explain the relative reduction in ts removal vfas accumulation and other effects on ad process interestingly firmicutes activity was significantly improved when mb was added to digesters this finding was consistent with 2 who observed an increasing trend in the firmicutes phylum when bc was added zhao et al 23 reported an increase in firmicutes activity after adding bentonite lactobacillus was another genus belonging to phylum firmicutes a genus of gram positive bacteria its relative abundance increased in the first 7 days with t2 and t3 while declining sharply for other reactors lactobacillus is known for its resistance to antibiotics pressure as reported by 42 this resistance was enriched when mb was added this finding may depict that cvas negatively impact the genus abundance however mb improved its abundance moreover the romboutsis genus also belongs to the firmicutes phylum and its relative abundance fluctuated over the 30 days by ad whereas it decreased within 7 days for all treatments except t1 3 86 and increased with control 5 5 and t3 3 7 within 12 days while its abundance was increased only with t1 4 6 within 30 days similarly the proteobacteria phylum relative s abundance was the lowest with t0 compared to other groups suggesting the negative impact of cvas proteobacteria bacteria phylum plays an important metabolic function in the ad process regarding utilizing glucose propionate butyrate and other small intermediate compounds 23 this phylum activity has enriched significantly with mb addition moreover ochrobactrum is another dominant genus belonging to the brucellaceae family a genus of gram negative organisms their abundance increased when mb addition rose its relative abundance was decreased to 5 3 4 4 5 3 and 7 7 respectively to control t0 t1 and t2 against an increase with t3 to 10 9 within 7 days and then decreased for all treatments within 30 days interestingly the phylum bacteroidetes is one of the three large classes of gram negative bacteria this phylum has a vital role in producing nh3 and promoting the conversion of vfas to acetate through depredating proteins in the substrate 43 this might afford material for methanosarcina and methanosaeta to metabolize and produce ch4 19 20 however adding mb had no obvious influence on bacteroidetes abundance over the digestion period in the current study the archaeal community for both phylum and genus in each group was depicted in fig 4 c and d from this figure unclassified archaea with an abundance of 91 1 in the initial substrate was the dominant taxa followed by euryachaeota phylum fig 4 c and methanothermobacter genus fig 4d cvas pressure and the mb regulation remarkably influenced this dominant phylum and genus succession unclassified archaea decreased with control t0 and t1 while increased to 99 1 and 98 6 respectively with t2 and t3 within 7 days while within 30 days unclassified archaea abundance was dropped with t1 37 6 against t0 t2 and t3 88 91 56 7 74 7 and 91 8 compared to control respectively euryarchaeota phylum abundance was not different than initial 8 5 within the first 7 days for control t0 and t1 however it s abundance declined sharply this decline in t2 and t3 reactors could be due to buffering capacity of mb interestingly euryarchaeota abundance increased slightly when time increased while it jumped for all treatments except the control reactor within 30 days euryarchaeota are a highly diverse phylum and include methanogens which produce methane by using acetate h2 co2 and methylated one carbon compounds as substrates 23 thus its abundance increasing for t0 t1 and t2 in the last period of the ad run may explain the methane production recovery as shown in fig 2a these results may indicate the impact of mb to enhance this phylum activity under high cvas pressure on the other hand methanothermobacter genus represents 6 3 of the total archaeal community abundance which belongs to methanobacteriaceae family that is responsible for using carbon dioxide and hydrogen as substrates to produce ch4 its abundance fluctuated at all treatments by ad within 30 days its abundance increased sharply by t0 33 7 t1 44 4 and t2 18 8 compared to declining with control 2 7 and t3 5 1 methanobrevibacter another genus of methanobacteriaceae family was found with 2 1 in the initial substrate no change would be observed in its abundance within 7 days while it declined within 12 days before it increased to 10 1 with t1 and 0 9 8 5 4 5 and 2 6 respectively to control t0 t2 and t3 within 30 days notably after adding mb into reactors particularly t2 and t3 methanothermobacter and methanobrevibacter genes tended by extinct due to mb s buffer capacity this finding was in agreement with 23 in this study mb accelerated swine manure degradation into small molecular organics that promoted the growth of methanogens and increased its resistance against the cvas inhibitory effect 3 4 ad system scale up model combined with mb application to treat manure with cvas the current study s results show that adding mb 10 g l 1 has successfully reduced cvas by 90 with very low residuals in the solid fraction however scale up and economic assessment are still important to predict and adjust the mb application in a continuous scale reactor as suggested in this study 5 10 kg m3 of mb is recommended for batch swine manure treatment in this scale up model the application of mb was designed for a continuous digester application assuming a 1 m3 digester volume as shown in fig 5 non degradable bags with a mesh size smaller than mb particle size is suggested to increase the retention time of the bm during the operation of a reactor as soon as a batch of manure with cvas is introduced to the digester however these bags need to be examined practically assuming 10 of the total mb weight could be lost from bags for each ad hrt due to microbial consumption activity or leakage which means each hrt would consume 0 5 1 0 kg of mb per 1 m3 the cost of mb is 7 2 per kg mb beijing yixiubo paleontology technology co ltd as a result the cost of bm required to eliminate the negative effects of cvas and ensure safe digestate disposal as field fertilizer would be 3 6 7 2 per 1 m3 of swine manure the estimated cost does not take into consideration the thermal modification of bentonite in many countries additional treatment of digestate is regulated ec no 1069 2009 and requires that animal wastes should be treated with pasteurization 1 h at 70 c prior to the ad process 44 which may cost 7 53 15 2 per m3 of raw sludge as reported by 45 this cost is 111 higher compared to mb treatment 3 6 7 2 per m3 this means that the mb addition cost would be lower than reported for animal manure pre treatment or post digestive treatment for reducing antibiotic residues this finding indicates that mb could be used as an economical alternative to guarantee anaerobic digestion stability against cvas impacts and a secure digestate as a fertilizer also the increase in biogas production 27 increase compared without mb when mb is used for treating manure with cvas could be used to offset part of the mb cost 4 conclusions combined antibiotics from different antibiotics classes could cause exacerbated impact on ad beyond that this study sheds light on the influence of mb on ad performance under high cvas pressure and evaluates its potential as a practical solution adding 10 g l 1 of mb into ad reactors enhanced the cvas removal by 30 attributed to promoting biodegradation and reducing adsorption competition among antibiotics mb addition made the biodegradation removal mechanism a dominant rather than adsorption nevertheless mb addition maintained the methanogenic stability and enhanced its performance against cvas inhibition impacts cvas 50 mg l 1 exhibited 27 less in methane production while 10 g l 1 of mb showed a reduction by only 1 7 vfas conversion was partially inhibited while it significantly recovered when mb added overall ad process stability was significantly enhanced with mb addition mb was proven an economical alternative compared to animal manure pre treatment or post digestive treatment for eliminating cvas impacts the findings in this study could introduce the mb as a promising choice for eradicating cvas and their impacts on enhancing ad performance stability in wide

12436,this study investigated the potential of modified bentonite mb material in mitigating the negative effects of combined veterinary antibiotics cvas on anaerobic digestion ad process treating swine manure four cvas i e oxytetracycline otc tetracycline tc norfloxacin norf and sulfadiazine sdz were selected as they are most frequently detected in swine manure and anaerobically incubated for 30 days under mesophilic conditions 37 c and with addition of different mb weights 1 5 and 10 g l 1 results showed that 1 5 and 10 g l 1 of mb enhanced the removal of cvas from 61 5 no mb addition to 72 7 86 4 and 91 4 respectively cvas removal was accredited to biodegradation rather than adsorption to mb norf was rapidly transferred to solids causing an adsorption competition and decreasing co antibiotics removal while it was fast removed when mb was added when 10 g l 1 of mb were added the cvas adsorption competition diminished and their inhibition on ch4 production decreased from 27 to 1 7 mb addition lowered the impact of cvas significantly by maintaining ph stability enhanced cod removal decreased the vfas accumulation and improved the activity of bacteria and archaeal communities the cost analysis showed that mb additions to ad would reduce cost by 52 than applied methods for animal slurry pre treatment or post digestive treatment for reducing antibiotic residues these findings suggests that using mb as an environmentally friendly and commercial additive holds promise for reducing cvas and eradicating their negative impacts with safe digestate disposal to land applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords combined antibiotics modified bentonite antibiotics degradation microbial responses data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction veterinary antibiotics vas are manufactured from natural or synthetic processes and are widely used for therapeutic purposes and as growth promoters but their overuse has led to the contamination of swine manure and surrounding environments with antibiotic resistant genes arg 1 3 tetracyclines tcs fluoroquinolones fqs and sulfonamides sas are the most administered vas in swine farms due to their high activity and relatively low cost 4 these antibiotics are typically mixed with animal feed and excreted in high amounts in animal urine and feces due to their low digestibility in animal guts in ranging from 75 to 90 meanwhile tcs fqs and sas were detected frequently in swine manure by ranges from 0 2 to 183 446 0 2 to 1491 and 2 4 to 30 640 μg kg 1 respectively showing their subclasses such as otc tc norf and sdz as the highest residues concentrations 1 these excretions therefore cause a potential risk to both human and ecological health when they are exposed to the environment 5 anaerobic digestion ad process has been widely used to treat animal residues including swine manure due to its lower cost and energy consumption for removing recalcitrant pollutants 45 48 however ad process for removing vas and eradicating their negative impacts is considered non satisfactory 1 8 antibiotics such as oxytetracycline otc tetracycline tc can reduce methane production when exist at a concentration of 1024 mg l 1 by 36 and 39 respectively and negatively affect microbial richness 9 not only methane production tcs can mainly hinder the ability of hydrogenotrophic or acetoclastic methanogens to use total volatile fatty acids vfas rather than converting proteins and carbohydrates to vfas by hydrolytic fermentative bacteria resulting in methane inhibition 10 while otc concentrations between 20 and 200 mg l 1 have negatively affected microbial richness and vfa concentrations and resulting in 41 71 less in methane yield respectively 11 meanwhile ad ability to acclimatize on these raised impacts from individual antibiotics without negative effects on its performance would be possibly 12 however swine manure containing multi antibiotics represents a great challenge to ad ability to acclimatize 13 since multiple antibiotic residues can exist in the environment simultaneously the effects of a single drug cannot reflect the actual situation 49 50 50 therefore there is a gap of knowledge regarding the microbial response to the multi antibiotics during swine manure treatment practices moreover little is known about the impacts of antibiotics mixtures on ad process and their removal improvement that need considerable attention additionally ad process showed more difficulty in removing the antibiotic mixtures due to the generated antagonism effects and consequences on the process performance 5 7 14 combined veterinary antibiotics cvas might deteriorate the ability of ad for ch4 production 13 15 for instance combined otc tc norf and sdz caused a temporal inhibition to the acidogenic activity followed by partial inhibition to methanogenic by 66 8 and ch4 production declined by 70 as well as process instability i e volatile fatty acids vfas accumulation hindering cod removal ph instability and inhibiting microbial activity 13 combined otc tc and tylosin showed a negative impact on biogas production than their individual spikes 5 similarly ch4 production was worsened in the presence of combined otc and chlortetracycline 16 tang et al 4 reported that mixed antibiotics inhibited the process of methane production while single antibiotics could promote the conversion of propionic and butyric acid in contrast combined antibiotics such as florfenicol tylosin and tilmicosin had no negative impacts on biogas production 12 this contrary would increase the information deficit on the effects of antibiotic mixtures containing different antibiotic classes on ad s performance and consequences therefore further research is required to explore the impacts of combined antibiotics in ad process as well as developing the ad technology to tackle such challenges practical approaches for improving antibiotics removal during ad including enhancing microorganism activity were established in literature adding bentonite into ad reactors could stimulate the syntrophic metabolism between bacteria and methanogens and improve biogas production 17 18 bentonite is found to drowning much attention because of its constructional cations such as fe3 k na and al3 19 20 which could enrich the microbial activity against toxic compounds during ad overall bentonite has been widely used as an adsorbent agent for dyes 21 enhancing ch4 production and ad stability 22 23 and reducing antibiotics such as otc and their args accumulation in the soil 24 bentonite can adsorb antibiotics sufficiently from aqueous solution electrostatically depending on its large surface particles 25 previous studies reported that adding 5 g l 1 of bentonite had enhanced ch4 production by 56 8 and effectively mitigated the arg s abundance in biogas slurry by 80 8 19 20 wu et al 26 highlighted that 10 g l 1 of bentonite additives could refresh the ad process against inhibitors on the other hand thermal modification to bentonite mb has enhanced its characteristics and led to higher ch4 production than raw bentonite 27 however no reports have yet discussed the practicability of mb regulating ad of swine manure under combined antibiotics effects particularly from the angles of combined antibiotics degradation microbial responses their effects on ad process stability and cost analysis as an alternative choice for post treatment of digestate before land application in this study an effort was undertaken to rally the ad output in swine manure under the inhibitory effect of cvas the overall objectives of this study were as follows 1 determine the effect of mb on cvas tc otc sdz and norf removal efficiency during

spss inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 cvas removal during ad process in this study the ability of mb to enhance the removal efficiencies of combined otc tc norf and sdz was investigated as shown in fig 1 the addition of mb to ad significantly p 0 05 improved cvas removal efficiency with an average of 91 4 for t3 compared to 86 4 72 7 and 61 5 for t2 t1 and t0 respectively within 30 days of ad fig 1a tc could be removed by an average of 9 5 18 7 40 1 and 74 6 within the first 2 days with t0 t1 t2 and t3 reactors respectively and by 72 7 80 5 93 4 and 94 respectively within 30 days of ad mb addition affected tc removal efficiency significantly p 0 05 whereas adding 5 g l 1 t2 and 10 g l 1 t3 of mb increased tc removal by 20 compared to the control reactor no mb additions meanwhile within the first 2 days 80 1 70 12 53 9 and 6 6 of spiked tc migrated to sludge and within 30 days only 21 3 11 3 1 5 and 0 2 existed in sludge respectively for t0 t1 t2 and t3 these results showed that tc adsorbed fast to sludge within 2 days t0 and after that its desorption behavour was increased with time increases while accelerated with mb addition t1 t2 and t3 compared to t0 reactor t3 reactor has the highest removal performance of tc with the lowest tc residues in the sludge after 30 days of ad these results indicated that mb has enhanced the degradation of tc rather than adsorption into solids i e sludge or mb material however tc is known for its fast adsorption into sludge as can be seen with t0 also tc could be adsorbed into mb sufficiently this finding was confirmed by results in table s1 whereas tc was adsorbed into mb material by 70 7 74 1 and 74 6 for t1 t2 and t3 wang et al 19 20 reported that hydrogen bonding chances and ions exchange sites for tc a mass of oh nh2 cooh function groups with bentonite ions such as fe3 ca2 and na could be performed these bonds play a prominent role in the tc adsorption process into bentonite material therefore tc removal enhancement in the current study with mb additions could be due to the fact that mb additives are rich in fe3 ca2 and na ions these ions are essential to the microbial growth to enhance their activity and resistance against inhibitors thus probably consumed tc as a carbon source for its growth rather than sorbing it into mb surface these findings might suggest that safe environmental disposal of swine manure containing tc residues to the field can be accomplished using ad supplemented by mb additions however it can be seen that the residues of tc in the liquid fraction had no discernible trends with respect to time in all reactors this could be due to low tc degradation potential in liquid fraction 32 because of tc s unique chemical structure it may undergo abiotic degradation than biodegradation 6 33 similar finding was observed by kasumba et al 6 who reported that tc removal from liquid fraction of swine manure is relatively low otc concentration declined gradually in both fractions as mb addition doses increased as shown in fig 1b otc was removed by an average of 37 4 42 4 58 6 and 62 5 within 2 days respectively for t0 t1 t2 and t3 and by 73 3 79 7 88 7 and 91 9 respectively within 30 days mb addition significantly p 0 05 enhanced the ad ability for otc removal with 19 increase by t3 compared to control reactor t3 reactor achieved the highest otc removal efficiency with a slightly significant variance compared with t2 similarly to tc mb addition led to less otc residues in sludge with reductions of 15 5 9 01 and 6 7 respectively for t1 t2 and t3 compared to 22 1 by t0 within 30 days while otc residues in liquid fraction existed less compared to tc reflecting a high otc potential for degradation however otc can be adsorbed remarkably in mb by 71 65 with 10 g l 1 table s1 this means that otc removal from mb reactors was attributed to biodegradation mechanism rather than sorption into sludge or mb conversely no significant difference was observed between t0 and mb groups regarding sdz elimination within 2 days fig 1c however sdz concentration was declined by 71 9 70 2 72 2 and 83 1 respectively for t0 t1 t2 and t3 treatments within 30 days these results showed that no significant difference between 1 and 5 g l 1 mb on sdz removal than t0 reactor this may be due to the inability of sludge or bentonite material to adsorb sdz meanwhile sdz could be adsorbed by only 17 5 20 2 and 24 8 respectively for t1 t2 t3 table s1 this impaired adsorption capacity of sdz into sludge might be attributed to the amphoteric sdz s ability to preserve functional groups in the anionic form which makes its adsorption to sludge negligible 34 furthermore mb addition by 10 g l 1 t3 increased sdz removal by 10 9 this enhancement could be driven by enriched activity of sdz s degradation bacterial genes such as pseudomonas psychrophila section 3 3 these specific microorganisms may consume sdz as the sole carbon source and energy source and or via co metabolism 35 norf is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic which is known for its fast adsorption to sludge with low desorption performance is known for its fast adsorption to sludge with deficient desorption behaviour these features might negatively impact other co antibiotics removal efficiencies as reported by 13 within 2 days 80 of spiked norf was migrated to sludge with the t0 reactor fig 1d while within 30 days only 28 4 of spiked norf was removed and 60 remaining in sludge after 30 days this portion of norf remained in sludge is higher than that was observed for co antibiotics in the current study this residual norf may cause environmental pollution when the treated sludge is applied to agricultural fields interestingly when mb was added into ad reactors t1 t2 and t3 norf was removed by 94 6 91 3 and 6 3 respectively within 2 days and by 96 2 93 5 and 58 9 within 30 days fig 1d t1 reactor showed a gradual increase in norf removal with time increases while t2 and t3 showed no adsorption of norf into sludge with a small remains in liquid fraction after 30 days of ad however norf could be adsorbed into mb material by 83 8 85 9 and 84 6 respectively for t1 t2 and t3 reactors table s1 these results depicted that mb had enhanced the removal of norf rather than adsorption into sludge or even into mb this finding may indicate that introducing mb would eradicate the negative impact of fast norf adsorption on co antibiotics degradation previous reports that focused on examining the removal efficiency of multi pollutants such as combined antibiotics have shown that the mechanism for removing antibiotics during the anaerobic digestion ad process is reduced when antibiotics are mixed 5 13 15 36 individually the adsorption mechanism into solids can participate to remove 71 1 32 2 and 55 1 of administrated otc and tc sdz and norf respectively during ad process 1 however when these antibiotics were mixed in the current study their adsorption into solids was significantly decreased resulting in an average of 4 8 21 3 22 1 and 60 6 respectively for sdz tc otc and norf with t0 reactor fig 1e these results suggest that only norf s adsorption was enhanced while co antibiotics adsorption behaviour was declined similar finding was observed by gaballah et al 13 15 who reported that due to the fast adsorption of norf a considerable portion of the sludge s active sites is probably occupied resulting in low adsorption for co antibiotics this indicates that due to fast adsorption of norf into sludge an adsorption competition was generated when antibiotics existed as a mixture this adsorption competition might raise the un adsorbed antibiotics in the reactor putting stress on microorganisms activity this stress would be intolerable and deleteriously affect the ad performance to achieve overall lower cvas removal performance ad performance in removing individual antibiotics is around 73 as reviewed by 1 while 61 5 of the spiked cvas in the current study was removed within 30 days t0 reactor this relatively lower removal could be attributed to an antagonism effect induced by specific functional groups of each antibiotic affecting the electronegativity and thus influencing their interactions with the microbes leading to less removal efficiencies similar findings were observed when several antibiotics were combined according to 5 13 15 36 on the other hand the addition of 1 5 and 10 g l 1 of mb for t1 t2 and t3 reactors raised cvas removal by 11 2 24 9 and 29 9 respectively with less cvas remains in solid fraction as shown in fig 1e however the adsorption analysis of mb showed a high ability to adsorb tc otc and norf but was not able to adsorb sdz table s1 these results suggest that antibiotics with strong adsorption to solids i e norf might be degraded faster in the presence of mb than those with low adsorption i e sdz these findings indicate that mb promoted cvas degradation rather than adsorption into sludge this may confirm the role of mb in enhancing microbial activity against cvas inhibition impacts furthermore improvement of microbial activity could be due to the fast removal of norf that reached 96 2 with t3 compared to 28 4 with t0 therefore it is suggested that norf was the main reason for lower cvas removal in the current study particularly for t0 reactors in comparison with other additives biochar has enhanced tc removal by 24 3 158 2 wang et al 022 adding nano zero valent iron nanozvi slightly improved tc removal efficiency by 4 under tc initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 37 while adding 0 1 5 g l 1 fe3o4 to ad reactors raised tc removal efficiency by 40 4 3 compared to our study tc removal efficiency in the presence of co antibiotics was improved by 21 3 when 10 g l 1 mb was added additionally cvas degradation in this study could be driven by several pathways such as the breakdown of the parent compounds or by hydroxylation as had been observed for otc tc norf and sdz acetylation of the amino group like otc and sdz loss of n methyl group by demethylation of the dimethyl amino group at c4 position such as tc and cleavage of the piperazine ring nh forming carboxyl groups like sdz and norf 13 15 35 3 2 influences of mb on ad performance under cvas pressure 3 2 1 ch4 production as shown in fig 2 the cumulative ch4 production for all treatments was observed and statistically analysed the cumulative ch4 yield was affected negatively by cvas presence while mb addition mitigated this effect significantly p 0 05 in t0 50 mg l 1 cvas the ch4 production was delayed 9 days indicating an inhibition effect induced by cvas fig 3a the cumulative ch4 production with t0 within 30 days was 150 5 ch4 g vs against 204 10 ml ch4 g 1 vs with the control reactors compared to the control digesters t0 decreased ch4 production by 27 comparatively mb addition revealed a positive effect on ch4 production in the presence of cvas the cumulative ch4 production potential overcame the inhibition whereas the inhibition ratio decreased from 27 1 t0 to 16 7 9 3 and 1 7 respectively with t1 1 g l mb t2 5 g l mb and t3 10 g l mb in mb groups the cumulative ch4 production was enhanced to be 170 6 185 2 and 202 3 ml ch4 g 1 vs within 30 days respectively for t1 t2 and t3 fig 2b shows that the ch4 content was generated directly for control and t3 while it was delayed 2 8 and 9 days for t2 t1 and t0 respectively these results indicated that cvas caused an inhibition to the ch4 production process cvas showed an exacerbated inhabitation effects on ch4 production as reported by 13 by 73 and 76 as reported by 5 however in the current study adding 10 g l 1 mb eradicated this inhibitory effect sufficiently this finding means that mb could help microorganisms resist antibiotic stress and degrade the organic matter this may confirm the relationship between cvas removal and methane production enhancement these results were agreed with zhao et al 23 who observed an enhancement in ch4 production using bentonite material against inhibitor effects daily ch4 kept producing until the end of all treatments except t0 and t1 on day 16 control treatment had the highest average ch4 content 67 6 while t3 had the lowest 47 7 fig 2c bentonite was thermally treated in this study providing larger pores due to the loss of inter layered water molecules this could afford more active sites for microbial activity and adsorption capacity 19 20 ma et al 27 observed that mb released more ca2 and mg2 during the ad process than natural bentonite which significantly supported methanogenesis activity besides the added mb can influence the microbial and enzymatic transformations of feed substrates that result in improving methane production 27 moreover bentonite has the ability to provide methanogenic populations and feed stock with the high capacity immobilisation that cause an in close contact with each other this enhancement can play an essential role in eradicating the combined antibiotics antagonistic effect notably cvas exposure resulted in partial inhibition of ch4 production that extended to 9 days however 10 g l 1 of mb was enough to mitigate this severe effect this mitigation effect on ch4 production was consistent with the cvas removal performance reported in previous section comparatively bentonite at 5 g l 1 exhibited lower ch4 production than 3 g l 1 as reported by wang et al 19 20 in the absence of antibiotics this was due to the high concentration of bentonite consuming a large amount of vfa through ion exchange negatively affecting ch4 production however this phenomenon was not observed in the current study this could be because mb was enrolled to face the exacerbated effects of cvas rather than consuming vfas these findings indicated that ad might consume much mb in terms of antibiotics existence therefore 10 g l 1 of mb could be added to ad reactors to eradicate any inhibitory effects caused by combined antibiotics in swine manure during the anaerobic digestion of batch reactors furthermore mb can be used in continuous reactors for long term but mb needs to be kept in bags as suggested in section 3 4 for economic benefits 3 2 2 the process stability ph vfas degradation and cod antibiotics in combined conditions could cause aggravated impacts on ad steadily including ph vfas and cod removal of swine manure fig 3 exhibited the effects of high cvas levels on the digestate properties such as the ph vfa and cod during ad and associated mb regulating performances as can be shown in fig 3a ph values were dropped in all digesters after 2 days of ad run ph values for control treatment were slightly increased to the end while it declined sharply with t0 and slightly with t1 t2 and t3 within 30 days the ph of the control reactor was the highest at 7 4 while the ph of t0 was the lowest at 6 7 mb additions showed a significant change in ph values by 7 03 7 12 and 7 1 respectively for t1 t2 and t3 within 30 days li et al 38 reported that ph reduction in the ad process could be due to organic acid accumulation induced by the failure of methanogens to convert the organics to ch4 in the current study the main reason of ph reduction is organic acid accumulation that caused by cvas as can be seen in reactor t0 compared to the control reactor while high removal of cvas induced mb additions resulted in an enhancement in ph values of t1 t2 and t3 was observed compared to t0 because mb can speed up the conversion of vfas to methane 27 mb improved the ad performance stability also the highly efficient of mb in adsorption or degradation of hazardous material such as antibiotics help in buffering the ph of the reactor through h solute ion exchanging with na 2 and ca 2 cations of mb and creating a suitable environment for microbes to grow and multiply 2 19 20 24 39 40 however with the highest mb concentration t3 ph values are still lower than in the control treatment this means that mb additives are still insufficient to achieve full recovery from cvas impacts which depict the strong effect of cvas on ad process as illustrated in fig 3b vfas content in reactors was observed periodically to provide more details about the effects of cvas and mb additives regulation on the ad of swine manure interestingly the effluent vfas concentrations with t0 were increased and found to be higher than both the control and mb groups which is consistent with effluent cod fig 3c with the operation of the reactors a similar performance was observed for all groups within the first 7 days suggesting a negligible influence of cvas on hydrolysis activity of organics after then vfas concentration increased rapidly with t0 within 30 days recording 2 86 g l 1 out of the initial concentration of 2 55 g l 1 while control t1 t2 and t3 recorded 0 3 1 1 1 1 and 0 9 g l 1 respectively this accumulation of vfas could be due to the disability of methanogens to convert the organics intermediates to ch4 these results could explain the low methane production with t0 reactor while mb reactors showed an stability for vfas conversion this is consistent with cumulative ch4 production fig 2 a this implies that ch4 fermentation inhibition was eliminated in the presence of mb according to fig 3d concentrations of cod declined sharply with the control treatment by 31 4 against a slight decrease by 16 0 20 8 12 4 and 3 3 within 2 days respectively for t0 and mb treatments t1 t2 and t3 and by 22 2 32 4 42 9 and 47 4 within 30 days against 54 9 with control treatment these results indicated the lowest reduction of cod owned to t0 while a close performance was recorded between t3 and control reactors within 30 days furthermore cvas exhibited 72 79 less cod removal within 30 days by t0 this inhibition was declined significantly p 0 05 when mb added to reactors reaching 50 2 26 7 and 16 9 respectively with t1 t2 and t3 these results indicated that t3 10 g bentonite l 1 showed a better performance among other mb treatments for removing cod within 30 days of ad this removal enhancement might be mainly due to removing cvas inhibitory impact that provided better hydrolysis performance to the ad process 3 3 microbial community changes fig 4 shows the differences in microbial activity i e bacterial and archaeal communities that were retrieved on days 0 7 12 and 30 marked as initial control 7d t0 7d t1 7d t 7d t3 7d etc each group s microbial community at the phylum level and genes level was illustrated in fig 4 a b according to fig 4a firmicutes proteobacteria and unclassified bacteria were the dominant phylum in each reactor accounting for 90 2 of relative abundances in the initial group at the same time the bacterial communities at the genus level showed a dominance of unclassified bacteria clostridium ochrobactrum lactobacillus unclassified bacteroidetes and romboutsis total abundance was 42 7 22 9 4 1 3 8 and 2 8 in the initial samples respectively fig 4 b when 50 mg l 1 cvas were added t0 the relative abundance of firmicutes phylum and its relative genus clostridia decreased significantly p 0 05 from 35 6 initial sample to 16 5 within the first 7 days and illustrated the lowest relative abundance among other groups within 30 days this may indicate the negative impact of cvas on firmicutes activity firmicutes phylum and its clostridia genus are illustrated as a dominant bacterial group in the reactors they are mainly responsible for hydrolyzing proteins fats sugars and amino acids by secreting various enzymes 41 however firmicutes activity showed the potential weakness to resist cvas toxicity consequently firmicutes activity paired with t0 can explain the relative reduction in ts removal vfas accumulation and other effects on ad process interestingly firmicutes activity was significantly improved when mb was added to digesters this finding was consistent with 2 who observed an increasing trend in the firmicutes phylum when bc was added zhao et al 23 reported an increase in firmicutes activity after adding bentonite lactobacillus was another genus belonging to phylum firmicutes a genus of gram positive bacteria its relative abundance increased in the first 7 days with t2 and t3 while declining sharply for other reactors lactobacillus is known for its resistance to antibiotics pressure as reported by 42 this resistance was enriched when mb was added this finding may depict that cvas negatively impact the genus abundance however mb improved its abundance moreover the romboutsis genus also belongs to the firmicutes phylum and its relative abundance fluctuated over the 30 days by ad whereas it decreased within 7 days for all treatments except t1 3 86 and increased with control 5 5 and t3 3 7 within 12 days while its abundance was increased only with t1 4 6 within 30 days similarly the proteobacteria phylum relative s abundance was the lowest with t0 compared to other groups suggesting the negative impact of cvas proteobacteria bacteria phylum plays an important metabolic function in the ad process regarding utilizing glucose propionate butyrate and other small intermediate compounds 23 this phylum activity has enriched significantly with mb addition moreover ochrobactrum is another dominant genus belonging to the brucellaceae family a genus of gram negative organisms their abundance increased when mb addition rose its relative abundance was decreased to 5 3 4 4 5 3 and 7 7 respectively to control t0 t1 and t2 against an increase with t3 to 10 9 within 7 days and then decreased for all treatments within 30 days interestingly the phylum bacteroidetes is one of the three large classes of gram negative bacteria this phylum has a vital role in producing nh3 and promoting the conversion of vfas to acetate through depredating proteins in the substrate 43 this might afford material for methanosarcina and methanosaeta to metabolize and produce ch4 19 20 however adding mb had no obvious influence on bacteroidetes abundance over the digestion period in the current study the archaeal community for both phylum and genus in each group was depicted in fig 4 c and d from this figure unclassified archaea with an abundance of 91 1 in the initial substrate was the dominant taxa followed by euryachaeota phylum fig 4 c and methanothermobacter genus fig 4d cvas pressure and the mb regulation remarkably influenced this dominant phylum and genus succession unclassified archaea decreased with control t0 and t1 while increased to 99 1 and 98 6 respectively with t2 and t3 within 7 days while within 30 days unclassified archaea abundance was dropped with t1 37 6 against t0 t2 and t3 88 91 56 7 74 7 and 91 8 compared to control respectively euryarchaeota phylum abundance was not different than initial 8 5 within the first 7 days for control t0 and t1 however it s abundance declined sharply this decline in t2 and t3 reactors could be due to buffering capacity of mb interestingly euryarchaeota abundance increased slightly when time increased while it jumped for all treatments except the control reactor within 30 days euryarchaeota are a highly diverse phylum and include methanogens which produce methane by using acetate h2 co2 and methylated one carbon compounds as substrates 23 thus its abundance increasing for t0 t1 and t2 in the last period of the ad run may explain the methane production recovery as shown in fig 2a these results may indicate the impact of mb to enhance this phylum activity under high cvas pressure on the other hand methanothermobacter genus represents 6 3 of the total archaeal community abundance which belongs to methanobacteriaceae family that is responsible for using carbon dioxide and hydrogen as substrates to produce ch4 its abundance fluctuated at all treatments by ad within 30 days its abundance increased sharply by t0 33 7 t1 44 4 and t2 18 8 compared to declining with control 2 7 and t3 5 1 methanobrevibacter another genus of methanobacteriaceae family was found with 2 1 in the initial substrate no change would be observed in its abundance within 7 days while it declined within 12 days before it increased to 10 1 with t1 and 0 9 8 5 4 5 and 2 6 respectively to control t0 t2 and t3 within 30 days notably after adding mb into reactors particularly t2 and t3 methanothermobacter and methanobrevibacter genes tended by extinct due to mb s buffer capacity this finding was in agreement with 23 in this study mb accelerated swine manure degradation into small molecular organics that promoted the growth of methanogens and increased its resistance against the cvas inhibitory effect 3 4 ad system scale up model combined with mb application to treat manure with cvas the current study s results show that adding mb 10 g l 1 has successfully reduced cvas by 90 with very low residuals in the solid fraction however scale up and economic assessment are still important to predict and adjust the mb application in a continuous scale reactor as suggested in this study 5 10 kg m3 of mb is recommended for batch swine manure treatment in this scale up model the application of mb was designed for a continuous digester application assuming a 1 m3 digester volume as shown in fig 5 non degradable bags with a mesh size smaller than mb particle size is suggested to increase the retention time of the bm during the operation of a reactor as soon as a batch of manure with cvas is introduced to the digester however these bags need to be examined practically assuming 10 of the total mb weight could be lost from bags for each ad hrt due to microbial consumption activity or leakage which means each hrt would consume 0 5 1 0 kg of mb per 1 m3 the cost of mb is 7 2 per kg mb beijing yixiubo paleontology technology co ltd as a result the cost of bm required to eliminate the negative effects of cvas and ensure safe digestate disposal as field fertilizer would be 3 6 7 2 per 1 m3 of swine manure the estimated cost does not take into consideration the thermal modification of bentonite in many countries additional treatment of digestate is regulated ec no 1069 2009 and requires that animal wastes should be treated with pasteurization 1 h at 70 c prior to the ad process 44 which may cost 7 53 15 2 per m3 of raw sludge as reported by 45 this cost is 111 higher compared to mb treatment 3 6 7 2 per m3 this means that the mb addition cost would be lower than reported for animal manure pre treatment or post digestive treatment for reducing antibiotic residues this finding indicates that mb could be used as an economical alternative to guarantee anaerobic digestion stability against cvas impacts and a secure digestate as a

12437,the regeneration of filter media was crucial to the filtration performance of the oily wastewater herein a novel hydrocyclone induce approach was proposed for filter media regeneration followed by an exploration of oil desorption feasibility and mechanism the effect of structural and operation parameters of a hydrocyclone on the particle self rotation was extensively analyzed by numerical simulation and its feasibility for oil desorption from the filter media was subsequently investigated a hydrocyclone intensified filtration method that combined by the unit of filtration and hydrocyclone self rotation regeneration was proposed and the effect of hydrocyclone induced filter media regeneration on the subsequent oily wastewater filtration was also explored the ideal specifications of the hydrocyclone were concluded to be an overflow pipe insertion of 120 mm and a cone angle of 60 for the optimal self rotation velocity the hydrocyclone induced regeneration presents a remarkable oil desorption efficiency and the oil concentration of filter media reduced from 9 43 to 6 94 4 33 and 3 43 as the flowrate increased from 1 8 105 l m 2 h 1 to 5 4 105 l m 2 h 1 the adhered oil was exfoliated due to the centrifugal force caused by the revolution and self rotation of the media particles while the filter media spun in a hydrocyclone the average effluent oil concentration in the raw oily wastewater was reduced to 12 2 mg l during the pilot scale test indicating that the hydrocyclone regeneration benefits the continuous oil water separation it is believed that this work might provide a unique and efficient method for oily wastewater treatment with the integration of filtration and hydrocyclone regeneration graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hydrocyclone self rotation filter media regeneration oil water separation filtration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction petroleum refinery wastewater generally exhibits the character of high concentration difficult degradation and wastewater contaminants fluctuation due to the poor quality of crude oil and the ongoing extension of refinery process 1 generally the amount of wastewater produced by petroleum refineries per volume of processed crude oil ranged 0 4 1 5 times 2 the difficult of treating oily wastewater is continuously rising owing to the increasingly strict environmental emission standards generally oil and suspended solids are the primary pollutant in petroleum refinery wastewater pretreatment 3 it is of great significance for maintaining the stability of wastewater treatment system with an efficient oil and ss removal 4 filtration with appropriate filter media seems to be an efficient method for the simultaneous removal of oil and ss due to its efficiency and feasibility 5 6 some filter media like anthracite 7 walnut 8 peanut shell 9 and sawdust 10 have been adopted for oil interception and adsorption which was ascribed to the surface wettability and tortuous channel structure of filter layer 11 as known it is significant to maintain the separation performance of filter media to realize the effective treatment of oily wastewater therefore filter media with adhered oil should be regenerated at a proper frequency and the filtration performance should be maintained however it is challenging to completely desorb the oil adhered on the filter media with the traditional regeneration method finally resulting in a reduction of oil water separation performance over time research has focused on improving media surface wettability optimizing the filtration process as well as exploring the mechanisms and the possibilities of modelling the filtration process however the filter media regeneration and its impact on the filtration process have received considerably less attention in the research accordingly the development of novel regeneration structure of filter to maintain the effective oil water separation is in high demanded owing to the mechanism of interception and adsorption the contaminants including oil suspended solids organic matter and heavy metals was removed by the filter media 12 periodical backwashing with air and water is the most efficient method for granular media filters to release the intercepted contaminants thus the separation ability of filter media was recovered 13 14 however for filtration that is predominately adsorption it is challenging to recover the filter media separation ability with conventional backwash methods 15 various techniques were adopted to accomplish regeneration such as steam washing 16 solvent extraction naoh h2o2 etc 17 and thermal desorption 18 the interaction between pollutants and filter media is overcome by additional input energy thus to realize the regeneration of filter media melter slag was adopted for the removal phosphorus from wastewater and a physical regeneration of crushing was performed on the exhausted slag to expose adsorption sites 19 granular chitosan adsorbent was applied for adsorption of as v in a fixed bed filter followed by the desorption of as v from the filter media with 1 naoh solution 17 however chemical regeneration methods contribute to the discharge of more pollutants into the environment 20 physical methods depend on mechanical treatment to remove foulants from the surface of the filter media and improve regeneration effectiveness which should be a preferred method 21 regarding the oily wastewater filtration the oleophilic filter media is responsible for oil removal the filter media regeneration is necessary for oil water filtration while the regeneration was hindered by the adherence between oleophilic filter media and oil the oil water filtration performance was therefore decreased 22 currently three regeneration approaches including fluidization fluidization assisted by mechanical stirring and fluidization by combined air and water have been proposed for the filter backwash 23 as for fluidization the raw wastewater was introduced from the filter bottom to backwash the filter layer 24 the oil removal efficiency was later attenuated with the conventional backwash approach of fluidization showing that the conventional fluidization is insufficient for the oily filter media regeneration 25 although the structures such as mechanical agitation have been proposed to improve the media regeneration the operation complexity was accordingly increased by the addition of moving parts moreover it is difficult to overcome the adhesion force between oil and particle surface by the shear effect produced by low speed agitation in addition as for oil water filtration separation immense attention has been paid to the improvement of the filter media wettability and optimization of the particle size gradation to obtain well oil removal performance while few studies have concentrated on the regeneration of the filter media to address the poor regeneration of oily filter media it is significant to develop a novel filter media regeneration structure finally maintaining the stable removal of oil and suspended solids from oily wastewater by filtration hydrocyclones typical centrifugal devices with high reliability have been extensively applied for separation processes 26 since the novel motion of particles high speed self rotation has been observed by huang et al 27 the application field of hydrocyclones has extended from separation to process intensification including catalysts reutilization 28 and excess sludge solubilization 29 additionally due to velocity differences between flow layers the revolving and shear stress in a hydrocyclone can also benefit the desorption oil from dispersed phase particles 30 accordingly the oil desorption was enhanced by the filter media self rotation which was caused by the shear stress in a hydrocyclone 27 28 an effective regeneration of filter media was realized subsequently followed by the oil water filtration performance potential advantages of hydrocyclone indicate valuable attempts to enhance and optimize filter backwash as a crucial component of filtration for oily wastewater treatment meanwhile the integration of microchannel filter and hydrocyclone regeneration provides new perspectives for industrial oily wastewater treatment the objective of this study is to propose a novel filter media regeneration method and investigate the performance of hydrocyclone for oil desorption from filter media the flow boundary for particle self rotation was optimized by numerical simulation a feasibility investigation of hydrocyclone for oily filter media regeneration was implemented and the mechanism of oil desorption from media was explored subsequently a pilot scale device was developed to explore the impact of hydrocyclone regeneration on the oil water separation performance with the integration of microchannel filter and hydrocyclone the oil water separation and filter media self rotation regeneration were simultaneously realized followed by the development of hydrocyclone intensified filtration hif hence a new insight for improvement of oil water filtration with lower cost and higher efficiency was proposed in this study 2 method and materials 2 1 hydrocyclone design for particle self rotation the hydrocyclone is installed at the top of the microchannel filter as shown in fig 1 a conventionally the filter media was fluidized by the backwash water followed by the regeneration of filter media however the application of microchannel filter was limited by the poor regeneration of oily filter media for industrial oily wastewater treatment in order to realize the regeneration of filter media with high concentration the cone angle and inlet area were increased and the designed hydrocyclone was illustrated in fig 1 c two tangential inlets were designed and the hydrocyclone was composed of outer cylinder vortex finder and cone section the structure parameters of the hydrocyclone were displayed in table 1 the vortex finder length and cone angle were set with different values to optimize the particle self rotation in the hydrocyclone by numerical simulation 2 2 mesh independence and model description the numerical simulation was adopted to investigate the effect of flow boundary on the particle self rotation the mesh is the significant factor for numerical analysis due to its number and mesh types has an obvious effect on simulation precision 31 hexahedral meshes were adopted for the computation domain of hydrocyclone owe to high precision and rapid convergence and the meshes are shown in fig 2 a considering the influence of the boundary layer on the flow field the meshes are more densely distributed on the wall surface around the vortex finder and the inlet different mesh numbers of 241 520 n1 336 896 n2 and 433 920 n3 were selected to investigate the mesh independence in a hydrocyclone tangential velocity was applied to clarify the effect of the mesh number on numerical simulation accuracy subsequently as shown in fig 2 b no change of tangential velocity was obtained with the increase of mesh numbers as the mesh numbers reached 336 896 indicating that the numerical precision cannot be affected by the further increase of mesh number considering the anisotropic turbulent flow field in a hydrocyclone turbulence models are required for the numerical simulation the reynolds stress model rsm was widely applied for swirl flow field simulation 32 33 thereby rsm was chosen for simulating the flow in a hydrocyclone in this work 2 3 self rotation induced oily filter media regeneration lab scale filter media regeneration tests were carried out to comprehensively evaluate oily filter media regeneration performance by hydrocyclone a schematic flow diagram of the lab scaled unit is displayed in fig 3 anthracite with a diameter of 246 1150 μm average diameter of 585 μm was adopted as the filter media labeled 15 and the oily filter media was prepared by soaking in raw oily wastewater for 24 h the main device applied to carry out filter media regeneration is a hydrocyclone apparatus the hydrocyclone apparatus composed of a hydrocyclone with a cylinder diameter of 60 mm labeled 11 a screw pump 0 1 m3 h labeled 1 for conveying water a flowmeter 0 2 m3 h labeled 6 for flowrate measurement a pressure gauge 0 0 4 mpa labeled 7 for pressure measurement a particle adding device labeled 9 for filter media addition and a tank labeled 3 for water storage two meshes collector labeled 4 and 13 were set at the overflow and underflow to collect the treated oily particles water was pumped into the hydrocyclone and the oily particles were added after the flow field was stable the treated oily particle was collected for future analysis each group of experiments was carried out for 3 times to avoid the operation error with the average value being used to represent the processing effect 2 4 analytical and calculation methods scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 3000 was utilized to observe the surface morphology of the filter media before and after treatment the oil concentration of wastewater was evaluated by an infrared spectrometer oil content analyser sh 21a shanghai shengaohua environment protection technology co ltd gas chromatography mass spectrometry agilent 7890a 5975c usa was also applied for organics compound detection in oily filter media before and after treatment and carbon tetrachloride was utilized for organic component extraction from the oily particles the regeneration performance of oily filter media is evaluated by the oil concentration of filter media before and after hydrocyclone treatment after treatment in hydrocyclone samples m 1 were collected and extracted by carbon tetrachloride the extracted particles were collected and dried in an oven at 105 c for 2 h until the weight has stabilized to get the oil free sample m 2 thus the filter media oil concentration c can be calculated as shown in eq 1 1 c m 1 m 2 m 1 meanwhile the oil removal efficiency is calculated as follows 2 η c 0 c c 0 100 where c 0 and c are the oil concentration of filter media before and after treatment 2 5 theory calculation for particle self rotation in this study it is assumed that the microspheres have good followability so the microspheres velocity with the local fluid of could be considered as consistent according to the symmetry of the flow field in a hydrocyclone the microspheres motion in the flow field is simplified as a rotational motion around the central axis and the revolution velocity ω a of particles in the swirling flow field is defined as 34 3 ω a u θ r c r n 1 where u θ is the fluid tangential velocity r is the distance from the fluid particle to central axis of the hydrocyclone c is constant and n is the index additionally the relationship between tangential shear strain and revolution velocity in swirling flow field is as follow 4 s θ r d ω a dr c n 1 r n 1 where s θ is the fluid tangential strain in the swirling flow field considering that the self rotation velocity is defined as half of the fluid tangential shear strain and the microspheres self rotation ω z is 35 5 ω z s θ 2 r d ω a 2 r when the microsphere size is small and much smaller than the size of the hydrocyclone the following formula is obtained according to the relationship between the fluid revolution velocity and the microspheres self rotation velocity in the swirling field 6 d ω a dr ω a 1 ω a 2 r 2 r 1 the distance r z between the particle center and the hydrocyclone central axis is as follow 7 r z r 1 r 2 2 therefore the formula for microspheres self rotation velocity is obtained according to the above formula 8 ω z r 1 r 2 4 r 2 r 1 ω a 2 ω a 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of hydrocyclone flow field for particle self rotation 3 1 1 effect of structure parameters on the particle self rotation to investigate the effect of hydrocyclone overflow pipe depth on the self rotation the overflow pipe depth was set as 80 mm 100 mm and 120 mm respectively as shown in fig 4 the inlet velocity of hydrocyclone was set to 0 1 m s with the increase of overflow pipe from 80 mm to 120 mm the short circuit was reduced indicating an improvement in particle separation performance as displayed in fig 4 a moreover the axial velocity distribution of y 0 plane was shown in fig 4 b the obvious downstream flow distribution was exhibited with the overflow pipe of 120 mm which is conducive to the separation of dispersed phase particles 36 the particle revolution velocity is directly related to the tangential velocity distribution while the self rotation velocity is affected by the fluid velocity gradient according to the our previous study 34 as shown in fig 4 c the revolution velocity increases gradually from the sidewall to the axis while a reduction of the revolution velocity is received with the increase of the overflow pipe depth the average revolution velocity reduced from 10 4 rad s to 7 2 rad s with the insertion depth increasing from 80 mm to 120 mm the peak of the self rotation velocity is located in the quasi forced vortex and boundary layer as demonstrated in fig 4 d which was ascribed to the higher velocity gradient additionally the particle self rotation velocity increases with the increase of overflow pipe depth and the absolute value of the maximum self rotation velocity rises from 19 9 rad s to 24 8 rad s therefore the highest particle self rotation speed was obtained under the condition of an overflow pipe depth of 120 mm to investigate the effect of cone angle on the particle self rotation three cone angles of 60 90 and 120 were designed respectively and the results are demonstrated as fig s1 the short circuit flow increased with the cone angle raised from 60 to 120 as shown in fig s1 a the axial velocity distribution of the y 0 plane at different cone angles is shown in fig s1 b an obvious downstream flow was obtained under the cone angles of 60 and 90 at the interface of column and cone which could inhibit the escape of particles induced by the short circuit moreover the negative axial velocity region also decreased followed by a decline of particles separation performance the distribution of the particle revolution and self rotation velocity at different cone angles was shown in fig s1 c and d overall the average revolution speed was 7 22 rad s 9 73 rad s and 8 73 rad s with the cone angles of 60 90 and 120 at the z 0 plane the self rotation velocity distribution in different cone angles was displayed in fig s1 d the absolute value of maximum self rotation velocity reduced from 24 8 rad s to 17 5 rad s as the cone angle increased from 60 to 90 although higher self rotation velocity was obtained with the a 120 cone angle the separation efficiency decrease caused by the short circuit is a significant issue in a word the particle self rotation velocity in the quasi forced vortex and boundary layer under the cone angle of 60 is higher than that of the cone angle of 90 therefore an optimal cone angle of 60 is adopted for hydrocyclone to realize the oily granular media regeneration 3 1 2 effect of operation parameters on the particle self rotation different inlet velocities of 0 05 m s 1 0 1 m s 1 and 0 15 m s 1 were set to explore the effect of inlet velocity on the particle self rotation the flow streamlines and axial velocity distribution of the y 0 plane were displayed in fig 5 a and b respectively the negative axial velocity at the axis can be observed with the increase of inlet velocity which effectively avoids the disturbance of separated particles at the spigot and improves the particle separation efficiency an increase of particle revolution velocity was obtained with inlet velocity increase which was ascribed to the accordingly increase of the tangential velocity as show in fig 5 c moreover the revolution velocity increases first and then decreases along the wall to the axis and the radial position of the revolution velocity peak is basically same the particle self rotation is significantly influenced by the hydrocyclone inlet velocity 37 as shown in fig 5 d the particle self rotation in the boundary layer of the hydrocyclone is much higher than that of other regions and the self rotation velocity increases with the increase of inlet velocity in the same cross section it can be concluded that the improvement of the desorption of oil and ss on the particles surface can be realized by increasing the inlet flow rate the particle revolution and self rotation velocity increase accordingly finally enhancing the filter media regeneration by inference the influence of flow field boundary on particle self rotation was thoroughly explored through numerical simulation and the structural parameters and operation parameters were then optimized in addition to revoluting around the hydrocyclone axis the self rotation of dispersed phase particle is also obtained due to the complex flow field the centrifugal force on particle surface contaminants increases with the increase of particle self rotation velocity which is beneficial to the desorption of contaminants from particle surface according to the above results the peak self rotation velocity of particles is usually located in the hydrocyclone sidewall and center area therefore the particle self rotation can be enhanced by adjusting the inlet flow rate and residence time for a specific hydrocyclone structure finally improving the regeneration of the particles 3 2 feasibility investigation of self rotation for oily filter media regeneration the feasibility of hydrocyclone self rotation for oily filter media regeneration was investigated and a series experiments were implemented with the optimized flow field boundary conditions according to the above numerical simulation considering the integration with filtration subsequently the hydrocyclone inlet velocity was decided by the backwash water flowrate therefore the less the amount of backwash water the better its economy for industrial applications with the premise of ideal filter media regeneration meanwhile it is significant to explore the filter media regeneration performance at low inlet velocity to explore the effect of inlet velocity on the oil desorption performance from the oily filter media the inlet velocities are set as 0 05 m s 0 10 m s and 0 15 m s and the corresponding flow rates are 1 8 105 l m 2 h 1 3 6 105 l m 2 h 1 and 5 4 105 l m 2 h 1 respectively the regeneration performance was evaluated by the oil concentration of oily filter media before and after hydrocyclone treatment and the results are shown in fig 6 a the oil concentration of the original oily filter media is 9 43 the oil concentration reduced to 6 94 4 33 and 3 43 with the flow rate increasing from 1 8 105 l m 2 h 1 to 5 4 105 l m 2 h 1 and the corresponding oil removal efficiency increased from 26 6 to 63 8 the above results indicate that the oil removal efficiency improvement is realized with the flow rate increase which is ascribed to the enhancement of particle self rotation velocity the effect of treatment times on oil removal performance from the oily filter media was then investigated and the number of treatment times was set as 1 2 3 and 4 respectively the test was implemented with one hydrocyclone and the treated filter media was collected for another treatment thereby the different treatment times was realized the flow rate was maintained at 3 6 105 l m 2 h 1 and the results is shown in fig 6 b the oil concentration on the particle surface reduces from 4 33 to 3 08 with an increase in treatment time from 1 to 4 the oil adhered on the particle surface was continuously exfoliated with an increase of treatment times followed by the decrease of oil concentration in order to improve oil removal from particle surface it is possible to increase treatment times by changing the backwashing time in practical filtration although the oil adhered on the particle can be effectively removed by hydrocyclone treatment there is a limit to the oil removal with the cyclic treatment therefore the backwashing time still needs to be optimized to obtain the best operating economy in practical applications additionally sem was adopted to observe the surface morphology of the oily filter media before and after treatment and the result is shown in fig s2 as demonstrated in fig s2 a the surface of oily particle is complicated and rough and the distribution of pollutants was also clearly observed oil and suspended solids are intercepted and adhered by the filter media followed by the deposition on the surface of the particles resulting in a decrease of oil water separation performance generally the filter media as the key for oil and ss removal in the filtration needs to be regenerated at a certain frequency the desorption of pollutants adhered on the oil particles surface were realized by the hydrocyclone treatment relying on the fluid shear and particle self rotation caused by the internal swirling turbulent flow field the surface of the particles after treatment is relatively uniform and no significant pollutant adhesion is found as displayed in fig s2 b the results indicate that the oil and suspended solids on the surface of the particles was effectively exfoliated by the hydrocyclone treatment as well as the renewal of the particle surface therefore the separation performance of filter media for oil and suspended solids should be recovered subsequently the difference of organic components adhered on the surface of oily particles before and after treatment was qualitatively revealed in fig s2 c the number of peaks of the treated sample decreases significantly as well as the peak area compared with the original sample indicating that the desorption of oil adhered on the surface of the particles was realized by hydrocyclone treatment moreover the desorption performance of different organic components was further investigated in conjunction with the oil concentration of oily particles as shown in fig s2 d above all the concentration of organic matter adhered on the surface of the particles after hydrocyclone treatment is lower than that of the original sample which further confirms that the oil desorption from the oily particles surface by hydrocyclone treatment is realized 3 3 mechanism analysis for oily particles regeneration the mechanism of oil desorption from the oily particles via hydrocyclone induced regeneration was investigated generally the dispersed phase particles typically migrate to the side wall due to the density difference then spiral to the underflow as a results of typical turbulent flow field in hydrocyclone as illustrated in fig 7 additionally dispersed phase particles in a hydrocyclone will be subjected to shear stress caused by the velocity gradient in the flow layer the shear stress significantly fluctuates in all axial cross sections and the shear force rate is at its highest near the wall or close to the center which also contributes the transfer of shear force 38 consequently the oily filter media surface was affected thus leading to the exfoliation of oil and ss adhered on the particles surface because of the significant shear stress fluctuation moreover not only revolutions but also the self rotation movement of the simulated particle was spurred by the hydrocyclone due to the shear stress non uniformity according to our previous study 27 29 which could benefit the surface renewal by inference generally a higher self rotation velocity of was observed in sidewall and center region of a hydrocyclone which is consistent with the section 3 1 as shown in fig s2 a the oil and suspended solids were intercepted by the filter media in oily wastewater treatment actually the adhesion force between oil and filter media is the main obstacle to realize filter media regeneration it is essential to introduce additional input energy to overcome the adhesion force between oil and filter media finally achieving the regeneration of oily filter media the centrifugal force caused by the particle self rotation in a swirl field has the potential to overcome the adhesion force between oil droplets and filter media as shown in fig 7 the f s and f r are the centrifugal force caused by the particle self rotation and revolution respectively while the f o is the coupling centrifugal force induced by the particle self rotation and revolution furthermore the magnitude of the coupling centrifugal force is positively correlated with the particle self rotation and revolution velocity and the increase of the coupling centrifugal force is beneficial to the desorption of the oil adhered on the particle surface moreover oil and suspended solids adhered on the particles surface were further exfoliated by the coupling centrifugal force and were removed by the action of self rotation simultaneously finally realizing the regeneration of the oily filter media 3 4 system integration and pilot scale continuous test for oily wastewater as known the filtration is believed to an effective and attractive approach for oil and suspended solids separation for its feasibility 10 39 however the filter media with adhered oil should be regenerated to maintain the filtration separation performance a novel method of hydrocyclone was proposed and the feasibility of oily filter media regeneration by hydrocyclone was verified therefore a novel method of hydrocyclone intensified filtration hif was proposed with the integration of oil water filtration and filter media self rotation regeneration as shown in fig 8 with the adsorption and interception of oil and suspended solids by the filter layer the pressure drops increased it is essential to backwash the filter layer at a certain frequency thus restoring the separation performance of filter media the water was introduced from the bottom of hif and the filter media was fluidized filter media was carried by the fluid into the hydrocyclone at the top of hif in the backwashing process thus the desorption of oil and ss adhered on the filter media surface was achieved under the shear stress and the particles self rotation of the swirl field finally improving the filter media regeneration after regeneration the treated filter media returned to the hif bed which was adopted for oil and suspended solids interception and adsorption once again finally realizing the continuous operation of hif an experimental equipment with a capacity of 1 27 104 l m 2 h 1 was set up at sinopec shanghai petrochemical co ltd sspc to investigate the effect of self rotation regeneration for continuous oil water separation performance of hif the hydrocyclone employed in the experiment was enlarged according to the similarity principle according to the hydrocyclone structure in section 3 1 the continuous oil water separation performance by hif was investigated subsequently as shown in fig 9 a and b as for the raw oily wastewater with an oil concentration of 15 9 129 1 mg l the average effluent oil concentration is 12 2 mg l indicating an effective continuous oil water separation is achieved as displayed in fig 9 a additionally the long term experimental results demonstrate that the separation performance of filter media is effectively maintained by the hydrocyclone treatment as previously mentioned the oil adhered on the filter media surface was exfoliated by the self rotation regeneration thus restoring the adsorption performance of the filter media the separation performance of filter media was recovered by the backwash followed by the oil water separation process the regeneration performance of filter media has a direct effect on the oil water separation the better the filter media regeneration performance the better the oil water separation moreover in order to investigate the effect of filter media regeneration on oil removal performance different hydrocyclone treatment capacity was conducted and the corresponding hif backwash flowrate was 1 27 104 l m 2 h 1 1 53 104 l m 2 h 1 1 85 104 l m 2 h 1 and 2 04 104 l m 2 h 1 respectively as shown in fig 9 b the oil removal efficiency increased with the increase of backwash flowrate and an average effluent oil concentration of 7 5 mg l was obtained with a hif backwash flowrate of 2 04 104 l m 2 h 1 which was ascribed to the higher self rotation of filter media in hydrocyclone in addition the economics of self rotation induced filter media regeneration are superior to the other reported methods which is summarized in table 2 the comparison results indicated that the self rotation induced filter media regeneration was a cost effective process due to its no chemicals addition a hydrocyclone intensified filtration was developed by integrating filtration and hydrocyclone regeneration in which the oil water separation and filter media self rotation regeneration was realized simultaneously providing a new choice for efficient and low carbon treatment of oily wastewater 4 conclusion in the present study a novel method of hydrocyclone was firstly proposed for filter media regeneration the flow boundary for particle self rotation was optimized by numerical simulation lab scale experiment and mechanism exploration for oil desorption have been implemented a stable oil water separation performance was realized with the developed hif in the pilot scale continuous test for raw oily wastewater the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the ideal flow field boundary of a hydrocyclone was concluded to be an overflow pipe insertion of 120 mm and a cone angle of 60 for the optimal particle self rotation velocity the particle self rotation velocity increases with the increase of overflow pipe depth while the opposite results are obtained in terms of cone angle moreover the self rotation velocity of dispersed phase increased with the increase of hydrocyclone inlet velocity 2 a remarkable oil desorption performance for oily filter media was achieved by a hydrocyclone the oil concentration of filter media reduced from 9 43 to 6 94 4 33 and 3 43 with the flow rate increased from 1 8 105 l m 2 h 1 to 5 4 105 l m 2 h 1 after hydrocyclone treatment additionally oil adhered on the particles surface was continuously exfoliated with the increase of treatment times finally realizing the filter media regeneration 3 a novel method of hydrocyclone intensified filtration was proposed with the integration of oil water filtration and filter media self rotation regeneration regarding the raw oily wastewater the average effluent oil concentration decreased to 12 2 mg l with a fluctuant influent oil concentration of 15 9 129 1 mg l the oil water separation ability of filter media was recovered by the self rotation regeneration thus realizing a long term effective separation performance in the pilot scale test the novel self rotation method illustrates a new strategy to realize filter media regeneration moreover a new perspective has been provided for the filtration of the raw oily wastewater in which the oil water separation and filter media in suit regeneration were realized simultaneously the hif can also be extended to the other industrial oily wastewater including oil and gas produced wastewater metalworking wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

to the surface wettability and tortuous channel structure of filter layer 11 as known it is significant to maintain the separation performance of filter media to realize the effective treatment of oily wastewater therefore filter media with adhered oil should be regenerated at a proper frequency and the filtration performance should be maintained however it is challenging to completely desorb the oil adhered on the filter media with the traditional regeneration method finally resulting in a reduction of oil water separation performance over time research has focused on improving media surface wettability optimizing the filtration process as well as exploring the mechanisms and the possibilities of modelling the filtration process however the filter media regeneration and its impact on the filtration process have received considerably less attention in the research accordingly the development of novel regeneration structure of filter to maintain the effective oil water separation is in high demanded owing to the mechanism of interception and adsorption the contaminants including oil suspended solids organic matter and heavy metals was removed by the filter media 12 periodical backwashing with air and water is the most efficient method for granular media filters to release the intercepted contaminants thus the separation ability of filter media was recovered 13 14 however for filtration that is predominately adsorption it is challenging to recover the filter media separation ability with conventional backwash methods 15 various techniques were adopted to accomplish regeneration such as steam washing 16 solvent extraction naoh h2o2 etc 17 and thermal desorption 18 the interaction between pollutants and filter media is overcome by additional input energy thus to realize the regeneration of filter media melter slag was adopted for the removal phosphorus from wastewater and a physical regeneration of crushing was performed on the exhausted slag to expose adsorption sites 19 granular chitosan adsorbent was applied for adsorption of as v in a fixed bed filter followed by the desorption of as v from the filter media with 1 naoh solution 17 however chemical regeneration methods contribute to the discharge of more pollutants into the environment 20 physical methods depend on mechanical treatment to remove foulants from the surface of the filter media and improve regeneration effectiveness which should be a preferred method 21 regarding the oily wastewater filtration the oleophilic filter media is responsible for oil removal the filter media regeneration is necessary for oil water filtration while the regeneration was hindered by the adherence between oleophilic filter media and oil the oil water filtration performance was therefore decreased 22 currently three regeneration approaches including fluidization fluidization assisted by mechanical stirring and fluidization by combined air and water have been proposed for the filter backwash 23 as for fluidization the raw wastewater was introduced from the filter bottom to backwash the filter layer 24 the oil removal efficiency was later attenuated with the conventional backwash approach of fluidization showing that the conventional fluidization is insufficient for the oily filter media regeneration 25 although the structures such as mechanical agitation have been proposed to improve the media regeneration the operation complexity was accordingly increased by the addition of moving parts moreover it is difficult to overcome the adhesion force between oil and particle surface by the shear effect produced by low speed agitation in addition as for oil water filtration separation immense attention has been paid to the improvement of the filter media wettability and optimization of the particle size gradation to obtain well oil removal performance while few studies have concentrated on the regeneration of the filter media to address the poor regeneration of oily filter media it is significant to develop a novel filter media regeneration structure finally maintaining the stable removal of oil and suspended solids from oily wastewater by filtration hydrocyclones typical centrifugal devices with high reliability have been extensively applied for separation processes 26 since the novel motion of particles high speed self rotation has been observed by huang et al 27 the application field of hydrocyclones has extended from separation to process intensification including catalysts reutilization 28 and excess sludge solubilization 29 additionally due to velocity differences between flow layers the revolving and shear stress in a hydrocyclone can also benefit the desorption oil from dispersed phase particles 30 accordingly the oil desorption was enhanced by the filter media self rotation which was caused by the shear stress in a hydrocyclone 27 28 an effective regeneration of filter media was realized subsequently followed by the oil water filtration performance potential advantages of hydrocyclone indicate valuable attempts to enhance and optimize filter backwash as a crucial component of filtration for oily wastewater treatment meanwhile the integration of microchannel filter and hydrocyclone regeneration provides new perspectives for industrial oily wastewater treatment the objective of this study is to propose a novel filter media regeneration method and investigate the performance of hydrocyclone for oil desorption from filter media the flow boundary for particle self rotation was optimized by numerical simulation a feasibility investigation of hydrocyclone for oily filter media regeneration was implemented and the mechanism of oil desorption from media was explored subsequently a pilot scale device was developed to explore the impact of hydrocyclone regeneration on the oil water separation performance with the integration of microchannel filter and hydrocyclone the oil water separation and filter media self rotation regeneration were simultaneously realized followed by the development of hydrocyclone intensified filtration hif hence a new insight for improvement of oil water filtration with lower cost and higher efficiency was proposed in this study 2 method and materials 2 1 hydrocyclone design for particle self rotation the hydrocyclone is installed at the top of the microchannel filter as shown in fig 1 a conventionally the filter media was fluidized by the backwash water followed by the regeneration of filter media however the application of microchannel filter was limited by the poor regeneration of oily filter media for industrial oily wastewater treatment in order to realize the regeneration of filter media with high concentration the cone angle and inlet area were increased and the designed hydrocyclone was illustrated in fig 1 c two tangential inlets were designed and the hydrocyclone was composed of outer cylinder vortex finder and cone section the structure parameters of the hydrocyclone were displayed in table 1 the vortex finder length and cone angle were set with different values to optimize the particle self rotation in the hydrocyclone by numerical simulation 2 2 mesh independence and model description the numerical simulation was adopted to investigate the effect of flow boundary on the particle self rotation the mesh is the significant factor for numerical analysis due to its number and mesh types has an obvious effect on simulation precision 31 hexahedral meshes were adopted for the computation domain of hydrocyclone owe to high precision and rapid convergence and the meshes are shown in fig 2 a considering the influence of the boundary layer on the flow field the meshes are more densely distributed on the wall surface around the vortex finder and the inlet different mesh numbers of 241 520 n1 336 896 n2 and 433 920 n3 were selected to investigate the mesh independence in a hydrocyclone tangential velocity was applied to clarify the effect of the mesh number on numerical simulation accuracy subsequently as shown in fig 2 b no change of tangential velocity was obtained with the increase of mesh numbers as the mesh numbers reached 336 896 indicating that the numerical precision cannot be affected by the further increase of mesh number considering the anisotropic turbulent flow field in a hydrocyclone turbulence models are required for the numerical simulation the reynolds stress model rsm was widely applied for swirl flow field simulation 32 33 thereby rsm was chosen for simulating the flow in a hydrocyclone in this work 2 3 self rotation induced oily filter media regeneration lab scale filter media regeneration tests were carried out to comprehensively evaluate oily filter media regeneration performance by hydrocyclone a schematic flow diagram of the lab scaled unit is displayed in fig 3 anthracite with a diameter of 246 1150 μm average diameter of 585 μm was adopted as the filter media labeled 15 and the oily filter media was prepared by soaking in raw oily wastewater for 24 h the main device applied to carry out filter media regeneration is a hydrocyclone apparatus the hydrocyclone apparatus composed of a hydrocyclone with a cylinder diameter of 60 mm labeled 11 a screw pump 0 1 m3 h labeled 1 for conveying water a flowmeter 0 2 m3 h labeled 6 for flowrate measurement a pressure gauge 0 0 4 mpa labeled 7 for pressure measurement a particle adding device labeled 9 for filter media addition and a tank labeled 3 for water storage two meshes collector labeled 4 and 13 were set at the overflow and underflow to collect the treated oily particles water was pumped into the hydrocyclone and the oily particles were added after the flow field was stable the treated oily particle was collected for future analysis each group of experiments was carried out for 3 times to avoid the operation error with the average value being used to represent the processing effect 2 4 analytical and calculation methods scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 3000 was utilized to observe the surface morphology of the filter media before and after treatment the oil concentration of wastewater was evaluated by an infrared spectrometer oil content analyser sh 21a shanghai shengaohua environment protection technology co ltd gas chromatography mass spectrometry agilent 7890a 5975c usa was also applied for organics compound detection in oily filter media before and after treatment and carbon tetrachloride was utilized for organic component extraction from the oily particles the regeneration performance of oily filter media is evaluated by the oil concentration of filter media before and after hydrocyclone treatment after treatment in hydrocyclone samples m 1 were collected and extracted by carbon tetrachloride the extracted particles were collected and dried in an oven at 105 c for 2 h until the weight has stabilized to get the oil free sample m 2 thus the filter media oil concentration c can be calculated as shown in eq 1 1 c m 1 m 2 m 1 meanwhile the oil removal efficiency is calculated as follows 2 η c 0 c c 0 100 where c 0 and c are the oil concentration of filter media before and after treatment 2 5 theory calculation for particle self rotation in this study it is assumed that the microspheres have good followability so the microspheres velocity with the local fluid of could be considered as consistent according to the symmetry of the flow field in a hydrocyclone the microspheres motion in the flow field is simplified as a rotational motion around the central axis and the revolution velocity ω a of particles in the swirling flow field is defined as 34 3 ω a u θ r c r n 1 where u θ is the fluid tangential velocity r is the distance from the fluid particle to central axis of the hydrocyclone c is constant and n is the index additionally the relationship between tangential shear strain and revolution velocity in swirling flow field is as follow 4 s θ r d ω a dr c n 1 r n 1 where s θ is the fluid tangential strain in the swirling flow field considering that the self rotation velocity is defined as half of the fluid tangential shear strain and the microspheres self rotation ω z is 35 5 ω z s θ 2 r d ω a 2 r when the microsphere size is small and much smaller than the size of the hydrocyclone the following formula is obtained according to the relationship between the fluid revolution velocity and the microspheres self rotation velocity in the swirling field 6 d ω a dr ω a 1 ω a 2 r 2 r 1 the distance r z between the particle center and the hydrocyclone central axis is as follow 7 r z r 1 r 2 2 therefore the formula for microspheres self rotation velocity is obtained according to the above formula 8 ω z r 1 r 2 4 r 2 r 1 ω a 2 ω a 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of hydrocyclone flow field for particle self rotation 3 1 1 effect of structure parameters on the particle self rotation to investigate the effect of hydrocyclone overflow pipe depth on the self rotation the overflow pipe depth was set as 80 mm 100 mm and 120 mm respectively as shown in fig 4 the inlet velocity of hydrocyclone was set to 0 1 m s with the increase of overflow pipe from 80 mm to 120 mm the short circuit was reduced indicating an improvement in particle separation performance as displayed in fig 4 a moreover the axial velocity distribution of y 0 plane was shown in fig 4 b the obvious downstream flow distribution was exhibited with the overflow pipe of 120 mm which is conducive to the separation of dispersed phase particles 36 the particle revolution velocity is directly related to the tangential velocity distribution while the self rotation velocity is affected by the fluid velocity gradient according to the our previous study 34 as shown in fig 4 c the revolution velocity increases gradually from the sidewall to the axis while a reduction of the revolution velocity is received with the increase of the overflow pipe depth the average revolution velocity reduced from 10 4 rad s to 7 2 rad s with the insertion depth increasing from 80 mm to 120 mm the peak of the self rotation velocity is located in the quasi forced vortex and boundary layer as demonstrated in fig 4 d which was ascribed to the higher velocity gradient additionally the particle self rotation velocity increases with the increase of overflow pipe depth and the absolute value of the maximum self rotation velocity rises from 19 9 rad s to 24 8 rad s therefore the highest particle self rotation speed was obtained under the condition of an overflow pipe depth of 120 mm to investigate the effect of cone angle on the particle self rotation three cone angles of 60 90 and 120 were designed respectively and the results are demonstrated as fig s1 the short circuit flow increased with the cone angle raised from 60 to 120 as shown in fig s1 a the axial velocity distribution of the y 0 plane at different cone angles is shown in fig s1 b an obvious downstream flow was obtained under the cone angles of 60 and 90 at the interface of column and cone which could inhibit the escape of particles induced by the short circuit moreover the negative axial velocity region also decreased followed by a decline of particles separation performance the distribution of the particle revolution and self rotation velocity at different cone angles was shown in fig s1 c and d overall the average revolution speed was 7 22 rad s 9 73 rad s and 8 73 rad s with the cone angles of 60 90 and 120 at the z 0 plane the self rotation velocity distribution in different cone angles was displayed in fig s1 d the absolute value of maximum self rotation velocity reduced from 24 8 rad s to 17 5 rad s as the cone angle increased from 60 to 90 although higher self rotation velocity was obtained with the a 120 cone angle the separation efficiency decrease caused by the short circuit is a significant issue in a word the particle self rotation velocity in the quasi forced vortex and boundary layer under the cone angle of 60 is higher than that of the cone angle of 90 therefore an optimal cone angle of 60 is adopted for hydrocyclone to realize the oily granular media regeneration 3 1 2 effect of operation parameters on the particle self rotation different inlet velocities of 0 05 m s 1 0 1 m s 1 and 0 15 m s 1 were set to explore the effect of inlet velocity on the particle self rotation the flow streamlines and axial velocity distribution of the y 0 plane were displayed in fig 5 a and b respectively the negative axial velocity at the axis can be observed with the increase of inlet velocity which effectively avoids the disturbance of separated particles at the spigot and improves the particle separation efficiency an increase of particle revolution velocity was obtained with inlet velocity increase which was ascribed to the accordingly increase of the tangential velocity as show in fig 5 c moreover the revolution velocity increases first and then decreases along the wall to the axis and the radial position of the revolution velocity peak is basically same the particle self rotation is significantly influenced by the hydrocyclone inlet velocity 37 as shown in fig 5 d the particle self rotation in the boundary layer of the hydrocyclone is much higher than that of other regions and the self rotation velocity increases with the increase of inlet velocity in the same cross section it can be concluded that the improvement of the desorption of oil and ss on the particles surface can be realized by increasing the inlet flow rate the particle revolution and self rotation velocity increase accordingly finally enhancing the filter media regeneration by inference the influence of flow field boundary on particle self rotation was thoroughly explored through numerical simulation and the structural parameters and operation parameters were then optimized in addition to revoluting around the hydrocyclone axis the self rotation of dispersed phase particle is also obtained due to the complex flow field the centrifugal force on particle surface contaminants increases with the increase of particle self rotation velocity which is beneficial to the desorption of contaminants from particle surface according to the above results the peak self rotation velocity of particles is usually located in the hydrocyclone sidewall and center area therefore the particle self rotation can be enhanced by adjusting the inlet flow rate and residence time for a specific hydrocyclone structure finally improving the regeneration of the particles 3 2 feasibility investigation of self rotation for oily filter media regeneration the feasibility of hydrocyclone self rotation for oily filter media regeneration was investigated and a series experiments were implemented with the optimized flow field boundary conditions according to the above numerical simulation considering the integration with filtration subsequently the hydrocyclone inlet velocity was decided by the backwash water flowrate therefore the less the amount of backwash water the better its economy for industrial applications with the premise of ideal filter media regeneration meanwhile it is significant to explore the filter media regeneration performance at low inlet velocity to explore the effect of inlet velocity on the oil desorption performance from the oily filter media the inlet velocities are set as 0 05 m s 0 10 m s and 0 15 m s and the corresponding flow rates are 1 8 105 l m 2 h 1 3 6 105 l m 2 h 1 and 5 4 105 l m 2 h 1 respectively the regeneration performance was evaluated by the oil concentration of oily filter media before and after hydrocyclone treatment and the results are shown in fig 6 a the oil concentration of the original oily filter media is 9 43 the oil concentration reduced to 6 94 4 33 and 3 43 with the flow rate increasing from 1 8 105 l m 2 h 1 to 5 4 105 l m 2 h 1 and the corresponding oil removal efficiency increased from 26 6 to 63 8 the above results indicate that the oil removal efficiency improvement is realized with the flow rate increase which is ascribed to the enhancement of particle self rotation velocity the effect of treatment times on oil removal performance from the oily filter media was then investigated and the number of treatment times was set as 1 2 3 and 4 respectively the test was implemented with one hydrocyclone and the treated filter media was collected for another treatment thereby the different treatment times was realized the flow rate was maintained at 3 6 105 l m 2 h 1 and the results is shown in fig 6 b the oil concentration on the particle surface reduces from 4 33 to 3 08 with an increase in treatment time from 1 to 4 the oil adhered on the particle surface was continuously exfoliated with an increase of treatment times followed by the decrease of oil concentration in order to improve oil removal from particle surface it is possible to increase treatment times by changing the backwashing time in practical filtration although the oil adhered on the particle can be effectively removed by hydrocyclone treatment there is a limit to the oil removal with the cyclic treatment therefore the backwashing time still needs to be optimized to obtain the best operating economy in practical applications additionally sem was adopted to observe the surface morphology of the oily filter media before and after treatment and the result is shown in fig s2 as demonstrated in fig s2 a the surface of oily particle is complicated and rough and the distribution of pollutants was also clearly observed oil and suspended solids are intercepted and adhered by the filter media followed by the deposition on the surface of the particles resulting in a decrease of oil water separation performance generally the filter media as the key for oil and ss removal in the filtration needs to be regenerated at a certain frequency the desorption of pollutants adhered on the oil particles surface were realized by the hydrocyclone treatment relying on the fluid shear and particle self rotation caused by the internal swirling turbulent flow field the surface of the particles after treatment is relatively uniform and no significant pollutant adhesion is found as displayed in fig s2 b the results indicate that the oil and suspended solids on the surface of the particles was effectively exfoliated by the hydrocyclone treatment as well as the renewal of the particle surface therefore the separation performance of filter media for oil and suspended solids should be recovered subsequently the difference of organic components adhered on the surface of oily particles before and after treatment was qualitatively revealed in fig s2 c the number of peaks of the treated sample decreases significantly as well as the peak area compared with the original sample indicating that the desorption of oil adhered on the surface of the particles was realized by hydrocyclone treatment moreover the desorption performance of different organic components was further investigated in conjunction with the oil concentration of oily particles as shown in fig s2 d above all the concentration of organic matter adhered on the surface of the particles after hydrocyclone treatment is lower than that of the original sample which further confirms that the oil desorption from the oily particles surface by hydrocyclone treatment is realized 3 3 mechanism analysis for oily particles regeneration the mechanism of oil desorption from the oily particles via hydrocyclone induced regeneration was investigated generally the dispersed phase particles typically migrate to the side wall due to the density difference then spiral to the underflow as a results of typical turbulent flow field in hydrocyclone as illustrated in fig 7 additionally dispersed phase particles in a hydrocyclone will be subjected to shear stress caused by the velocity gradient in the flow layer the shear stress significantly fluctuates in all axial cross sections and the shear force rate is at its highest near the wall or close to the center which also contributes the transfer of shear force 38 consequently the oily filter media surface was affected thus leading to the exfoliation of oil and ss adhered on the particles surface because of the significant shear stress fluctuation moreover not only revolutions but also the self rotation movement of the simulated particle was spurred by the hydrocyclone due to the shear stress non uniformity according to our previous study 27 29 which could benefit the surface renewal by inference generally a higher self rotation velocity of was observed in sidewall and center region of a hydrocyclone which is consistent with the section 3 1 as shown in fig s2 a the oil and suspended solids were intercepted by the filter media in oily wastewater treatment actually the adhesion force between oil and filter media is the main obstacle to realize filter media regeneration it is essential to introduce additional input energy to overcome the adhesion force between oil and filter media finally achieving the regeneration of oily filter media the centrifugal force caused by the particle self rotation in a swirl field has the potential to overcome the adhesion force between oil droplets and filter media as shown in fig 7 the f s and f r are the centrifugal force caused by the particle self rotation and revolution respectively while the f o is the coupling centrifugal force induced by the particle self rotation and revolution furthermore the magnitude of the coupling centrifugal force is positively correlated with the particle self rotation and revolution velocity and the increase of the coupling centrifugal force is beneficial to the desorption of the oil adhered on the particle surface moreover oil and suspended solids adhered on the particles surface were further exfoliated by the coupling centrifugal force and were removed by the action of self rotation simultaneously finally realizing the regeneration of the oily filter media 3 4 system integration and pilot scale continuous test for oily wastewater as known the filtration is believed to an effective and attractive approach for oil and suspended solids separation for its feasibility 10 39 however the filter media with adhered oil should be regenerated to maintain the filtration separation performance a novel method of hydrocyclone was proposed and the feasibility of oily filter media regeneration by hydrocyclone was verified therefore a novel method of hydrocyclone intensified filtration hif was proposed with the integration of oil water filtration and filter media self rotation regeneration as shown in fig 8 with the adsorption and interception of oil and suspended solids by the filter layer the pressure drops increased it is essential to backwash the filter layer at a certain frequency thus restoring the separation performance of filter media the water was introduced from the bottom of hif and the filter media was fluidized filter media was carried by the fluid into the hydrocyclone at the top of hif in the backwashing process thus the desorption of oil and ss adhered on the filter media surface was achieved under the shear stress and the particles self rotation of the swirl field finally improving the filter media regeneration after regeneration the treated filter media returned to the hif bed which was adopted for oil and suspended solids interception and adsorption once again finally realizing the continuous operation of hif an experimental equipment with a capacity of 1 27 104 l m 2 h 1 was set up at sinopec shanghai petrochemical co ltd sspc to investigate the effect of self rotation regeneration for continuous oil water separation performance of hif the hydrocyclone employed in the experiment was enlarged according to the similarity principle according to the hydrocyclone structure in section 3 1 the continuous oil water separation performance by hif was investigated subsequently as shown in fig 9 a and b as for the raw oily wastewater with an oil concentration of 15 9 129 1 mg l the average effluent oil concentration is 12 2 mg l indicating an effective continuous oil water separation is achieved as displayed in fig 9 a additionally the long term experimental results demonstrate that the separation performance of filter media is effectively maintained by the hydrocyclone treatment as previously mentioned the oil adhered on the filter media surface was exfoliated by the self rotation regeneration thus restoring the adsorption performance of the filter media the separation performance of filter media was recovered by the backwash followed by the oil water separation process the regeneration performance of filter media has a direct effect on the oil water separation the better the filter media regeneration performance the better the oil water separation moreover in order to investigate the effect of filter media regeneration on oil removal performance different hydrocyclone treatment capacity was conducted and the corresponding hif backwash flowrate was 1 27 104 l m 2 h 1 1 53 104 l m 2 h 1 1 85 104 l m 2 h 1 and 2 04 104 l m 2 h 1 respectively as shown in fig 9 b the oil removal efficiency increased with the increase of backwash flowrate and an average effluent oil concentration of 7 5 mg l was obtained with a hif backwash flowrate of 2 04 104 l m 2 h 1 which was ascribed to the higher self rotation of filter media in hydrocyclone in addition the economics of self rotation induced filter media regeneration are superior to the other reported methods which is summarized in table 2 the comparison results indicated that the self rotation induced filter media regeneration was a cost effective process due to its no chemicals addition a hydrocyclone intensified filtration was developed by integrating filtration and hydrocyclone regeneration in which the oil water separation and filter media self rotation regeneration was realized simultaneously providing a new choice for efficient and low carbon treatment of oily wastewater 4 conclusion in the present study a novel method of hydrocyclone was firstly proposed for filter media regeneration the flow boundary for particle self rotation was optimized by numerical simulation lab scale experiment and mechanism exploration for oil desorption have been implemented a stable oil water separation performance was realized with the developed hif in the pilot scale continuous test for raw oily wastewater the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the ideal flow field boundary of a hydrocyclone was concluded to be an overflow pipe insertion of 120 mm and a cone angle of 60 for the optimal particle self rotation velocity the particle self rotation velocity increases with the increase of overflow pipe depth while the opposite results are obtained in terms of cone angle moreover the self rotation velocity of dispersed phase increased with the increase of hydrocyclone inlet velocity 2 a remarkable oil desorption performance for oily filter media was achieved by a hydrocyclone the oil concentration of filter media reduced from 9 43 to 6 94 4 33 and 3 43 with the flow rate increased from 1 8 105 l m 2 h 1 to 5 4 105 l m 2 h 1 after hydrocyclone treatment additionally oil adhered on the particles surface was continuously exfoliated with the increase of treatment times finally realizing the filter media regeneration 3 a novel method of hydrocyclone intensified filtration was proposed with the integration of oil water filtration and filter media self rotation regeneration regarding the raw oily wastewater the average effluent oil concentration decreased to 12 2 mg l with a fluctuant influent oil concentration of 15 9 129 1 mg l the oil water separation ability of filter media was recovered by the self rotation regeneration thus realizing a long term effective separation performance in the pilot scale test the novel self rotation method illustrates a new strategy to realize filter media regeneration moreover a new perspective has been provided for the filtration of the raw oily wastewater in which the oil water separation and filter media in suit regeneration were realized simultaneously the hif can also be extended to the other industrial oily wastewater including oil and gas produced wastewater metalworking wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

extensively used in agriculture to control weeds pests and diseases all over the world played a key role in the promotion of grain yield nevertheless as much as 90 of applied pesticides are discharged into the environment because of the low efficiency and overuse pesticide resulting in the environmental pollution and the health problems 1 3 therefore it has been important to design new approaches to develop the efficient and green pesticide delivery system controlled release formulations crfs of pesticides could provide a plausible strategy for mitigating the above mentioned drawback of conventional pesticides applied 4 6 the release property of crfs in agriculture practice is tightly related to the matrix and preparation techniques to achieve sustainable development of agriculture cost effective pesticide carriers are of great academic and practical value considered from the point of economy feasibility attapulgite atp is a nanoscale natural hydrated magnesium aluminum silicate clay which is widely used in carrier adsorbent filtration media etc atp has plentiful reactive silanol groups and surface charges therefore it is easy to obtain multi functional nanocomposite attapulgite materials by grafting on its surface in view of its many features such as high stability environmentally friendly cost efficient and abundant storage atp has been used as a high performance carrier for slow release pesticide based on adsorption 7 10 for example as studied by xiang et al 11 12 a multi modified atp matrix gel system was obtained using functionalization of atp with polydopamine to load the insecticide chlorpyrifos cpf then add sodium alginate and calcium chloride for further coating the system could excellently keep cpf molecules from degradation in the uv light which also showed a good ph responsively controlled release performance besides chi et al 13 prepared a magnetic responsive controlled release herbicide consisting of ferroferric oxide atp glyphosate and amino silicon oil in his study the controlled release of pesticide is accomplished by the movement of fe3o4 nanoparticles which is regulated by a magnetic field however the bare atp as a substrate for agrochemicals is not able to meet the demands of sustainable agriculture owing to the lack of affinity for many organic chemicals 14 cyclodextrin cd is a kind of macrocyclic oligosaccharides with both internal hydrophobic and external hydrophilic structures which is widely used in food cosmetics textiles agriculture and other fields 15 17 prominently β cyclodextrin β cd is generally used to capture and hold targets of a certain size because it can interact with various types of molecules to form inclusion compounds 18 21 on account of its plentiful hydroxyl group β cd can definitely build a network of cd based porous polymers by reacting with various coupling agents and direct grafting with insoluble carriers can contribute to a large number of adsorption active sites 22 24 in a previous study pan et al 25 has synthesized β cd atp nanomaterials for adsorbing phenolic contaminants from aqueous solutions meanwhile β cyclodextrin grafted attapulgite was applied to the dispersive liquid solid phase extraction analysis of the pesticide pyrethroids and fluoro quinolones 26 27 as far as we know the evaluation of the adsorption performance of β cd atp on pesticides has not yet been reported in addition ionic liquids ils are liquid salts below 100 c with chemical inertness and low flammability which are considered as green solvents and functional materials for nanomaterials adsorbents and dispersants 28 30 ils are capable of interacting with targets through π π interactions n π interactions hydrogen bonding dipole interactions and electrostatic interactions 31 a great number of research papers on ils for pesticide analysis are available in the literature however there is a lack of papers researching the applicability of functionalized materials with ils for pesticide adsorption in this study thiamethoxam th is second generation broad spectrum highly effective and low toxicity neonicotinoid insecticide 32 which was selected as the model pesticide the adsorption kinetics of natural and modified atp was investigated to reveal their effects on the spatial diffusion structure of th molecules in the interlayer space the equilibrium adsorption of the natural and modified atp on th was explored and adsorption thermodynamic parameters were obtained to account for the interaction between the substrate and the insecticide this study seeks to develop a cost effective pesticide carrier and investigate the removal effect of the matrix on th from real water samples which can be used as a reference to develop pesticide new crfs and the removal of th in aqueous phase 2 experimental section 2 1 materials attapulgite from dianjinshi technology co ltd in jiangsu china β cyclodextrin silane coupling agent kh560

added to 10 ml 100 mg l th aqueous solution the supernatants was analyzed by hplc for the required time 20 720 min at 298 k and the adsorbed amounts were obtained from the difference between the initial and final concentrations three kinetic models including pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion model are applied to fit the kinetics data of th on three materials

qt versus t respectively the kinetic data are further described by weber and morris intraparticle diffusion model which is given by eq 18 35 18 q t k i t 1 2 c where ki is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g min1 2 c can be determined by qt versus t1 2 plot 2 7 adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics equilibrium adsorptions were performed by contacting 10 mg adsorbents atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp respectively with 10 ml th solution of different initial concentrations ranging from 20 mg l to 140 mg l a series of such glass bottles were shaken at 200 rpm for 12 h and the temperature was maintained at 298 k 318 k and 338 k respectively equilibrium adsorption capacity was calculated according to the following equation 36 1 q t c 0 c t v m where qt mg g and ct mg l are the adsorption amount of th and the th concentration at time respectively c0 mg l is the initial concentration of th v ml is the total volume of the initial th solution and m mg is the mass of adsorbents the adsorption isotherms are quantitatively fitted by three generally used models langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich 37 38 the two forms of the langmuir isotherm model are represented by the following eqs 2 and 3 39 40 2 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m 3 q e k l q m c e 1 k l c e where ce mg l is the concentration of th at equilibrium qe mg g is the adsorption capacity of th at equilibrium qm mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent and kl l mg represents the langmuir constant related to the adsorption energy and affinity of binding sites the langmuir equation can also be expressed by the following eq 4 25 which is used to predict the spontaneity of the adsorption process 4 r l 1 1 c m k l where cm represents the maximum value of th aqueous solution in initial concentration from 20 mg l to 140 mg l the rl represents the favourability and the capacity of adsorption system if the adsorption system has good adsorption it means that 0 rl 1 the two forms of the freundlich isotherm model are represented by the following eqs 5 and 6 41 42 5 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e 6 q e k f c e 1 n where kf mg g l mg 1 n represents the freundlich constant related to the adsorption capacity of adsorbent n represents freundlich coefficient the value of 1 n signifying adsorption intensity reflects the adsorption to be irreversible when 1 n 0 favorable when 0 1 n 1 and difficult when 1 n 1 moreover the two forms of the dubinin radushkevich model are represented by the following eqs 7 and 8 43 7 lnq e lnq m k dr ε 2 8 q e q m exp kε 2 where ε can be obtained by the following eq 9 9 ε rtln 1 1 c e in addition e kj mol represents the free energy of adsorption per molecule of th which is related to the value of constant kdr e can be obtained by the following eq 10 10 e 1 2 k dr where r 8 314 j mol k is the universal gas constant t k is the solution absolute temperature the value of kdr 1 0 reflects the rough surface with many cavities and the value of e 40 kj mol represents the chemisorption between adsorbent and adsorbate thermodynamic parameters of th adsorption were calculated using the following equations 34 11 δg 0 rtlnk c the relationship equation of δg0 to δh0 δs0 is expressed as 44 12 δg 0 δh 0 tδs 0 the renowned van t hoff equation is obtained by substituting eq 11 into eq 12 13 ln k c h 0 r 1 t s 0 r the gibbs free energy change δg0 kj mol is calculated using eq 12 although the enthalpy change δh0 kj mol and the entropy change δs0 kj mol k are obtained from the slope and intercept of the eq 13 what is well known is that the equilibrium constant kc must be dimensionless in this study the kc can be easily obtained as a dimensionless parameter by multiplying kl by the molecular weight of adsorbate 1000 and then 55 5 the molar concentration of pure water per liter 43 2 8 reusability evaluation of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp to further evaluate the reusability of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp a series of adsorption desorption experiments were performed 10 mg β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp were separately mixed in th solution 10 ml 100 mg l at 45 c for 12 h the th from saturated th β cd atp and th c12mim ntf2 β cd atp were ultrasonically eluted with acetone solution for 2 h at 45 c the recovered β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp were washed thoroughly with distilled water until no th was detected infiltrates and then dried at 80 c before used for the next adsorption desorption cycle each experiment was performed in triplicates and the data averaged 3 results and discussion 3 1 the structure and morphology of samples ft ir of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp are shown in fig 2 a for c12mim ntf2 β cd atp the peaks at 3400 3550 cm 1 are respectively caused by the adsorbed water and crystal water in the atp tunnel in comparison with the raw atp the band intensities observed at 2930 cm 1 and 2860 cm 1 for β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp are much stronger these bands correspond to the stretching vibration of ch consistent with β cd the characteristic peaks located at 1398 cm 1 is derived from the bending vibration of ch bond in β cd 45 the absorbance at 1350 cm 1 is ascribed to the ch stretching vibration of the alkyl group on the nitrogen atom of the imidazolium ring the emerging peaks at 1470 cm 1and 1196 cm 1 can be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of oso in oso these results may indicate the coexistence of the structures of c12mim ntf2 and β cd the xrd spectra of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp are shown in fig 2 b characteristic peaks at 8 3o 21 04o 26 83o 31 02o and 35 29o are well matched with the attapulgite crystal structure and the peaks at 8 3o 21 04o 26 83o 31 02o and 35 29o correspond to the crystallographic planes of the 020 100 101 104 and 007 respectively after modification with β cd and c12mim ntf2 the basal spacing at 31 2o for atp shift from 0 286 nm to 0 303 nm at 29 4o meanwhile comparison of the xrd pattern of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp reveals no obvious differences between the scattering peaks of these two compounds these data indicate that the crystalline structure of atp has not changed during the grafting process and its diffraction peaks were gradually diminished as the modification process progressed further the xrd data provide evidence that c12mim ntf2 β cd atp exists as an aggregate and is covered with the hydrophobic ionic liquids in order to further confirm the chemical composition and chemical bonding of the surface elements of the prepared samples xps analysis was performed which is a powerful method to detect the surface chemical states and element types as shown in fig 3 a the main surface elements of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp were c n o si and mg the c1s and o1s high resolution of atp xps spectra were demonstrated in fig 3 b the c1s spectrum of atp with the functional groups of cc 284 8 ev cn 286 4 ev and oc 289 7 ev and o1s spectrum fig 3c presents the atp sio2 al2o3 and mgo corresponding to 531 9 ev 46 similarly the c1s xps spectrum of β cd atp fig 3d contains two functional group of cc 283 ev and nch 285 ev 47 while o1s xps spectrum fig 3e detects co 530 2 ev and co 531 1 ev tem was performed to observe the morphologies of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp as shown in the fig 4 a the typical structure of atp nanorods is in a single state and some of them interwoven structure between the rods fig 4b showed that the synthesized β cd atp was agglomerated which may be attributed to β cd graft onto atp further changing its microstructure the micrograph of c12mim ntf2 β cd atp was observed as a crystalline ionic liquid morphology in fig 4c which is due to the morphological changes caused by the c12mim ntf2 ionic liquid covering the β cd atp surface in according with the xrd results 3 2 bet and tg analysis the thermal stability and degradation of samples were evaluated by tga as shown in fig 5 in the initial step below 180 c the mass of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp were decreased to 93 33 95 51 and 96 71 respectively which were attributed to the loss of atp surface adsorption water 48 in a second phase thermal degradation started at 360 c 185 c and 220 c for atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp respectively the last stage of degradation showed a slow decomposition of the residues with 82 39 69 16 and 73 96 residual masses of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp respectively which indicated that the samples were thermally stable the isotherm in fig 6 a shows that the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the three materials can be classified as type iv curves which is a feature of evident slitshaped mesopores the slow increase in adsorption capacity at intermediate relative pressure can be attributed to the increase in the thickness of the adsorption layer 49 the observable adsorption at high relative pressure 0 6 p p0 1 0 indicates that capillary condensation has occurred in addition the nl dft pore size distribution and specific surface area of the adsorbent were shown in the fig 6 b and table s1 respectively from the fig 6 b we can obviously observe that the size of most pores in β cd atp is concentrated within 2 05 nm 2 6 nm compared with atp the average pore diameter of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp increased to 17 76 nm and 18 79 nm respectively furthermore the large pore diameter of β cd atp is due to the grafting and polymerization of β cd molecules on the surface of atp forming a large number of pores 50 meanwhile organic molecules will significantly reduce their specific surface area after entering the atp pores the specific surface areas of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp have decreased to 18 38 m2 g and 18 13 m2 g respectively which is produced by the structure and size effects of the modifier molecule 3 3 effects of adsorbents dosage and initial ph value the th adsorption on the atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp were displayed in the fig 7 the β cd atp adsorption capacity gradually decreased with the increase of the adsorbent dosage in fig 6 b as the β cd atp content increases from 1 g l to 4 g l the th adsorption capacity of β cd atp decreases sharply from 37 49 mg g to 13 98 mg g when the β cd atp dose is 4 g l the decreasing rate of th load capacity slows significantly this is because the amount of adsorbent is too much to reach adsorption saturation with fixed th concentration during the adsorption process secondly when the adsorbent dose of β cd atp gradually increased the removal rate of th tended to be higher because of the increased surface area and active sites meanwhile the adsorption capacity and removal rates of th by atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp in fig 7 a and fig 7 c showed a similar trend to that of β cd atp the ph of the solution is important parameter in adsorption process since it can consecutively affect surface property of adsorbent and ionization degree of adsorbate fig 7 shows the initial ph value on the th adsorption on the atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp it can be seen that the final ph is usually higher than the initial ph as fig 8 a displays the adsorption capacity of atp for th is hardly affected in the ph range from 1 to 10 the adsorptions of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp exhibit similar curve trend and both adsorbents had excellent load performance for th in the experimental ph range in fig 8 b and in fig 8 c meanwhile the adsorption of the adsorbents increase with the increase of ph and reached to maximum at ph 9 0 for β cd atp 52 46 mg g and at ph 8 0 for c12mim ntf2 β cd atp 45 76 mg g 3 4 adsorption kinetics the effects of contact time on the adsorption process of tested th are displayed in fig 9 according to fig 9 a the optimal contact time for th sorption is 60 min and increase precipitously to 95 of maximum adsorption within the first 150 min this occurrence is in consequence of abundant empty adsorption active sites at initial time 51 afterward the adsorption amount increases gradually until equilibrium at 240 min and small changes appears with contact time increasing which is due to the presence of adsorption saturation sites 52 corresponding kinetics parameter values are summarized in table s2 comparison with the pseudo first order model fig 9b the pseudo second order model plots fig 8c display superior linearity and close coherence correlation coefficients r2 for the pseudo second order model are all 0 997 while the pseudo first order model r2 are less 0 589 in addition qe cal values derived from the pseudo second order kinetic model fitting well with the experimental qe exp values the result showed that the adsorption behaviour for th can be defined by the pseudo second order model indicating that the adsorption process was dominated by chemisorption such as the cavity inclusion for β cd and the n π π interaction of ionic liquid 53 54 based on the principle recommended by weber and morris 55 the internal diffusion is the only rate limiting step when the internal diffusion model shows a straight line the adsorption process is determined by two or more factors when the fitted data exhibit a multilinear plots it can be inferred that the intraparticle diffusion model is not well fitted by the r2 values of the adsorbents in table s2 fig 9 d illustrates that intraparticle diffusion is not the only rate controlling step in the adsorption process since the intraparticle diffusion model has been divided into two parts and neither crosses the coordinate origin 3 5 adsorption isotherms to measure the adsorption effect of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp for th at different temperatures 298 308 and 318 k the equilibrium adsorption isotherms were investigated at different initial th concentration from 20 mg l to 140 mg l and the results were illustrated in fig 10 an upward trend in pesticide binding is observed when the solution temperature rises from 298 k to 318 k which indicates that the adsorption process is essentially endothermic furthermore the load amount of th enhances progressively with increasing initial concentrations which is attributed to the concentration gradient driving force in addition it is clear that β cd atp shows better adsorption compared to atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp at 298 k 308 k and 318 k the corresponding parameter values for the three adsorption isotherm models are shown in table 1 in contrast the freundlich adsorption isotherm model fits better with experimental values based on higher r2 values signifying the adsorption of th onto the atp was possibly a heterogeneous and multilayer adsorption system consequently molecules beyond one layer are contained by the adsorbent and the adsorbed molecules are not all in contact with the adsorbent surface 56 furthermore it can be deduced from the freundlich isotherm model that the adsorption capacity of th onto materials will improve with the improving of the th concentration in the solution it is noteworthy that the maximum adsorption of initial concentration 140 mg l th solution on β cd atp was 73 45 mg g in fig 10a at 318 k compared to atp 24 58 mg g in fig 10e and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp 55 42 mg g in fig 10i in addition the e values of d r model were all 16 kj mol indicating that the adsorption process of the three adsorbents was dominated by chemical adsorption which was in agreement with the kinetic fitting results as anticipated the adsorption effect of three adsorbents on th displayed the following order β cd atp c12mim ntf2 β cd atp atp fig 10 and table 1 such as the maximum langmuir theoretical adsorption capacity th at 318 k followed the order β cd atp qmax 160 06 mg g c12mim ntf2 β cd atp 141 4 mg g atp 49 04 mg g apart from that the adsorption effect of the β cd atp 85 93 160 06 mg g for th was significantly higher than that of c12mim ntf2 β cd atp 74 4 141 4 mg g this difference might be ascribed to the aggregation caused by the ionic liquid covering the surface of β cd atp which hinders the interaction between the β cd cavity structure and th molecules 45 to get a further insight into the addition of ionic liquid display lower adsorption compared with β cd atp a reasonable speculation on the process of th adsorption by β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp was made based on the kinetic and isotherm studies described above according to fig 11 the reason why c12mim ntf2 β cd atp observed lower th adsorption capacity than β cd atp was that the alkyl chain of c12mim ntf2 ionic liquid covered the β cd atp surface and thus prevented β cd from interacting with th the c12mim ntf2 introduction did not act synergistically with β cd atp on adsorption th and its only weakly interacted with th all of these results were consistent with the tem and xrd results the possible adsorption mechanisms towards th on β cd atp can be divided into three aspects firstly th reacted with surface hydroxyl groups of atp to form stable complexes secondly β cd can form cavity compound with th finally complexation of th with the β cd hydroxyl group plays an important role during sorption all in all the introduction of β cd can provide a synergistic effect which can effectively adsorb th 3 6 adsorption thermodynamics the effects of system temperature on the adsorption of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp on th are shown in fig 11 and table 2 apparently the adsorption amounts of three adsorbents were raised as the temperature improved the th adsorption can be explained by standard free energy change δg0 enthalpy change δh0 and entropy change δs0 the thermodynamic parameters of adsorbate th onto three materials are listed in table 2 δg0 values is negative in all experimental temperatures which indicates that the th adsorption process is spontaneous meanwhile positive δs0 values indicate that the increased randomness at the solid liquid phase during the th adsorption process in addition positive δh0 values represent that the adsorption system is endothermic in nature which was confirmed by an growth in the adsorption capacity fig 11 and the equilibrium constant table 2 at a greater temperature 3 7 recycling and stability of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp the recovery and stability of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp are critical from the viewpoint of economic value and environmental protection as shown in fig 12 the adsorption of β cd atp on th can still reach over 91 of the initial adsorption capacity after six sequential cycles compared to β cd atp the removal efficiency of th by c12mim ntf2 β cd atp decreased from 76 to 69 which was attributed to large reduction of binding sites overall β cd atp has excellent stability and reusability during adsorption desorption process making it a great potential in practical applications 4 conclusion this β cd atp nanocomposite was prepared by grafting method and then c12mim ntf2 β cd atp was obtained by immobilizing ionic liquid on the surface of β cd atp after synthesis this novel β cd atp polymerized polysaccharide nanoparticle was found to be an effective adsorbent for removal th from real water samples the prepared β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp were characterized by ft ir xrd xps bet tem and tga the results showed that β cd and c12mim ntf2 were well grafted to atp and β cd atp nanoparticles respectively compared with atp 106 38 m2 g the specific surface areas of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp have decreased to 18 38 m2 g and 18 13 m2 g respectively the optimum ph initial concentration and adsorbent dosage for β cd atp were 9 100 mg l and 0 01 g respectively the adsorption process can be described by the freundlich model and the pseudo second order kinetic the maximum capacity of langmuir isotherm of three adsorbents on th at 318 k displayed the following order β cd atp 160 06 mg g c12mim ntf2 β cd atp 141 mg g atp 49 04 mg g the gibbs free energy δg0 and standard enthalpy change δh0 demonstrated that the adsorption was spontaneous endothermic process in nature and increasingly random δs0 in addition β cd atp showed satisfactory reusability and stability over six cycles of adsorption desorption overall β cd atp offers a significant adsorption capacity appropriate reusability and temperature dependent control and has certain advantages and potential in the practical application system declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exists in the submission of this manuscript and enclosed manuscript is approved

extensively used in agriculture to control weeds pests and diseases all over the world played a key role in the promotion of grain yield nevertheless as much as 90 of applied pesticides are discharged into the environment because of the low efficiency and overuse pesticide resulting in the environmental pollution and the health problems 1 3 therefore it has been important to design new approaches to develop the efficient and green pesticide delivery system controlled release formulations crfs of pesticides could provide a plausible strategy for mitigating the above mentioned drawback of conventional pesticides applied 4 6 the release property of crfs in agriculture practice is tightly related to the matrix and preparation techniques to achieve sustainable development of agriculture cost effective pesticide carriers are of great academic and practical value considered from the point of economy feasibility attapulgite atp is a nanoscale natural hydrated magnesium aluminum silicate clay which is widely used in carrier adsorbent filtration media etc atp has plentiful reactive silanol groups and surface charges therefore it is easy to obtain multi functional nanocomposite attapulgite materials by grafting on its surface in view of its many features such as high stability environmentally friendly cost efficient and abundant storage atp has been used as a high performance carrier for slow release pesticide based on adsorption 7 10 for example as studied by xiang et al 11 12 a multi modified atp matrix gel system was obtained using functionalization of atp with polydopamine to load the insecticide chlorpyrifos cpf then add sodium alginate and calcium chloride for further coating the system could excellently keep cpf molecules from degradation in the uv light which also showed a good ph responsively controlled release performance besides chi et al 13 prepared a magnetic responsive controlled release herbicide consisting of ferroferric oxide atp glyphosate and amino silicon oil in his study the controlled release of pesticide is accomplished by the movement of fe3o4 nanoparticles which is regulated by a magnetic field however the bare atp as a substrate for agrochemicals is not able to meet the demands of sustainable agriculture owing to the lack of affinity for many organic chemicals 14 cyclodextrin cd is a kind of macrocyclic oligosaccharides with both internal hydrophobic and external hydrophilic structures which is widely used in food cosmetics textiles agriculture and other fields 15 17 prominently β cyclodextrin β cd is generally used to capture and hold targets of a certain size because it can interact with various types of molecules to form inclusion compounds 18 21 on account of its plentiful hydroxyl group β cd can definitely build a network of cd based porous polymers by reacting with various coupling agents and direct grafting with insoluble carriers can contribute to a large number of adsorption active sites 22 24 in a previous study pan et al 25 has synthesized β cd atp nanomaterials for adsorbing phenolic contaminants from aqueous solutions meanwhile β cyclodextrin grafted attapulgite was applied to the dispersive liquid solid phase extraction analysis of the pesticide pyrethroids and fluoro quinolones 26 27 as far as we know the evaluation of the adsorption performance of β cd atp on

added to 10 ml 100 mg l th aqueous solution the supernatants was analyzed by hplc for the required time 20 720 min at 298 k and the adsorbed amounts were obtained from the difference between the initial and final concentrations three kinetic models including pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion model are applied to fit the kinetics data of th on three materials

qt versus t respectively the kinetic data are further described by weber and morris intraparticle diffusion model which is given by eq 18 35 18 q t k i t 1 2 c where ki is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g min1 2 c can be determined by qt versus t1 2 plot 2 7 adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics equilibrium adsorptions were performed by contacting 10 mg adsorbents atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp respectively with 10 ml th solution of different initial concentrations ranging from 20 mg l to 140 mg l a series of such glass bottles were shaken at 200 rpm for 12 h and the temperature was maintained at 298 k 318 k and 338 k respectively equilibrium adsorption capacity was calculated according to the following equation 36 1 q t c 0 c t v m where qt mg g and ct mg l are the adsorption amount of th and the th concentration at time respectively c0 mg l is the initial concentration of th v ml is the total volume of the initial th solution and m mg is the mass of adsorbents the adsorption isotherms are quantitatively fitted by three generally used models langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich 37 38 the two forms of the langmuir isotherm model are represented by the following eqs 2 and 3 39 40 2 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m 3 q e k l q m c e 1 k l c e where ce mg l is the concentration of th at equilibrium qe mg g is the adsorption capacity of th at equilibrium qm mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent and kl l mg represents the langmuir constant related to the adsorption energy and affinity of binding sites the langmuir equation can also be expressed by the following eq 4 25 which is used to predict the spontaneity of the adsorption process 4 r l 1 1 c m k l where cm represents the maximum value of th aqueous solution in initial concentration from 20 mg l to 140 mg l the rl represents the favourability and the capacity of adsorption system if the adsorption system has good adsorption it means that 0 rl 1 the two forms of the freundlich isotherm model are represented by the following eqs 5 and 6 41 42 5 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e 6 q e k f c e 1 n where kf mg g l mg 1 n represents the freundlich constant related to the adsorption capacity of adsorbent n represents freundlich coefficient the value of 1 n signifying adsorption intensity reflects the adsorption to be irreversible when 1 n 0 favorable when 0 1 n 1 and difficult when 1 n 1 moreover the two forms of the dubinin radushkevich model are represented by the following eqs 7 and 8 43 7 lnq e lnq m k dr ε 2 8 q e q m exp kε 2 where ε can be obtained by the following eq 9 9 ε rtln 1 1 c e in addition e kj mol represents the free energy of adsorption per molecule of th which is related to the value of constant kdr e can be obtained by the following eq 10 10 e 1 2 k dr where r 8 314 j mol k is the universal gas constant t k is the solution absolute temperature the value of kdr 1 0 reflects the rough surface with many cavities and the value of e 40 kj mol represents the chemisorption between adsorbent and adsorbate thermodynamic parameters of th adsorption were calculated using the following equations 34 11 δg 0 rtlnk c the relationship equation of δg0 to δh0 δs0 is expressed as 44 12 δg 0 δh 0 tδs 0 the renowned van t hoff equation is obtained by substituting eq 11 into eq 12 13 ln k c h 0 r 1 t s 0 r the gibbs free energy change δg0 kj mol is calculated using eq 12 although the enthalpy change δh0 kj mol and the entropy change δs0 kj mol k are obtained from the slope and intercept of the eq 13 what is well known is that the equilibrium constant kc must be dimensionless in this study the kc can be easily obtained as a dimensionless parameter by multiplying kl by the molecular weight of adsorbate 1000 and then 55 5 the molar concentration of pure water per liter 43 2 8 reusability evaluation of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp to further evaluate the reusability of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp a series of adsorption desorption experiments were performed 10 mg β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp were separately mixed in th solution 10 ml 100 mg l at 45 c for 12 h the th from saturated th β cd atp and th c12mim ntf2 β cd atp were ultrasonically eluted with acetone solution for 2 h at 45 c the recovered β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp were washed thoroughly with distilled water until no th was detected infiltrates and then dried at 80 c before used for the next adsorption desorption cycle each experiment was performed in triplicates and the data averaged 3 results and discussion 3 1 the structure and morphology of samples ft ir of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp are shown in fig 2 a for c12mim ntf2 β cd atp the peaks at 3400 3550 cm 1 are respectively caused by the adsorbed water and crystal water in the atp tunnel in comparison with the raw atp the band intensities observed at 2930 cm 1 and 2860 cm 1 for β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp are much stronger these bands correspond to the stretching vibration of ch consistent with β cd the characteristic peaks located at 1398 cm 1 is derived from the bending vibration of ch bond in β cd 45 the absorbance at 1350 cm 1 is ascribed to the ch stretching vibration of the alkyl group on the nitrogen atom of the imidazolium ring the emerging peaks at 1470 cm 1and 1196 cm 1 can be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of oso in oso these results may indicate the coexistence of the structures of c12mim ntf2 and β cd the xrd spectra of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp are shown in fig 2 b characteristic peaks at 8 3o 21 04o 26 83o 31 02o and 35 29o are well matched with the attapulgite crystal structure and the peaks at 8 3o 21 04o 26 83o 31 02o and 35 29o correspond to the crystallographic planes of the 020 100 101 104 and 007 respectively after modification with β cd and c12mim ntf2 the basal spacing at 31 2o for atp shift from 0 286 nm to 0 303 nm at 29 4o meanwhile comparison of the xrd pattern of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp reveals no obvious differences between the scattering peaks of these two compounds these data indicate that the crystalline structure of atp has not changed during the grafting process and its diffraction peaks were gradually diminished as the modification process progressed further the xrd data provide evidence that c12mim ntf2 β cd atp exists as an aggregate and is covered with the hydrophobic ionic liquids in order to further confirm the chemical composition and chemical bonding of the surface elements of the prepared samples xps analysis was performed which is a powerful method to detect the surface chemical states and element types as shown in fig 3 a the main surface elements of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp were c n o si and mg the c1s and o1s high resolution of atp xps spectra were demonstrated in fig 3 b the c1s spectrum of atp with the functional groups of cc 284 8 ev cn 286 4 ev and oc 289 7 ev and o1s spectrum fig 3c presents the atp sio2 al2o3 and mgo corresponding to 531 9 ev 46 similarly the c1s xps spectrum of β cd atp fig 3d contains two functional group of cc 283 ev and nch 285 ev 47 while o1s xps spectrum fig 3e detects co 530 2 ev and co 531 1 ev tem was performed to observe the morphologies of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp as shown in the fig 4 a the typical structure of atp nanorods is in a single state and some of them interwoven structure between the rods fig 4b showed that the synthesized β cd atp was agglomerated which may be attributed to β cd graft onto atp further changing its microstructure the micrograph of c12mim ntf2 β cd atp was observed as a crystalline ionic liquid morphology in fig 4c which is due to the morphological changes caused by the c12mim ntf2 ionic liquid covering the β cd atp surface in according with the xrd results 3 2 bet and tg analysis the thermal stability and degradation of samples were evaluated by tga as shown in fig 5 in the initial step below 180 c the mass of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp were decreased to 93 33 95 51 and 96 71 respectively which were attributed to the loss of atp surface adsorption water 48 in a second phase thermal degradation started at 360 c 185 c and 220 c for atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp respectively the last stage of degradation showed a slow decomposition of the residues with 82 39 69 16 and 73 96 residual masses of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp respectively which indicated that the samples were thermally stable the isotherm in fig 6 a shows that the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the three materials can be classified as type iv curves which is a feature of evident slitshaped mesopores the slow increase in adsorption capacity at intermediate relative pressure can be attributed to the increase in the thickness of the adsorption layer 49 the observable adsorption at high relative pressure 0 6 p p0 1 0 indicates that capillary condensation has occurred in addition the nl dft pore size distribution and specific surface area of the adsorbent were shown in the fig 6 b and table s1 respectively from the fig 6 b we can obviously observe that the size of most pores in β cd atp is concentrated within 2 05 nm 2 6 nm compared with atp the average pore diameter of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp increased to 17 76 nm and 18 79 nm respectively furthermore the large pore diameter of β cd atp is due to the grafting and polymerization of β cd molecules on the surface of atp forming a large number of pores 50 meanwhile organic molecules will significantly reduce their specific surface area after entering the atp pores the specific surface areas of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp have decreased to 18 38 m2 g and 18 13 m2 g respectively which is produced by the structure and size effects of the modifier molecule 3 3 effects of adsorbents dosage and initial ph value the th adsorption on the atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp were displayed in the fig 7 the β cd atp adsorption capacity gradually decreased with the increase of the adsorbent dosage in fig 6 b as the β cd atp content increases from 1 g l to 4 g l the th adsorption capacity of β cd atp decreases sharply from 37 49 mg g to 13 98 mg g when the β cd atp dose is 4 g l the decreasing rate of th load capacity slows significantly this is because the amount of adsorbent is too much to reach adsorption saturation with fixed th concentration during the adsorption process secondly when the adsorbent dose of β cd atp gradually increased the removal rate of th tended to be higher because of the increased surface area and active sites meanwhile the adsorption capacity and removal rates of th by atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp in fig 7 a and fig 7 c showed a similar trend to that of β cd atp the ph of the solution is important parameter in adsorption process since it can consecutively affect surface property of adsorbent and ionization degree of adsorbate fig 7 shows the initial ph value on the th adsorption on the atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp it can be seen that the final ph is usually higher than the initial ph as fig 8 a displays the adsorption capacity of atp for th is hardly affected in the ph range from 1 to 10 the adsorptions of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp exhibit similar curve trend and both adsorbents had excellent load performance for th in the experimental ph range in fig 8 b and in fig 8 c meanwhile the adsorption of the adsorbents increase with the increase of ph and reached to maximum at ph 9 0 for β cd atp 52 46 mg g and at ph 8 0 for c12mim ntf2 β cd atp 45 76 mg g 3 4 adsorption kinetics the effects of contact time on the adsorption process of tested th are displayed in fig 9 according to fig 9 a the optimal contact time for th sorption is 60 min and increase precipitously to 95 of maximum adsorption within the first 150 min this occurrence is in consequence of abundant empty adsorption active sites at initial time 51 afterward the adsorption amount increases gradually until equilibrium at 240 min and small changes appears with contact time increasing which is due to the presence of adsorption saturation sites 52 corresponding kinetics parameter values are summarized in table s2 comparison with the pseudo first order model fig 9b the pseudo second order model plots fig 8c display superior linearity and close coherence correlation coefficients r2 for the pseudo second order model are all 0 997 while the pseudo first order model r2 are less 0 589 in addition qe cal values derived from the pseudo second order kinetic model fitting well with the experimental qe exp values the result showed that the adsorption behaviour for th can be defined by the pseudo second order model indicating that the adsorption process was dominated by chemisorption such as the cavity inclusion for β cd and the n π π interaction of ionic liquid 53 54 based on the principle recommended by weber and morris 55 the internal diffusion is the only rate limiting step when the internal diffusion model shows a straight line the adsorption process is determined by two or more factors when the fitted data exhibit a multilinear plots it can be inferred that the intraparticle diffusion model is not well fitted by the r2 values of the adsorbents in table s2 fig 9 d illustrates that intraparticle diffusion is not the only rate controlling step in the adsorption process since the intraparticle diffusion model has been divided into two parts and neither crosses the coordinate origin 3 5 adsorption isotherms to measure the adsorption effect of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp for th at different temperatures 298 308 and 318 k the equilibrium adsorption isotherms were investigated at different initial th concentration from 20 mg l to 140 mg l and the results were illustrated in fig 10 an upward trend in pesticide binding is observed when the solution temperature rises from 298 k to 318 k which indicates that the adsorption process is essentially endothermic furthermore the load amount of th enhances progressively with increasing initial concentrations which is attributed to the concentration gradient driving force in addition it is clear that β cd atp shows better adsorption compared to atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp at 298 k 308 k and 318 k the corresponding parameter values for the three adsorption isotherm models are shown in table 1 in contrast the freundlich adsorption isotherm model fits better with experimental values based on higher r2 values signifying the adsorption of th onto the atp was possibly a heterogeneous and multilayer adsorption system consequently molecules beyond one layer are contained by the adsorbent and the adsorbed molecules are not all in contact with the adsorbent surface 56 furthermore it can be deduced from the freundlich isotherm model that the adsorption capacity of th onto materials will improve with the improving of the th concentration in the solution it is noteworthy that the maximum adsorption of initial concentration 140 mg l th solution on β cd atp was 73 45 mg g in fig 10a at 318 k compared to atp 24 58 mg g in fig 10e and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp 55 42 mg g in fig 10i in addition the e values of d r model were all 16 kj mol indicating that the adsorption process of the three adsorbents was dominated by chemical adsorption which was in agreement with the kinetic fitting results as anticipated the adsorption effect of three adsorbents on th displayed the following order β cd atp c12mim ntf2 β cd atp atp fig 10 and table 1 such as the maximum langmuir theoretical adsorption capacity th at 318 k followed the order β cd atp qmax 160 06 mg g c12mim ntf2 β cd atp 141 4 mg g atp 49 04 mg g apart from that the adsorption effect of the β cd atp 85 93 160 06 mg g for th was significantly higher than that of c12mim ntf2 β cd atp 74 4 141 4 mg g this difference might be ascribed to the aggregation caused by the ionic liquid covering the surface of β cd atp which hinders the interaction between the β cd cavity structure and th molecules 45 to get a further insight into the addition of ionic liquid display lower adsorption compared with β cd atp a reasonable speculation on the process of th adsorption by β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp was made based on the kinetic and isotherm studies described above according to fig 11 the reason why c12mim ntf2 β cd atp observed lower th adsorption capacity than β cd atp was that the alkyl chain of c12mim ntf2 ionic liquid covered the β cd atp surface and thus prevented β cd from interacting with th the c12mim ntf2 introduction did not act synergistically with β cd atp on adsorption th and its only weakly interacted with th all of these results were consistent with the tem and xrd results the possible adsorption mechanisms towards th on β cd atp can be divided into three aspects firstly th reacted with surface hydroxyl groups of atp to form stable complexes secondly β cd can form cavity compound with th finally complexation of th with the β cd hydroxyl group plays an important role during sorption all in all the introduction of β cd can provide a synergistic effect which can effectively adsorb th 3 6 adsorption thermodynamics the effects of system temperature on the adsorption of atp β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp on th are shown in fig 11 and table 2 apparently the adsorption amounts of three adsorbents were raised as the temperature improved the th adsorption can be explained by standard free energy change δg0 enthalpy change δh0 and entropy change δs0 the thermodynamic parameters of adsorbate th onto three materials are listed in table 2 δg0 values is negative in all experimental temperatures which indicates that the th adsorption process is spontaneous meanwhile positive δs0 values indicate that the increased randomness at the solid liquid phase during the th adsorption process in addition positive δh0 values represent that the adsorption system is endothermic in nature which was confirmed by an growth in the adsorption capacity fig 11 and the equilibrium constant table 2 at a greater temperature 3 7 recycling and stability of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp the recovery and stability of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp are critical from the viewpoint of economic value and environmental protection as shown in fig 12 the adsorption of β cd atp on th can still reach over 91 of the initial adsorption capacity after six sequential cycles compared to β cd atp the removal efficiency of th by c12mim ntf2 β cd atp decreased from 76 to 69 which was attributed to large reduction of binding sites overall β cd atp has excellent stability and reusability during adsorption desorption process making it a great potential in practical applications 4 conclusion this β cd atp nanocomposite was prepared by grafting method and then c12mim ntf2 β cd atp was obtained by immobilizing ionic liquid on the surface of β cd atp after synthesis this novel β cd atp polymerized polysaccharide nanoparticle was found to be an effective adsorbent for removal th from real water samples the prepared β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp were characterized by ft ir xrd xps bet tem and tga the results showed that β cd and c12mim ntf2 were well grafted to atp and β cd atp nanoparticles respectively compared with atp 106 38 m2 g the specific surface areas of β cd atp and c12mim ntf2 β cd atp have decreased to 18 38 m2 g and 18 13 m2 g respectively the optimum ph initial concentration and adsorbent dosage for β cd atp were 9 100 mg l and 0 01 g respectively the adsorption process can be described by the freundlich model and the pseudo second order kinetic the maximum capacity of langmuir isotherm of three adsorbents on th at 318 k displayed the following order β cd atp 160 06 mg g c12mim ntf2 β cd atp 141 mg g atp 49 04 mg g the gibbs free energy δg0 and standard enthalpy change δh0 demonstrated that the adsorption was spontaneous endothermic process in nature and increasingly random δs0 in addition β cd atp showed satisfactory reusability and stability over six cycles of adsorption desorption overall β cd atp offers a significant adsorption capacity appropriate reusability and temperature dependent control and has certain advantages and potential in the practical application system declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exists in the submission of this manuscript and enclosed manuscript is approved

12439,even low concentrations of nano sized silica particles should be effectively removed from chemical mechanical polishing cmp wastewater as they can corrode the pipes in semiconductor manufacturing processes in this study we systematically investigated the factors affecting the silica removal efficiency using ceramic nanofiltration nf membranes under different conditions to remove nano sized dissolved silica which is difficult with conventional microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf membranes a tubular ceramic nf membrane with an average pore size of approximately 946 da 1 3 nm was strongly negatively charged at ph values above 4 0 indicating the existence of repulsive forces between the membrane and monoanionic silica h3sio4 under basic ph conditions as the ph level increased from 4 to 12 retention increased from 10 6 to 62 0 and it also increased with increasing concentration of dissolved silica and applied pressure we also investigated the effect of combined salt solutions kcl k2so4 cacl2 or caso4 on the removal efficiency for dissolved silica to better understand the mechanism for underlying the operating conditions when dissolved silica was the only contaminant in the solution 61 6 was removed however the presence of cations such as ca2 with higher valence reduced the removal efficiency by up to 20 5 the presence of calcium compounds that bonded to higher valence anions had a greater impact on the removal efficiency for dissolved silica our findings can serve as guidance for the selection of suitable coagulants and the improvement of the membrane performance through fine control strategies in semiconductor wastewater treatment processes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ceramic nanofiltration membrane co existing ion combined salt solution dissolved silica semiconductor wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as the global demand for semiconductor devices continues to increase the semiconductor industry and its associated wastewater treatment problems are attracting increasing attention the composition of the generated wastewater depends on the chemicals used in each semiconductor manufacturing process with chemical mechanical polishing cmp wastewater being one of the representative types of discharged wastewater the cmp process which is crucial for improving product quality is mainly used in the manufacture of microchips and integrated circuits it requires more than 40 of the ultrapure water used in the entire semiconductor manufacturing process 1 5 the significant amounts of cmp wastewater contain high concentrations of nano sized particles such as silica sio2 and alumina 6 9 silica must be removed as it causes scale formation in distribution pipes and maintenance problems in wastewater treatment 10 12 in cmp wastewater a large amount of silica is dissolved owing to its high solubility 13 16 because dissolved silica particles aggregate and form colloidal silica particles as the concentration increases both types of silica particles should be removed researchers have studied several methods for treating cmp wastewater including adsorption to metal hydroxides and electrocoagulation with filtration 17 18 however these methods have deficiencies in terms of cost and energy efficiency despite removing approximately 80 to 90 of the silica content 19 researchers have also thoroughly studied lime softening 20 22 in which coagulation and filtration are used to remove over 80 of silica coagulation is an effective pre treatment method that reduces the possibility of contamination and maintains high permeability during filtration 23 25 in general a combination of coagulation and filtration with calcium based coagulants such as cao ca oh 2 and cacl2 is widely applied to remove colloidal silica 26 28 the solubility of silica varies greatly depending on the conditions such as the ph level temperature and pressure at a ph level of 7 and standard ambient temperature and pressure the solubility of silica is approximately 120 mg l it can increase at a ph level of 10 or higher since silica is mostly found in dissociated form 29 the ph level also affects the form of silica present in water a ph level of 7 results in particulate silica such as h4sio4 or sio2 whereas a ph level of 11 results in monoanionic h3sio4 which is a form of dissolved silica however adding calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 which is the most commonly used coagulant to semiconductor wastewater increases the ph level and solubility of silica thereby converting colloidal silica into dissolved silica 30 31 the aggregation mechanism of ca oh 2 involves momentarily changing colloidal silica into an ionic form and then combining it with injected ca2 to form casio3 32 as the ph level increases owing to the use of coagulants removing the remaining colloidal silica increases the concentration of dissolved silica therefore the treatment of dissolved silica beyond colloidal silica in the existing treatment methods in which the removal efficiency for colloidal silica is insufficient requires further attention membrane filtration is a viable option it is a straightforward and low energy method that does not require phase change or chemical additives 33 membranes can be categorized into two types polymer and ceramic membranes based on their material structure at high ph values polymeric membranes may exhibit broader and larger pores owing to dehydrofluorination reactions which produce carbon carbon double and triple bonds upon the interaction with hydrofluoric acid hf molecules thereby ultimately weakening the membrane structure 33 35 consequently the stability of polymeric membranes may decline which increases permeability and decreases retention 36 37 by contrast ceramic membranes which have been studied less thoroughly than polymeric ones owing to their high cost and technical difficulties are made of inorganic materials such as alumina oxides and titania 38 40 ceramic membranes exhibit superior durability mechanical strength and chemical thermal and physical stability compared to polymeric membranes therefore they can resist harsh environments and are ideal candidates for treating industrial wastewater such as semiconductor wastewater 41 43 regarding filtration with membranes based on the pore size ultrafiltration uf membranes can eliminate high molecular weight substances such as bacteria colloids and small particulates through size exclusion in the current wastewater treatment process only colloidal silica is removed with uf membranes 44 46 as discussed earlier because the removal of dissolved silica is also imperative treating semiconductor wastewater with commercially available uf membranes has its limitations dissolved silica particles are much smaller approximately 96 g mol than colloidal silica particles and their negative charge cannot be exploited by the uf membrane which mainly dominates based on size exclusion with relatively large pores by contrast nanofiltration nf membranes can remove even low molecular weight substances because this mechanism excludes other ions by interacting with their charges 47 49 hence dissolved silica can be readily removed by ceramic nf membranes via donnan exclusion because they possess the same negative charge as the surfaces of dissolved silica particles in this study we critically assessed the feasibility and practicality of commercial ceramic nf membranes in removing dissolved silica that cannot be removed by low pressure driven membranes we thoroughly investigated the physicochemical surface properties of commercial ceramic nf membranes to assess their potential and limitations for the treatment of semiconductor wastewater moreover we studied the rejection of dissolved silica with respect to the feed water characteristics and operating conditions the several key mechanisms responsible for the rejection of dissolved silica with several important co existing ions are discussed to provide optimal fine control conditions for the desired membrane performance finally we examined a wide variety of combined salt solutions to

commercially available ceramic nf membrane inopor nano scheßlitz germany was used to investigate the retention behavior for dissolved silica and the impact of different combined salt solutions the filtration experiments were conducted with a single channel ceramic nf tubular membrane with 250mm length and 10mm diameter which was operated in the inside out filtration mode the effective surface area was 5 5 10 3 m2 in addition the multi layered ceramic nf membrane had a tio2 active layer and an al2o3 support layer with a molecular weight cut off mwco of 200da and 30 to 40 porosity according to the manufacturer the ceramic nf membrane pore sizes were determined by measuring the retention for polyethylene glycol peg sigma aldrich st louis mo with molecular weights of 200 300 600 1000 and 1500 g mol prepared at 3 0 g l the mwco represents 90 retention for the solutes 50 52 the peg retention of the ceramic nf membrane was determined by the non purgeable organic carbon concentration of

dissolved silica solution we prepared different combined salt solutions with concentrations of 0 01 0 1 and 1 0 mm 2 3 filtration experiments with ceramic nf membrane we employed a bench scale crossflow ceramic nf membrane filtration unit that is identical to the one used in our previous study 43 the unit consisted of a 5 l feed reservoir with an automated temperature controller a ceramic nf membrane module a high pressure pump hyosung pump co ltd dangjin korea two pressure gauges and a flow meter fig s1 the filtration experiments were carried out at different hydraulic pressures 5 15 bar by adjusting a pressure regulator placed in a retentate line to fine tune the transmembrane pressure a back pressure regulator was installed in the retentate line each filtration experiment was

naocl 6 14 samchun pure chemical pyeongtaek korea followed by rinsing with di water three times until recovery to the initial flux was confirmed the removal efficiency for dissolved silica r was

concentrations generated from the different combined salt solutions were analyzed via ion chromatography ic basic ic plus metrohm herisau switzerland to determine the retention behavior and removal efficiency of the ceramic nf membranes 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ceramic nf membrane to better understand the retention mechanism of the ceramic nf membrane for dissolved silica we examined its structural and chemical properties as it was operated in the inside out filtration mode we performed fe sem analysis to investigate the internal surface of the membrane analyzing the structural properties of a ceramic nf membrane requires systematically investigating the composition of the membrane surface layers and the pore size fig 1 presents the fe sem images of the ceramic nf membrane the cross sectional view reveals three distinct layers an active layer tio2 an intermediate layer tio2 and a support layer al2o3 the chemical composition of each layer of the ceramic nf membrane was provided by the manufacturer the thickness of the active layer which plays a vital role in the separation process was found to be approximately 932 nm in agreement with the values presented in previous studies 43 57 to determine the average pore size of the ceramic nf membrane we employed peg solutions of five different mwcos the results of the peg retention experiment are shown in fig 2 a which presents the cumulative log normal distribution function the retention efficiency results for the peg solutions with mwcos of 1000 and 1500 g mol exceeded 89 7 and 95 4 respectively the average pore size of the ceramic nf membrane was approximately 1 3 nm according to the conversion of the mwco 946 da corresponding to 90 peg retention eq 1 although it was slightly larger than the average pore size 200 da provided by the membrane manufacturer it was still within the typical range of nf membrane pore sizes 200 1000 da 58 we hypothesize that charge induced donnan exclusion is the primary mechanism responsible for removing dissolved silica owing to the existence of negatively charged ions at high ph values to confirm this we measured the zeta potential of the ceramic nf membrane surface as a function of the ph value fig 2 b accordingly the zeta potential became increasingly negative beyond the isoelectric point phiep 3 7 and it was approximately 32 1 1 6 mv at ph 10 when a coagulant was used the ph level generally increased to 11 12 thereby increasing the zeta potential of the ceramic nf membrane to 38 5 1 2 mv at ph 12 the resulting strong electrical repulsion between the surface of the membrane and dissolved silica which was mostly due to the monoanionic h3sio4 ions at high ph levels resulted in a more effective retention of dissolved silica therefore the increasingly negative zeta potential of the membrane surface with increasing ph value can promote the retention of contaminants with the same negative charge 59 3 2 effect of feed water characteristics to investigate how the removal efficiency varied according to the concentration of dissolved silica in the feed water a solution with dissolved silica only was prepared with sodium metasilicate na2sio3 at concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 10 0 mm the filtration experiments were conducted with a standard nf membrane at 10 bar without adjusting the ph level fig 3 subsequently the effect of changes in the ph level on the removal efficiency for dissolved silica was evaluated for feed water with 1 0 mm dissolved silica this is because dissolved silica in semiconductor wastewater can change their form depending on the ph level of the water the removal efficiency for dissolved silica increased as the feed concentration increased however there was no significant change in the removal efficiency at concentrations above 2 5 mm increasing the sodium silicate concentration resulted in a slight increase in the ph level owing to the loss of alkalinity and the dissolution of the alkaline chemical agent 60 this increased their solubility in the aqueous solution 29 when the concentration of dissolved silica is below its solubility limit silica dissolves proportionally as the feed concentration increases and the concentration in the permeate remains relatively constant therefore the removal efficiency increased with increasing feed concentration in this study to investigate further the impact of changes in the ph level the removal efficiency for dissolved silica was systematically evaluated at a fixed feed concentration of 1 0 mm and 10 bar while the removal efficiency was 10 6 at a ph level of 4 the removal efficiency increased steadily with increasing ph level reaching 74 5 at a ph level of 12 fig 3 this is because dissolved silica converts from neutral h4sio4 into monovalent h3sio4 and divalent h2sio4 2 anions as the ph level increases thereby increasing the electrical repulsive force between the membrane surface and dissolved silica 30 this improves the removal efficiency for dissolved silica 3 3 effect of operating conditions the removal efficiency for dissolved silica by ceramic nf membranes was investigated under various operating conditions using feed water with a representative composition of effluent from the multi stage coagulation and precipitation processes in semiconductor wastewater it typically contains 1 0 mm of dissolved silica and has a ph level of 11 commonly 5 15 bar pressure is applied to ceramic nf membranes this factor which can be easily controlled by operators is related to the maintenance cost of the membrane system the removal efficiency of the ceramic nf membrane for dissolved silica slightly increased from 61 4 to 66 0 when the applied pressure steadily increased from 5 to 15 bar fig 4 this is due to the compressive effect of the applied pressure on the membrane which increases the retention of dissolve silica 61 when the applied pressure increases the permeate water flux through the membrane increases while the ion flux remains virtually unchanged the resulting lower solute concentration in the permeate has an additional dilution effect on the permeate concentration 62 according to the results of this experiment the removal efficiency for dissolved silica increased slightly as the water flux increased from 5 5 0 6 to 23 8 0 3 l m 2 h 1 from 5 to 15 bar the water permeability remained almost constant 1 5 0 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 despite the increased applied pressure because the removal efficiency did not change significantly the membrane can be operated at low pressure to save energy the removal efficiency exceeds 60 even when the applied pressure is only 5 bar we expect that the dissolved silica concentration in the final effluent remains below 0 4 mm 40 mg l which can be maintained at acceptable levels to avoid the formation of silica based deposits 63 no silica scaling was observed and the water permeate flux did not significantly decrease during the experimental period however it should be noted that the silica scaling or fouling may occur during long term operation therefore future research should investigate the long term stability of silica scaling in ceramic nf membrane filtration under various operating conditions including real semiconductor wastewaters to broaden the range of practical applications 3 4 effect of combined salt solution many chemical agents including coagulants are commonly used in the treatment of semiconductor wastewater in this study we investigated the effect of various ion types and their concentrations on the removal efficiency for dissolved silica in ceramic nf membrane filtration the experiments were performed with combined salt solutions containing mono and di valent ions which are commonly used as coagulants or ph adjusters to process semiconductor wastewater when each combined salt solution was added to a solution containing only dissolved silica the removal efficiency for dissolved silica decreased with increasing concentration of combined salt regardless of the type of ions in addition it decreased with increasing ionic strength in the following order caso4 cacl2 k2so4 and kcl fig 5 in particular the addition of caso4 resulted in a significant decrease in the removal efficiency for dissolved silica whereas it was less affected by the addition of kcl this can be attributed to the different ion types of kcl monovalent ions and caso4 divalent ions divalent cations ca2 were found to be more effective in neutralizing the negative charge on the membrane surface than monovalent cations k consequently the repulsive force between the anion and membrane surface decreased significantly 64 66 this was also evidenced by the fact that cacl2 divalent cations decreased the retention for dissolved silica more than kcl and k2so4 monovalent cations furthermore based on the removal efficiency of each ion type in the presence of cacl2 and caso4 divalent anions so4 2 resulted in a greater removal efficiency than monovalent anions cl owing to the greater repulsive force at the membrane surface the dissolved silica in the form of monovalent anions h3sio4 with relatively weak negative charges at a ph level of 11 passed through the membrane and maintained in the permeate electroneutral which resulted in the lower retention for dissolved silica similar results were observed even in the presence of a combined salt solution kcl and k2so4 fig s2 overall the removal efficiency for dissolved silica decreased as the ionic strength of the combined salt solutions increased because a high ionic strength can compress the double layer of a charged solute or a charged membrane surface thereby reducing the electrostatic interaction 67 69 3 5 effect of electrolyte ionic composition it was observed that the presence of higher valence counterions ca2 significantly decreased the removal efficiency for dissolved silica the transport of each ion type was analyzed to investigate which one has a major impact on the removal of dissolved silica in combined salt solutions composed of ca2 thus we performed ceramic nf membrane filtration experiments by mixing 2 1 cacl2 and 2 2 caso4 electrolytes with the solution containing dissolved silica each solution had the same ionic strength first we compared the effects of the ions in the 2 1 electrolyte and those in the solution with the dissolved silica only on the removal efficiency fig 6 depicts the concentration changes and removal efficiency of each ion type ca2 cl na and h3sio4 before and after ceramic nf membrane filtration in the presence of cacl2 with dissolved silica at ionic strengths of 0 1 and 1 0 mm when 1 0 mm dissolved silica was filtered with the ceramic nf membrane the removal efficiency was 61 6 0 8 however when 0 1 mm cacl2 was present the removal efficiency decreased to 28 4 when 1 0 mm cacl2 was used it further decreased to 24 4 evidently cacl2 interferes with the removal of h3sio4 ions as the ionic strength of cacl2 increases electrical double layer repulsion should decrease thereby resulting in a slight decrease in the removal efficiency for co ions cl and h3sio4 in addition the removal efficiency for counterions ca2 and na decreased significantly to maintain the electroneutrality in bulk solution fig 7 shows the concentration changes and removal efficiency of each ion type ca2 so4 2 na and h3sio4 before and after ceramic nf membrane filtration in the presence of caso4 with dissolved silica at ionic strengths of 0 1 and 1 0 mm similar to the retention behavior for the cacl2 solution the removal efficiency for co ions so4 2 decreased from 77 1 at 0 1 mm to 33 8 at 1 0 mm and the removal efficiency for counterion ca2 decreased from 91 1 to 11 3 owing to decreased electrical double layer repulsion consequently the removal efficiency for dissolved silica decreased to 27 1 and 20 5 as the concentration of caso4 increased to 0 1 and 1 0 mm respectively thus h3sio4 ions passed through the ceramic nf membrane the ceramic nf membrane showed a better rejection efficiency for dissolved silica with higher valence co ions so4 2 than with cl ions higher valence counterions ca2 were also rejected more efficiently at different ionic strengths i e kcl cacl2 fig 5 the removal efficiency for co ions so4 2 was 77 1 which was significantly higher than that for monovalent co ions cl 7 9 in the experiment with cacl2 at 0 1 mm ionic strength in addition the counterions ca2 remained in the feed bulk solution to maintain the electroneutrality of higher valence so4 2 ions thereby promoting the transport of dissolved silica h3sio4 toward the permeate because the observed trends do not agree with the size of the hydrated ions charge exclusion is the predominant mechanism for dissolved silica removal with the studied ceramic nf membrane 70 71 ceramic nf membrane filtration processes could be implemented in the downstream of multi stage coagulation precipitation processes in actual industrial wastewater treatment plants however since calcium based coagulants and sulfuric acid are used to adjust the ph level residual ca2 or so4 2 ions can be introduced into the ceramic nf membrane these ions can negatively affect the removal efficiency for dissolved silica in semiconductor wastewater 4 conclusions we investigated the effects of the feed water characteristics operating conditions and combined salt solutions which can be generated from different chemical compounds used in semiconductor wastewater treatment processes on the removal efficiency of a commercially available ceramic nf membrane for dissolved silica in this study the ceramic nf membrane surface was negatively charged under basic ph conditions and the dissolved silica in the feed water existed in the form of monoanionic h3sio4 as the ph level increased the monoanionic h3sio4 increased the electrical repulsion and ultimately increased the removal efficiency for dissolved silica in addition an increasing applied pressure increased the removal efficiency and the presence of calcium ions ca2 with higher valence had a significant impact on the decrease in their retention regarding the calcium based combined salt solutions higher valence sulfate ions so4 2 affected the removal of dissolved silica more than chloride ions cl researchers should consider the further optimization of the control process for the desired membrane performance and investigate the impact of other chemicals that commonly co exist in semiconductor wastewater during longer tests we believe that our preliminary studies provide helpful guidance for the treatment of silica containing wastewater and that the results prove the practicality of ceramic nf membranes for semiconductor wastewater credit authorship contribution statement yeon so conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft

12439,even low concentrations of nano sized silica particles should be effectively removed from chemical mechanical polishing cmp wastewater as they can corrode the pipes in semiconductor manufacturing processes in this study we systematically investigated the factors affecting the silica removal efficiency using ceramic nanofiltration nf membranes under different conditions to remove nano sized dissolved silica which is difficult with conventional microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf membranes a tubular ceramic nf membrane with an average pore size of approximately 946 da 1 3 nm was strongly negatively charged at ph values above 4 0 indicating the existence of repulsive forces between the membrane and monoanionic silica h3sio4 under basic ph conditions as the ph level increased from 4 to 12 retention increased from 10 6 to 62 0 and it also increased with increasing concentration of dissolved silica and applied pressure we also investigated the effect of combined salt solutions kcl k2so4 cacl2 or caso4 on the removal efficiency for dissolved silica to better understand the mechanism for underlying the operating conditions when dissolved silica was the only contaminant in the solution 61 6 was removed however the presence of cations such as ca2 with higher valence reduced the removal efficiency by up to 20 5 the presence of calcium compounds that bonded to higher valence anions had a greater impact on the removal efficiency for dissolved silica our findings can serve as guidance for the selection of suitable coagulants and the improvement of the membrane performance through fine control strategies in semiconductor wastewater treatment processes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ceramic nanofiltration membrane co existing ion combined salt solution dissolved silica semiconductor wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as the global demand for semiconductor devices continues to increase the semiconductor industry and its associated wastewater treatment problems are attracting increasing attention the composition of the generated wastewater depends on the chemicals used in each semiconductor manufacturing process with chemical mechanical polishing cmp wastewater being one of the representative types of discharged wastewater the cmp process which is crucial for improving product quality is mainly used in the manufacture of microchips and integrated circuits it requires more than 40 of the ultrapure water used in the entire semiconductor manufacturing process 1 5 the significant amounts of cmp wastewater contain high concentrations of nano sized particles such as silica sio2 and alumina 6 9 silica must be removed as it causes scale formation in distribution pipes and maintenance problems in wastewater treatment 10 12 in cmp wastewater a large amount of silica is dissolved owing to its high solubility 13 16 because dissolved silica particles aggregate and form colloidal silica particles as the concentration increases both types of silica particles should be removed researchers have studied several methods for treating cmp wastewater including adsorption to metal hydroxides and electrocoagulation with filtration 17 18 however these methods have deficiencies in terms of cost and energy efficiency despite removing approximately 80 to 90 of the silica content 19 researchers have also thoroughly studied lime softening 20 22 in which coagulation and filtration are used to remove over 80 of silica coagulation is an effective pre treatment method that reduces the possibility of contamination and maintains high permeability during filtration 23 25 in general a combination of coagulation and filtration with calcium based coagulants such as cao ca oh 2 and cacl2 is widely applied to remove colloidal silica 26 28 the solubility of silica varies greatly depending on the conditions such as the ph level temperature and pressure at a ph level of 7 and standard ambient temperature and pressure the solubility of silica is approximately 120 mg l it can increase at a ph level of 10 or higher since silica is mostly found in dissociated form 29 the ph

respectively the average pore size of the ceramic nf membrane was approximately 1 3 nm according to the conversion of the mwco 946 da corresponding to 90 peg retention eq 1 although it was slightly larger than the average pore size 200 da provided by the membrane manufacturer it was still within the typical range of nf membrane pore sizes 200 1000 da 58 we hypothesize that charge induced donnan exclusion is the primary mechanism responsible for removing dissolved silica owing to the existence of negatively charged ions at high ph values to confirm this we measured the zeta potential of the ceramic nf membrane surface as a function of the ph value fig 2 b accordingly the zeta potential became increasingly negative beyond the isoelectric point phiep 3 7 and it was approximately 32 1 1 6 mv at ph 10 when a coagulant was used the ph level generally increased to 11 12 thereby increasing the zeta potential of the ceramic nf membrane to 38 5 1 2 mv at ph 12 the resulting strong electrical repulsion between the surface of the membrane and dissolved silica which was mostly due to the monoanionic h3sio4 ions at high ph levels resulted in a more effective retention of dissolved silica therefore the increasingly negative zeta potential of the membrane surface with increasing ph value can promote the retention of contaminants with the same negative charge 59 3 2 effect of feed water characteristics to investigate how the removal efficiency varied according to the concentration of dissolved silica in the feed water a solution with dissolved silica only was prepared with sodium metasilicate na2sio3 at concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 10 0 mm the filtration experiments were conducted with a standard nf membrane at 10 bar without adjusting the ph level fig 3 subsequently the effect of changes in the ph level on the removal efficiency for dissolved silica was evaluated for feed water with 1 0 mm dissolved silica this is because dissolved silica in semiconductor wastewater can change their form depending on the ph level of the water the removal efficiency for dissolved silica increased as the feed concentration increased however there was no significant change in the removal efficiency at concentrations above 2 5 mm increasing the sodium silicate concentration resulted in a slight increase in the ph level owing to the loss of alkalinity and the dissolution of the alkaline chemical agent 60 this increased their solubility in the aqueous solution 29 when the concentration of dissolved silica is below its solubility limit silica dissolves proportionally as the feed concentration increases and the concentration in the permeate remains relatively constant therefore the removal efficiency increased with increasing feed concentration in this study to investigate further the impact of changes in the ph level the removal efficiency for dissolved silica was systematically evaluated at a fixed feed concentration of 1 0 mm and 10 bar while the removal efficiency was 10 6 at a ph level of 4 the removal efficiency increased steadily with increasing ph level reaching 74 5 at a ph level of 12 fig 3 this is because dissolved silica converts from neutral h4sio4 into monovalent h3sio4 and divalent h2sio4 2 anions as the ph level increases thereby increasing the electrical repulsive force between the membrane surface and dissolved silica 30 this improves the removal efficiency for dissolved silica 3 3 effect of operating conditions the removal efficiency for dissolved silica by ceramic nf membranes was investigated under various operating conditions using feed water with a representative composition of effluent from the multi stage coagulation and precipitation processes in semiconductor wastewater it typically contains 1 0 mm of dissolved silica and has a ph level of 11 commonly 5 15 bar pressure is applied to ceramic nf membranes this factor which can be easily controlled by operators is related to the maintenance cost of the membrane system the removal efficiency of the ceramic nf membrane for dissolved silica slightly increased from 61 4 to 66 0 when the applied pressure steadily increased from 5 to 15 bar fig 4 this is due to the compressive effect of the applied pressure on the membrane which increases the retention of dissolve silica 61 when the applied pressure increases the permeate water flux through the membrane increases while the ion flux remains virtually unchanged the resulting lower solute concentration in the permeate has an additional dilution effect on the permeate concentration 62 according to the results of this experiment the removal efficiency for dissolved silica increased slightly as the water flux increased from 5 5 0 6 to 23 8 0 3 l m 2 h 1 from 5 to 15 bar the water permeability remained almost constant 1 5 0 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 despite the increased applied pressure because the removal efficiency did not change significantly the membrane can be operated at low pressure to save energy the removal efficiency exceeds 60 even when the applied pressure is only 5 bar we expect that the dissolved silica concentration in the final effluent remains below 0 4 mm 40 mg l which can be maintained at acceptable levels to avoid the formation of silica based deposits 63 no silica scaling was observed and the water permeate flux did not significantly decrease during the experimental period however it should be noted that the silica scaling or fouling may occur during long term operation therefore future research should investigate the long term stability of silica scaling in ceramic nf membrane filtration under various operating conditions including real semiconductor wastewaters to broaden the range of practical applications 3 4 effect of combined salt solution many chemical agents including coagulants are commonly used in the treatment of semiconductor wastewater in this study we investigated the effect of various ion types and their concentrations on the removal efficiency for dissolved silica in ceramic nf membrane filtration the experiments were performed with combined salt solutions containing mono and di valent ions which are commonly used as coagulants or ph adjusters to process semiconductor wastewater when each combined salt solution was added to a solution containing only dissolved silica the removal efficiency for dissolved silica decreased with increasing concentration of combined salt regardless of the type of ions in addition it decreased with increasing ionic strength in the following order caso4 cacl2 k2so4 and kcl fig 5 in particular the addition of caso4 resulted in a significant decrease in the removal efficiency for dissolved silica whereas it was less affected by the addition of kcl this can be attributed to the different ion types of kcl monovalent ions and caso4 divalent ions divalent cations ca2 were found to be more effective in neutralizing the negative charge on the membrane surface than monovalent cations k consequently the repulsive force between the anion and membrane surface decreased significantly 64 66 this was also evidenced by the fact that cacl2 divalent cations decreased the retention for dissolved silica more than kcl and k2so4 monovalent cations furthermore based on the removal efficiency of each ion type in the presence of cacl2 and caso4 divalent anions so4 2 resulted in a greater removal efficiency than monovalent anions cl owing to the greater repulsive force at the membrane surface the dissolved silica in the form of monovalent anions h3sio4 with relatively weak negative charges at a ph level of 11 passed through the membrane and maintained in the permeate electroneutral which resulted in the lower retention for dissolved silica similar results were observed even in the presence of a combined salt solution kcl and k2so4 fig s2 overall the removal efficiency for dissolved silica decreased as the ionic strength of the combined salt solutions increased because a high ionic strength can compress the double layer of a charged solute or a charged membrane surface thereby reducing the electrostatic interaction 67 69 3 5 effect of electrolyte ionic composition it was observed that the presence of higher valence counterions ca2 significantly decreased the removal efficiency for dissolved silica the transport of each ion type was analyzed to investigate which one has a major impact on the removal of dissolved silica in combined salt solutions composed of ca2 thus we performed ceramic nf membrane filtration experiments by mixing 2 1 cacl2 and 2 2 caso4 electrolytes with the solution containing dissolved silica each solution had the same ionic strength first we compared the effects of the ions in the 2 1 electrolyte and those in the solution with the dissolved silica only on the removal efficiency fig 6 depicts the concentration changes and removal efficiency of each ion type ca2 cl na and h3sio4 before and after ceramic nf membrane filtration in the presence of cacl2 with dissolved silica at ionic strengths of 0 1 and 1 0 mm when 1 0 mm dissolved silica was filtered with the ceramic nf membrane the removal efficiency was 61 6 0 8 however when 0 1 mm cacl2 was present the removal efficiency decreased to 28 4 when 1 0 mm cacl2 was used it further decreased to 24 4 evidently cacl2 interferes with the removal of h3sio4 ions as the ionic strength of cacl2 increases electrical double layer repulsion should decrease thereby resulting in a slight decrease in the removal efficiency for co ions cl and h3sio4 in addition the removal efficiency for counterions ca2 and na decreased significantly to maintain the electroneutrality in bulk solution fig 7 shows the concentration changes and removal efficiency of each ion type ca2 so4 2 na and h3sio4 before and after ceramic nf membrane filtration in the presence of caso4 with dissolved silica at ionic strengths of 0 1 and 1 0 mm similar to the retention behavior for the cacl2 solution the removal efficiency for co ions so4 2 decreased from 77 1 at 0 1 mm to 33 8 at 1 0 mm and the removal efficiency for counterion ca2 decreased from 91 1 to 11 3 owing to decreased electrical double layer repulsion consequently the removal efficiency for dissolved silica decreased to 27 1 and 20 5 as the concentration of caso4 increased to 0 1 and 1 0 mm respectively thus h3sio4 ions passed through the ceramic nf membrane the ceramic nf membrane showed a better rejection efficiency for dissolved silica with higher valence co ions so4 2 than with cl ions higher valence counterions ca2 were also rejected more efficiently at different ionic strengths i e kcl cacl2 fig 5 the removal efficiency for co ions so4 2 was 77 1 which was significantly higher than that for monovalent co ions cl 7 9 in the experiment with cacl2 at 0 1 mm ionic strength in addition the counterions ca2 remained in the feed bulk solution to maintain the electroneutrality of higher valence so4 2 ions thereby promoting the transport of dissolved silica h3sio4 toward the permeate because the observed trends do not agree with the size of the hydrated ions charge exclusion is the predominant mechanism for dissolved silica removal with the studied ceramic nf membrane 70 71 ceramic nf membrane filtration processes could be implemented in the downstream of multi stage coagulation precipitation processes in actual industrial wastewater treatment plants however since calcium based coagulants and sulfuric acid are used to adjust the ph level residual ca2 or so4 2 ions can be introduced into the ceramic nf membrane these ions can negatively affect the removal efficiency for dissolved silica in semiconductor wastewater 4 conclusions we investigated the effects of the feed water characteristics operating conditions and combined salt solutions which can be generated from different chemical compounds used in semiconductor wastewater treatment processes on the removal efficiency of a commercially available ceramic nf membrane for dissolved silica in this study the ceramic nf membrane surface was negatively charged under basic ph conditions and the dissolved silica in the feed water existed in the form of monoanionic h3sio4 as the ph level increased the monoanionic h3sio4 increased the electrical repulsion and ultimately increased the removal efficiency for dissolved silica in addition an increasing applied pressure increased the removal efficiency and the presence of calcium ions ca2 with higher valence had a significant impact on the decrease in their retention regarding the calcium based combined salt solutions higher valence sulfate ions so4 2 affected the removal of dissolved silica more than chloride ions cl researchers should consider the further optimization of the control process for the desired membrane performance and investigate the impact of other chemicals that commonly co exist in semiconductor wastewater during longer tests we believe that our preliminary studies provide helpful guidance for the treatment of silica containing wastewater and that the results prove the practicality of ceramic nf membranes for semiconductor wastewater credit authorship contribution statement yeon so conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft
