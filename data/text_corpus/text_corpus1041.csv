5205,the non intrusive b splines bézier elements method bsbem is used to perform uncertainty propagation for complex dam break flow models the predictive efficiency of the bsbem is first compared to the polynomial chaos expansion pce and monte carlo mc methods using stoker s analytical solution for an idealized dam break flow with discontinuous outputs the computational efficiency of the proposed methodology is then illustrated by analyzing the uncertainty propagation of a hypothetical failure of an actual dam batiscan river located within the province of québec canada three parameters the input discharge the strickler roughness coefficient of the main channel and the average breach width are considered as input random variables from which uncertainties may occur and propagate through the 1d hydraulic numerical model mascaret the obtained results reveal the ability of bsbem to efficiently predict the statistical moments and probability distributions of the output quantities of interest represented in terms of the downstream discharge water level and front wave arrival time at different locations of the studied reach thus yielding useful information for flood risk management with lower computational cost keywords uncertainty propagation polynomial chaos b splines bézier elements method dam break flows 1 introduction floods triggered by dams breaking are considered among the most devastating type of floods due to their instantaneous and unpredictable nature leading to costly material damages and loss of human lives as evidenced by numerous accidents lempérière 2017 dai et al 2005 considerable efforts have been dedicated over the last decades to develop numerical models to simulate the spatial and temporal variations of the maximum water level and arrival time of a dam break shock wave aureli et al 2014 marsooli and wu 2014 zhang et al 2014 seyedashraf and akhtari 2017 haltas et al 2016 chang et al 2011 erpicum et al 2010 the availability of these hydraulic parameters allows for fair hazard assessment and provides decision making tools with which to establish emergency action plans for flood prone areas the predictions stemming from these numerical models are considered as deterministic since they are obtained with fixed values of the input parameters and boundary conditions such as upstream discharge bathymetry roughness coefficient and average breach width the nominal values of these parameters are estimated by means of in situ measurements and observations as well as by empirical models as is the case with the breach width where several correlations have been proposed to predict breach characteristics froehlich 2008 sammen et al 2017 ahmadisharaf et al 2016 it should be stressed that major uncertainties aleatoric and epistimic may originate from these estimation processes due to a lack of knowledge measurement errors and the random nature of input parameters butt et al 2013 kim and sanders 2016 which can significantly influence the deterministic inundation mapping and related planning actions it is thus crucial to take into account the propagation of uncertainties from the input parameters via numerical models in order to quantify the variability to the output response of quantities of interest qoi wu and hsu 2018 thereby allowing the establishment of probabilistic flood inundation mapping that can provide credible and realistic predictions bharath and elshorbagy 2018 tsai et al 2019 sampling methods are some of the most extensively used approaches for uncertainty propagation analysis the well known monte carlo mc method relies on generating a random sampling of each input parameter accordingly to its probability distribution running the deterministic model and then computing the statistical moments of quantities of interest from the set of the output responses despite the attractiveness of the mc method due to its simplicity it requires a high sample size for an accurate estimation of statistics which can be a major drawback for models demanding large computational consumption ballio and guadagnini 2004 a variety of sampling approaches such as latin hypercube sampling lhs mckay et al 1979 shields and zhang 2016 which is based on stratified sampling and low discrepancy sampling hammersley and handscomb 1964 sobol and levitan 1999 have been developed to alleviate the cumbersome computational cost these approaches improve the sampling strategy and thus reduce the number of sample points by ensuring they are efficiently widespread over the random space in addition to the aforementioned sampling techniques polynomial chaos expansion pce presents a practical alternative for uncertainty analysis based on the spectral representation of the output response as a polynomial expansion of the input variables ghanem and spanos 1991 pce selects the orthogonal basis functions in relation to the probability distribution functions of the input random parameters to ensure the best efficacy of the expansion xiu and karniadakis 2002 non intrusive polynomial chaos expansions nipce have been increasingly applied to uncertainty analysis by many researchers these methods unlike the so called intrusive techniques soize and ghanem 2004 mathelin et al 2005 treat the deterministic solver as a black box which renders them more useful since the source codes of most commercial software systems are not available in addition to the projection technique which is based on a multidimensional numerical quadrature reagana et al 2003 avdonin et al 2018 the so called regression technique has been successfully employed to compute the expansion s coefficients non intrusively using the least square minimization procedure berveiller et al 2006 other approaches originate from the nipce based on the selection of the sampling points in the input domain including the probabilistic collocation method pcm tatang et al 1997 li and zhang 2007 the point collocation method pcol hosder et al 2007 hosder and walters 2010 and more recently a non intrusive approach that requires fewer collocation points polynomial chaos decomposition with differentiation pcdd thapa et al 2018 2019 the use of nipc expansions to estimate the statistics of quantities of interest presenting smooth and continuous variations as a function of the input parameters yields accurate values however for problems with dominate hyperbolic behaviour or with discontinuities in the random or physical space a global polynomial basis that spans the entire random space is used which generates spurious oscillations in the approximated output response these spurious oscillations known as gibbs phenomena bijl et al 2013 produce large deviations from the exact solution with highly non physical values negative water level values and less smooth profiles debusschere et al 2004 a panoply of methods have been introduced to overcome the limited utility of standard pces some of these suggest discretizing the input random space into multiple non overlapping subspaces where either polynomial chaos basis functions chouvion and sarrouy 2016 foo et al 2008 wan and karniadakis 2005 or other types of basis functions such as multi wavelet functions le maitre et al 2004 pettersson et al 2013 can be used to locally approximate the output response jakeman et al 2013 van halder et al 2018 in this context the b splines basis functions present a promising tool to mitigate the oscillatory behaviour of the output response with regard to the mathematical properties they procure indeed ditkowski et al 2018 recently presented a detailed comparison that addressed the attractive features of b splines in contrast to some of the limitations of pc basis functions in approximating the statistical moments and more particularly the probability distribution of quantities of interest that do not smoothly depend on their inputs the application of b splines basis functions in the field of uncertainty analysis has gradually gained in interest since the advent of isogeometric analysis concepts iga hughes et al 2005 as indicated by a growing number of studies dertimanis et al 2018 li et al 2019 beck et al 2019 recently a non intrusive b splines bézier elements based method bsbem was introduced abdedou and soulaïmani 2019 for uncertainty propagation analysis for hyperbolic problems inspired by the iga approach this method relies on approximating the stochastic output response using a b splines polynomial expansion over the bézier elements on the parametric domain which corresponds to the cumulative distribution function the objective of this study is to apply the aforementioned bsbem to perform uncertainty propagation analysis and surrogate model construction in the case of the hypothetical failure of an actual dam located within the province of québec canada realistic terrain data and model parameters are available for this dam such as the bathymetry roughness coefficients initial water level average breach width and upstream discharge the variability of the output responses such as the downstream water level and the discharge as a function of time at various locations of the reach under study are evaluated by the proposed expansion and compared to the values from the reference monte carlo method and the polynomial chaos based point collocation approach furthermore this paper complements the previously published one abdedou and soulaïmani 2019 and pushes the bsbem method towards its potential in realistic applications for engineering interests by investigating its abilities to accurately estimate beyond the statistical moments the whole probability density functions pdfs of the output quantities the predictions of the pdfs aspects are particularly worth investigating because as reported in the literature even though the classical pce approaches may be accurate enough to predict the statistical moments they may fail to accurately estimate the pdfs this issue is therefore deeply investigated in the present work the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the concepts of the non intrusive pce and bsbe methods section 3 presents a comparative evaluation of the performance of both the bsbem and pcol methods applied to an analytical solution of an idealized dam break test case the results of a hypothetical rupture of a real dam are then presented in terms of statistical moments and probability distributions finally a summary and concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 uncertainty propagation methodology the general framework for uncertainty analysis relies on several steps de rocquigny et al 2008 sudret 2007 i quantifying the sources of uncertainty which involves the estimation of uncertainty of input parameters aleatoric and epistimic ii propagating the uncertainty through the model which transforms the measure of uncertainty in the input into the measure of uncertainty in the outputs iii post processing the results by computing the statistics of the outputs and sensitivity indices as mentioned above the present study is focused solely on uncertainty propagation in addition to the classical monte carlo mc method two non intrusive stochastic expansion approaches the point collocation method pcol and the b splines bézier elements method bsbem are used here to deal with uncertainty propagation in physical problems presenting hyperbolic behaviour their fundamental concepts will be summarily addressed in the sequel 2 1 non intrusive point collocation method let η η 1 η 2 η m r m be a set of m independent uncertain input parameters defined on the probability space θ σ p where θ is the event space p the probability measure and σ is the σ algebra on θ the statistical behaviour of η i θ with its support denoted by ξ is characterized by a probability density function ϱ i η i in case of the correlated input parameters an appropriate mathematical transformation such as the karhunen loève expansion li and zhang 2007 can be used to remove the correlation prior to the construction of the basis functions oladyshkin and nowak 2012 let us consider a deterministic relationship y m η that links a set of m independent uncertain input parameters to the output response variable y where m represents the model that may be considered as black box the model s output response can be expanded onto multivariate orthogonal basis functions as follows ghanem and spanos 1991 1 y j 1 m α j ψ j η m η where ψ j η denotes the multivariate basis functions that are orthogonal to the joint probability density function ϱ η η i 1 m ϱ i η i m denotes the surrogate model of m α j are the unknown coefficients to be computed and which are space and time dependent α j x t representing the deterministic part of the expansion m is the total number of expansion terms defined as a function of the polynomial chaos order p and the number of the input random parameters m 2 m p m p m the one dimensional basis functions ψ k η i k 1 p i 1 m from which the multivariate basis functions ψ j η j 1 m are constructed must be meticulously selected with respect to the probability density function type indeed there is a correspondence between the probability distribution of the input parameter and which appropriate basis functions must be selected in order to ensure the best convergence and accurately represent the output distributions the most commonly used orthogonal polynomials with their corresponding probability distributions are listed in table 1 xiu and karniadakis 2002 the multivariate basis functions ψ i given in eq 1 are obtained from the product of univariate polynomials xiu 2010 sudret 2008 3 ψ j η ψ p 1 j η 1 ψ p m j η m where the subscript p i j incorporates the multi indices notation q n m so that the sum of all their possible combinations q i 1 m p i j is equal to the total degree of each multivariate polynomial ψ q η ψ j η more implementation details about the multi indices and the construction of the multivariate basis functions are given in sudret 2014 avdonin et al 2018 and miller et al 2018 the unknown coefficients α α 1 α m t of the approximation in eq 1 can be obtained using the regression also called the least square minimization approach one of the non intrusive techniques this method starts with the construction of the experimental design d η 1 η n s t which is defined as a sample set of n s collocation points generated according to the probability density function of each input parameter η 1 η m for each row of the experimental design the deterministic model is run to obtain the corresponding results which are gathered in an output response vector y y 1 m η 1 y n s m η n s t evaluating the obtained multivariate basis functions onto these sampling points within the experimental design allows the construction of a design matrix whose terms are defined as ψ ψ ij ψ j η i i 1 n s j 1 m the unknown coefficients can thus be obtained by solving the normal equation 4 α ψ t ψ 1 ψ t y the number of collocation points in the experimental design has to be larger than the number of expansion terms n s m in order to avoid a potential ill conditioning of the design matrix blatman 2009 the use of the oversampling concept known as the point collocation approach pcol which considers the total number of sampling points as a multiple of the expansion term number n s n p m with n p n the oversampling ratio allows a better estimation of the statistical moments particularly when it is associated with an efficient sampling method such as the lhs halton and harmemesly methods hosder et al 2007 hosder and walters 2010 after obtaining the expansion s coefficients the statistical moments can be estimated easily due to the orthogonality property of the basis functions thus the mean and standard deviation of the output response surface can be expressed as 5 μ e y ξ j 1 m α j ψ j η ϱ η η d η α 1 and 6 σ e y e y 2 1 2 j 2 m α j 2 ψ j 2 η 1 2 respectively where ψ j 2 η is evaluated using the inner product notion whose expression reads ψ i ψ j ξ ψ i η ψ j η ϱ η η d η and where ϱ η η denotes the joint probability function as mentioned above the aforementioned fundamental concepts of the pcol method are summarized in a graphical framework presented in fig 1 2 2 non intrusive b splines bézier elements method the b splines bézier element method bsbem can be categorized as a non intrusive stochastic multi elements approach that consists of local approximations of the output response of quantities of interest using piecewise b splines basis functions over each element named a bézier element borden et al 2011 the b splines basis functions present interesting mathematical features they offer c p 1 continuity local interpolation support a strong convex hull property and a variation diminishing property these attractive characteristics combined with the multi element structure of the bézier extraction operator render them a promising tool for uncertainty analysis even for problems with non smooth or discontinuous outputs rogers 2001 piegl and tiller 1997 a schematic representation of the univariate b splines basis functions 12 global splines of order 2 over the parametric domain their traces on the elements are shown in color in fig 2 for every element their local traces amount into three functions in order blue red and green the basic framework of this method and its implementation algorithm are addressed in detail in abdedou and soulaïmani 2019 let us consider ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ m γ 0 1 m as a set of m independent parametric variables defined in the parametric domain and linked to the set of input random parameters η η 1 η 2 η m r m by the marginal cumulative density function cdf whose image domain is 0 1 which corresponds to the image domain of the b splines basis functions this allows for ξ i η i f i η i η i ϱ i η d η which implies that d ξ i ϱ i η i d η i the basic principle of the method is that it decomposes the definition domain 0 1 of each variable ξ i into nx i non overlapping intervals whose interfaces are defined by the coordinates ξ i 0 ξ i nx i with ξ i 0 0 and ξ i nx i 1 representing the lower and upper bounds respectively of the definition domain the bézier element i e multidimensional element defined as hypercubes for the entire parametric domain γ is defined as a tensor product of univariate intervals i e ξ 1 e 1 ξ 1 e 1 1 ξ m e m ξ m e m 1 with 0 e i nx i and i 1 m the total number of bézier elements in the entire parametric domain is given by n elt i 1 m nx i which increases considerably for high dimensional problems which have a high number of input random parameters i e the curse of dimensionality problem the model s output response y m η is approximated on each bézier element i e as the sum of the piecewise basis functions of the set of parameters ξ 7 y e j 1 nb α j e ψ j e ξ where α j e and ψ j e denote the local coefficients and the local multivariate piecewise b splines basis functions over the e th bézier element i e respectively the number of local multivariate basis functions i e the number of local expansion terms is given by nb i 1 m p i 1 where p i is the polynomial order corresponding to the random parameter ξ i nb grows significantly with increasing dimensionality unlike in the pcol method where the number of basis functions is obtained by total order truncation as given in eq 2 the global approximation of the output response can be built by patching the local approximations on each bézier element i e 8 y e 1 n elt y e ξ λ e ξ where λ e ξ denotes a standard indicator function satisfying λ e ξ 1 if ξ i e and λ e ξ 0 otherwise jakeman et al 2013 van halder et al 2018 the construction of the multivariate basis functions in each element i e can be realized by the tensor product of a set of local univariate polynomials as follows 9 ψ j e ξ ψ 1 e ξ 1 ψ m e ξ m j 1 nb where ψ i e ξ i corresponds to the univariate b splines basis functions that ensure c p i 1 continuity so that ψ i e ξ i n i p i e ξ i i 1 m these basis functions can be obtained with an appropriate mapping from a set of local bernstein s functions by introducing the so called local linear bézier extraction operator c e so that n e ξ c e b e ξ borden et al 2011 where b e denotes the univariate bernstein functions of degree p on the e th bézier element whose explicit recursive form on the parametric domain 0 1 is given by buffa and sangalli 2016 10 b k p ξ 1 ξ b k p 1 ξ 1 ξ b k 1 p 1 ξ with b k 0 ξ 1 and b k p ξ 0 if k 1 or k p 1 bernstein functions can also be defined over the interval τ 1 1 as follows borden et al 2011 11 b k p τ 1 2 1 τ b k p 1 τ 1 2 1 τ b k 1 p 1 τ this recursive expression is more useful for numerical integration by quadratures in this case for a given value of the univariate parameter ξ i ξ i e i ξ i e i 1 0 e i nx i and i 1 m its corresponding parametric value τ i 1 1 can be computed by adopting the following change of variable 12 τ i 2 ξ i ξ i e i ξ i e i 1 ξ i e i 1 ξ i e i the sampling procedure in connection with the above polynomial approximations requires the construction of local experimental design d e in each element i e thus for each i th random variable ξ i in the parametric random vector ξ ξ 1 ξ m a set of n s e nb collocation points are selected randomly in the e i th corresponding interval ξ i e s ξ i e i ξ i e i 1 s 1 n s e thus a local experimental design d e ξ e 1 ξ e s ξ e n s e t with ξ e s ξ 1 e s ξ m e s is constructed as for the aforementioned pcol expansion a local over sampling technique is also possible in each element by introducing an oversampling ratio n s e n p nb the local multivariate basis functions given in eq 9 are evaluated on each row of the local experimental design ψ n s e nb e ψ i j e ψ j e ξ e i i 1 n s e j 1 nb the components of the local experimental design are also used to run the deterministic model to obtain the local output response vector y n s e 1 e y e 1 m η e 1 y e s m η e s y e n s e m η e n s e t where η e s η 1 e s η m e s represents the s th component of the corresponding local experimental design in the random physical domain obtained by the inverse cdf mapping 13 η i e s f i 1 ξ i e s s 1 n s e i 1 m the resulting local design matrix and the output response vector are expressed as 14 ψ nb nb e ψ e ψ e and y nb 1 e ψ e y e a global design matrix ψ m m and global output response vector y m 1 where m i 1 m nx i p i are constructed from the assembly of local design matrices and local output response vectors using the assembly operator ψ a e 1 n elt ψ e and y a e 1 n elt y e introduced by hughes 2012 where the subscripts of the global design matrix components ψ k ℓ are linked to those of the local design matrices ψ r s e by the connectivity array ien with respect to the e th bézier element expressed as k ien r e and ℓ ien s e with k ℓ 1 m and r s 1 nb cottrell et al 2009 scott et al 2011 the unknown coefficients can be computed by solving the resulting global system of equations 15 α ψ 1 y once the coefficients are computed the surrogate model given in eq 7 is realized by extracting the local coefficients α e from the set of global coefficients α found with eq 15 using the same ien connectivity array mentioned above the constructed substitution model can then evaluate the statistical moments of the output quantities of interest whose mean and variance are expressed respectively as follows 16 μ y e y ξ y ϱ η η d η and 17 σ y 2 e y 2 μ y 2 ξ y 2 ϱ η η d η μ y 2 the evaluation of these integrals can be greatly simplified by considering the cumulative density function mapping as detailed above ξ i f i η i and d ξ i ϱ i η i d η i this change of variable allows the integrals to be evaluated over the cdf image domain 0 1 that corresponds to the parametric domain of the basis functions thus the mean and the variance given in eqs 16 and 17 can be expressed respectively as 18 μ y e 1 n elt i e y e d ξ and 19 σ y 2 e 1 n elt i e y e 2 d ξ μ y 2 based on the detailed steps presented above a general flowchart for the implementation of the proposed bsbem is shown in fig 3 the efficiency and accuracy of the aforementioned non intrusive stochastic expansions will be compared in two 1d hydraulic tests 3 results and discussion in the following subsections numerical results for an idealized univariate test case stoker s analytical solution and a hypothetical break of an actual dam are presented and discussed in terms of statistical moments and probability density functions profiles of output quantities of interest 3 1 univariate dam break flow test case analytical solution in this benchmark test case the physical domain is a 100 m flat frictionless channel the dam represented by a vertical gate is located in the middle of the channel x 0 50 m the initial conditions are defined by unequal water levels on both sides of the dam as shown in fig 4 the downstream water depth is kept constant at a deterministic value h ds 1 m while the upstream water depth h up is considered as a noisy input parameter with various values in the random space stoker s solution stoker 1957 an analytical solution of the aforementioned idealized problem is obtained by solving the following polynomial equations delestre et al 2013 seyedashraf and akhtari 2017 seyedashraf et al 2018 20 h x t h up 4 9 g gh up x 2 t 2 c m 2 g h ds u x t 0 m s if x x a t 2 3 x t gh up if x a t x x b t 2 gh up c m if x b t x x c t 0 m s if x c t x where x denotes the axial position x a t x 0 t gh up x b t x 0 t gh up 3 c m and x c x 0 t 2 c m 2 gh up c m c m 2 gh ds and where c m gh m denotes the selected solution of 8 gh ds c m 2 gh up c m 2 2 c m 2 gh ds c m 2 gh ds 2 0 that fulfil both the mathematical and the physical conditions the test case described above depicts an interesting case study for uncertainty propagation analysis and surrogate model building because it presents a low computational cost analytical solution combined with a high degree of difficulty due to the presence of a discontinuity in the output quantities of interest as mentioned earlier such problems have been addressed in the literature and are known to present a serious challenge for polynomial chaos methods for estimation of the stochastic behaviour of output responses in the vicinity of discontinuities pettersson et al 2014 to further investigate this aspect the analytical solution stoker s solution is considered as a deterministic model through which uncertainties are propagated thus the initial upstream water level is considered as a random parameter following a normal distribution centred on the nominal value h up 10 m with a standard deviation value of 0 5 m which represents a coefficient of variation of 5 it has been shown that using a number of sampling points that is twice the minimum required number represents a fairly optimal value of the oversampling ratio n p 2 which when used with a relatively high polynomial order of basis functions leads to a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the point collocation method for smooth and continuous problems hosder et al 2007 hosder and walters 2010 in the sequel we address the effect of the oversampling ratio and its interaction with the polynomial order on the accuracy of the output response especially for cases presenting hyperbolic behaviour with a discontinuity in the physical domain it should be noted that a part of this aspect has been briefly outlined in abdedou and soulaïmani 2019 the evolution of the statistics profiles mean and standard deviation of the water depth as a function of the channel length at simulation time t 4 s obtained from the pcol method using various polynomial order values and an oversampling ratio of two are depicted in fig 5 and compared to that of 10 6 monte carlo simulations the distributions of the mean of the water depth fig 5a obtained from the pcol approach show a smooth profile with a good agreement with those obtained from the mc method over the whole domain except in the regions near the discontinuity where there is a strong oscillatory behaviour indeed by keeping an oversampling ratio of two any increase in the polynomial order from p 2 to p 5 leads to an increase in the intensity of the oscillations this may include unphysical negative values for both water level and velocity as can be seen from the zooms of the selected areas discontinuity region the described behaviour is more remarkable on the standard deviation distribution where it seems to be much more sensitive to the increase of the polynomial order the pcol results clearly change significantly when going from p 2 to p 5 where strong oscillations in terms of amplitude and frequencies appear in the discontinuity region this leads to multiple values of the maximum standard deviation which could be observed in terms of local peak values obtained for p 5 in the region surrounding the discontinuity causing an unrealistic over prediction of the standard deviation as shown in the close up view of the selected zones of the water depth profiles fig 5b similar error structures have been observed in the velocity profiles and because of space limitation their corresponding plots are not shown to further investigate the effect of the interaction between the oversampling ratio and the polynomial order on the statistical moments prediction of discontinuous output responses the convergence of the relative least square mean error l 2 norm given by eq 21 is assessed for a wide range of the aforementioned parameter values 21 l φ 2 k 1 n e φ k surrogate φ k mc 2 k 1 n e φ k mc 2 where φ k stands for the mean or the standard deviation of the output quantity of interest in this case water depth at the k th axial position this error is evaluated by comparing the statistical moments obtained by surrogate models pcol and bsbem with those from the monte carlo reference solution with 10 6 realizations over the total number n e of calculation points axial positions fig 6 shows the variation of the l 2 error of the statistical moments of the water level as a function of the polynomial order for various oversampling ratios one can observe from fig 6a that the error in the mean increases greatly with the increase of the polynomial order thus providing high values of relative errors especially for low oversampling ratios ex n p 2 in the case of hyperbolic discontinuous problems the pce basis functions show spurious oscillations in the vicinity of the discontinuity as shown in fig 5 even though theses oscillations are localized in a small region surrounding the shock their intensity is so strong and increases with the polynomial order that the statistic profiles present as unrealistic and even non physical values fig 5b and so they impact the global tendency of the global l 2 error this is similar to the well known gibbs phenomenon in the approximation theory it can also be seen that as the oversampling ratio is increased from n p 2 to n p 10 the intensity of the error generally diminishes for low chaos orders p 5 and is less remarkable for high chaos orders the same behaviour can be observed in fig 6b which shows the error in the standard deviation with respect to the polynomial chaos order this figure reveals that as the polynomial order increases the plots display rapid divergence almost exponential where the percentage error reaches significant values 10 4 at a higher polynomial order even more distinctly when a low oversampling ratio n p 2 is used thus by considering an oversampling ratio of two n p 2 what is found to be an optimal value for smooth continuous solutions as mentioned above does not yield a suitable convergence with the increase of the polynomial orders for cases with discontinuous output response in contrast by choosing a relatively high value of oversampling ratio n p 10 the error decreases slightly particularly for low values of the polynomial order p 5 to assess the ability of the bsbem to accurately reproduce the monte carlo reference solution the variation of the statistical moments relative errors in the water depth as a function of the bézier elements number nx for a fixed polynomial order p 2 and different oversampling ratios are presented in fig 7 these variations indicate that the relative errors of the bsbem results which are estimated with respect to reference monte carlo statistics decrease monotonically when the number of bézier elements is gradually increased from nx 1 to nx 10 2 it is worth noting that the bsbem approach yields reasonable error values 10 3 for the mean and 10 1 for the standard deviation even for low bézier elements number values which are considerably lower than those from the pcol expansion obtained with low oversampling ratios fig 7 also shows that when the oversampling ratio is increased locally in each bézier element from n p 1 to n p 4 the smoothness of the convergence is slightly improved and the relative error values are reduced for both the mean and the standard deviation for a better interpretation of the relative errors presented above the distributions of the mean and standard deviation of the water level along the channel length obtained from the bsbem for different bézier elements numbers are shown in fig 8 one can observe that errors due to the coarse b splines approximation appear in the mean distribution profile obtained for nx 1 in the discontinuity region fig 8a as nx increases the mean distribution gets smoother and becomes completely superimposed to that of the monte carlo reference solution the same oscillatory behaviour is also observed in the standard deviation profile with more visible discrepancies in the discontinuity region where a high peak value can be seen for nx 1 thus leading to an over prediction of the standard deviation at that location as for the mean distribution this effect is greatly reduced by increasing the number of bézier elements thereby allowing an accurate reproduction of the standard deviation distribution of the water level as shown in fig 8b the combination of the local over sampling and relatively high number of bézier elements shows a remarkable improvement in the prediction of the mean and standard deviation of the water depth where a very good agreement can be observed between the bsbem and monte carlo distributions for nx 100 and n p 4 fig 8c and d it should be pointed out that the observed errors are well controlled using the bsbem across the whole range of the tested configurations unlike the pcol approach which yields spurious oscillations and fails to converge fig 9 presents a comparison of the mean and standard deviation distributions of the water level along the channel length obtained from the bsbem and the pcol using almost the same operating conditions at simulation time t 4 s it is clear that mean distributions are more accurately reproduced by the bsbem and pcol methods than the standard deviation distributions indeed by increasing the oversampling ratio the profiles obtained from the pcol expansion show a smooth distribution but still cannot adequately match the reference mc distribution near the discontinuity where the peak value is under predicted in contrast the distribution obtained from the bsbem with nx 100 illustrates an excellent superimposition with that of the mc solution over the whole domain study it should be emphasized that the computational effort of the bsbem in this univariate case without local oversampling is almost equal to that of the pcol method however when a local oversampling procedure is applied to each bézier element the computational effort required for the bsbem is higher than that of the pcol approach for the same polynomial order 3 2 application to a hypothetical break of an actual dam 3 2 1 description of the study case the aforementioned modelling approaches have been applied for uncertainty propagation analysis regarding a hypothetical break of a 21 m height actual dam located on the batiscan river province of québec which takes its source in the laurentides and discharging south into the saint laurent river the hydraulic behaviour was simulated by using the 1d mascaret software goutal and maurel 2002 which is widely adopted to solve the one dimensional form of the shallow water equations describing a dam break wave however it should be noted that a growing number of 2d and 3d computational dam break models are being used ferrari et al 2009 marsooli and wu 2014 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 the site under study shown in fig 10 is represented by a series of 74 cross sections describing the topography and the bathymetry of the terrain the hydraulic parameters considered in building the deterministic model in mascaret correspond to 1000 year flood episodes the upstream condition is a fixed discharge during the simulation period however its value is uncertain it is randomly selected following a normal distribution with given statistical moments a mean value of 1 343 m 3 s which corresponds to a 1000 year flood event and a coefficient of variation of 5 thus this variability of the upstream discharge combined with those from other considered input random parameters are propagated through the numerical model mascaret to obtain the random output responses at selected cross sections of interest the corresponding water level of a value of 64 86 m represents the water level at the crest of the dam at which the breach is initiated the downstream boundary condition is described by a limnigram with a value of 4 2 m corresponding to the saint laurent river s water depth under high tide conditions the roughness parameters which are represented in this study in terms of the strickler coefficient ks were equally distributed throughout the entire stretch and lumped into two values one of the main channel and one of the floodplain with their corresponding values of 30 and 20 respectively other parameters such as breach characteristics are considered as key parameters due to their great contribution to estimating the peak discharge during the breaking process in the absence of observation evidence various empirical models based on several assumptions have been proposed to estimate these characteristics these estimations of the nominal values are prone to high uncertainty which significantly impact the reliability of the dam break analysis according to the results from some relevant investigations sammen et al 2017 vorogushyn et al 2011 in the current study the dam s breach height is fixed at 18 13 m and its average width is considered equal to four times its height b av 72 52 m the input parameters described above may be subjected to high variability in their nominal values which could induce several uncertainties in the numerical model and thus affect the reliability of the predictions of the output quantities of interest in the present work the upstream discharge the roughness coefficient of the main channel and the average width of the breach have been identified as independent random variables with their a priori probability density functions pdf from which uncertainties are propagated throughout the one dimensional mascaret hydraulic model the upstream discharge is described by a truncated normal distribution with a mean of 1344 m 3 s which corresponds to the safety flood event discharge and a coefficient of variation of 5 std 67 2 m 3 s the pdf was truncated by a factor of 3 std to avoid generating values of the input discharge outside the bounds of the rating curve of the dam s evacuator the roughness parameter strickler coefficient of the main channel is considered to be uniformly distributed within its plausible range with a mean value of 30 and coefficient of variation of 5 std 1 5 the average width of the breach is considered to follow a normal distribution with a mean of 72 52 m which corresponds to the widely used value of 4 times the breach height while the standard deviation is set to 3 6 m coefficient of variation of 5 the other parameters i e the roughness coefficient of the floodplain and the downstream water level at the junction with the saint laurent river are treated as deterministic parameters the statistical characteristics of the aforementioned uncertain input parameters are summarized in table 2 stochastic processing requires the generation of samples for random variables according to their probability density functions for a given sample size n s a single value of each random parameter was selected to run the deterministic model for which an in house matlab code was developed to assign the selected values of the input discharge the strickler coefficient and the average width of the breach to their appropriate locations in the pre process files used by the mascaret software this deterministic model was run for each combination of the aforementioned input parameters and the obtained output responses of quantities of interest were extracted from the mascaret output files by the routines developed for statistical post processing and surrogate modelling special treatment is required to take into account the variability of the average width of the breach in the deterministic model call this breach is represented in mascaret by an idealized shape defined by two vertical sides whose gap delineates the breach width as shown in fig 11 which illustrates a typical terrain profile at the location of the dam with a schematic representation of the breach therefore once the value of the breach width is selected within the generated samples the positions of both the left and right sides points 1 2 and 3 4 respectively in fig 11 are updated accordingly using eq 22 22 x 1 2 i x 0 b av i 2 x 3 4 i x 0 b av i 2 where x 0 represents the position of the breach centre fixed with the deterministic value and b av i denotes the selected value of the average breach width from the generated sample in the random space after this updating these positions are then replaced in the input geometric file used by mascaret to run the deterministic model 3 2 2 statistical moments predictions the results are presented here mainly in terms of statistical moment profiles mean and standard deviation of the downstream discharge and water level at selected cross sections in the absence of the analytical solution of such complex situations the monte carlo method was considered as a benchmark reference solution to which other stochastic expansion approaches bsbem and pcol were compared to evaluate their accuracy it is well known that the convergence of the monte carlo method strongly depends on the sample size whose convergence rate is on the order of 1 n s which requires a relatively high number of realizations for suitable accuracy thus the required optimal number of samples has to be defined by conducting a convergence study of the standard deviation of the output quantities of interest water level and downstream discharge as a function of the number of realizations fig 12 shows the convergence of the standard deviation of the water level and discharge at specific locations downstream of the dam x 8 168 m and 14 555 m for two simulation times t 1 5 h and 3 h versus the number of mc realizations the total number of 50 000 mc realizations is retained in this study to generate results that can be considered as reference solutions to use in assessing the reliability of other approaches the runtime required to achieve 50 000 mc realizations using a personal computer intel r xeon r cpu e3 125 v6 3 30 ghz is approximately 359 h fig 13 displays the variation of the standard deviations of the discharge and of the water level as a function of time at two locations x 8 168 m and 14 555 m obtained from pcol expansion with various polynomial orders the results are presented for a value of oversampling ratio that is twice the minimum required number of collocation points n p 2 which is highly recommended for smooth continuous problems hosder et al 2007 hosder and walters 2010 as can be seen from these figures slight oscillations appear near the front wave when a relatively low value of polynomial order p 3 is used the intensity of these oscillations increases greatly as the polynomial order is increased from p 3 to p 7 where a strong oscillatory behaviour is observed with high oscillations amplitude leading to an overestimation and non physical value of the statistical moment for both downstream discharge figs 13a and c and water level figs 13b and d it should be emphasized that for smooth continuous problems once the oversampling ratio is fixed to n p 2 any increase in the polynomial order leads to a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the pce approximation conversely to the present case where the polynomial chaos expansion cannot effectively describe the high hyperbolic behaviour of the flooding wave indeed as shown in fig 13 any increase in the polynomial order leads to the appearance of spurious oscillations with non physical values of the output responses of quantities of interest to illustrate the ability of the bsbem to accurately approximate the statistical moments of the output quantities fig 14 shows the evolution of the standard deviation profiles of the downstream discharge and water level at selected locations x 8 168 m and x 14 555 m as a function of time the results obtained from the bsbem with a fixed polynomial order of the basis functions p i 2 i 1 2 3 and various numbers of bézier elements are compared to those from the 50 000 realization monte carlo reference solution these plots reveal that even for a small value of the number of bézier elements nx i 2 i 1 2 3 the results show a smooth profile even in regions surrounding the front wave the increase in the number of bézier elements from nx i 2 to 5 leads to a real improvement in the bsbem s accuracy to where an excellent agreement is observed with those from the 50 000 mc realizations this improvement is the result of an appropriate split of the random space of each variable into nx i sub domains from which the minimum required number of collocation points n s e i 1 3 p i 1 are selected this procedure provides an efficient distribution of the collocation points within the random space thereby considerably improving the accuracy of the approximation the abilities of the pcol and bsbem approaches to fit the statistical moments obtained by the reference monte carlo method are evaluated together in fig 15 which shows the confidence interval profiles ci quantified in terms of the mean plus and minus two standard deviations of downstream discharge and water level as a function of time at selected cross sections x 8 168 m and 14 555 m these plots clearly indicate that the statistical moment profiles obtained with the pcol expansion with p 3 and n p 6 and with the bsbem approach with p i 2 and nx i 4 i 1 2 3 present an excellent agreement with those from the monte carlo method with 50 000 realizations the propagation of the inundation wave is outlined by the evolution in time for the peak value of discharge and water level which progresses downstream from one cross section to another this progression is accompanied by a high variability range around the mean as illustrated by the confidence interval delineated by upper and lower bounds which transmit the effect of uncertainty propagation stemming from the input parameters into the output responses of the quantities of interest the confidence interval of the water level may be used to establish the probability inundation map by calculating the confidence interval of the uncertain free surface from the uncertain water level and the terrain profile and projecting its lower and upper bounds at a selected time onto the topography of the terrain it is possible to provide an estimated range of the inundated banks of the selected cross section this probabilistic inundation mapping is especially worthwhile as it considers the variability that may be introduced by the input parameters 3 2 3 estimated probability density function in this subsection probability density function of the downstream discharge water level and front wave arrival time at selected cross sections obtained from pcol and bsbem are presented and discussed in comparison with those from the monte carlo and lhs sampling methods fig 16 shows the probability density function of the downstream discharge and water level at selected cross sections x 8 168 m and x 14 555 m at simulation times t 0 5 h and t 1 h respectively which closely correspond to the time of the peak discharge and water level describing the inundation wave the monte carlo sampling method is applied by using the constructed surrogate model from pcol with p 3 n p 6 and bebem with p i 2 nx i 4 to estimate pdfs of the output quantities of interest the results are then compared with those computed from the 50 000 monte carlo realizations using the direct deterministic model the distributions of the downstream discharge show that the pdf resulting from the bsbem is in excellent agreement with the pdf obtained from direct mc simulations unlike the pcol expansion which fails to approximate pdfs as shown in fig 16a and c the deviation observed in the discharge distribution is less visible in the water level pdfs of the surrogate models and so they compare well with the reference monte carlo pdf whose shape is almost gaussian as illustrated in fig 16b and d thus the obtained results clearly show the strong abilities of the bsbem to closely approximate a wider range of pdfs than the pcol expansion to further illustrate the bsbem s ability to well estimate the probability density function of the outputs in addition to the statistical moments the probability distributions of the arrival time of the front wave at different selected locations over the reach are depicted in fig 17 it is important to note that in this work the arrival time of the front wave is defined as the time recorded by the deterministic solver mascaret when the water level at a given downstream cross section is raised by 30 cm compared to the initial water level fig 17 shows that the pdf resulting from the bsbem surrogate is almost superimposed with that resulting from the reference monte carlo method unlike the distributions obtained using the pcol surrogate model where significant deviations can be observed the uncertainty accompanying the wave arrival time increases downstream of the dam as illustrated by the wider range of the probability density function which does not follow a normal distribution the pdfs shown in figs 16 and 17 are obtained for a low variability in the input parameters with coefficients of variation of cv 5 in order to show the bsbem s ability to accurately reproduce the pdfs of the outputs with a relatively high variability of the inputs the effect of increasing the coefficient of variation of the input parameters is depicted in figs 18 and 19 indeed the upstream discharge values are generated by a normal distribution n 1 344 134 4 with a coefficient of variation cv q up 10 truncated at 950 and 1745 m 3 s the average breach width is described by a normal distribution with a coefficient of variation of cv b av 25 which yields n 72 52 18 13 truncated at 36 and 109 m which approximately corresponds to 2 h and 6 h respectively where h represents the dam s breach height wahl 2004 the variability of the strickler coefficient of the river s main channel is represented by a uniform distribution u 17 43 with a coefficient of variation cv ks 25 johnson 1996 fig 18 shows the probability distribution functions of the downstream discharge and water level at two selected cross sections and simulation times where a good agreement can be observed between the pdfs obtained from bsbem surrogate model and those computed from the 10 000 lhs realizations considered as a reference solution unlike the pcol surrogate model where deviations can be detected particularly in the output discharge distributions at both selected locations the effect of increasing the variability of the input parameters is clearly visible in the uncertainty of the output discharge which is traduced by a high variability range indeed as an example we can clearly see the increase in the variability range of the output discharge at x 14 555 m from 1420 1730 m 3 s for a coefficient of variation of 5 to considerably widen to 800 2300 m 3 s for cv q up 10 and cv b av ks 25 as illustrated by figs 16c and 18c respectively the same behaviour is observed in the probability distributions of the front wave arrival time at selected locations over the studied area shown in fig 19 overall an excellent agreement can be clearly observed between the pdfs from the bsbem surrogate model and those from the lhs realizations where the profiles are almost superimposed with the exception of the results obtained at the location x 3 098 m where some slight discrepancies can be noted between both distributions bsbem and lhs on the other hand one can clearly note that the pcol surrogate model fails to reproduce the shape of the front wave arrival time distributions over the whole selected locations the uncertainty related to the arrival time of the front wave which increases as the wave evolves through the studied reach is greatly affected by the increase in the uncertainty of the input parameters as illustrated by the variability range of the distribution functions of the front wave arrival time shown in figs 17d and 19d which correspond respectively to the low and high coefficient of variation of the input parameters 3 2 4 computational efficiency this subsection provides a computational efficiency analysis of the bsbem approach in comparison to the pcol and the mc methods it should be emphasized that all programs involved in this paper were implemented serially and the computations were performed on a personal computer intel r xeon r cpu e3 125 v6 3 30 ghz and 16 gb memory the computational efficiency can be estimated among other ways by comparing the number of numerical solver runs thus for instance a bsbem with p i 2 nx i 2 and nx i 4 requires 216 and 1 827 runs respectively which makes the bsbem 231 and 30 times respectively faster than the monte carlo sampling method with 50 000 runs the pcol approach with p 2 an n p 6 requires 84 model evaluations which makes it 595 times faster than the monte carlo method another aspect of the comparison concerns the required cost to approximate the pdfs of the outputs thus the computed pdf with the direct monte carlo method requires a high computational cost 359 h to achieve 50 000 realizations while for the pcol and bsbem approaches the computational time is on the order of minutes 13 min for bsbem and 14 min for pcol to perform 50 000 realizations with the generated surrogate models it is worth mentioning that the gain in the computational effort with bsbem is expected to be more substantial for cases involving 2d and 3d configurations with a computational domain consisting of millions of nodes in some applications where the classical sampling techniques mc lhs may require a huge computational cost 4 conclusion this study describes the implementation of the non intrusive b splines bézier elements method bsbem for uncertainty propagation analysis for a hypothetical rupture of a real dam the method which belongs to the multi elements approaches is based on splitting the random space of the input parameters which corresponds to the parametric domain into subspaces called bézier elements within which the stochastic output response is approximated by local b splines basis functions the coefficients allowing this local approximation are calculated non intrusively by the regression technique stoker s analytical solution of the downstream water level and velocity for an idealized dam break flow was first considered as a test case to assess the bsbem s performance compared to that of the polynomial chaos based pcol expansion the variation of l 2 error norms of mean and standard deviation for both methods has clearly revealed the limitation of pc expansion particularly for relatively high polynomial order to accurately approximate the statistics of problems where discontinuity occurs in the output quantities where a strong divergence in the l 2 error is observed our assessment also showed that using an oversampling ratio beyond the recommended value for smooth problems or twice the number of expansion terms combined with a lower polynomial order contributes to mitigating the divergence rate as much as possible in contrast the bsbem showed a better and monotonic convergence rate of the mean and standard deviation errors as the number of bézier elements is increased producing smooth profiles of the water level and velocity the introduced method was then applied to analyze the propagation of uncertainties over numerical models describing the flood wave resulting from a hypothetical break of an actual dam located in the province of québec the variability of the input parameters namely the upstream discharge the strickler roughness coefficient of the main channel and the average breach width was defined in accordance with their corresponding probability distributions around the deterministic nominal values the generated uncertainties were then propagated through the one dimensional hydrodynamic deterministic model and their impact on the output response quantified in terms of the statistical moments and probability density functions of the downstream water level and discharge as a function of time at different locations of the considered reach the results reveal that the bsbem provides smooth profiles of the standard deviation and confidence interval as a function of time accurately describing the variability accompanying the flood wave propagation at different locations furthermore the predictions obtained using the bsbem were found to be in excellent agreement with those from the 50 000 monte carlo and 10 000 lhs realizations unlike the pcol expansion that estimated spurious oscillations this oscillatory behaviour was slightly mitigated by using a low polynomial order and a relatively high oversampling ratio another meaningful result stemming from this study is the remarkable efficiency of the bsbem to successfully approximate the probability distribution of the outputs unlike the pcol approach which cannot accurately predict these pdfs especially for the front wave arrival time this study s main findings indicate that the bsbem presents an efficient tool for dealing with uncertainty propagation through complex dam break flow models thereby making it possible to establish probabilistic inundations maps for flood hazard predictions that takes into account uncertainty stemming from input parameters the applicability of the presented approach can be successfully extended to other complex system with hyperbolic non smooth or even discontinuous behaviour for high dimensional problems the total number of collocation points is greatly affected by the number of bézier elements and the number of random variables which could present a drawback in terms of computational cost curse dimensionality more research effort is still required to solve the problem of curse dimensionality in the bsbem the curse of dimensionality is inherited from the use of a simple tensor product of a one dimensional basis to build the multivariate basis this aspect highlights an area of potential research improvements one idea that could be pursued to overcome at least partially the problem of curse dimensionality is the use of local refinements while still using the tensor product for instance if more accuracy is required for the tails of the cdf the number of elements could be increased locally therefore patches will constitute the mesh and nx i will be defined for each patch the use of unstructured splines as in u splines thomas et al 2018 or t splines sangalli et al 2016 sederberg et al 2003 scott et al 2011 is another idea to be investigated though not trivial for a dimension greater than 3 nevertheless once the surrogate model based on bsbem has been built the computational effort which is on the order of minutes remains insignificant compared to that of the standard monte carlo

5205,the non intrusive b splines bézier elements method bsbem is used to perform uncertainty propagation for complex dam break flow models the predictive efficiency of the bsbem is first compared to the polynomial chaos expansion pce and monte carlo mc methods using stoker s analytical solution for an idealized dam break flow with discontinuous outputs the computational efficiency of the proposed methodology is then illustrated by analyzing the uncertainty propagation of a hypothetical failure of an actual dam batiscan river located within the province of québec canada three parameters the input discharge the strickler roughness coefficient of the main channel and the average breach width are considered as input random variables from which uncertainties may occur and propagate through the 1d hydraulic numerical model mascaret the obtained results reveal the ability of bsbem to efficiently predict the statistical moments and probability distributions of the output quantities of interest represented in terms of the downstream discharge water level and front wave arrival time at different locations of the studied reach thus yielding useful information for flood risk management with lower computational cost keywords uncertainty propagation polynomial chaos b splines bézier elements method dam break flows 1 introduction floods triggered by dams breaking are considered among the most devastating type of floods due to their instantaneous and unpredictable nature leading to costly material damages and loss of human lives as evidenced by numerous accidents lempérière 2017 dai et al 2005 considerable efforts have been dedicated over the last decades to develop numerical models to simulate the spatial and temporal variations of the maximum water level and arrival time of a dam break shock wave aureli et al 2014 marsooli and wu 2014 zhang et al 2014 seyedashraf and akhtari 2017 haltas et al 2016 chang et al 2011 erpicum et al 2010 the availability of these hydraulic parameters allows for fair hazard assessment and provides decision making tools with which to establish emergency action plans for flood prone areas the predictions stemming from these numerical models are considered as deterministic since they are obtained with fixed values of the input parameters and boundary conditions such as upstream discharge bathymetry roughness coefficient and average breach width the nominal values of these parameters are estimated by means of in situ measurements and observations as well as by empirical models as is the case with the breach width where several correlations have been proposed to predict breach characteristics froehlich 2008 sammen et al 2017 ahmadisharaf et al 2016 it should be stressed that major uncertainties aleatoric and epistimic may originate from these estimation processes due to a lack of knowledge measurement errors and the random nature of input parameters butt et al 2013 kim and sanders 2016 which can significantly influence the deterministic inundation mapping and related planning actions it is thus crucial to take into account the propagation of uncertainties from the input parameters via numerical models in order to quantify the variability to the output response of quantities of interest qoi wu and hsu 2018 thereby allowing the establishment of probabilistic flood inundation mapping that can provide credible and realistic predictions bharath and elshorbagy 2018 tsai et al 2019 sampling methods are some of the most extensively used approaches for uncertainty propagation analysis the well known monte carlo mc method relies on generating a random sampling of each input parameter accordingly to its probability distribution running the deterministic model and then computing the statistical moments of quantities of interest from the set of the output responses despite the attractiveness of the mc method due to its simplicity it requires a high sample size for an accurate estimation of statistics which can be a major drawback for models demanding large computational consumption ballio and guadagnini 2004 a variety of sampling approaches such as latin hypercube sampling lhs mckay et al 1979 shields and zhang 2016 which is based on stratified sampling and low discrepancy sampling hammersley and handscomb 1964 sobol and levitan 1999 have been developed to alleviate the cumbersome computational cost these approaches improve the sampling strategy and thus reduce the number of sample points by ensuring they are efficiently widespread over the random space in addition to the aforementioned sampling techniques polynomial chaos expansion pce presents a practical alternative for uncertainty analysis based on the spectral representation of the output response as a polynomial expansion of the input variables ghanem and spanos 1991 pce selects the orthogonal basis functions in relation to the probability distribution functions of the input random parameters to ensure the best efficacy of the expansion xiu and karniadakis 2002 non intrusive polynomial chaos expansions nipce have been increasingly applied to uncertainty analysis by many researchers these methods unlike the so called intrusive techniques soize and ghanem 2004 mathelin et al 2005 treat the deterministic solver as a black box which renders them more useful since the source codes of most commercial software systems are not available in addition to the projection technique which is based on a multidimensional numerical quadrature reagana et al 2003 avdonin et al 2018 the so called regression technique has been successfully employed to compute the expansion s coefficients non intrusively using the least square minimization procedure berveiller et al 2006 other approaches originate from the nipce based on the selection of the sampling points in the input domain including the probabilistic collocation method pcm tatang et al 1997 li and zhang 2007 the point collocation method pcol hosder et al 2007 hosder and walters 2010 and more recently a non intrusive approach that requires fewer collocation points polynomial chaos decomposition with differentiation pcdd thapa et al 2018 2019 the use of nipc expansions to estimate the statistics of quantities of interest presenting smooth and continuous variations as a function of the input parameters yields accurate values however for problems with dominate hyperbolic behaviour or with discontinuities in the random or physical space a global polynomial basis that spans the entire random space is used which generates spurious oscillations in the approximated output response these spurious oscillations known as gibbs phenomena bijl et al 2013 produce large deviations from the exact solution with highly non physical values negative water level values and less smooth profiles debusschere et al 2004 a panoply of methods have been introduced to overcome the limited utility of standard pces some of these suggest discretizing the input random space into multiple non overlapping subspaces where either polynomial chaos basis functions chouvion and sarrouy 2016 foo et al 2008 wan and karniadakis 2005 or other types of basis functions such as multi wavelet functions le maitre et al 2004 pettersson et al 2013 can be used to locally approximate the output response jakeman et al 2013 van halder et al 2018 in this context the b splines basis functions present a promising tool to mitigate the oscillatory behaviour of the output response with regard to the mathematical properties they procure indeed ditkowski et al 2018 recently presented a detailed comparison that addressed the attractive features of b splines in contrast to some of the limitations of pc basis functions in approximating the statistical moments and more particularly the probability distribution of quantities of interest that do not smoothly depend on their inputs the application of b splines basis functions in the field of uncertainty analysis has gradually gained in interest since the advent of isogeometric analysis concepts iga hughes et al 2005 as indicated by a growing number of studies dertimanis et al 2018 li et al 2019 beck et al 2019 recently a non intrusive b splines bézier elements based method bsbem was introduced abdedou and soulaïmani 2019 for uncertainty propagation analysis for hyperbolic problems inspired by the iga approach this method relies on approximating the stochastic output response using a b splines polynomial expansion over the bézier elements on the parametric domain which corresponds to the cumulative distribution function the objective of this study is to apply the aforementioned bsbem to perform uncertainty propagation analysis and surrogate model construction in the case of the hypothetical failure of an actual dam located within the province of québec canada realistic terrain data and model parameters are available for this dam such as the bathymetry roughness coefficients initial water level average breach width and upstream discharge the variability of the output responses such as the downstream water level and the discharge as a function of time at various locations of the reach under study are evaluated by the proposed expansion and compared to the values from the reference monte carlo method and the polynomial chaos based point collocation approach furthermore this paper complements the previously published one abdedou and soulaïmani 2019 and pushes the bsbem method towards its potential in realistic applications for engineering interests by investigating its abilities to accurately estimate beyond the statistical moments the whole probability density functions pdfs of the output quantities the predictions of the pdfs aspects are particularly worth investigating because as reported in the literature even though the classical pce approaches may be accurate enough to predict the statistical moments they may fail to accurately estimate the pdfs this issue is therefore deeply investigated in the present work the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the concepts of the non intrusive pce and bsbe methods section 3 presents a comparative evaluation of the performance of both the bsbem and pcol methods applied to an analytical solution of an idealized dam break test case the results of a hypothetical rupture of a real dam are then presented in terms of statistical moments and probability distributions finally a summary and concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 uncertainty propagation methodology the general framework for uncertainty analysis relies on several steps de rocquigny et al 2008 sudret 2007 i quantifying the sources of uncertainty which involves the estimation of uncertainty of input parameters aleatoric and epistimic ii propagating the uncertainty through the model which transforms the measure of uncertainty in the input into the measure of uncertainty in the outputs iii post processing the results by computing the statistics of the outputs and sensitivity indices as mentioned above the present study is focused solely on uncertainty propagation in addition to the classical monte carlo mc method two non intrusive stochastic expansion approaches the point collocation method pcol and the b splines bézier elements method bsbem are used here to deal with uncertainty propagation in physical problems presenting hyperbolic behaviour their fundamental concepts will be summarily addressed in the sequel 2 1 non intrusive point collocation method let η η 1 η 2 η m r m be a set of m independent uncertain input parameters defined on the probability space θ σ p where θ is the event space p the probability measure and σ is the σ algebra on θ the statistical behaviour of η i θ with its support denoted by ξ is characterized by a probability density function ϱ i η i in case of the correlated input parameters an appropriate mathematical transformation such as the karhunen loève expansion li and zhang 2007 can be used to remove the correlation prior to the construction of the basis functions oladyshkin and nowak 2012 let us consider a deterministic relationship y m η that links a set of m independent uncertain input parameters to the output response variable y where m represents the model that may be considered as black box the model s output response can be expanded onto multivariate orthogonal basis functions as follows ghanem and spanos 1991 1 y j 1 m α j ψ j η m η where ψ j η denotes the multivariate basis functions that are orthogonal to the joint probability density function ϱ η η i 1 m ϱ i η i m denotes the surrogate model of m α j are the unknown coefficients to be computed and which are space and time dependent α j x t representing the deterministic part of the expansion m is the total number of expansion terms defined as a function of the polynomial chaos order p and the number of the input random parameters m 2 m p m p m the one dimensional basis functions ψ k η i k 1 p i 1 m from which the multivariate basis functions ψ j η j 1 m are constructed must be meticulously selected with respect to the probability density function type indeed there is a correspondence between the probability distribution of the input parameter and which appropriate basis functions must be selected in order to ensure the best convergence and accurately represent the output distributions the most commonly used orthogonal polynomials with their corresponding probability distributions are listed in table 1 xiu and karniadakis 2002 the multivariate basis functions ψ i given in eq 1 are obtained from the product of univariate polynomials xiu 2010 sudret 2008 3 ψ j η ψ p 1 j η 1 ψ p m j η m where the subscript p i j incorporates the multi indices notation q n m so that the sum of all their possible combinations q i 1 m p i j is equal to the total degree of each multivariate polynomial ψ q η ψ j η more implementation details about the multi indices and the construction of the multivariate basis functions are given in sudret 2014 avdonin et al 2018 and miller et al 2018 the unknown coefficients α α 1 α m t of the approximation in eq 1 can be obtained using the regression also called the least square minimization approach one of the non intrusive techniques this method starts with the construction of the experimental design d η 1 η n s t which is defined as a sample set of n s collocation points generated according to the probability density function of each input parameter η 1 η m for each row of the experimental design the deterministic model is run to obtain the corresponding results which are gathered in an output response vector y y 1 m η 1 y n s m η n s t evaluating the obtained multivariate basis functions onto these sampling points within the experimental design allows the construction of a design matrix whose terms are defined as ψ ψ ij ψ j η i i 1 n s j 1 m the unknown coefficients can thus be obtained by solving the normal equation 4 α ψ t ψ 1 ψ t y the number of collocation points in the experimental design has to be larger than the number of expansion terms n s m in order to avoid a potential ill conditioning of the design matrix blatman 2009 the use of the oversampling concept known as the point collocation approach pcol which considers the total number of sampling points as a multiple of the expansion term number n s n p m with n p n the oversampling ratio allows a better estimation of the statistical moments particularly when it is associated with an efficient sampling method such as the lhs halton and harmemesly methods hosder et al 2007 hosder and walters 2010 after obtaining the expansion s coefficients the statistical moments can be estimated easily due to the orthogonality property of the basis functions thus the mean and standard deviation of the output response surface can be expressed as 5 μ e y ξ j 1 m α j ψ j η ϱ η η d η α 1 and 6 σ e y e y 2 1 2 j 2 m α j 2 ψ j 2 η 1 2 respectively where ψ j 2 η is evaluated using the inner product notion whose expression reads ψ i ψ j ξ ψ i η ψ j η ϱ η η d η and where ϱ η η denotes the joint probability function as mentioned above the aforementioned fundamental concepts of the pcol method are summarized in a graphical framework presented in fig 1 2 2 non intrusive b splines bézier elements method the b splines bézier element method bsbem can be categorized as a non intrusive stochastic multi elements approach that consists of local approximations of the output response of quantities of interest using piecewise b splines basis functions over each element named a bézier element borden et al 2011 the b splines basis functions present interesting mathematical features they offer c p 1 continuity local interpolation support a strong convex hull property and a variation diminishing property these attractive characteristics combined with the multi element structure of the bézier extraction operator render them a promising tool for uncertainty analysis even for problems with non smooth or discontinuous outputs rogers 2001 piegl and tiller 1997 a schematic representation of the univariate b splines basis functions 12 global splines of order 2 over the parametric domain their traces on the elements are shown in color in fig 2 for every element their local traces amount into three functions in order blue red and green the basic framework of this method and its implementation algorithm are addressed in detail in abdedou and soulaïmani 2019 let us consider ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ m γ 0 1 m as a set of m independent parametric variables defined in the parametric domain and linked to the set of input random parameters η η 1 η 2 η m r m by the marginal cumulative density function cdf whose image domain is 0 1 which corresponds to the image domain of the b splines basis functions this allows for ξ i η i f i η i η i ϱ i η d η which implies that d ξ i ϱ i η i d η i the basic principle of the method is that it decomposes the definition domain 0 1 of each variable ξ i into nx i non overlapping intervals whose interfaces are defined by the coordinates ξ i 0 ξ i nx i with ξ i 0 0 and ξ i nx i 1 representing the lower and upper bounds respectively of the definition domain the bézier element i e multidimensional element defined as hypercubes for the entire parametric domain γ is defined as a tensor product of univariate intervals i e ξ 1 e 1 ξ 1 e 1 1 ξ m e m ξ m e m 1 with 0 e i nx i and i 1 m the total number of bézier elements in the entire parametric domain is given by n elt i 1 m nx i which increases considerably for high dimensional problems which have a high number of input random parameters i e the curse of dimensionality problem the model s output response y m η is approximated on each bézier element i e as the sum of the piecewise basis functions of the set of parameters ξ 7 y e j 1 nb α j e ψ j e ξ where α j e and ψ j e denote the local coefficients and the local multivariate piecewise b splines basis functions over the e th bézier element i e respectively the number of local multivariate basis functions i e the number of local expansion terms is given by nb i 1 m p i 1 where p i is the polynomial order corresponding to the random parameter ξ i nb grows significantly with increasing dimensionality unlike in the pcol method where the number of basis functions is obtained by total order truncation as given in eq 2 the global approximation of the output response can be built by patching the local approximations on each bézier element i e 8 y e 1 n elt y e ξ λ e ξ where λ e ξ denotes a standard indicator function satisfying λ e ξ 1 if ξ i e and λ e ξ 0 otherwise jakeman et al 2013 van halder et al 2018 the construction of the multivariate basis functions in each element i e can be realized by the tensor product of a set of local univariate polynomials as follows 9 ψ j e ξ ψ 1 e ξ 1 ψ m e ξ m j 1 nb where ψ i e ξ i corresponds to the univariate b splines basis functions that ensure c p i 1 continuity so that ψ i e ξ i n i p i e ξ i i 1 m these basis functions can be obtained with an appropriate mapping from a set of local bernstein s functions by introducing the so called local linear bézier extraction operator c e so that n e ξ c e b e ξ borden et al 2011 where b e denotes the univariate bernstein functions of degree p on the e th bézier element whose explicit recursive form on the parametric domain 0 1 is given by buffa and sangalli 2016 10 b k p ξ 1 ξ b k p 1 ξ 1 ξ b k 1 p 1 ξ with b k 0 ξ 1 and b k p ξ 0 if k 1 or k p 1 bernstein functions can also be defined over the interval τ 1 1 as follows borden et al 2011 11 b k p τ 1 2 1 τ b k p 1 τ 1 2 1 τ b k 1 p 1 τ this recursive expression is more useful for numerical integration by quadratures in this case for a given value of the univariate parameter ξ i ξ i e i ξ i e i 1 0 e i nx i and i 1 m its corresponding parametric value τ i 1 1 can be computed by adopting the following change of variable 12 τ i 2 ξ i ξ i e i ξ i e i 1 ξ i e i 1 ξ i e i the sampling procedure in connection with the above polynomial approximations requires the construction of local experimental design d e in each element i e thus for each i th random variable ξ i in the parametric random vector ξ ξ 1 ξ m a set of n s e nb collocation points are selected randomly in the e i th corresponding interval ξ i e s ξ i e i ξ i e i 1 s 1 n s e thus a local experimental design d e ξ e 1 ξ e s ξ e n s e t with ξ e s ξ 1 e s ξ m e s is constructed as for the aforementioned pcol expansion a local over sampling technique is also possible in each element by introducing an oversampling ratio n s e n p nb the local multivariate basis functions given in eq 9 are evaluated on each row of the local experimental design ψ n s e nb e ψ i j e ψ j e ξ e i i 1 n s e j 1 nb the components of the local experimental design are also used to run the deterministic model to obtain the local output response vector y n s e 1 e y e 1 m η e 1 y e s m η e s y e n s e m η e n s e t where η e s η 1 e s η m e s represents the s th component of the corresponding local experimental design in the random physical domain obtained by the inverse cdf mapping 13 η i e s f i 1 ξ i e s s 1 n s e i 1 m the resulting local design matrix and the output response vector are expressed as 14 ψ nb nb e ψ e ψ e and y nb 1 e ψ e y e a global design matrix ψ m m and global output response vector y m 1 where m i 1 m nx i p i are constructed from the assembly of local design matrices and local output response vectors using the assembly operator ψ a e 1 n elt ψ e and y a e 1 n elt y e introduced by hughes 2012 where the subscripts of the global design matrix components ψ k ℓ are linked to those of the local design matrices ψ r s e by the connectivity array ien with respect to the e th bézier element expressed as k ien r e and ℓ ien s e with k ℓ 1 m and r s 1 nb cottrell et al 2009 scott et al 2011 the unknown coefficients can be computed by solving the resulting global system of equations 15 α ψ 1 y once the coefficients are computed the surrogate model given in eq 7 is realized by extracting the local coefficients α e from the set of global coefficients α found with eq 15 using the same ien connectivity array mentioned above the constructed substitution model can then evaluate the statistical moments of the output quantities of interest whose mean and variance are expressed respectively as follows 16 μ y e y ξ y ϱ η η d η and 17 σ y 2 e y 2 μ y 2 ξ y 2 ϱ η η d η μ y 2 the evaluation of these integrals can be greatly simplified by considering the cumulative density function mapping as detailed above ξ i f i η i and d ξ i ϱ i η i d η i this change of variable allows the integrals to be evaluated over the cdf image domain 0 1 that corresponds to the parametric domain of the basis functions thus the mean and the variance given in eqs 16 and 17 can be expressed respectively as 18 μ y e 1 n elt i e y e d ξ and 19 σ y 2 e 1 n elt i e y e 2 d ξ μ y 2 based on the detailed steps presented above a general flowchart for the implementation of the proposed bsbem is shown in fig 3 the efficiency and accuracy of the aforementioned non intrusive stochastic expansions will be compared in two 1d hydraulic tests 3 results and discussion in the following subsections numerical results for an idealized univariate test case stoker s analytical solution and a hypothetical break of an actual dam are presented and discussed in terms of statistical moments and probability density functions profiles of output quantities of interest 3 1 univariate dam break flow test case analytical solution in this benchmark test case the physical domain is a 100 m flat frictionless channel the dam represented by a vertical gate is located in the middle of the channel x 0 50 m the initial conditions are defined by unequal water levels on both sides of the dam as shown in fig 4 the downstream water depth is kept constant at a deterministic value h ds 1 m while the upstream water depth h up is considered as a noisy input parameter with various values in the random space stoker s solution stoker 1957 an analytical solution of the aforementioned idealized problem is obtained by solving the following polynomial equations delestre et al 2013 seyedashraf and akhtari 2017 seyedashraf et al 2018 20 h x t h up 4 9 g gh up x 2 t 2 c m 2 g h ds u x t 0 m s if x x a t 2 3 x t gh up if x a t x x b t 2 gh up c m if x b t x x c t 0 m s if x c t x where x denotes the axial position x a t x 0 t gh up x b t x 0 t gh up 3 c m and x c x 0 t 2 c m 2 gh up c m c m 2 gh ds and where c m gh m denotes the selected solution of 8 gh ds c m 2 gh up c m 2 2 c m 2 gh ds c m 2 gh ds 2 0 that fulfil both the mathematical and the physical conditions the test case described above depicts an interesting case study for uncertainty propagation analysis and surrogate model building because it presents a low computational cost analytical solution combined with a high degree of difficulty due to the presence of a discontinuity in the output quantities of interest as mentioned earlier such problems have been addressed in the literature and are known to present a serious challenge for polynomial chaos methods for estimation of the stochastic behaviour of output responses in the vicinity of discontinuities pettersson et al 2014 to further investigate this aspect the analytical solution stoker s solution is considered as a deterministic model through which uncertainties are propagated thus the initial upstream water level is considered as a random parameter following a normal distribution centred on the nominal value h up 10 m with a standard deviation value of 0 5 m which represents a coefficient of variation of 5 it has been shown that using a number of sampling points that is twice the minimum required number represents a fairly optimal value of the oversampling ratio n p 2 which when used with a relatively high polynomial order of basis functions leads to a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the point collocation method for smooth and continuous problems hosder et al 2007 hosder and walters 2010 in the sequel we address the effect of the oversampling ratio and its interaction with the polynomial order on the accuracy of the output response especially for cases presenting hyperbolic behaviour with a discontinuity in the physical domain it should be noted that a part of this aspect has been briefly outlined in abdedou and soulaïmani 2019 the evolution of the statistics profiles mean and standard deviation of the water depth as a function of the channel length at simulation time t 4 s obtained from the pcol method using various polynomial order values and an oversampling ratio of two are depicted in fig 5 and compared to that of 10 6 monte carlo simulations the distributions of the mean of the water depth fig 5a obtained from the pcol approach show a smooth profile with a good agreement with those obtained from the mc method over the whole domain except in the regions near the discontinuity where there is a strong oscillatory behaviour indeed by keeping an oversampling ratio of two any increase in the polynomial order from p 2 to p 5 leads to an increase in the intensity of the oscillations this may include unphysical negative values for both water level and velocity as can be seen from the zooms of the selected areas discontinuity region the described behaviour is more remarkable on the standard deviation distribution where it seems to be much more sensitive to the increase of the polynomial order the pcol results clearly change significantly when going from p 2 to p 5 where strong oscillations in terms of amplitude and frequencies appear in the discontinuity region this leads to multiple values of the maximum standard deviation which could be observed in terms of local peak values obtained for p 5 in the region surrounding the discontinuity causing an unrealistic over prediction of the standard deviation as shown in the close up view of the selected zones of the water depth profiles fig 5b similar error structures have been observed in the velocity profiles and because of space limitation their corresponding plots are not shown to further investigate the effect of the interaction between the oversampling ratio and the polynomial order on the statistical moments prediction of discontinuous output responses the convergence of the relative least square mean error l 2 norm given by eq 21 is assessed for a wide range of the aforementioned parameter values 21 l φ 2 k 1 n e φ k surrogate φ k mc 2 k 1 n e φ k mc 2 where φ k stands for the mean or the standard deviation of the output quantity of interest in this case water depth at the k th axial position this error is evaluated by comparing the statistical moments obtained by surrogate models pcol and bsbem with those from the monte carlo reference solution with 10 6 realizations over the total number n e of calculation points axial positions fig 6 shows the variation of the l 2 error of the statistical moments of the water level as a function of the polynomial order for various oversampling ratios one can observe from fig 6a that the error in the mean increases greatly with the increase of the polynomial order thus providing high values of relative errors especially for low oversampling ratios ex n p 2 in the case of hyperbolic discontinuous problems the pce basis functions show spurious oscillations in the vicinity of the discontinuity as shown in fig 5 even though theses oscillations are localized in a small region surrounding the shock their intensity is so strong and increases with the polynomial order that the statistic profiles present as unrealistic and even non physical values fig 5b and so they impact the global tendency of the global l 2 error this is similar to the well known gibbs phenomenon in the approximation theory it can also be seen that as the oversampling ratio is increased from n p 2 to n p 10 the intensity of the error generally diminishes for low chaos orders p 5 and is less remarkable for high chaos orders the same behaviour can be observed in fig 6b which shows the error in the standard deviation with respect to the polynomial chaos order this figure reveals that as the polynomial order increases the plots display rapid divergence almost exponential where the percentage error reaches significant values 10 4 at a higher polynomial order even more distinctly when a low oversampling ratio n p 2 is used thus by considering an oversampling ratio of two n p 2 what is found to be an optimal value for smooth continuous solutions as mentioned above does not yield a suitable convergence with the increase of the polynomial orders for cases with discontinuous output response in contrast by choosing a relatively high value of oversampling ratio n p 10 the error decreases slightly particularly for low values of the polynomial order p 5 to assess the ability of the bsbem to accurately reproduce the monte carlo reference solution the variation of the statistical moments relative errors in the water depth as a function of the bézier elements number nx for a fixed polynomial order p 2 and different oversampling ratios are presented in fig 7 these variations indicate that the relative errors of the bsbem results which are estimated with respect to reference monte carlo statistics decrease monotonically when the number of bézier elements is gradually increased from nx 1 to nx 10 2 it is worth noting that the bsbem approach yields reasonable error values 10 3 for the mean and 10 1 for the standard deviation even for low bézier elements number values which are considerably lower than those from the pcol expansion obtained with low oversampling ratios fig 7 also shows that when the oversampling ratio is increased locally in each bézier element from n p 1 to n p 4 the smoothness of the convergence is slightly improved and the relative error values are reduced for both the mean and the standard deviation for a better interpretation of the relative errors presented above the distributions of the mean and standard deviation of the water level along the channel length obtained from the bsbem for different bézier elements numbers are shown in fig 8 one can observe that errors due to the coarse b splines approximation appear in the mean distribution profile obtained for nx 1 in the discontinuity region fig 8a as nx increases the mean distribution gets smoother and becomes completely superimposed to that of the monte carlo reference solution the same oscillatory behaviour is also observed in the standard deviation profile with more visible discrepancies in the discontinuity region where a high peak value can be seen for nx 1 thus leading to an over prediction of the standard deviation at that location as for the mean distribution this effect is greatly reduced by increasing the number of bézier elements thereby allowing an accurate reproduction of the standard deviation distribution of the water level as shown in fig 8b the combination of the local over sampling and relatively high number of bézier elements shows a remarkable improvement in the prediction of the mean and standard deviation of the water depth where a very good agreement can be observed between the bsbem and monte carlo distributions for nx 100 and n p 4 fig 8c and d it should be pointed out that the observed errors are well controlled using the bsbem across the whole range of the tested configurations unlike the pcol approach which yields spurious oscillations and fails to converge fig 9 presents a comparison of the mean and standard deviation distributions of the water level along the channel length obtained from the bsbem and the pcol using almost the same operating conditions at simulation time t 4 s it is clear that mean distributions are more accurately reproduced by the bsbem and pcol methods than the standard deviation distributions indeed by increasing the oversampling ratio the profiles obtained from the pcol expansion show a smooth distribution but still cannot adequately match the reference mc distribution near the discontinuity where the peak value is under predicted in contrast the distribution obtained from the bsbem with nx 100 illustrates an excellent superimposition with that of the mc solution over the whole domain study it should be emphasized that the computational effort of the bsbem in this univariate case without local oversampling is almost equal to that of the pcol method however when a local oversampling procedure is applied to each bézier element the computational effort required for the bsbem is higher than that of the pcol approach for the same polynomial order 3 2 application to a hypothetical break of an actual dam 3 2 1 description of the study case the aforementioned modelling approaches have been applied for uncertainty propagation analysis regarding a hypothetical break of a 21 m height actual dam located on the batiscan river province of québec which takes its source in the laurentides and discharging south into the saint laurent river the hydraulic behaviour was simulated by using the 1d mascaret software goutal and maurel 2002 which is widely adopted to solve the one dimensional form of the shallow water equations describing a dam break wave however it should be noted that a growing number of 2d and 3d computational dam break models are being used ferrari et al 2009 marsooli and wu 2014 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 the site under study shown in fig 10 is represented by a series of 74 cross sections describing the topography and the bathymetry of the terrain the hydraulic parameters considered in building the deterministic model in mascaret correspond to 1000 year flood episodes the upstream condition is a fixed discharge during the simulation period however its value is uncertain it is randomly selected following a normal distribution with given statistical moments a mean value of 1 343 m 3 s which corresponds to a 1000 year flood event and a coefficient of variation of 5 thus this variability of the upstream discharge combined with those from other considered input random parameters are propagated through the numerical model mascaret to obtain the random output responses at selected cross sections of interest the corresponding water level of a value of 64 86 m represents the water level at the crest of the dam at which the breach is initiated the downstream boundary condition is described by a limnigram with a value of 4 2 m corresponding to the saint laurent river s water depth under high tide conditions the roughness parameters which are represented in this study in terms of the strickler coefficient ks were equally distributed throughout the entire stretch and lumped into two values one of the main channel and one of the floodplain with their corresponding values of 30 and 20 respectively other parameters such as breach characteristics are considered as key parameters due to their great contribution to estimating the peak discharge during the breaking process in the absence of observation evidence various empirical models based on several assumptions have been proposed to estimate these characteristics these estimations of the nominal values are prone to high uncertainty which significantly impact the reliability of the dam break analysis according to the results from some relevant investigations sammen et al 2017 vorogushyn et al 2011 in the current study the dam s breach height is fixed at 18 13 m and its average width is considered equal to four times its height b av 72 52 m the input parameters described above may be subjected to high variability in their nominal values which could induce several uncertainties in the numerical model and thus affect the reliability of the predictions of the output quantities of interest in the present work the upstream discharge the roughness coefficient of the main channel and the average width of the breach have been identified as independent random variables with their a priori probability density functions pdf from which uncertainties are propagated throughout the one dimensional mascaret hydraulic model the upstream discharge is described by a truncated normal distribution with a mean of 1344 m 3 s which corresponds to the safety flood event discharge and a coefficient of variation of 5 std 67 2 m 3 s the pdf was truncated by a factor of 3 std to avoid generating values of the input discharge outside the bounds of the rating curve of the dam s evacuator the roughness parameter strickler coefficient of the main channel is considered to be uniformly distributed within its plausible range with a mean value of 30 and coefficient of variation of 5 std 1 5 the average width of the breach is considered to follow a normal distribution with a mean of 72 52 m which corresponds to the widely used value of 4 times the breach height while the standard deviation is set to 3 6 m coefficient of variation of 5 the other parameters i e the roughness coefficient of the floodplain and the downstream water level at the junction with the saint laurent river are treated as deterministic parameters the statistical characteristics of the aforementioned uncertain input parameters are summarized in table 2 stochastic processing requires the generation of samples for random variables according to their probability density functions for a given sample size n s a single value of each random parameter was selected to run the deterministic model for which an in house matlab code was developed to assign the selected values of the input discharge the strickler coefficient and the average width of the breach to their appropriate locations in the pre process files used by the mascaret software this deterministic model was run for each combination of the aforementioned input parameters and the obtained output responses of quantities of interest were extracted from the mascaret output files by the routines developed for statistical post processing and surrogate modelling special treatment is required to take into account the variability of the average width of the breach in the deterministic model call this breach is represented in mascaret by an idealized shape defined by two vertical sides whose gap delineates the breach width as shown in fig 11 which illustrates a typical terrain profile at the location of the dam with a schematic representation of the breach therefore once the value of the breach width is selected within the generated samples the positions of both the left and right sides points 1 2 and 3 4 respectively in fig 11 are updated accordingly using eq 22 22 x 1 2 i x 0 b av i 2 x 3 4 i x 0 b av i 2 where x 0 represents the position of the breach centre fixed with the deterministic value and b av i denotes the selected value of the average breach width from the generated sample in the random space after this updating these positions are then replaced in the input geometric file used by mascaret to run the deterministic model 3 2 2 statistical moments predictions the results are presented here mainly in terms of statistical moment profiles mean and standard deviation of the downstream discharge and water level at selected cross sections in the absence of the analytical solution of such complex situations the monte carlo method was considered as a benchmark reference solution to which other stochastic expansion approaches bsbem and pcol were compared to evaluate their accuracy it is well known that the convergence of the monte carlo method strongly depends on the sample size whose convergence rate is on the order of 1 n s which requires a relatively high number of realizations for suitable accuracy thus the required optimal number of samples has to be defined by conducting a convergence study of the standard deviation of the output quantities of interest water level and downstream discharge as a function of the number of realizations fig 12 shows the convergence of the standard deviation of the water level and discharge at specific locations downstream of the dam x 8 168 m and 14 555 m for two simulation times t 1 5 h and 3 h versus the number of mc realizations the total number of 50 000 mc realizations is retained in this study to generate results that can be considered as reference solutions to use in assessing the reliability of other approaches the runtime required to achieve 50 000 mc realizations using a personal computer intel r xeon r cpu e3 125 v6 3 30 ghz is approximately 359 h fig 13 displays the variation of the standard deviations of the discharge and of the water level as a function of time at two locations x 8 168 m and 14 555 m obtained from pcol expansion with various polynomial orders the results are presented for a value of oversampling ratio that is twice the minimum required number of collocation points n p 2 which is highly recommended for smooth continuous problems hosder et al 2007 hosder and walters 2010 as can be seen from these figures slight oscillations appear near the front wave when a relatively low value of polynomial order p 3 is used the intensity of these oscillations increases greatly as the polynomial order is increased from p 3 to p 7 where a strong oscillatory behaviour is observed with high oscillations amplitude leading to an overestimation and non physical value of the statistical moment for both downstream discharge figs 13a and c and water level figs 13b and d it should be emphasized that for smooth continuous problems once the oversampling ratio is fixed to n p 2 any increase in the polynomial order leads to a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the pce approximation conversely to the present case where the polynomial chaos expansion cannot effectively describe the high hyperbolic behaviour of the flooding wave indeed as shown in fig 13 any increase in the polynomial order leads to the appearance of spurious oscillations with non physical values of the output responses of quantities of interest to illustrate the ability of the bsbem to accurately approximate the statistical moments of the output quantities fig 14 shows the evolution of the standard deviation profiles of the downstream discharge and water level at selected locations x 8 168 m and x 14 555 m as a function of time the results obtained from the bsbem with a fixed polynomial order of the basis functions p i 2 i 1 2 3 and various numbers of bézier elements are compared to those from the 50 000 realization monte carlo reference solution these plots reveal that even for a small value of the number of bézier elements nx i 2 i 1 2 3 the results show a smooth profile even in regions surrounding the front wave the increase in the number of bézier elements from nx i 2 to 5 leads to a real improvement in the bsbem s accuracy to where an excellent agreement is observed with those from the 50 000 mc realizations this improvement is the result of an appropriate split of the random space of each variable into nx i sub domains from which the minimum required number of collocation points n s e i 1 3 p i 1 are selected this procedure provides an efficient distribution of the collocation points within the random space thereby considerably improving the accuracy of the approximation the abilities of the pcol and bsbem approaches to fit the statistical moments obtained by the reference monte carlo method are evaluated together in fig 15 which shows the confidence interval profiles ci quantified in terms of the mean plus and minus two standard deviations of downstream discharge and water level as a function of time at selected cross sections x 8 168 m and 14 555 m these plots clearly indicate that the statistical moment profiles obtained with the pcol expansion with p 3 and n p 6 and with the bsbem approach with p i 2 and nx i 4 i 1 2 3 present an excellent agreement with those from the monte carlo method with 50 000 realizations the propagation of the inundation wave is outlined by the evolution in time for the peak value of discharge and water level which progresses downstream from one cross section to another this progression is accompanied by a high variability range around the mean as illustrated by the confidence interval delineated by upper and lower bounds which transmit the effect of uncertainty propagation stemming from the input parameters into the output responses of the quantities of interest the confidence interval of the water level may be used to establish the probability inundation map by calculating the confidence interval of the uncertain free surface from the uncertain water level and the terrain profile and projecting its lower and upper bounds at a selected time onto the topography of the terrain it is possible to provide an estimated range of the inundated banks of the selected cross section this probabilistic inundation mapping is especially worthwhile as it considers the variability that may be introduced by the input parameters 3 2 3 estimated probability density function in this subsection probability density function of the downstream discharge water level and front wave arrival time at selected cross sections obtained from pcol and bsbem are presented and discussed in comparison with those from the monte carlo and lhs sampling methods fig 16 shows the probability density function of the downstream discharge and water level at selected cross sections x 8 168 m and x 14 555 m at simulation times t 0 5 h and t 1 h respectively which closely correspond to the time of the peak discharge and water level describing the inundation wave the monte carlo sampling method is applied by using the constructed surrogate model from pcol with p 3 n p 6 and bebem with p i 2 nx i 4 to estimate pdfs of the output quantities of interest the results are then compared with those computed from the 50 000 monte carlo realizations using the direct deterministic model the distributions of the downstream discharge show that the pdf resulting from the bsbem is in excellent agreement with the pdf obtained from direct mc simulations unlike the pcol expansion which fails to approximate pdfs as shown in fig 16a and c the deviation observed in the discharge distribution is less visible in the water level pdfs of the surrogate models and so they compare well with the reference monte carlo pdf whose shape is almost gaussian as illustrated in fig 16b and d thus the obtained results clearly show the strong abilities of the bsbem to closely approximate a wider range of pdfs than the pcol expansion to further illustrate the bsbem s ability to well estimate the probability density function of the outputs in addition to the statistical moments the probability distributions of the arrival time of the front wave at different selected locations over the reach are depicted in fig 17 it is important to note that in this work the arrival time of the front wave is defined as the time recorded by the deterministic solver mascaret when the water level at a given downstream cross section is raised by 30 cm compared to the initial water level fig 17 shows that the pdf resulting from the bsbem surrogate is almost superimposed with that resulting from the reference monte carlo method unlike the distributions obtained using the pcol surrogate model where significant deviations can be observed the uncertainty accompanying the wave arrival time increases downstream of the dam as illustrated by the wider range of the probability density function which does not follow a normal distribution the pdfs shown in figs 16 and 17 are obtained for a low variability in the input parameters with coefficients of variation of cv 5 in order to show the bsbem s ability to accurately reproduce the pdfs of the outputs with a relatively high variability of the inputs the effect of increasing the coefficient of variation of the input parameters is depicted in figs 18 and 19 indeed the upstream discharge values are generated by a normal distribution n 1 344 134 4 with a coefficient of variation cv q up 10 truncated at 950 and 1745 m 3 s the average breach width is described by a normal distribution with a coefficient of variation of cv b av 25 which yields n 72 52 18 13 truncated at 36 and 109 m which approximately corresponds to 2 h and 6 h respectively where h represents the dam s breach height wahl 2004 the variability of the strickler coefficient of the river s main channel is represented by a uniform distribution u 17 43 with a coefficient of variation cv ks 25 johnson 1996 fig 18 shows the probability distribution functions of the downstream discharge and water level at two selected cross sections and simulation times where a good agreement can be observed between the pdfs obtained from bsbem surrogate model and those computed from the 10 000 lhs realizations considered as a reference solution unlike the pcol surrogate model where deviations can be detected particularly in the output discharge distributions at both selected locations the effect of increasing the variability of the input parameters is clearly visible in the uncertainty of the output discharge which is traduced by a high variability range indeed as an example we can clearly see the increase in the variability range of the output discharge at x 14 555 m from 1420 1730 m 3 s for a coefficient of variation of 5 to considerably widen to 800 2300 m 3 s for cv q up 10 and cv b av ks 25 as illustrated by figs 16c and 18c respectively the same behaviour is observed in the probability distributions of the front wave arrival time at selected locations over the studied area shown in fig 19 overall an excellent agreement can be clearly observed between the pdfs from the bsbem surrogate model and those from the lhs realizations where the profiles are almost superimposed with the exception of the results obtained at the location x 3 098 m where some slight discrepancies can be noted between both distributions bsbem and lhs on the other hand one can clearly note that the pcol surrogate model fails to reproduce the shape of the front wave arrival time distributions over the whole selected locations the uncertainty related to the arrival time of the front wave which increases as the wave evolves through the studied reach is greatly affected by the increase in the uncertainty of the input parameters as illustrated by the variability range of the distribution functions of the front wave arrival time shown in figs 17d and 19d which correspond respectively to the low and high coefficient of variation of the input parameters 3 2 4 computational efficiency this subsection provides a computational efficiency analysis of the bsbem approach in comparison to the pcol and the mc methods it should be emphasized that all programs involved in this paper were implemented serially and the computations were performed on a personal computer intel r xeon r cpu e3 125 v6 3 30 ghz and 16 gb memory the computational efficiency can be estimated among other ways by comparing the number of numerical solver runs thus for instance a bsbem with p i 2 nx i 2 and nx i 4 requires 216 and 1 827 runs respectively which makes the bsbem 231 and 30 times respectively faster than the monte carlo sampling method with 50 000 runs the pcol approach with p 2 an n p 6 requires 84 model evaluations which makes it 595 times faster than the monte carlo method another aspect of the comparison concerns the required cost to approximate the pdfs of the outputs thus the computed pdf with the direct monte carlo method requires a high computational cost 359 h to achieve 50 000 realizations while for the pcol and bsbem approaches the computational time is on the order of minutes 13 min for bsbem and 14 min for pcol to perform 50 000 realizations with the generated surrogate models it is worth mentioning that the gain in the computational effort with bsbem is expected to be more substantial for cases involving 2d and 3d configurations with a computational domain consisting of millions of nodes in some applications where the classical sampling techniques mc lhs may require a huge computational cost 4 conclusion this study describes the implementation of the non intrusive b splines bézier elements method bsbem for uncertainty propagation analysis for a hypothetical rupture of a real dam the method which belongs to the multi elements approaches is based on splitting the random space of the input parameters which corresponds to the parametric domain into subspaces called bézier elements within which the stochastic output response is approximated by local b splines basis functions the coefficients allowing this local approximation are calculated non intrusively by the regression technique stoker s analytical solution of the downstream water level and velocity for an idealized dam break flow was first considered as a test case to assess the bsbem s performance compared to that of the polynomial chaos based pcol expansion the variation of l 2 error norms of mean and standard deviation for both methods has clearly revealed the limitation of pc expansion particularly for relatively high polynomial order to accurately approximate the statistics of problems where discontinuity occurs in the output quantities where a strong divergence in the l 2 error is observed our assessment also showed that using an oversampling ratio beyond the recommended value for smooth problems or twice the number of expansion terms combined with a lower polynomial order contributes to mitigating the divergence rate as much as possible in contrast the bsbem showed a better and monotonic convergence rate of the mean and standard deviation errors as the number of bézier elements is increased producing smooth profiles of the water level and velocity the introduced method was then applied to analyze the propagation of uncertainties over numerical models describing the flood wave resulting from a hypothetical break of an actual dam located in the province of québec the variability of the input parameters namely the upstream discharge the strickler roughness coefficient of the main channel and the average breach width was defined in accordance with their corresponding probability distributions around the deterministic nominal values the generated uncertainties were then propagated through the one dimensional hydrodynamic deterministic model and their impact on the output response quantified in terms of the statistical moments and probability density functions of the downstream water level and discharge as a function of time at different locations of the considered reach the results reveal that the bsbem provides smooth profiles of the standard deviation and confidence interval as a function of time accurately describing the variability accompanying the flood wave propagation at different locations furthermore the predictions obtained using the bsbem were found to be in excellent agreement with those from the 50 000 monte carlo and 10 000 lhs realizations unlike the pcol expansion that estimated spurious oscillations this oscillatory behaviour was slightly mitigated by using a low polynomial order and a relatively high oversampling ratio another meaningful result stemming from this study is the remarkable efficiency of the bsbem to successfully approximate the probability distribution of the outputs unlike the pcol approach which cannot accurately predict these pdfs especially for the front wave arrival time this study s main findings indicate that the bsbem presents an efficient tool for dealing with uncertainty propagation through complex dam break flow models thereby making it possible to establish probabilistic inundations maps for flood hazard predictions that takes into account uncertainty stemming from input parameters the applicability of the presented approach can be successfully extended to other complex system with hyperbolic non smooth or even discontinuous behaviour for high dimensional problems the total number of collocation points is greatly affected by the number of bézier elements and the number of random variables which could present a drawback in terms of computational cost curse dimensionality more research effort is still required to solve the problem of curse dimensionality in the bsbem the curse of dimensionality is inherited from the use of a simple tensor product of a one dimensional basis to build the multivariate basis this aspect highlights an area of potential research improvements one idea that could be pursued to overcome at least partially the problem of curse dimensionality is the use of local refinements while still using the tensor product for instance if more accuracy is required for the tails of the cdf the number of elements could be increased locally therefore patches will constitute the mesh and nx i will be defined for each patch the use of unstructured splines as in u splines thomas et al 2018 or t splines sangalli et al 2016 sederberg et al 2003 scott et al 2011 is another idea to be investigated though not trivial for a dimension greater than 3 nevertheless once the surrogate model based on bsbem has been built the computational effort which is on the order of minutes remains insignificant compared to that of the standard monte carlo

5206,climate change has emerged as a key issue for hydropower management and development in future this study systematically evaluates the impact of climate change on reservoir inflow hydropower output sustainability and efficiency under the representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 by taking the pearl river basin in china as the case the variable infiltration capacity model is coupled with global climate models to project future hydropower changes it is shown that future reservoir inflow and hydropower output significantly differ from the historical ones dry years in future are projected to become drier leading to decrease in hydropower output that in turn reduces hydropower reliability and resiliency and increases the vulnerability wet years would get wetter but the hydropower output does not necessarily increase possibly due to more surplus water released from reservoirs during flood seasons for normal years neither of reservoir inflow and hydropower output displays obvious changes moreover water use efficiency of the west river in wet years and that of the north river in wet normal and dry years would be lower in future while the east river during non flood seasons in dry years is expected to have higher water use efficiency our study can potentially provide an insight into the response of hydropower to climate change and help policy makers and stakeholders manage future hydropower generation keywords hydropower generation sustainability climate change coupled model pearl river basin china 1 introduction hydropower not only provides low cost clean and renewable electricity to support the economic development watts et al 2015 van vliet et al 2016 flörke et al 2018 but also makes a critical contribution to the reliability of electricity system liao et al 2018 chung and kim 2018 however the rising hydrometeorological extremes such as floods and droughts triggered by climate change exert large negative impact on hydropower fakhri et al 2013 ragettli et al 2016 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 huss and hock 2018 li et al 2020a b which threatens hydropower sustainability through altering spatiotemporal distribution of water resources and in turn poses a challenge for future hydropower management and development kusangaya et al 2014 bartos and chester 2015 kao et al 2015 mendes et al 2017 feng et al 2017 goldemberg et al 2018 chang et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 as such the comprehensive understanding of future response of hydropower on climate change is urgent and necessary in terms of future hydropower planning and adjustment of current policies stickler et al 2013 boehlert et al 2016 teotónio et al 2017 a great deal of attentions have been drawn at both global and regional scales to the impact of climate change on hydropower during the recent years hamududu and killingtveit 2018 zhou et al 2015 turner et al 2017 one infers that the change in global hydropower output in future due to climate change is modest turner et al 2017 at regional scale some argue that climate change would cause the decline in streamflow and induce more droughts resulting in lower hydropower output in future such as the amazon and iberian regions lobanova et al 2016 mendes et al 2017 and the mozambique uamusse et al 2017 while some studies hold the opposite opinion that the hydropower output mostly in wet regions is projected to increase along with increasing reservoir inflows for examples the upper mekong basin zhong et al 2019 and the zambezi basin spalding fecher et al 2017 in california however the streamflow variability is getting higher leading to significant decline in hydropower output even though the streamflow overall is increased tarroja et al 2016 2018 therefore the impact of climate change on hydropower is complex and can vary substantially from one place to another a study on regional hydropower changes in response to future climate change enables a comparison among different regions and enriches the knowledge of climate change impact on hydropower generation the pearl river basin prb as one of the most prosperous regions in china is the second largest drainage basin in the country zhang et al 2018 li et al 2020c controlled by a tropical and sub tropical climate the basin receives abundant precipitation annually with plenty of water resources indicating the considerable potential for hydropower development liu et al 2015 2016 zhang et al 2017 li et al 2018 specifically the annual generation capacity of hydropower in 2015 has exceeded 780 tw h li et al 2018 indeed hydropower plays a vital role in supporting the rapid economic development in the basin nonetheless the basin suffered from frequent severe droughts with rather prolonged water deficit periods during the recent decade for example the one during 2009 2011 niu et al 2014 such severe droughts are mostly driven by climate anomalies negatively affecting hydropower output zhang et al 2012 in future climate anomalies are expected to enhance and dry wet period is more likely to get drier wetter which is different from the historical period making hydropower more uncertain in this basin chou et al 2013 donat et al 2016 deng et al 2018 with the increasing power demand it is of paramount importance to deal with possible electricity crises caused by climate change unfortunately limited studies have been conducted regarding future hydropower changes in prb more importantly there are still lack of studies on the efficiency and sustainability of hydropower during future dry wet and normal periods worldwide as the existing ones usually do not classify future period into the three categories consequently they can only reveal the overall hydropower efficiency and sustainability for the whole study period for example the one in the upper mekong river conducted by zhong et al 2019 this is far from adequate in practice given that future climate anomalies are quite different in dry wet or normal periods donat et al 2016 to overcome such shortage this study set out to systematically assess the effect of future climate change on hydropower sustainability and efficiency for future dry wet and normal periods by taking the prb as the case region and uses variable infiltration capacity vic model and global climate model gcm projections the study has potential to provide scientific and useful information for governors and stakeholders to better manage hydropower in prb and enrich the knowledge of responses of hydropower to climate change which can be referenced by other basins across the globe 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the prb 102 14 115 53 e 21 31 26 49 n covers a total drainage area of 453 690 km2 fig 1 annual precipitation ranges from 1200 to 2500 mm and it is unevenly distributed in time which concentrates on the flood season during may september accounting for more than 70 of the annual total the annual average runoff volume is about 33 1010 m3 with enormous hydropower potential zhang et al 2012 the pear river is composed of three major tributaries the west north and east rivers of which the west river is the longest the west river with abundant runoff and steep gradient provides the good natural and construction conditions for hydropower development a survey of hydropower resources shows that the gross hydropower potential and the exploitable installed capacity of the west rive are 29 430 mw and 21 600 mw respectively several large hydropower plants for examples the tianshengqiao one tsq longtan lt and yantan yt have been operated by the year 2018 with the total installed capacity of up to 13 262 mw the hydropower generation in west river provides the power guarantee for the economy development of both the guangxi and guangdong provinces wu et al 2018a b the north river with the total installed capacity of 348 mw is the second largest river while the total installed capacity of the east river has reached 490 mw the major hydropower plants in each tributary are selected in this study specifically three hydropower plants i e tsq lt and yt are selected in west river and their total installed capacity is 8710 mw the hydropower plants of the feilaixia flx reservoir in north river and xinfengjiang xfj reservoir in east river are also chosen the installed capacities of which are 140 mw and 335 mw respectively flx and xfj are the largest hydropower plants in their own sub basins shi et al 2005 wu et al 2018a b altogether the installed capacities of the five plants occupy 65 of the total over prb therefore the selected hydropower plants can be representative for prb the information including some parameters of these hydropower plants are listed in table 1 and their geographical locations are shown in fig 1 2 2 data daily meteorological datasets covering 1960 2015 are collected from 91 observational stations in and around prb fig 1 the historical data reach 56 years and can represent the historical climate variation in prb the datasets include precipitation maximum air temperature mean air temperature minimum air temperature air pressure wind speed relative humidity and sunshine duration all of these meteorological datasets are provided by the china meteorological administration http cdc nmic cn home do the temporal coverage of the datasets exceeds 99 7 and the missing data are filled in by the average value of its neighboring days the datasets are interpolated into 0 1 spatial resolution by using the kriging method to match the spatial resolution used in the vic model see below gcm that provides tools for future climate projections is used to determine future reservoir inflow and hydropower output in prb climate projections among different gcms exist certain variability due to their different implementations and initial states asseng et al 2013 a single gcm is inadequate to provide a stable and reliable future climate projection and multiple gcms should be used huang et al 2013 belachsen et al 2017 mendes et al 2017 here five gcms are utilized for climate projections i e canesm2 cnrm cm5 csiro mk3 6 miroc esm and mpi esm lr which are selected from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change given that they have been proven to perform satisfactorily in future climate projections for southern china huang et al 2013 wang et al 2017 all the projections are based on three representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 which represent the greenhouse gas emissions levels from low to high all of the gcm outputs in this study are relied on the first ensemble member of each model referred to as r1i1p1 in all of the experiments the coarse resolution of the gcms has hampered their direct coupling with vic previously gcm is generally downscaled through statistical or dynamical downscaling method and the former one is widely applied due to its simplicity chen et al 2019 fenta mekonnen and disse 2018 though downscaling methods may yield some biases on the whole they are capable of reflecting local climate features and processes from original gcms wilby et al 1998 mcsweeney et al 2015 hamlet et al 2019 recently downscaled gcms based on statistical downscaling methods have been commonly used to analyze the potential impact of future climate change on hydropower tarroja et al 2016 zhong et al 2019 in this study the bias corrected climate imprint bcci method one of the delta statistical downscaling methods is applied to downscale the gcms to the 0 1 spatial resolution a study has showed that the downscaled gcms by bcci can be used to explore the relevant impact of climate change wang et al 2017 the period of 2030 2100 is considered as the future period and 1960 2015 is the historical period 2 3 vic model and hydropower model to generate the streamflow under future climate change scenarios the vic model is coupled with gcms the physically based vic model liang et al 1994 1996 can balance both water and energy budgets for land surface atmosphere hydrometeorological processes within a grid cell the soil column of the model is divided vertically into three layers the top two represent the response of the soil moisture to the rainfall events while the bottom one represents the seasonal soil moisture behavior the evapotranspiration module consists of three parts including canopy evaporation vegetation transpiration and soil water evaporation using the variable infiltration curve the surface runoff portion is calculated from the top two soil layers and the underground base flow is from the bottom soil layer based on the arno base flow formulation in addition the penman monteith allen et al 1998 is used to simulate the potential evapotranspiration since the detailed continuous historical observational reservoir inflow data are unavailable for our study it is more appropriate to employ the model which has been used in the same region previously since the vic model is widely used in the basin and the applicability of the model has been demonstrated in many studies niu et al 2014 2015 niu and chen 2010 2016 wang et al 2017 this study employs vic to simulated daily reservoir inflows and the monthly or annual inflows are obtained based on the daily inflow values surface elevation data used in vic are from the 90 90 m shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model downloaded from the international scientific and technical data mirror site land cover data with spatial resolution of 1 1 km are from the resources and environmental sciences data center chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn since the vic model only yields runoff data at each grid cell a large scale horizontal routing model lohmann et al 1996 was applied to generate streamflow based on vic outputs six parameters of vic that control the runoff generation and routing are calibrated to obtain optimized values including a shape of the vic curve the maximum velocity of base flow dm fraction of dm where non linear base flow begins the fraction of maximum soil moisture where non linear base flow occurs the thickness of the second soil moisture layer and the thickness of the third soil moisture layer by adjusting the parameters the simulated streamflow values fit the observed values well and the optimized parameters are determined the model is run at the daily scale with 0 1 spatial resolution across the whole prb using the observational streamflow data from the gaoyao shijiao and boluo hydrological stations covering 1960 2000 collected from the guangdong hydrology bureau the model is calibrated for the period 1960 1980 and validated for 1981 2000 there is a reasonable fit between the estimated streamflow and the observations the monthly nash sutcliffe efficiency is generally greater than 0 85 and the determination coefficient is higher than 0 85 for both the calibration and validation in particular nash sutcliffe efficiency for the gaoyao and shijiao stations is greater than 0 95 the relative bias for the three stations is lower than 3 table 2 and more detailed calibration and validation results can be found in li et al 2020a in light of this the simulated reservoir inflow for the historical period can be applied for further analysis the dynamic programming is utilized to optimize hydropower output during the historical and future periods bellman 1961 as one of the most robust methods dynamic programming has been commonly used for the optimization of reservoir operation cheng et al 2012 ji et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 feng et al 2017 2018 in the dynamic programming model the storage volume of reservoir in each stage is divided into a finite number of points by exhaustive enumerating all possible combinations of these discrete points the global optimum is determined zhang et al 2015 the objective function of the model is described as 1 max e max t 1 t n i t δ t where e is the total hydropower plant power generation kw h ni t is the total output of the ith hydropower plant of the period t mw t and δ t are the total operation period and the duration of an operation stage respectively the water level constraint in this model is expressed as 2 z i min z i t z i max where zi min zi max are the dead water level and the highest water level of the reservoir respectively zi t is the water level of the ith reservoir of the period t the reservoir storage constraint is given as 3 q i min q i t q i max where qi min qi max are the minimum and the maximum discharges of the reservoir respectively qi t is the discharge of the ith reservoir of the period t while the output constraint is as follows 4 n i min n i t n i max where ni min ni min are the basic output and the installed capacity of the hydropower plant respectively ni t is the output of the ith hydropower plant of the period t lastly the reservoir water balance constraint is formulated as 5 v i t 1 v i t q i t q i t δ t where vi t vi t 1 are the storage of the ith reservoir at the beginning and the end of period t respectively qi t qi t are the inflow and discharge of the ith reservoir during the average period t respectively 2 4 assessment of future changes in hydropower establishing the likely effect of climate change on sustainability and efficiency of hydropower is a priority for their successful future management raje and mujumdar 2010 thushara de silva and hornberger 2019 to reflect sustainability of hydropower three indices i e the reliability resilience and vulnerability are employed the reliability refers to the probability of normal running of the hydropower system and resiliency is a measure of recovering from a failure the vulnerability represents the severity of failure quantitatively the reliability is measured by the assurance rate ar the resiliency re and output gap og are to represent the resiliency and vulnerability respectively greater ar re and og values indicate higher reliability and resiliency and vulnerability respectively and vice versa they appear as 6 ar n n n base n 100 7 re i 1 n 1 n i n base n i 1 n base n n n base 100 8 og max 0 n base n n base where n n n base is the number of days when monthly hydropower output satisfies the base output n base and n n n base points to the opposite situation n is the total number of days for all months and n refers to the monthly actual hydropower output mw n i is the hydropower output on the month i and is the indicator function that returns 1 when satisfying the condition and 0 if not the hydropower output was simulated at the monthly scale in the study to assess changes in the efficiency of hydropower plants two metrics are used i e the abandoned water aw which determines the amount of surplus water that could not be used effectively and the water use efficiency wue that determines the proportion of the water amount used for hydropower generation to the total amount these two indices can be described as follows 9 aw q out q p 10 wue q p q out where q p is the discharge for generate hydropower m3 s and q out is the total reservoir outflow m3 s the changes in reservoir inflow and hydropower output for dry wet and normal years under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios are explored in the current study in which the dry wet and normal years are identified based on china national standard for hydrological information and hydrological forecasting gb t 22482 2008 according to this standard the percentage of annual runoff anomaly is used to identify the dry wet and normal years defined as 11 arap a r i ar ar 100 where arap is the percentage of annual runoff anomaly a r i is the annual runoff in the ith year ar is the inter annual average runoff when arap in a specific year is less than 10 the year is considered as a dry year while arap is greater than 10 the year is identified as a wet year if arap ranges between 10 and 10 the year belongs to a normal year 3 results 3 1 evaluation of coupling vic and gcms the simulated reservoir inflow and hydropower output for the five selected hydropower plants in the pearl river basin during the historical period of 1960 2005 are illustrated in figs 2 and 3 clearly a favorable coincidence between two results from vic with meteorological observations and vic with gcms data is found fig 2 in addition the indices ar og re and wue based on coupled vic and gcm simulations are in agreement with the result from vic driven by meteorological observations fig 3 further the performance of gcms for wet dry and normal years is demonstrated by the scatterplot fig s1 a satisfactory correlation is also found between observations and simulations from gcms especially for mpi esm lr indicating that the gcms can also perform well for wet dry and normal years when looking into the daily scale simulations it is found that the biases between the results from vic driven by gcms and from vic driven by meteorological observations are relatively small table s1 these demonstrate that the coupling of vic and gcms is an effective way for obtaining both the inflow and hydropower output of the hydropower plants which can be used in the subsequent work regarding projection of future changes in hydropower under different rcp scenarios 3 2 historical and future changes in inflow and hydropower output fig 4 and table s2 show the monthly changes in reservoir inflow in the pearl river basin in the future period relative to those in the historical period under the dry wet and normal scenarios tsq lt and yt generally have more reservoir inflows during flood season may september in wet years under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios with 20 of increment however reservoir inflow tends to slightly decease during january april with a maximum reduction of approximately 20 in april in contrast a general decrease is found for future dry years for tsq lt and yt relative to the historical dry years in addition the inflows of these reservoirs present large fluctuations in normal period showing ambiguous trends for flx the inflow presents a remarkable increase from may to october in wet years with the increment of more than 50 in september on the contrary the inflow during the same period generally exhibits a decrease in dry years for the remaining months the changing patterns during dry and wet years do not show obvious difference the inflow at xfj exhibits different changes in dry and wet years specifically inflow generally increases from february to april in dry years while decreases during the same period in wet years but the pattern appears oppositely during june to november regardless of hydropower plants the future reservoir inflows all show large fluctuations for annual total inflow changes it is found that the annual inflow during future wet years is mostly larger than that in historical wet years while the future dry years are expected to have decreased annual inflow relative to historical dry years fig s2 in the supplementary materials the monthly changes in hydropower output in the future period relative to those in the historical period are illustrated in fig 5 and table s3 at first glance there is a close linkage between the reservoir inflow and hydropower output however fig 4 the variation in hydropower output differs from the inflow variation the changes in hydropower output at tsq and lt present similar pattern under three scenarios the hydropower output from january to april in future wet years is most larger than that for the same period in historical wet years while it does not show remarkable change for other months but in future dry years less hydropower output would be obtained than in historical dry years in particular the maximum relative increase at lt is higher than 50 for wet years whereas the maximum reduction has reached approximately 30 for dry years a negative change during january to april is found at yt during future years and a reduction is also found during june to december in dry years for flx the changes in hydropower output are generally similar in both dry and wet years negative change is detected in most cases with a largest decline of approximately 50 in some months surprisingly hydropower output even shows an increase from january to june in the future dry years at xfj and a large increase is seen during october to december in wet years for annual hydropower output in future wet years more hydropower output is expected but in dry years it tends to reduce fig s3 in the supplementary materials 3 3 sustainability and efficiency evaluation the inter annual changes in ar under three scenarios in the future period relative to those in the historical period are shown in fig 6 and table s4 for tsq future dry years mostly experience smaller ar than historical dry years but ar during wet and normal years does not show distinct change ar generally displays a decrease in dry years at lt with a high reduction of more than 40 but it only shows decrease during the non flood season in wet years a negative change in ar at yt is found with large decrease in dry years a large reduction of assurance rate is found at flx during dry period except from january to april ar shows decrease during dry years at xfj but does not show obvious change during wet years fig 7 and table s5 show the monthly changes in og in the future period relative to those in the historical period under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios over the basin a similar variation pattern is detected for tsq and lt dry years mostly present an increase in og but wet years do not show apparent change indicating that climate change may cause a negative impact on hydropower vulnerability in dry years at yt a slight increase in og is only found during the non flood season in addition most of months exhibit large increases during dry years at flx with increment of 25 in november and december with regard to og at xfj it mainly shows increase during dry years overall climate change could exacerbate the vulnerability of hydropower generation in future dry years and potentially causes significant negative impact on reliability of the hydropower system fig 7 and table s5 fig 8 illustrates the changes in annual mean re over the basin in the future period relative to those in the historical period re at tsq lt and yt are similar on the whole mostly presenting a negative change under three scenarios in addition large reduction is projected during wet years for tsq and is found during normal and dry years for yt on the contrary an overall increase in re is detected for xfj with high increment in normal years flx presents a decrease in wet and normal years but an increase during dry years figs 9 and 10 and table s6 7 show the inter annual change patterns of aw and wue in the future period relative to those in the historical period over the pearl river basin for tsq lt and yt future wet years display increase in aw and corresponding decrease in wue during the flood season dry and normal years however do not show obvious change as for flx aw shows a relatively high increase during may to september while an overall decrease in wue is detected an increase in aw is found at xfj during august october in wet years and wue in dry years even shows an increase during january april but presents a reduction in the remaining months 4 discussion while future change in hydropower from the large scale perspective provides a general insight into the climate change effects it may omit the complex hydrological interactions at the local basin scale bosson et al 2013 johansson et al 2015 climate change with resultant increasing temperature and changing rainfall regimes is expected to continue which could significantly alter regionally hydrological responses kusangaya et al 2014 the coupling of gcms with hydrology and hydropower models provides a useful and common approach to reveal the responses of streamflow and hydropower changes to climate change for a specific basin tarroja et al 2016 2018 to discover the possible changes in the hydropower over prb several gcms are selected and their performances before application are evaluated similar to other relevant studies lobanova et al 2016 mendes et al 2017 turner et al 2017 as expected reservoir inflow anomalies lead to similar changes in hydropower output given that hydropower is highly dependent on streamflow availability lobanova et al 2016 li et al 2018 our results also indicate that climate change generally causes larger variability of hydropower output and reservoir inflow compared to the historical period such connection between climate change and hydropower output can be explained by changes in precipitation byrne and o gorman 2015 donat et al 2016 as illustrated in table 3 there is a strong correlation between future annual total precipitation and runoff but no obvious connection between runoff and evapotranspiration is found indicating that future reservoir inflow is largely controlled by precipitation variability and independent of evapotranspiration in fact increase in streamflow anomalies is found in prb along with the occurrence of precipitation induced floods and droughts previously chen et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 wu et al 2017 2018a b deng et al 2018 liu et al 2018 climate change can affect the hydropower by altering the mean annual streamflow shifting seasonal flows and increasing streamflow variability ipcc 2014 the impact of climate change on a specific region depends on the local change in these hydrological characteristics golombek et al 2012 based on an ensemble of 11 gcms beyene et al 2010 found that hydropower generation at the aswan high dam would decrease along with the decreased mean annual river discharge after 2050s similar result is found over the amazon and iberian area where decrease in the streamflow would cause obviously lower hydropower output in the future lobanova et al 2016 mendes et al 2017 on the other hand scientists argued that future higher streamflow variability would have negative impact on the hydropower generation even if the streamflow is overall increased such as in california tarroja et al 2018 by comparison in sweden the annual hydrograph will become more similar to the variation in electricity demand due to increase in the total runoff resulting in more hydropower generation renofalt et al 2010 unlike these results the findings of this study provide more detailed information about how hydropower generation would change along with climate change for wet dry and normal years more specifically in future wet years for most cases more reservoir inflow and hydropower are expected but less during future dry years in comparison to the historical wet and dry years over the basin in other words dry years may get drier while wet years could be wetter figs 4 and s2 in accord with the current viewpoint that the atmospheric water holding capacity increases due to global warming that enhances the hydrological cycle at both regional and global scales causing wet regions becoming wetter and dry regions drier chou et al 2013 greve et al 2014 chadwick et al 2016 donat et al 2016 however it should also be noted that an increase in annual total inflow does not necessarily lead to more annual hydropower output as can be seen in the example of flx compared with historical wet years the future total inflow at flx increase due to increased inflow during the flood season but the inflow shows a reduction for the non flood season which somewhat offset the potential increase in hydropower output during the flood season moreover when suffering from major floods reservoirs need to release excessive water without producing hydropower to avoid dam failure and are therefore unable to make full use of increased inflow in the flood season while in the following non flood season reservoir levels fall below their historical mean level and reduces hydropower output tarroja et al 2016 in this regard even though the future simulations indicate more total reservoir inflow it does not always lead to significant increase in hydropower output for wet years it is also noteworthy that future hydropower generation exhibits higher vulnerability for dry years and mostly shows lower reliability and resiliency hydropower output and the installed capacity over prb have been developed rapidly during the recent decades which provides a support for local economic development and becomes a key component in achieving emission reduction to mitigate and cope with climate change the local government promotes the use of renewable energy particularly the hydropower unfortunately future climate change may limit the function of hydropower supply and even lead to increase in greenhouse gas emissions liu et al 2015 2016 due to decrease in reliability of hydropower generation the power system have to lay more dependence on thermal power generation to meet the local electric requirement to compensate for the hydropower generation gap as a consequence climate change could inevitably increase the risk against the successful operation of hydropower and long term energy planning wang et al 2014 li et al 2018 with the ongoing socio economic development the demand for electricity over prb continues to increase for the foreseeable future zhao et al 2014 liu et al 2018 for this circumstance one should not only adopt measures for climate change but also pay more attention to the loss of hydropower arising from climate change wang et al 2014 it is essential to improve the structure of power generation and strengthen the management between hydropower and other power sources while this study reveal climate change impact on future hydropower generation at meso time scale future works should focus upon the impact of weather variability on hydropower for example storm induced flood events usually last a few days or weeks which might have limited impact on the long term monthly or longer hydropower generation yet they can result in reservoir lost capacity due to flood regulation and affect sub monthly or sometimes even monthly hydropower generation apart from this future work should also conduct the sensitivity analysis of climate change impact on hydropower to quantitatively determine the contributions of different climate factors such as precipitation and temperature to future hydropower changes which would help policy makers and stakeholders better understand the role of each climate factor in local hydropower system 5 conclusions this study systematically evaluates the future changes in reservoir inflow hydropower output and its sustainability and efficiency under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios by taking the pearl river basin as the case region based on the coupling of gcms with vic the case study supports that reservoir inflow and hydropower output under all three scenarios show larger fluctuations compared with the historical period an overall increase in inflow and hydropower output is expected in future wet years but large decrease is found in dry years and no obvious change exists in normal years correspondingly future hydropower in dry years would have higher vulnerability with lower reliability and resiliency also note that increased inflow does not always produce more hydropower output partly because reservoirs are unable to make full use of inflow and release surplus water during the flood season finally the west river in wet years and north river in wet normal and dry years are more likely to have lower water use efficiency in future while the east river during non flood seasons in dry years tends to have higher water use efficiency more measures should therefore be adopted to cope with loss of hydropower caused by climate change in future and better manage hydropower as well as other power sources credit authorship

5206,climate change has emerged as a key issue for hydropower management and development in future this study systematically evaluates the impact of climate change on reservoir inflow hydropower output sustainability and efficiency under the representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 by taking the pearl river basin in china as the case the variable infiltration capacity model is coupled with global climate models to project future hydropower changes it is shown that future reservoir inflow and hydropower output significantly differ from the historical ones dry years in future are projected to become drier leading to decrease in hydropower output that in turn reduces hydropower reliability and resiliency and increases the vulnerability wet years would get wetter but the hydropower output does not necessarily increase possibly due to more surplus water released from reservoirs during flood seasons for normal years neither of reservoir inflow and hydropower output displays obvious changes moreover water use efficiency of the west river in wet years and that of the north river in wet normal and dry years would be lower in future while the east river during non flood seasons in dry years is expected to have higher water use efficiency our study can potentially provide an insight into the response of hydropower to climate change and help policy makers and stakeholders manage future hydropower generation keywords hydropower generation sustainability climate change coupled model pearl river basin china 1 introduction hydropower not only provides low cost clean and renewable electricity to support the economic development watts et al 2015 van vliet et al 2016 flörke et al 2018 but also makes a critical contribution to the reliability of electricity system liao et al 2018 chung and kim 2018 however the rising hydrometeorological extremes such as floods and droughts triggered by climate change exert large negative impact on hydropower fakhri et al 2013 ragettli et al 2016 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 huss and hock 2018 li et al 2020a b which threatens hydropower sustainability through altering spatiotemporal distribution of water resources and in turn poses a challenge for future hydropower management and development kusangaya et al 2014 bartos and chester 2015 kao et al 2015 mendes et al 2017 feng et al 2017 goldemberg et al 2018 chang et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 as such the comprehensive understanding of future response of hydropower on climate change is urgent and necessary in terms of future hydropower planning and adjustment of current policies stickler et al 2013 boehlert et al 2016 teotónio et al 2017 a great deal of attentions have been drawn at both global and regional scales to the impact of climate change on hydropower during the recent years hamududu and killingtveit 2018 zhou et al 2015 turner et al 2017 one infers that the change in global hydropower output in future due to climate change is modest turner et al 2017 at regional scale some argue that climate change would cause the decline in streamflow and induce more droughts resulting in lower hydropower output in future such as the amazon and iberian regions lobanova et al 2016 mendes et al 2017 and the mozambique uamusse et al 2017 while some studies hold the opposite opinion that the hydropower output mostly in wet regions is projected to increase along with increasing reservoir inflows for examples the upper mekong basin zhong et al 2019 and the zambezi basin spalding fecher et al 2017 in california however the streamflow variability is getting higher leading to significant decline in hydropower output even though the streamflow overall is increased tarroja et al 2016 2018 therefore the impact of climate change on hydropower is complex and can vary substantially from one place to another a study on regional hydropower changes in response to future climate change enables a comparison among different regions and enriches the knowledge of climate change impact on hydropower generation the pearl river basin prb as one of the most prosperous regions in china is the second largest drainage basin in the country zhang et al 2018 li et al 2020c controlled by a tropical and sub tropical climate the basin receives abundant precipitation annually with plenty of water resources indicating the considerable potential for hydropower development liu et al 2015 2016 zhang et al 2017 li et al 2018 specifically the annual generation capacity of hydropower in 2015 has exceeded 780 tw h li et al 2018 indeed hydropower plays a vital role in supporting the rapid economic development in the basin nonetheless the basin suffered from frequent severe droughts with rather prolonged water deficit periods during the recent decade for example the one during 2009 2011 niu et al 2014 such severe droughts are mostly driven by climate anomalies negatively affecting hydropower output zhang et al 2012 in future climate anomalies are expected to enhance and dry wet period is more likely to get drier wetter which is different from the historical period making hydropower more uncertain in this basin chou et al 2013 donat et al 2016 deng et al 2018 with the increasing power demand it is of paramount importance to deal with possible electricity crises caused by climate change unfortunately limited studies have been conducted regarding future hydropower changes in prb more importantly there are still lack of studies on the efficiency and sustainability of hydropower during future dry wet and normal periods worldwide as the existing ones usually do not classify future period into the three categories consequently they can only reveal the overall hydropower efficiency and sustainability for the whole study period for example the one in the upper mekong river conducted by zhong et al 2019 this is far from adequate in practice given that future climate anomalies are quite different in dry wet or normal periods donat et al 2016 to overcome such shortage this study set out to systematically assess the effect of future climate change on hydropower sustainability and efficiency for future dry wet and normal periods by taking the prb as the case region and uses variable infiltration capacity vic model and global climate model gcm projections the study has potential to provide scientific and useful information for governors and stakeholders to better manage hydropower in prb and enrich the knowledge of responses of hydropower to climate change which can be referenced by other basins across the globe 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the prb 102 14 115 53 e 21 31 26 49 n covers a total drainage area of 453 690 km2 fig 1 annual precipitation ranges from 1200 to 2500 mm and it is unevenly distributed in time which concentrates on the flood season during may september accounting for more than 70 of the annual total the annual average runoff volume is about 33 1010 m3 with enormous hydropower potential zhang et al 2012 the pear river is composed of three major tributaries the west north and east rivers of which the west river is the longest the west river with abundant runoff and steep gradient provides the good natural and construction conditions for hydropower development a survey of hydropower resources shows that the gross hydropower potential and the exploitable installed capacity of the west rive are 29 430 mw and 21 600 mw respectively several large hydropower plants for examples the tianshengqiao one tsq longtan lt and yantan yt have been operated by the year 2018 with the total installed capacity of up to 13 262 mw the hydropower generation in west river provides the power guarantee for the economy development of both the guangxi and guangdong provinces wu et al 2018a b the north river with the total installed capacity of 348 mw is the second largest river while the total installed capacity of the east river has reached 490 mw the major hydropower plants in each tributary are selected in this study specifically three hydropower plants i e tsq lt and yt are selected in west river and their total installed capacity is 8710 mw the hydropower plants of the feilaixia flx reservoir in north river and xinfengjiang xfj reservoir in east river are also chosen the installed capacities of which are 140 mw and 335 mw respectively flx and xfj are the largest hydropower plants in their own sub basins shi et al 2005 wu et al 2018a b altogether the installed capacities of the five plants occupy 65 of the total over prb therefore the selected hydropower plants can be representative for prb the information including some parameters of these hydropower plants are listed in table 1 and their geographical locations are shown in fig 1 2 2 data daily meteorological datasets covering 1960 2015 are collected from 91 observational stations in and around prb fig 1 the historical data reach 56 years and can represent the historical climate variation in prb the datasets include precipitation maximum air temperature mean air temperature minimum air temperature air pressure wind speed relative humidity and sunshine duration all of these meteorological datasets are provided by the china meteorological administration http cdc nmic cn home do the temporal coverage of the datasets exceeds 99 7 and the missing data are filled in by the average value of its neighboring days the datasets are interpolated into 0 1 spatial resolution by using the kriging method to match the spatial resolution used in the vic model see below gcm that provides tools for future climate projections is used to determine future reservoir inflow and hydropower output in prb climate projections among different gcms exist certain variability due to their different implementations and initial states asseng et al 2013 a single gcm is inadequate to provide a stable and reliable future climate projection and multiple gcms should be used huang et al 2013 belachsen et al 2017 mendes et al 2017 here five gcms are utilized for climate projections i e canesm2 cnrm cm5 csiro mk3 6 miroc esm and mpi esm lr which are selected from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change given that they have been proven to perform satisfactorily in future climate projections for southern china huang et al 2013 wang et al 2017 all the projections are based on three representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 which represent the greenhouse gas emissions levels from low to high all of the gcm outputs in this study are relied on the first ensemble member of each model referred to as r1i1p1 in all of the experiments the coarse resolution of the gcms has hampered their direct coupling with vic previously gcm is generally downscaled through statistical or dynamical downscaling method and the former one is widely applied due to its simplicity chen et al 2019 fenta mekonnen and disse 2018 though downscaling methods may yield some biases on the whole they are capable of reflecting local climate features and processes from original gcms wilby et al 1998 mcsweeney et al 2015 hamlet et al 2019 recently downscaled gcms based on statistical downscaling methods have been commonly used to analyze the potential impact of future climate change on hydropower tarroja et al 2016 zhong et al 2019 in this study the bias corrected climate imprint bcci method one of the delta statistical downscaling methods is applied to downscale the gcms to the 0 1 spatial resolution a study has showed that the downscaled gcms by bcci can be used to explore the relevant impact of climate change wang et al 2017 the period of 2030 2100 is considered as the future period and 1960 2015 is the historical period 2 3 vic model and hydropower model to generate the streamflow under future climate change scenarios the vic model is coupled with gcms the physically based vic model liang et al 1994 1996 can balance both water and energy budgets for land surface atmosphere hydrometeorological processes within a grid cell the soil column of the model is divided vertically into three layers the top two represent the response of the soil moisture to the rainfall events while the bottom one represents the seasonal soil moisture behavior the evapotranspiration module consists of three parts including canopy evaporation vegetation transpiration and soil water evaporation using the variable infiltration curve the surface runoff portion is calculated from the top two soil layers and the underground base flow is from the bottom soil layer based on the arno base flow formulation in addition the penman monteith allen et al 1998 is used to simulate the potential evapotranspiration since the detailed continuous historical observational reservoir inflow data are unavailable for our study it is more appropriate to employ the model which has been used in the same region previously since the vic model is widely used in the basin and the applicability of the model has been demonstrated in many studies niu et al 2014 2015 niu and chen 2010 2016 wang et al 2017 this study employs vic to simulated daily reservoir inflows and the monthly or annual inflows are obtained based on the daily inflow values surface elevation data used in vic are from the 90 90 m shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model downloaded from the international scientific and technical data mirror site land cover data with spatial resolution of 1 1 km are from the resources and environmental sciences data center chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn since the vic model only yields runoff data at each grid cell a large scale horizontal routing model lohmann et al 1996 was applied to generate streamflow based on vic outputs six parameters of vic that control the runoff generation and routing are calibrated to obtain optimized values including a shape of the vic curve the maximum velocity of base flow dm fraction of dm where non linear base flow begins the fraction of maximum soil moisture where non linear base flow occurs the thickness of the second soil moisture layer and the thickness of the third soil moisture layer by adjusting the parameters the simulated streamflow values fit the observed values well and the optimized parameters are determined the model is run at the daily scale with 0 1 spatial resolution across the whole prb using the observational streamflow data from the gaoyao shijiao and boluo hydrological stations covering 1960 2000 collected from the guangdong hydrology bureau the model is calibrated for the period 1960 1980 and validated for 1981 2000 there is a reasonable fit between the estimated streamflow and the observations the monthly nash sutcliffe efficiency is generally greater than 0 85 and the determination coefficient is higher than 0 85 for both the calibration and validation in particular nash sutcliffe efficiency for the gaoyao and shijiao stations is greater than 0 95 the relative bias for the three stations is lower than 3 table 2 and more detailed calibration and validation results can be found in li et al 2020a in light of this the simulated reservoir inflow for the historical period can be applied for further analysis the dynamic programming is utilized to optimize hydropower output during the historical and future periods bellman 1961 as one of the most robust methods dynamic programming has been commonly used for the optimization of reservoir operation cheng et al 2012 ji et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 feng et al 2017 2018 in the dynamic programming model the storage volume of reservoir in each stage is divided into a finite number of points by exhaustive enumerating all possible combinations of these discrete points the global optimum is determined zhang et al 2015 the objective function of the model is described as 1 max e max t 1 t n i t δ t where e is the total hydropower plant power generation kw h ni t is the total output of the ith hydropower plant of the period t mw t and δ t are the total operation period and the duration of an operation stage respectively the water level constraint in this model is expressed as 2 z i min z i t z i max where zi min zi max are the dead water level and the highest water level of the reservoir respectively zi t is the water level of the ith reservoir of the period t the reservoir storage constraint is given as 3 q i min q i t q i max where qi min qi max are the minimum and the maximum discharges of the reservoir respectively qi t is the discharge of the ith reservoir of the period t while the output constraint is as follows 4 n i min n i t n i max where ni min ni min are the basic output and the installed capacity of the hydropower plant respectively ni t is the output of the ith hydropower plant of the period t lastly the reservoir water balance constraint is formulated as 5 v i t 1 v i t q i t q i t δ t where vi t vi t 1 are the storage of the ith reservoir at the beginning and the end of period t respectively qi t qi t are the inflow and discharge of the ith reservoir during the average period t respectively 2 4 assessment of future changes in hydropower establishing the likely effect of climate change on sustainability and efficiency of hydropower is a priority for their successful future management raje and mujumdar 2010 thushara de silva and hornberger 2019 to reflect sustainability of hydropower three indices i e the reliability resilience and vulnerability are employed the reliability refers to the probability of normal running of the hydropower system and resiliency is a measure of recovering from a failure the vulnerability represents the severity of failure quantitatively the reliability is measured by the assurance rate ar the resiliency re and output gap og are to represent the resiliency and vulnerability respectively greater ar re and og values indicate higher reliability and resiliency and vulnerability respectively and vice versa they appear as 6 ar n n n base n 100 7 re i 1 n 1 n i n base n i 1 n base n n n base 100 8 og max 0 n base n n base where n n n base is the number of days when monthly hydropower output satisfies the base output n base and n n n base points to the opposite situation n is the total number of days for all months and n refers to the monthly actual hydropower output mw n i is the hydropower output on the month i and is the indicator function that returns 1 when satisfying the condition and 0 if not the hydropower output was simulated at the monthly scale in the study to assess changes in the efficiency of hydropower plants two metrics are used i e the abandoned water aw which determines the amount of surplus water that could not be used effectively and the water use efficiency wue that determines the proportion of the water amount used for hydropower generation to the total amount these two indices can be described as follows 9 aw q out q p 10 wue q p q out where q p is the discharge for generate hydropower m3 s and q out is the total reservoir outflow m3 s the changes in reservoir inflow and hydropower output for dry wet and normal years under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios are explored in the current study in which the dry wet and normal years are identified based on china national standard for hydrological information and hydrological forecasting gb t 22482 2008 according to this standard the percentage of annual runoff anomaly is used to identify the dry wet and normal years defined as 11 arap a r i ar ar 100 where arap is the percentage of annual runoff anomaly a r i is the annual runoff in the ith year ar is the inter annual average runoff when arap in a specific year is less than 10 the year is considered as a dry year while arap is greater than 10 the year is identified as a wet year if arap ranges between 10 and 10 the year belongs to a normal year 3 results 3 1 evaluation of coupling vic and gcms the simulated reservoir inflow and hydropower output for the five selected hydropower plants in the pearl river basin during the historical period of 1960 2005 are illustrated in figs 2 and 3 clearly a favorable coincidence between two results from vic with meteorological observations and vic with gcms data is found fig 2 in addition the indices ar og re and wue based on coupled vic and gcm simulations are in agreement with the result from vic driven by meteorological observations fig 3 further the performance of gcms for wet dry and normal years is demonstrated by the scatterplot fig s1 a satisfactory correlation is also found between observations and simulations from gcms especially for mpi esm lr indicating that the gcms can also perform well for wet dry and normal years when looking into the daily scale simulations it is found that the biases between the results from vic driven by gcms and from vic driven by meteorological observations are relatively small table s1 these demonstrate that the coupling of vic and gcms is an effective way for obtaining both the inflow and hydropower output of the hydropower plants which can be used in the subsequent work regarding projection of future changes in hydropower under different rcp scenarios 3 2 historical and future changes in inflow and hydropower output fig 4 and table s2 show the monthly changes in reservoir inflow in the pearl river basin in the future period relative to those in the historical period under the dry wet and normal scenarios tsq lt and yt generally have more reservoir inflows during flood season may september in wet years under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios with 20 of increment however reservoir inflow tends to slightly decease during january april with a maximum reduction of approximately 20 in april in contrast a general decrease is found for future dry years for tsq lt and yt relative to the historical dry years in addition the inflows of these reservoirs present large fluctuations in normal period showing ambiguous trends for flx the inflow presents a remarkable increase from may to october in wet years with the increment of more than 50 in september on the contrary the inflow during the same period generally exhibits a decrease in dry years for the remaining months the changing patterns during dry and wet years do not show obvious difference the inflow at xfj exhibits different changes in dry and wet years specifically inflow generally increases from february to april in dry years while decreases during the same period in wet years but the pattern appears oppositely during june to november regardless of hydropower plants the future reservoir inflows all show large fluctuations for annual total inflow changes it is found that the annual inflow during future wet years is mostly larger than that in historical wet years while the future dry years are expected to have decreased annual inflow relative to historical dry years fig s2 in the supplementary materials the monthly changes in hydropower output in the future period relative to those in the historical period are illustrated in fig 5 and table s3 at first glance there is a close linkage between the reservoir inflow and hydropower output however fig 4 the variation in hydropower output differs from the inflow variation the changes in hydropower output at tsq and lt present similar pattern under three scenarios the hydropower output from january to april in future wet years is most larger than that for the same period in historical wet years while it does not show remarkable change for other months but in future dry years less hydropower output would be obtained than in historical dry years in particular the maximum relative increase at lt is higher than 50 for wet years whereas the maximum reduction has reached approximately 30 for dry years a negative change during january to april is found at yt during future years and a reduction is also found during june to december in dry years for flx the changes in hydropower output are generally similar in both dry and wet years negative change is detected in most cases with a largest decline of approximately 50 in some months surprisingly hydropower output even shows an increase from january to june in the future dry years at xfj and a large increase is seen during october to december in wet years for annual hydropower output in future wet years more hydropower output is expected but in dry years it tends to reduce fig s3 in the supplementary materials 3 3 sustainability and efficiency evaluation the inter annual changes in ar under three scenarios in the future period relative to those in the historical period are shown in fig 6 and table s4 for tsq future dry years mostly experience smaller ar than historical dry years but ar during wet and normal years does not show distinct change ar generally displays a decrease in dry years at lt with a high reduction of more than 40 but it only shows decrease during the non flood season in wet years a negative change in ar at yt is found with large decrease in dry years a large reduction of assurance rate is found at flx during dry period except from january to april ar shows decrease during dry years at xfj but does not show obvious change during wet years fig 7 and table s5 show the monthly changes in og in the future period relative to those in the historical period under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios over the basin a similar variation pattern is detected for tsq and lt dry years mostly present an increase in og but wet years do not show apparent change indicating that climate change may cause a negative impact on hydropower vulnerability in dry years at yt a slight increase in og is only found during the non flood season in addition most of months exhibit large increases during dry years at flx with increment of 25 in november and december with regard to og at xfj it mainly shows increase during dry years overall climate change could exacerbate the vulnerability of hydropower generation in future dry years and potentially causes significant negative impact on reliability of the hydropower system fig 7 and table s5 fig 8 illustrates the changes in annual mean re over the basin in the future period relative to those in the historical period re at tsq lt and yt are similar on the whole mostly presenting a negative change under three scenarios in addition large reduction is projected during wet years for tsq and is found during normal and dry years for yt on the contrary an overall increase in re is detected for xfj with high increment in normal years flx presents a decrease in wet and normal years but an increase during dry years figs 9 and 10 and table s6 7 show the inter annual change patterns of aw and wue in the future period relative to those in the historical period over the pearl river basin for tsq lt and yt future wet years display increase in aw and corresponding decrease in wue during the flood season dry and normal years however do not show obvious change as for flx aw shows a relatively high increase during may to september while an overall decrease in wue is detected an increase in aw is found at xfj during august october in wet years and wue in dry years even shows an increase during january april but presents a reduction in the remaining months 4 discussion while future change in hydropower from the large scale perspective provides a general insight into the climate change effects it may omit the complex hydrological interactions at the local basin scale bosson et al 2013 johansson et al 2015 climate change with resultant increasing temperature and changing rainfall regimes is expected to continue which could significantly alter regionally hydrological responses kusangaya et al 2014 the coupling of gcms with hydrology and hydropower models provides a useful and common approach to reveal the responses of streamflow and hydropower changes to climate change for a specific basin tarroja et al 2016 2018 to discover the possible changes in the hydropower over prb several gcms are selected and their performances before application are evaluated similar to other relevant studies lobanova et al 2016 mendes et al 2017 turner et al 2017 as expected reservoir inflow anomalies lead to similar changes in hydropower output given that hydropower is highly dependent on streamflow availability lobanova et al 2016 li et al 2018 our results also indicate that climate change generally causes larger variability of hydropower output and reservoir inflow compared to the historical period such connection between climate change and hydropower output can be explained by changes in precipitation byrne and o gorman 2015 donat et al 2016 as illustrated in table 3 there is a strong correlation between future annual total precipitation and runoff but no obvious connection between runoff and evapotranspiration is found indicating that future reservoir inflow is largely controlled by precipitation variability and independent of evapotranspiration in fact increase in streamflow anomalies is found in prb along with the occurrence of precipitation induced floods and droughts previously chen et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 wu et al 2017 2018a b deng et al 2018 liu et al 2018 climate change can affect the hydropower by altering the mean annual streamflow shifting seasonal flows and increasing streamflow variability ipcc 2014 the impact of climate change on a specific region depends on the local change in these hydrological characteristics golombek et al 2012 based on an ensemble of 11 gcms beyene et al 2010 found that hydropower generation at the aswan high dam would decrease along with the decreased mean annual river discharge after 2050s similar result is found over the amazon and iberian area where decrease in the streamflow would cause obviously lower hydropower output in the future lobanova et al 2016 mendes et al 2017 on the other hand scientists argued that future higher streamflow variability would have negative impact on the hydropower generation even if the streamflow is overall increased such as in california tarroja et al 2018 by comparison in sweden the annual hydrograph will become more similar to the variation in electricity demand due to increase in the total runoff resulting in more hydropower generation renofalt et al 2010 unlike these results the findings of this study provide more detailed information about how hydropower generation would change along with climate change for wet dry and normal years more specifically in future wet years for most cases more reservoir inflow and hydropower are expected but less during future dry years in comparison to the historical wet and dry years over the basin in other words dry years may get drier while wet years could be wetter figs 4 and s2 in accord with the current viewpoint that the atmospheric water holding capacity increases due to global warming that enhances the hydrological cycle at both regional and global scales causing wet regions becoming wetter and dry regions drier chou et al 2013 greve et al 2014 chadwick et al 2016 donat et al 2016 however it should also be noted that an increase in annual total inflow does not necessarily lead to more annual hydropower output as can be seen in the example of flx compared with historical wet years the future total inflow at flx increase due to increased inflow during the flood season but the inflow shows a reduction for the non flood season which somewhat offset the potential increase in hydropower output during the flood season moreover when suffering from major floods reservoirs need to release excessive water without producing hydropower to avoid dam failure and are therefore unable to make full use of increased inflow in the flood season while in the following non flood season reservoir levels fall below their historical mean level and reduces hydropower output tarroja et al 2016 in this regard even though the future simulations indicate more total reservoir inflow it does not always lead to significant increase in hydropower output for wet years it is also noteworthy that future hydropower generation exhibits higher vulnerability for dry years and mostly shows lower reliability and resiliency hydropower output and the installed capacity over prb have been developed rapidly during the recent decades which provides a support for local economic development and becomes a key component in achieving emission reduction to mitigate and cope with climate change the local government promotes the use of renewable energy particularly the hydropower unfortunately future climate change may limit the function of hydropower supply and even lead to increase in greenhouse gas emissions liu et al 2015 2016 due to decrease in reliability of hydropower generation the power system have to lay more dependence on thermal power generation to meet the local electric requirement to compensate for the hydropower generation gap as a consequence climate change could inevitably increase the risk against the successful operation of hydropower and long term energy planning wang et al 2014 li et al 2018 with the ongoing socio economic development the demand for electricity over prb continues to increase for the foreseeable future zhao et al 2014 liu et al 2018 for this circumstance one should not only adopt measures for climate change but also pay more attention to the loss of hydropower arising from climate change wang et al 2014 it is essential to improve the structure of power generation and strengthen the management between hydropower and other power sources while this study reveal climate change impact on future hydropower generation at meso time scale future works should focus upon the impact of weather variability on hydropower for example storm induced flood events usually last a few days or weeks which might have limited impact on the long term monthly or longer hydropower generation yet they can result in reservoir lost capacity due to flood regulation and affect sub monthly or sometimes even monthly hydropower generation apart from this future work should also conduct the sensitivity analysis of climate change impact on hydropower to quantitatively determine the contributions of different climate factors such as precipitation and temperature to future hydropower changes which would help policy makers and stakeholders better understand the role of each climate factor in local hydropower system 5 conclusions this study systematically evaluates the future changes in reservoir inflow hydropower output and its sustainability and efficiency under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios by taking the pearl river basin as the case region based on the coupling of gcms with vic the case study supports that reservoir inflow and hydropower output under all three scenarios show larger fluctuations compared with the historical period an overall increase in inflow and hydropower output is expected in future wet years but large decrease is found in dry years and no obvious change exists in normal years correspondingly future hydropower in dry years would have higher vulnerability with lower reliability and resiliency also note that increased inflow does not always produce more hydropower output partly because reservoirs are unable to make full use of inflow and release surplus water during the flood season finally the west river in wet years and north river in wet normal and dry years are more likely to have lower water use efficiency in future while the east river during non flood seasons in dry years tends to have higher water use efficiency more measures should therefore be adopted to cope with loss of hydropower caused by climate change in future and better manage hydropower as well as other power sources credit authorship

5207,drought prediction is an important subject particularly in drought hydrology and has a key role in risk management drought readiness and alleviation hydrological time series data consists of nonlinear features and various time scales with this view in mind this study has combined the strengths of the wavelet transformation autoregressive integrated moving average arima and artificial neural network ann to test a new method of a hybrid model for their ability to accurately predict future droughts a 30 year rainfall data from the year 1986 to 2016 for malaysia s langat river basin was analyzed meteorological drought indices di such as the standardized precipitation index spi and the standard index of annual precipitation siap were used to compute historical drought events at first each of these computed drought time series went through a process of decomposition to be divided as low frequency and high frequency sub series by discrete wavelet transform dwt secondly the high and low frequency sub series were passed through the predictive model of ann and arima techniques respectively lastly the predicted sub series were used to reconstruct and develop a final drought prediction model it was found that the wavelet arima ann which named as w 2a model outperformed the single ann and wavelet ann predictive models the ann model developed by spi achieved an overall correlation co efficient r value of 0 423 but the wavelet based ann model decreased in the r value to 0 415 finally two different models which were established using drought indices spi and siap and discrete wavelet transformation based hybrid ann arima w 2a have achieved improved r values of 0 914 and 0 934 respectively keywords ann arima discrete wavelet drought forecasting siap and spi 1 introduction drought is the most devastating natural hazard and in fact it is a world wide crisis the two terms drought and water scarcity refer to quite different phenomena but often classed together and used interchangeably van loon and van lanen 2013 drought is pondered as the most incomprehensible catastrophe and least grasped by many researchers it progressively takes place with an absence of rainfall for a long period of time drought impact differs for the affected areas drought indices di that indicate a function of hydro meteorological variables such as precipitation and streamflow are commonly used to analyze the impacts there have been different dis used in different nations morid et al 2006 for four principal classes of droughts i e meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic drought varies spatially and temporarily therefore to monitor drought events by indices there is need to evaluate the potential of the chosen di and also the availability of hydro meteorological data nonetheless no single index alone can specifically depict the onset and severity of such an event some dis are superior for certain uses than others while none of the common and major drought indices is characteristically loftier than the rest in all contexts karavitis et al 2011 in this study the standardized precipitation index spi and the standard index of annual precipitation siap are chosen the spi is a well known united nations un recommended and globally accepted drought index it requires a parameter estimation while siap is very simple khalili and bazrafshan 2003 and does not require parameter estimation in a previous study it was concluded that the spi values are relatively vulnerable to the acceptance of the parametric distribution function particularly in the tail of the distribution naresh kumar et al 2009 the results from another study conducted by farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 show that a single distribution function may not fit the universal precipitation data and hence the unique parametric approach of spi may not be applicable worldwide therefore the authors developed standardized drought analysis toolbox sdat which is a non parametric way it is often notably challenging to produce proper forecasts because of the complexity in measuring the precise kind of a time series numerous forecasting models have been established throughout the years among them the autoregressive integrated moving average arima and artificial neural network ann zhang 2003 zhang and qi 2005 are broadly trendy arima is well preferred for remarkable forecasting precision and flexibility in exemplifying many types of time series nevertheless a foremost constraint is an apparent linear form of the related data that makes them unsuitable for multifaceted non linear time series modeling zhang 2003 anns are able to overcome this shortcoming superbly but they have generated varied outcomes for decently linear time series for instance by means of modeled data denton 1995 revealed that neural networks could notably outdo linear regression models if there are abnormal values or multiple collinearities in the related data markham and rakes 1998 have also discovered that the functioning of anns for linear regressions is governed by the size of samples and the noise level thus it is not sensible to use anns inconsiderately to any type of data on the contrary a hybrid technique merges the advantages of two or more separate models applied to the same data rather than applying a single model improved forecasting accuracy ilow 2000 khashei and bijari 2011 zhang 2003 sai et al 2007 olsson and soder 2008 hassan 2009 in most of the cases it is found that if hybrid models are applied as opposed to a single model the prediction accuracy gets better except when the model applies an excessive decomposition level such as in wavelet also if many individual models are combined the precision is lowered after some limit and the model shown not so valuable therefore the development of these types of hybrid models has to be restricted to a reduced number of individual models to preserve cohesiveness efficiency and accuracy wavelet transform has become a widely accepted technique in the last decade for analyzing trends in time series especially variations and periodicities zhou et al 2017 seo et al 2017 quilty et al 2019 it is able to generate a decent local portrayal of the signal in both the time and frequency domains gives sizable figures on the arrangement of the basic process to be modeled each decomposed sub series which has different attributes delivers detailed information about the data structure and its periodicity wang and ding 2003 the past research results have shown that the wavelet based methodology was a promising approach kim and valdes 2003 partal and kisi 2007 rathinasamy et al 2014 however not many researchers have applied wavelet in drought forecasting approximately one hundred and five 105 papers on the subject of wavelet artificial intelligence ai for several hydrological time series issues were investigated by nourani et al 2014 and only six 6 of them were in drought forecasting but in the same study it was observed that the number of published papers regarding wavelet ai applications in hydrology indexed in scopus with respect to the year of publication has increased from three 3 in 2003 to thirty two 32 in 2013 scientists have gradually begun to integrate wavelet technique to pre process the inputs of hydrologic time series and improve the ability of the model because a key disadvantage of anns is their incapability to cope with nonstationary data adamowski et al 2012 belayneh et al 2016 kim and valdes 2003 shabri 2015 soh et al 2018 belayneh and adamowski 2013 however according to nourani et al 2014 the first step in developing wavelet ai models is to pre process input data or original data series by utilizing the wavelet transformation method mishra et al 2007 confirmed that a hybrid model is capable of estimating droughts with greater accuracy by linking a linear stochastic model and a nonlinear ann to estimate droughts using spi as such the main objective of this study is to present a new hybrid technique that merges the advantages of two or more separate models such as the wavelet transformation arima and ann for accurately predicting future droughts using spi and siap separately this combination has not been tested in previous drought studies the predictive hybrid model developed in this study using the time series of siap is a novel way to forecast future drought conditions and contributes to the existing knowledge 2 data collection and methodology thirty years of rainfall data collected from rainfall stations located around langat river basin were obtained from the department of irrigation and drainage malaysia did the precipitation data were arranged from october to september of the following year as an input requirement of drought indicator calculator drinc software tigkas et al 2015 drinc was developed at the laboratory of reclamation works and water resources management of the national technical university of athens greece the three stations selected are as per description in table 1 with the names numbers and coordinates for simplicity which are being marked as station 1 for station no 2916001 station 2 for station no 2917001 and flagged as station 3 for station no 3018107 fig 1 presents the mean values and median values which were estimated from 30 years i e october 1986 to september 2016 of raw data for all stations it is seen that the highest values of 369 4 mm and 317 0 mm respectively for mean and median were in november at station 3 the lowest rainfall was in june with a mean 112 0 mm for station 1 and median of 107 mm followed by june july and february generally the dry months in peninsular malaysia start from january to march and june to september whereas the wet period in the year is from october through the beginning of january as shown in fig 1 for station 3 the wettest months are october and november with an average rainfall of 321 5 mm and 369 4 mm respectively 2 1 standardized precipitation index spi the standardized precipitation index spi was established by mckee et al 1995 this di has been widely used all over the world and it can be used to compute rainfall shortage to determine drought situations tsakiris and vangelis 2004 it uses long periods of historical rainfall records matched to a probability distribution in generally a gamma distribution and then converted into a normal distribution mckee and edwards 1997 gamma distribution fits the rainfall period sequence well and it is used to fit long periods of historical rainfall records equation 1 shows the pdf probability density function defined by gamma distribution 1 f x α β 1 β α τ α x α 1 e x β f o r x α β 0 where β α x and γ α represent the scale shape variables rainfall amount and gamma function respectively equations 2 and 3 approximate the finest values of α and β boundaries guttman 1999 2 α 1 4 a 1 1 4 a 3 β x α where x and n denote the rainfall average

non zero rainfall and equation 6 is used to calculate h x 6 h x q 1 q f x α β where q α represent the likelihood of zero rainfall number of zeros exist in a rainfall time series while β is estimated by m n the spi mean and variance would equal zero and one respectively once the cumulative probability is altered to a standardized normal distribution sonmez et al 2005 which are shown by equations 7 and 8 7 spi k c 0 c 1 k c 2 k 2 1 d 1 k d 2 k 2 d 3 k 3 w h e n k l n 1 h x 2 for 0 h x 0 5 8 spi k c 0 c 1 k c 2 k 2 1 d 1 k d 2 k 2 d 3 k 3 w h e n k l n 1 1 h x 2 for 0 h x 1 spi threshold ranges to ascertain drought conditions are described by mckee et al 1995 and those are normal 0 99 spi 0 99 moderately dry 1 00 spi 1 49 severely dry 1 50 spi 1 99 extremely dry spi 2 00 extremely wet spi 2 00 very wet 1 50 spi 1 99 moderately wet 1 00 spi 1 49 negative spi means lower than average rainfall and positive values specify more than mean rainfall both dry and wet conditions are able to be monitored using spi wee and shitan 2013 2 2 development of model using artificial neural network ann haykin 1999 described an artificial neural network as a group of simple processing units operating as a parallel dispersed processor these processing units called neurons stores experimental knowledge for discarding later in anns learning happens through experiences examples and gained knowledge are stored in the connection weights between neurons which imitates the biological nervous system comparable to the brain demuth and beale 2005 the input layer allows the data to be in the network which are presented to successive layers to gradually processes it delivering a result in the output layer neurons of the input layer are networked to those in the intermediary layer through wji weights and the neurons in the intermediary level are connected to those in the output level or final layer via wki masses the symbols ith jth kth or i j and k represent the neurons in input hidden and output layers respectively according to bishop 1995 the intermingle of net weighted input and biases netj to the jth neuron of the hidden layer can be articulated as equation 9 below 9 net j i 1 p w ji x i b j where xi and bj separately are the input value to the ith neuron of input layer and the bias of jth hidden neuron a transfer or activation function in the hidden layer to work on the network value netj to generate an output from the hidden neuron the output can be extracted as per equation 10 below bishop 1995 10 y j f net j f h i 1 p w ji x i b j where yj is the output from jth hidden neuron the net weighted input to the output neuron can be conveyed by equation 11 bishop 1995 11 net k j 1 q f o y j w ki b k similar to above the output from the kth neuron in the output layer is given by equation 12 bishop 1995 12 y k f net k f o j 1 q w ki f h i 1 p w ji x i b j b k for model calibration ann weights are prepared and tailored iteratively in this study the levenberg marquardt lm back propagation algorithm trained a feed forward multilayer perceptron mlp architecture mlps have often been used in hydrologic forecasting due to their simplicity it is rational to believe that the network generalizes well the unseen data if the performance of the neural network was achieved to be constantly good for both the test and validation sections testing does not disturb the training part it gives unbiased measure of the network operation during and after training fig 2 shows a simple neural network structure as described above 2 3 autoregressive integrated moving average arima model the arima model developed by box and jenkins 1976 has several advantages over other stochastic models such as exponential smoothing its greater forecasting capability and its ability to provide greater information with respect to time related changes mishra and desai 2005 mishra et al 2007 a non seasonal model of the arima group is arranged by three constraints p d q that can have zero or positive integral values which are as autoregressive ar to order p moving average ma to order q and runs on dth difference of the time series zt a general non seasonal arima model could be penned as per equations 13 14 and 15 below box and jenkins 1976 13 z t θ b a t b d 14 b 1 1 b 2 b 2 p b p 15 θ b 1 θ 1 b θ 2 b 2 θ q b q where z t ϕ b and θ b are the observed time series polynomials of order p and polynomials of order q respectively random errors at are expected to be identically and freely circulated with a mean of zero and a constant variance differencing operation d to make the data series stationary and d is the number of regular differencing identification estimation and diagnostic check are the three stages for time series model developement box et al 1994 stationarity is a required condition in building an arima model suitable for forecasting and data transformation is frequently desirable to make the time series stationary zhang and dong 2001 in the identification stage the estimation of model parameters is done in the estimation stage diagnostic checking of model adequacy is performed in the last stage of model building and verifies if the model guesses about the errors are fulfilled the goodness of fit can be assessed of the exploratory model to the observed data by several diagnostic statistics and plots of the residuals a new tentative model should be selected if the model is insufficient which is later followed again by the stages of model parameter estimation and diagnostic checking equations 17 and 18 are examples of the first and second order differences differencing of the data series abolishes its non stationarity and it is normally done for first second or the dth times chatfield 2003 said that the first difference is understood to be sufficient in many cases whereas salas et al 1980 noticed that actually only one or two difference operations are exercised in reality 16 u t x t x t 1 17 w t u t u t 1 x t x t 1 x t 1 x t 2 x t 2 x t 1 x t 2 18 u t i 1 p φ i u t i ε t j 1 q θ j ε t j 19 w t i 1 p φ i w t i ε t j 1 q θ j ε t j the performance of the different series ut or wt can be then represented in arima p d q model by equation above box and jenkins 1976 promoted the arima p d q model for forecasting hydrologic variables including rainfall and streamflow 2 4 discrete wavelet wavelet analysis can be split into two types continuous wavelet transformation cwt and discrete wavelet transformation dwt the continuous wavelet transformation is not randomly used for predictions due to its computationally difficult and time requirement to process kisi 2011 discrete wavelet transformation is often used in forecasting applications because it requires less computation time and is simpler to apply dwt is given by equation 20 20 ψ m n t 1 s o m ψ t n τ o s o m s o m where m and n are integers who control the scale and time ψ t is the mother wavelet and the most frequent choices for the parameters so and τo are 2 1 respectively as stated by mallat s theory the unique discrete time series can be decomposed into a series of linearly neutral approximation and detail signals by using the inverse dwt equation 21 gives the inverse dwt as per mallat 1989 21 x t t m 1 m t 0 2 m m 1 w m n 2 m 2 ψ 2 m t n where w m n 2 m 2 t 0 n 1 ψ 2 m t n x t is the wavelet coefficient for the discrete wavelet at scale s 2m and τ 2m n discrete dyadic wavelet transforms are scale samples of the wavelet transform causing a geometric structure of ratio 2 mallat 1998 to abridge the numerical calculations the scale is being tested along a dyadic sequence the term á trous with holes which basically is a fast filter bank special algorithm can be used to guess a discrete dyadic wavelet transform and the distance between samples growing by a factor 2 from the scale i 1 to the next one ci k is given by 22 c i k l h l c i 1 k 2 i 1 l where c 0 t x t h is the low pass filter and the distance wavelet transform w i k i s w i k c i 1 k c i k the coefficients h k are resultant from the scaling function φ x given by 23 1 2 ψ x 2 ϕ x 1 2 ϕ x 2 where the sampled data c0 k are assumed to be scalar products at pixel k of function f x with a scaling function φ x which corresponds to a low pass filter european southern observatory 1998 related to a wavelet ψ x 2 5 w ann model each sub time series dw has different impressions on the original series and plays a well defined role in the original data to help identify the useful wavelet components correlation analysis was done and coefficient values between each sub time series and the parallel original data was applied to denote the differing impact of each discrete dw component has on the original data series all chosen and effective dw components was then summed to increase the functioning of the ann model and in each restructured series formation the approximation subseries was also finally added to crease a whole new time series the assortment process of dominant subseries is modified from the technique exercised by khan et al 2018 and kisi 2009 this selection process of discrete dw sub time series permitted most of the boisterous data to be sorted out and quasiperiodic and periodic signals are being withdrawn three wavelet decomposition levels were chosen in this study 2 6 wavelet based ann arima w 2a model development the method involves two phases i e decomposition and reconstruction at first the series is disintegrated into high detailed and low approximate pass filters which respectively pick up the higher and lower frequency components of the series the low frequency signals approximation estimated by an arima forecast model and the detail signals noises were being taught with a neural network alone a new signal was reconstructed by the sub series of predicted values of approximations and predicted details that were exposed to an inverse wavelet transformation finally the joined predictions are acquired by adding these two component wise forecasts the major advantage of wavelet transformation is that it enables analysis of different treatments neutrally on distinct time scales fig 3 shows the conceptual framework of the proposed model in this study debauches db3 mother wavelet was applied for decomposition of the time series of drought indices using matlab the drought forecasting precisions of the wavelet based arima ann models were contrasted to that of wavelet ann models 2 7 model performance evaluation the performances of the developed models are appraised depending on their correlation coefficient r rmse root mean square error and r2 coefficient of determination the evaluation of r is done using equation 25 25 r 1 n t 1 n y t o y t o y t f y t f 1 n t 1 n y t o y t o 2 1 n t 1 n y t f y t f 2 where observed and forecasted values at time t are y t o and y t f respectively and number of data points represented by n the correlation coefficient determines how well the forecasted quantities correlate with the observed quantities and displays the degree to which extent the two variables are directly related when r value is very close to unity will indicate a highly accepted result while a value that is close to zero implies an incompetent result the rmse reports about the predictive competences of the model the rmse gauges on how close the estimates equal the observations by below equation 26 26 r m s e 1 n t 1 n y t o y t f 2 the criteria in determining the best models are centered on how small the rmse obtained in both training testing and validation of the data the coefficient of determination r2 is given by equation 27 27 r 2 1 i 1 n r i r l 2 i 1 n r l r 2 where r2 n ri r l r are determination coefficient number of observations observed data predicted values and mean of observed data respectively 3 results discussions 3 1 artificial neural network ann model of meteorological drought the neural network models which are verified for the forecasting of drought is spi based and at station 3 ldg dominion shown by equations 28 and 29 below this study used three layers input hidden and output and the inputs combinations consist of rainfall data series with lagged and with same structure for drought index data series separately and the output as a single di variable 28 spi t f p t 1 p t 2 p t 3 input model no 1 29 spi t f s t 1 s t 2 s t 3 input model no 2 where spi or s is the drought index p is precipitation or input of drought index itself in general the equations rooted as drought index t n f inputt inputt 1 inputt 2 where n represents lag of time and t is time in month morid and smakhtin 2007 stated that models based on main input parameter i e rainfall or streamflow in calculating index di or inputs of a di itself had achieved better in forecasting by neural network structure in that study it was illustrated the deficiency of impact from secondary parameters as inputs soi and nao etc on the functioning of the network models neural network models with different combinations of inputs and resulted in inaccurate forecasts of effective drought index edi there is no organized way to ascertain an appropriate architecture in ann modelling neural networks that are too tiny and uncomplicated can guide to under fitting while networks that are too complex incline to over fit the training pattern dawson et al 2006 in this current study the ann model samples were classified into three training part of 70 validation part of 15 and testing section of 15 252 samples 54 samples 54 samples however this data division format effect significantly on model performance shahin et al 2004 throughout training it adapts the network in accordance with its final computed error validation is worked at the end of training as a bonus check on the operation of the model number of hidden neurons in a single hidden layer as shown in the table 2 to choose the efficient model for analyzing performance the three best operating orders are shown for each input model 3 2 wavelet ann w ann model table 3 shows the correlations among the dwt details subseries of wavelet decomposition such as d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7 d8 from original spi data series and rainfall series with the original spi series i e computed spi if a detail sub series correlation is more than the average value of correlations of all eight sub series then it is taken as significant out of others in the case of spi wavelet components d1 d2 d3 and d8 showed considerably higher associations whereas between original spi rainfall d1 d2 d8 sub series showed higher correlations than average based on the correlation analyses those subseries components were selected as the dominant in the next step the significant wavelet detail sub series components and one of the dominant approximation sub series component i e a8 were added together to establish a new series the vital point for this type of model is the selection of inputs to form w ann model the new series which made form summed wavelet components i e details and approximation rather than original data were engaged as inputs into the w ann model for drought predicting four w ann models based on input model no 1 and no 2 were developed based on grouping of different input data spi and rainfall and evaluated accordingly the performances of the wavelet neural network models are showed in table 4 in terms of rmse and r it was found that for meteorological drought predictions using spi the highest value of correlation coefficient r attained among all ann model was 0 423 see table 3 with wavelet ann model this value decreased to 0 419 see table 4 the application of wavelet in the ann models did not achieve higher correlation coefficients though for both natures of inputs it was also found that the models which had taken input as the preceding drought index values accomplished slightly better than models developed using raw data such as rainfall as the input table 4 also shows the performance in percentage of the w ann models and models for meteorological drought forecasting improved by however spi based input model no 1 had the highest decrease of 13 00 all spi forecasts exhibited low results in terms of r the best spi forecast for a 1 month lead time had a r value of 0 423 a possible explanation for the low correlation between predicted and observed spi values is the low level of autocorrelation within the data set the spi time series was also more sensitive to changes in monthly precipitation as the spi 1 is the shortest monthly spi and is not made up of any other cumulative values its sensitivity is higher than any other long term spi values belayneh et al 2012 3 3 wavelet ann arima w 2a hybrid model development the hydrological time series data was being disintegrated by db3 mother wavelet the detail subseries of wavelet is non linear in nature hence was used in prediction by an ann based model because anns are well capable to predict non linear time series however the approximation series is linear in nature so were used in prediction by an arima model structure the predicted values were utilized to reconstruct the data series in next step of model development the accuracy of drought forecasting of the hybrid w 2a discrete wavelet ann arima model was matched to that of wavelet ann w ann models the network input models tested for the hybrid model development in this section are based on siap and spi gourabi 2010 used siap for the detection of drought years in iran and to evaluate the consequences on rice yield and water surface arvind singh et al 2015 used siap and other drought indices to measure drought spells in the almora district of uttarakhand india khan et al 2018 found that the w ann model developed using siap shown improved performance of 8 29 so we proceeded further to improve that model into w 2a framework and test it the input models tested are spi t f st 1 st 2 st 3 and siap t f sit 1 sit 2 sit 3 for meteorological drought forecasting the daubechies db wavelets are frequently used mother wavelets for the dwt in hydrometeorological wavelet based studies daubechies wavelets deliver efficient support vonesch et al 2007 it has full scaling and translational orthonormality properties and also signifies that the wavelets have non zero basis functions over a finite interval popivanov and miller 2002 de artigas et al 2006 these structures are very important for confining events in the time dependent signals each of the details obtained through optimum lags were used to predict details for drought indices the number of wavelet decompositions is either determined via trial and error or using the formula l log n with n being the number of samples using this formula the optimal number of decompositions would be l 3 in this study as experiment wavelet decomposition levels were kept at 1 through 8 and dominant detail sub series was determined using correlation analysis approximation component from wavelet decomposition of drought indices di series was employed by an arima p d q model and p d and q parameters were estimated various combinations were evaluated based on the error criteria set at eviews software i e akaike information criterion aic the aic is an estimator of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data aic provides a means for model selection by estimating the quality of each model among collection of models for the dataset an arima 2 1 4 model showed the lowest error criteria of the a5 level 5 approximation sub signal for spi series the coefficients of the arima 2 1 4 model were obtained confirmation of how well the model fitted well was done by taking into consideration the model s residuals the shape of its frequency histogram bell shape as shown in fig 4 below also the appropriate adjustment for the values of observed and theoretical as well the acf autocorrelation function pacf partial autocorrelation function of residuals were found mostly falls within the independent boundary likewise appropriate arima models were uncovered for siap in the next step of w 2a model development the prediction accuracy by the arima model was tested using the last 15 of data 54 months of approximate sub series the performance r2 for the arima models of approximate sub series are shown in table 5 addition of the predicted details and approximation was done to obtain the final predicted drought index using w 2a model table 5 also indicates that the input model no 3 performed better than other model in terms of r and rmse but r2 slightly lower while input model no 2 obtained from spi meteorological drought index showed significant and noticeable improvement than ann or w ann model applied into itself 0 914 from 0 419 of r value for further evaluation of the proposed discrete wavelet ann arima w 2a models accuracy graphical presentations were made of predicted time series against observed values for both siap and spi as shown in fig 5 drought forecasting computed from spi showed better match between modelled and observed data based meteorological drought forecasting mostly for peak points which are significant in water resources management the w 2a model was able to overestimate some of the peak events shown in the observed spi time series the dry period around 10 60th months and the wet periods in between 85 and 170th months are examples of this see fig 5 fig 6 shows a scatter plot using w 2a model of siap and it shows that forecasts approximate the general behavior of the observed data more satisfactorily for the drought months with the correlation coefficient of 0 934 fig 6 also shows a scatter plot using w 2a model spi and it shows that w ann arima forecasts have strong positive and linear relation with the observed data having correlation coefficient of 0 914 4 conclusion most of the time data from time series contain both linear and nonlinear variations derived from diverse applications linear arima and non linear ann models are capable of modelling time series of drought events discretely but with low accuracy however when they are combined the strengths of arima and ann models formed a hybrid resulting in better performance as compared to the individual types of models in this study a new discrete wavelet transform dwt based arima ann hybrid forecasting model is developed it is concluded that the wavelet arima ann w 2a model helped improve forecasting precision in case of spi and siap which are considered as meteorological drought indices we have shown that both wavelet ann arima w 2a models established from siap and spi were reliable with r2 values of 0 872 and 0 836 and improved r values of 0 934 and 0 914 respectively than w ann models this study can

5207,drought prediction is an important subject particularly in drought hydrology and has a key role in risk management drought readiness and alleviation hydrological time series data consists of nonlinear features and various time scales with this view in mind this study has combined the strengths of the wavelet transformation autoregressive integrated moving average arima and artificial neural network ann to test a new method of a hybrid model for their ability to accurately predict future droughts a 30 year rainfall data from the year 1986 to 2016 for malaysia s langat river basin was analyzed meteorological drought indices di such as the standardized precipitation index spi and the standard index of annual precipitation siap were used to compute historical drought events at first each of these computed drought time series went through a process of decomposition to be divided as low frequency and high frequency sub series by discrete wavelet transform dwt secondly the high and low frequency sub series were passed through the predictive model of ann and arima techniques respectively lastly the predicted sub series were used to reconstruct and develop a final drought prediction model it was found that the wavelet arima ann which named as w 2a model outperformed the single ann and wavelet ann predictive models the ann model developed by spi achieved an overall correlation co efficient r value of 0 423 but the wavelet based ann model decreased in the r value to 0 415 finally two different models which were established using drought indices spi and siap and discrete wavelet transformation based hybrid ann arima w 2a have achieved improved r values of 0 914 and 0 934 respectively keywords ann arima discrete wavelet drought forecasting siap and spi 1 introduction drought is the most devastating natural hazard and in fact it is a world wide crisis the two terms drought and water scarcity refer to quite different phenomena but often classed together and used interchangeably van loon and van lanen 2013 drought is pondered as the most incomprehensible catastrophe and least grasped by many researchers it progressively takes place with an absence of rainfall for a long period of time drought impact differs for the affected areas drought indices di that indicate a function of hydro meteorological variables such as precipitation and streamflow are commonly used to analyze the impacts there have been different dis used in different nations morid et al 2006 for four principal classes of droughts i e meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic drought varies spatially and temporarily therefore to monitor drought events by indices there is need to evaluate the potential of the chosen di and also the availability of hydro meteorological data nonetheless no single index alone can specifically depict the onset and severity of such an event some dis are superior for certain uses than others while none of the common and major drought indices is characteristically loftier than the rest in all contexts karavitis et al 2011 in this study the standardized precipitation index spi and the standard index of annual precipitation siap are chosen the spi is a well known united nations un recommended and globally accepted drought index it requires a parameter estimation while siap is very simple khalili and bazrafshan 2003 and does not require parameter estimation in a previous study it was concluded that the spi values are relatively vulnerable to the acceptance of the parametric distribution function particularly in the tail of the distribution naresh kumar et al 2009 the results from another study conducted by farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 show that a single distribution function may not fit the universal precipitation data and hence the unique parametric approach of spi may not be applicable worldwide therefore the authors developed standardized drought analysis toolbox sdat which is a non parametric way it is often notably challenging to produce proper forecasts because of the complexity in measuring the precise kind of a time series numerous forecasting models have been established throughout the years among them the autoregressive integrated moving average arima and artificial neural network ann zhang 2003 zhang and qi 2005 are broadly trendy arima is well preferred for remarkable forecasting precision and flexibility in exemplifying many types of time series nevertheless a foremost constraint is an apparent linear form of the related data that makes them unsuitable for multifaceted non linear time series modeling zhang 2003 anns are able to overcome this shortcoming superbly but they have generated varied outcomes for decently linear time series for instance by means of modeled data denton 1995 revealed that neural networks could notably outdo linear regression models if there are abnormal values or multiple collinearities in the related data markham and rakes 1998 have also discovered that the functioning of anns for linear regressions is governed by the size of samples and the noise level thus it is not sensible to use anns inconsiderately to any type of data on the contrary a hybrid technique merges the advantages of two or more separate models applied to the same data rather than applying a single model improved forecasting accuracy ilow 2000 khashei and bijari 2011 zhang 2003 sai et al 2007 olsson and soder 2008 hassan 2009 in most of the cases it is found that if hybrid models are applied as opposed to a single model the prediction accuracy gets better except when the model applies an excessive decomposition level such as in wavelet also if many individual models are combined the precision is lowered after some limit and the model shown not so valuable therefore the development of these types of hybrid models has to be restricted to a reduced number of individual models to preserve cohesiveness efficiency and accuracy wavelet transform has become a widely accepted technique in the last decade for analyzing trends in time series especially variations and periodicities zhou et al 2017 seo et al 2017 quilty et al 2019 it is able to generate a decent local portrayal of the signal in both the time and frequency domains gives sizable figures on the arrangement of the basic process to be modeled each decomposed sub series which has different attributes delivers detailed information about the data structure and its periodicity wang and ding 2003 the past research results have shown that the wavelet based methodology was a promising approach kim and valdes 2003 partal and kisi 2007 rathinasamy et al 2014 however not many researchers have applied wavelet in drought forecasting approximately one hundred and five 105 papers on the subject of wavelet artificial intelligence ai for several hydrological time series issues were investigated by nourani et al 2014 and only six 6 of them were in drought forecasting but in the same study it was observed that the number of published papers regarding wavelet ai applications in hydrology indexed in scopus with respect to the year of publication has increased from three 3 in 2003 to thirty two 32 in 2013 scientists have gradually begun to integrate wavelet technique to pre process the inputs of hydrologic time series and improve the ability of the model because a key disadvantage of anns is their incapability to cope with nonstationary data adamowski et al 2012 belayneh et al 2016 kim and valdes 2003 shabri 2015 soh et al 2018 belayneh and adamowski 2013 however according to nourani et al 2014 the first step in developing wavelet ai models is to pre process input data or original data series by utilizing the wavelet transformation method mishra et al 2007 confirmed that a hybrid model is capable of estimating droughts with greater accuracy by linking a linear stochastic model and a nonlinear ann to estimate droughts using spi as such the main objective of this study is to present a new hybrid technique that merges the advantages of two or more separate models such as the wavelet transformation arima and ann for accurately predicting future droughts using spi and siap separately this combination has not been tested in previous drought studies the predictive hybrid model developed in this study using the time series of siap is a novel way to forecast future drought conditions and contributes to the existing knowledge 2 data collection and methodology thirty years of rainfall data collected from rainfall stations located around langat river basin were obtained from the department of irrigation and drainage malaysia did the precipitation data were arranged from october to september of the following year as an input requirement of drought indicator calculator drinc software tigkas et al 2015 drinc was developed at the laboratory of reclamation works and water resources management of the national technical university of athens greece the three stations selected are as per description in table 1 with the names numbers and coordinates for simplicity which are being marked as station 1 for station no 2916001 station 2 for station no 2917001 and flagged as station 3 for station no 3018107 fig 1 presents the mean values and median values which were estimated from 30 years i e october 1986 to september 2016 of raw data for all stations it is seen that the highest values of 369 4 mm and 317 0 mm respectively for mean and median were in november at station 3 the lowest rainfall was in june with a mean 112 0 mm for station 1 and median of 107 mm followed by june july and february generally the dry months in peninsular malaysia start from january to march and june to september whereas the wet period in the year is from october through the beginning of january as shown in fig 1 for station 3 the wettest months are october and november with an average rainfall of 321 5 mm and 369 4 mm respectively 2 1 standardized precipitation index spi the standardized precipitation index spi was established by mckee et al 1995 this di has been widely used all over the world and it can be used to compute rainfall shortage to determine drought situations tsakiris and vangelis 2004 it uses long periods of historical rainfall records matched to a probability distribution in generally a gamma distribution and then converted into a normal distribution mckee and edwards 1997 gamma distribution fits the rainfall period sequence well and it is used to fit long periods of historical rainfall records equation 1 shows the pdf probability density function defined by gamma distribution 1 f x α β 1 β α τ α x α 1 e x β f o r x α β 0 where β α x and γ α represent the scale shape variables rainfall amount and gamma function respectively equations 2 and 3 approximate the finest values of α and β boundaries guttman 1999 2 α 1 4 a 1 1 4 a 3 β x α where x and n denote the rainfall average

non zero rainfall and equation 6 is used to calculate h x 6 h x q 1 q f x α β where q α represent the likelihood of zero rainfall number of zeros exist in a rainfall time series while β is estimated by m n the spi mean and variance would equal zero and one respectively once the cumulative probability is altered to a standardized normal distribution sonmez et al 2005 which are shown by equations 7 and 8 7 spi k c 0 c 1 k c 2 k 2 1 d 1 k d 2 k 2 d 3 k 3 w h e n k l n 1 h x 2 for 0 h x 0 5 8 spi k c 0 c 1 k c 2 k 2 1 d 1 k d 2 k 2 d 3 k 3 w h e n k l n 1 1 h x 2 for 0 h x 1 spi threshold ranges to ascertain drought conditions are described by mckee et al 1995 and those are normal 0 99 spi 0 99 moderately dry 1 00 spi 1 49 severely dry 1 50 spi 1 99 extremely dry spi 2 00 extremely wet spi 2 00 very wet 1 50 spi 1 99 moderately wet 1 00 spi 1 49 negative spi means lower than average rainfall and positive values specify more than mean rainfall both dry and wet conditions are able to be monitored using spi wee and shitan 2013 2 2 development of model using artificial neural network ann haykin 1999 described an artificial neural network as a group of simple processing units operating as a parallel dispersed processor these processing units called neurons stores experimental knowledge for discarding later in anns learning happens through experiences examples and gained knowledge are stored in the connection weights between neurons which imitates the biological nervous system comparable to the brain demuth and beale 2005 the input layer allows the data to be in the network which are presented to successive layers to gradually processes it delivering a result in the output layer neurons of the input layer are networked to those in the intermediary layer through wji weights and the neurons in the intermediary level are connected to those in the output level or final layer via wki masses the symbols ith jth kth or i j and k represent the neurons in input hidden and output layers respectively according to bishop 1995 the intermingle of net weighted input and biases netj to the jth neuron of the hidden layer can be articulated as equation 9 below 9 net j i 1 p w ji x i b j where xi and bj separately are the input value to the ith neuron of input layer and the bias of jth hidden neuron a transfer or activation function in the hidden layer to work on the network value netj to generate an output from the hidden neuron the output can be extracted as per equation 10 below bishop 1995 10 y j f net j f h i 1 p w ji x i b j where yj is the output from jth hidden neuron the net weighted input to the output neuron can be conveyed by equation 11 bishop 1995 11 net k j 1 q f o y j w ki b k similar to above the output from the kth neuron in the output layer is given by equation 12 bishop 1995 12 y k f net k f o j 1 q w ki f h i 1 p w ji x i b j b k for model calibration ann weights are prepared and tailored iteratively in this study the levenberg marquardt lm back propagation algorithm trained a feed forward multilayer perceptron mlp architecture mlps have often been used in hydrologic forecasting due to their simplicity it is rational to believe that the network generalizes well the unseen data if the performance of the neural network was achieved to be constantly good for both the test and validation sections testing does not disturb the training part it gives unbiased measure of the network operation during and after training fig 2 shows a simple neural network structure as described above 2 3 autoregressive integrated moving average arima model the arima model developed by box and jenkins 1976 has several advantages over other stochastic models such as exponential smoothing its greater forecasting capability and its ability to provide greater information with respect to time related changes mishra and desai 2005 mishra et al 2007 a non seasonal model of the arima group is arranged by three constraints p d q that can have zero or positive integral values which are as autoregressive ar to order p moving average ma to order q and runs on dth difference of the time series zt a general non seasonal arima model could be penned as per equations 13 14 and 15 below box and jenkins 1976 13 z t θ b a t b d 14 b 1 1 b 2 b 2 p b p 15 θ b 1 θ 1 b θ 2 b 2 θ q b q where z t ϕ b and θ b are the observed time series polynomials of order p and polynomials of order q respectively random errors at are expected to be identically and freely circulated with a mean of zero and a constant variance differencing operation d to make the data series stationary and d is the number of regular differencing identification estimation and diagnostic check are the three stages for time series model developement box et al 1994 stationarity is a required condition in building an arima model suitable for forecasting and data transformation is frequently desirable to make the time series stationary zhang and dong 2001 in the identification stage the estimation of model parameters is done in the estimation stage diagnostic checking of model adequacy is performed in the last stage of model building and verifies if the model guesses about the errors are fulfilled the goodness of fit can be assessed of the exploratory model to the observed data by several diagnostic statistics and plots of the residuals a new tentative model should be selected if the model is insufficient which is later followed again by the stages of model parameter estimation and diagnostic checking equations 17 and 18 are examples of the first and second order differences differencing of the data series abolishes its non stationarity and it is normally done for first second or the dth times chatfield 2003 said that the first difference is understood to be sufficient in many cases whereas salas et al 1980 noticed that actually only one or two difference operations are exercised in reality 16 u t x t x t 1 17 w t u t u t 1 x t x t 1 x t 1 x t 2 x t 2 x t 1 x t 2 18 u t i 1 p φ i u t i ε t j 1 q θ j ε t j 19 w t i 1 p φ i w t i ε t j 1 q θ j ε t j the performance of the different series ut or wt can be then represented in arima p d q model by equation above box and jenkins 1976 promoted the arima p d q model for forecasting hydrologic variables including rainfall and streamflow 2 4 discrete wavelet wavelet analysis can be split into two types continuous wavelet transformation cwt and discrete wavelet transformation dwt the continuous wavelet transformation is not randomly used for predictions due to its computationally difficult and time requirement to process kisi 2011 discrete wavelet transformation is often used in forecasting applications because it requires less computation time and is simpler to apply dwt is given by equation 20 20 ψ m n t 1 s o m ψ t n τ o s o m s o m where m and n are integers who control the scale and time ψ t is the mother wavelet and the most frequent choices for the parameters so and τo are 2 1 respectively as stated by mallat s theory the unique discrete time series can be decomposed into a series of linearly neutral approximation and detail signals by using the inverse dwt equation 21 gives the inverse dwt as per mallat 1989 21 x t t m 1 m t 0 2 m m 1 w m n 2 m 2 ψ 2 m t n where w m n 2 m 2 t 0 n 1 ψ 2 m t n x t is the wavelet coefficient for the discrete wavelet at scale s 2m and τ 2m n discrete dyadic wavelet transforms are scale samples of the wavelet transform causing a geometric structure of ratio 2 mallat 1998 to abridge the numerical calculations the scale is being tested along a dyadic sequence the term á trous with holes which basically is a fast filter bank special algorithm can be used to guess a discrete dyadic wavelet transform and the distance between samples growing by a factor 2 from the scale i 1 to the next one ci k is given by 22 c i k l h l c i 1 k 2 i 1 l where c 0 t x t h is the low pass filter and the distance wavelet transform w i k i s w i k c i 1 k c i k the coefficients h k are resultant from the scaling function φ x given by 23 1 2 ψ x 2 ϕ x 1 2 ϕ x 2 where the sampled data c0 k are assumed to be scalar products at pixel k of function f x with a scaling function φ x which corresponds to a low pass filter european southern observatory 1998 related to a wavelet ψ x 2 5 w ann model each sub time series dw has different impressions on the original series and plays a well defined role in the original data to help identify the useful wavelet components correlation analysis was done and coefficient values between each sub time series and the parallel original data was applied to denote the differing impact of each discrete dw component has on the original data series all chosen and effective dw components was then summed to increase the functioning of the ann model and in each restructured series formation the approximation subseries was also finally added to crease a whole new time series the assortment process of dominant subseries is modified from the technique exercised by khan et al 2018 and kisi 2009 this selection process of discrete dw sub time series permitted most of the boisterous data to be sorted out and quasiperiodic and periodic signals are being withdrawn three wavelet decomposition levels were chosen in this study 2 6 wavelet based ann arima w 2a model development the method involves two phases i e decomposition and reconstruction at first the series is disintegrated into high detailed and low approximate pass filters which respectively pick up the higher and lower frequency components of the series the low frequency signals approximation estimated by an arima forecast model and the detail signals noises were being taught with a neural network alone a new signal was reconstructed by the sub series of predicted values of approximations and predicted details that were exposed to an inverse wavelet transformation finally the joined predictions are acquired by adding these two component wise forecasts the major advantage of wavelet transformation is that it enables analysis of different treatments neutrally on distinct time scales fig 3 shows the conceptual framework of the proposed model in this study debauches db3 mother wavelet was applied for decomposition of the time series of drought indices using matlab the drought forecasting precisions of the wavelet based arima ann models were contrasted to that of wavelet ann models 2 7 model performance evaluation the performances of the developed models are appraised depending on their correlation coefficient r rmse root mean square error and r2 coefficient of determination the evaluation of r is done using equation 25 25 r 1 n t 1 n y t o y t o y t f y t f 1 n t 1 n y t o y t o 2 1 n t 1 n y t f y t f 2 where observed and forecasted values at time t are y t o and y t f respectively and number of data points represented by n the correlation coefficient determines how well the forecasted quantities correlate with the observed quantities and displays the degree to which extent the two variables are directly related when r value is very close to unity will indicate a highly accepted result while a value that is close to zero implies an incompetent result the rmse reports about the predictive competences of the model the rmse gauges on how close the estimates equal the observations by below equation 26 26 r m s e 1 n t 1 n y t o y t f 2 the criteria in determining the best models are centered on how small the rmse obtained in both training testing and validation of the data the coefficient of determination r2 is given by equation 27 27 r 2 1 i 1 n r i r l 2 i 1 n r l r 2 where r2 n ri r l r are determination coefficient number of observations observed data predicted values and mean of observed data respectively 3 results discussions 3 1 artificial neural network ann model of meteorological drought the neural network models which are verified for the forecasting of drought is spi based and at station 3 ldg dominion shown by equations 28 and 29 below this study used three layers input hidden and output and the inputs combinations consist of rainfall data series with lagged and with same structure for drought index data series separately and the output as a single di variable 28 spi t f p t 1 p t 2 p t 3 input model no 1 29 spi t f s t 1 s t 2 s t 3 input model no 2 where spi or s is the drought index p is precipitation or input of drought index itself in general the equations rooted as drought index t n f inputt inputt 1 inputt 2 where n represents lag of time and t is time in month morid and smakhtin 2007 stated that models based on main input parameter i e rainfall or streamflow in calculating index di or inputs of a di itself had achieved better in forecasting by neural network structure in that study it was illustrated the deficiency of impact from secondary parameters as inputs soi and nao etc on the functioning of the network models neural network models with different combinations of inputs and resulted in inaccurate forecasts of effective drought index edi there is no organized way to ascertain an appropriate architecture in ann modelling neural networks that are too tiny and uncomplicated can guide to under fitting while networks that are too complex incline to over fit the training pattern dawson et al 2006 in this current study the ann model samples were classified into three training part of 70 validation part of 15 and testing section of 15 252 samples 54 samples 54 samples however this data division format effect significantly on model performance shahin et al 2004 throughout training it adapts the network in accordance with its final computed error validation is worked at the end of training as a bonus check on the operation of the model number of hidden neurons in a single hidden layer as shown in the table 2 to choose the efficient model for analyzing performance the three best operating orders are shown for each input model 3 2 wavelet ann w ann model table 3 shows the correlations among the dwt details subseries of wavelet decomposition such as d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7 d8 from original spi data series and rainfall series with the original spi series i e computed spi if a detail sub series correlation is more than the average value of correlations of all eight sub series then it is taken as significant out of others in the case of spi wavelet components d1 d2 d3 and d8 showed considerably higher associations whereas between original spi rainfall d1 d2 d8 sub series showed higher correlations than average based on the correlation analyses those subseries components were selected as the dominant in the next step the significant wavelet detail sub series components and one of the dominant approximation sub series component i e a8 were added together to establish a new series the vital point for this type of model is the selection of inputs to form w ann model the new series which made form summed wavelet components i e details and approximation rather than original data were engaged as inputs into the w ann model for drought predicting four w ann models based on input model no 1 and no 2 were developed based on grouping of different input data spi and rainfall and evaluated accordingly the performances of the wavelet neural network models are showed in table 4 in terms of rmse and r it was found that for meteorological drought predictions using spi the highest value of correlation coefficient r attained among all ann model was 0 423 see table 3 with wavelet ann model this value decreased to 0 419 see table 4 the application of wavelet in the ann models did not achieve higher correlation coefficients though for both natures of inputs it was also found that the models which had taken input as the preceding drought index values accomplished slightly better than models developed using raw data such as rainfall as the input table 4 also shows the performance in percentage of the w ann models and models for meteorological drought forecasting improved by however spi based input model no 1 had the highest decrease of 13 00 all spi forecasts exhibited low results in terms of r the best spi forecast for a 1 month lead time had a r value of 0 423 a possible explanation for the low correlation between predicted and observed spi values is the low level of autocorrelation within the data set the spi time series was also more sensitive to changes in monthly precipitation as the spi 1 is the shortest monthly spi and is not made up of any other cumulative values its sensitivity is higher than any other long term spi values belayneh et al 2012 3 3 wavelet ann arima w 2a hybrid model development the hydrological time series data was being disintegrated by db3 mother wavelet the detail subseries of wavelet is non linear in nature hence was used in prediction by an ann based model because anns are well capable to predict non linear time series however the approximation series is linear in nature so were used in prediction by an arima model structure the predicted values were utilized to reconstruct the data series in next step of model development the accuracy of drought forecasting of the hybrid w 2a discrete wavelet ann arima model was matched to that of wavelet ann w ann models the network input models tested for the hybrid model development in this section are based on siap and spi gourabi 2010 used siap for the detection of drought years in iran and to evaluate the consequences on rice yield and water surface arvind singh et al 2015 used siap and other drought indices to measure drought spells in the almora district of uttarakhand india khan et al 2018 found that the w ann model developed using siap shown improved performance of 8 29 so we proceeded further to improve that model into w 2a framework and test it the input models tested are spi t f st 1 st 2 st 3 and siap t f sit 1 sit 2 sit 3 for meteorological drought forecasting the daubechies db wavelets are frequently used mother wavelets for the dwt in hydrometeorological wavelet based studies daubechies wavelets deliver efficient support vonesch et al 2007 it has full scaling and translational orthonormality properties and also signifies that the wavelets have non zero basis functions over a finite interval popivanov and miller 2002 de artigas et al 2006 these structures are very important for confining events in the time dependent signals each of the details obtained through optimum lags were used to predict details for drought indices the number of wavelet decompositions is either determined via trial and error or using the formula l log n with n being the number of samples using this formula the optimal number of decompositions would be l 3 in this study as experiment wavelet decomposition levels were kept at 1 through 8 and dominant detail sub series was determined using correlation analysis approximation component from wavelet decomposition of drought indices di series was employed by an arima p d q model and p d and q parameters were estimated various combinations were evaluated based on the error criteria set at eviews software i e akaike information criterion aic the aic is an estimator of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data aic provides a means for model selection by estimating the quality of each model among collection of models for the dataset an arima 2 1 4 model showed the lowest error criteria of the a5 level 5 approximation sub signal for spi series the coefficients of the arima 2 1 4 model were obtained confirmation of how well the model fitted well was done by taking into consideration the model s residuals the shape of its frequency histogram bell shape as shown in fig 4 below also the appropriate adjustment for the values of observed and theoretical as well the acf autocorrelation function pacf partial autocorrelation function of residuals were found mostly falls within the independent boundary likewise appropriate arima models were uncovered for siap in the next step of w 2a model development the prediction accuracy by the arima model was tested using the last 15 of data 54 months of approximate sub series the performance r2 for the arima models of approximate sub series are shown in table 5 addition of the predicted details and approximation was done to obtain the final predicted drought index using w 2a model table 5 also indicates that the input model no 3 performed better than other model in terms of r and rmse but r2 slightly lower while input model no 2 obtained from spi meteorological drought index showed significant and noticeable improvement than ann or w ann model applied into itself 0 914 from 0 419 of r value for further evaluation of the proposed discrete wavelet ann arima w 2a models accuracy graphical presentations were made of predicted time series against observed values for both siap and spi as shown in fig 5 drought forecasting computed from spi showed better match between modelled and observed data based meteorological drought forecasting mostly for peak points which are significant in water resources management the w 2a model was able to overestimate some of the peak events shown in the observed spi time series the dry period around 10 60th months and the wet periods in between 85 and 170th months are examples of this see fig 5 fig 6 shows a scatter plot using w 2a model of siap and it shows that forecasts approximate the general behavior of the observed data more satisfactorily for the drought months with the correlation coefficient of 0 934 fig 6 also shows a scatter plot using w 2a model spi and it shows that w ann arima forecasts have strong positive and linear relation with the observed data having correlation coefficient of 0 914 4 conclusion most of the time data from time series contain both linear and nonlinear variations derived from diverse applications linear arima and non linear ann models are capable of modelling time series of drought events discretely but with low accuracy however when they are combined the strengths of arima and ann models formed a hybrid resulting in better performance as compared to the individual types of models in this study a new discrete wavelet transform dwt based arima ann hybrid forecasting model is developed it is concluded that the wavelet arima ann w 2a model helped improve forecasting precision in case of spi and siap which are considered as meteorological drought indices we have shown that both wavelet ann arima w 2a models established from siap and spi were reliable with r2 values of 0 872 and 0 836 and improved r values of 0 934 and 0 914 respectively than w ann models this study can

difference between net primary production and heterotrophic soil respiration the rate of change of stored carbon or net flux of carbon between the land and atmosphere represents the total amount of organic carbon in an ecosystem available for storage woodwell and whittaker 1968 lovett et al 2006 it is an important index for the estimation of regional carbon balance the formula is as follows 8 n

precipitation mm we used the temperature and precipitation data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 from the climatic research unit to calculate the soil microbial respiration rh then we unified the spatiotemporal resolution of rh and npp to 1 km to calculate nep based on re sampling nearest neighbor interpolation meanwhile we unified the spatiotemporal resolution of land use cover change data based on re sampling and re classification techniques and combined the data from the different source datasets to form comprehensive records 2 5 palmer drought severity index pdsi algorithm potential evapotranspiration pet is one of the inputs in the palmer drought severity index pdsi pet estimates based on the penman monteith approach are considered to be more physically realistic but require

negative nep values nep 0 indicate carbon sources white et al 1999 luyssaert et al 2008 forest land is the largest carbon pool in the terrestrial ecosystem generally considered a high carbon sink area sorensen 1993 thompson et al 1996 luyssaert et al 2008 when nep 300 gc m 2 a 1 almost all the land types in this area are forest land the vegetation carbon sequestration capacity in this area is considered to be large and the area is categorized as a high carbon sink when 0 nep 300 gc m 2 a 1 the area is categorized as a low carbon sink 3 1 spatial distribution and variations of nep 3 1 1 spatial distribution of average nep the spatial distribution map of average carbon sources and sinks in central asia from 2000 to 2015 is based on nep classifications as shown in fig 3 a from fig 3a we can see that carbon source areas form the majority and are mainly located in south central kazakhstan and parts of uzbekistan and turkmenistan low carbon sink areas are mainly distributed in northern kazakhstan kyrghyzstan and tajikistan whereas high carbon sink areas are relatively rare and are concentrated in a small number of high altitude areas of kyrgyzstan and northernmost sections of kazakhstan on the whole the distribution of carbon sources and sinks shows obvious zonal characteristics spatially nep in most area of central asia showed a downward trend in 2000 2015 fig 3b especially in the northwest area of kazakhstan whereas in the alpine areas of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan nep have increasing trends this indicates that ecological carbon sink capacity is weakening in kazakhstan while carbon sink capacity in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan is increasing 3 1 2 spatial distribution of carbon sources sinks at different elevations a digital elevation model dem of the study area is classified according to the division standards of physical geography and then superimposed on the spatial distribution map of carbon sources and sinks in central asia the number of carbon source and sink grids in each altitude range is then obtained fig 3c due to the flatness of the terrain across most of central asia areas of carbon sources and sinks occur mainly below 1500 m as the altitude increases however the areas designated as carbon source or sink gradually decrease between the altitudes of 1500 3000 m the carbon sink area is larger than the carbon source area this trend is closely related to the geomorphological features of the study area altitudes below 1500 m evolved from a plain to a hilly area to a mountainous area at 1500 to 3000 m as the altitude increases human activities decrease along with temperature and evapotranspiration precipitation on the other hand increases as does vegetation growth and coverage there is a corresponding decrease in carbon source area as well as an increase in carbon sink area at ultra high altitudes there is a progressive drop in temperature resulting in a growth inhibition of vegetation and a subsequent reduction in carbon sink area 3 1 3 spatial distribution of carbon sources sinks at different slops according to the classification standard of the international geographical union we first divided the slope into seven grades and then superimposed it on the spatial distribution map of carbon sources and sinks in the study area fig 3d illustrates the obtained number of carbon source sink grids for each slope grade range as can be seen carbon sources are mainly distributed in plains areas 0 0 5 and micro slopes 0 5 2 while carbon sinks are mainly distributed in plains areas 0 0 5 micro slopes 0 5 2 and slopes 5 15 in locations characterized as steep slopes 15 35 and cliff slopes 35 45 the carbon sink area gradually decreases due to soil erosion and the steepness of the terrain as these features are not positively associated with vegetation growth 3 1 4 spatial distribution and variations of carbon sources sinks in different vegetation types northern kazakhstan is mostly semi arid grassland the central portion of central asia is mostly arid desert shrubland and the mountainous areas of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan are covered in forest meadowland fig 4 a and b the main vegetation types in northern kazakhstan are mixed areas of cultivated land and grassland this region has a relatively moderate climate and a high average npp on the other hand the low value area of npp in central kazakhstan is mainly dry gramineae grasslands and meadows and is affected by a dry climate the higher npp value area is also located in the high mountains and intermountain basins of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan due to the climatic conditions of relatively low temperatures but abundant precipitation in these regions the vegetation types there are ecotones of grassland forestland and mountain forests for distribution and variations of carbon sources sinks in different vegetation types the total capacity of carbon sources in central asia is greater than that of carbon sinks the main vegetation type which occurs in high carbon sink areas is forest while the main vegetation types which occur in low carbon sink areas are cultivated land grassland and forest sparse vegetation and bare areas are mainly carbon source areas fig 4c and d because there is little vegetation distribution indicating desertification of the landscape based on the land use cover classification data from 2000 to 2015 land use in central asia experienced considerable change the most notable changes were the phenomena of forest reduction and the expansion of land cultivation and urban areas during the study period cultivated land area expanded by 19 while forestland decreased by 20 as a consequence the capacity of ecological carbon sinks in central asia also weakened during the same timeframe with the exception of the capacities of low carbon sinks cultivated land and shrub land increased 9 55 and 12 38 respectively meanwhile the capacities of low carbon sinks like forest land sparse vegetation and bare areas decreased by 41 52 57 84 and 42 88 respectively and the capacities of high carbon sinks like forest land shrub land sparse vegetation and bare areas decreased by 18 81 48 62 78 93 and 100 respectively it is worth noting that there was no significant decrease in grassland area during 2000 2015 even though the capacities of low and high carbon sinks of grassland fell 35 66 and 46 75 respectively this indicates that the quality of the grassland declined 3 2 attributions of nep variations the general assumption is that the spatial distribution of carbon source sink changes in any region match the spatial distribution of npp pacala et al 2001 given the existence of a stimulatory mechanism acting on terrestrial npp net ecosystem uptake is expected to be largest where npp is high and the turnover of carbon through plants and soil is slow from figs 3b and 5 a we can see that npp and nep show similar spatio temporal changes 3 2 1 variations in npp the simulation predicted an anomalous drop in npp at a rate of 1 58 gc m2 yr during 2000 2015 caused by low rainfall and anomalous warming fig 5b in terms of spatial distribution the decreasing trend in npp in northwest central asia is larger than that in the southeast and its decline in grassland areas in northwest kazakhstan is particularly obvious the growing regions are located in the southeastern regions of kazakhstan and turkmenistan as well as most parts of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan fig 5a kyrgyzstan and tajikistan have more mountainous areas the frontiers of which are mainly the ecotone of forest land and grassland affected by geographical location and climatic conditions the primary vegetation types in these two countries are crops and grassland water resources are relatively abundant here as about 75 of the water from the amu darya and syr darya rivers the two largest rivers in central asia flows through kyrgyzstan and tajikistan respectively 3 2 2 controlling factors for npp variations water temperature and radiation interact to impose complex and varying limitations on vegetation activities zhao et al 2019 to understand why npp declined in central asia we analyzed partial correlations between npp and temperature t precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet during growing seasons to determine their respective contributions fig 6 a comprehensive interpretation of interactive climatic controls on plant productivity showed that water temperature and radiation are the key factors affecting vegetation growth in higher altitude areas featuring greater amounts of precipitation temperature has a positive correlation with npp warming generally lengthens growing seasons for vegetation and promotes plant growth so the recent warming in these regions has increased npp conversely in desert regions with an arid climate e g parts of turkmenistan and uzbekistan temperature has a negative correlation with npp in the arid portions of central asia there is a positive correlation between precipitation and npp as a whole central asia is an arid and semi arid region featuring high temperatures little precipitation and strong potential evaporation the negative impact of potential evaporation on npp is obvious there 3 2 3 drought impacts on carbon sinks and sources water is the limiting factor for ecological attributes in arid and semi arid regions zhao et al 2019 a water based ecosystem is fragile in areas that are arid or semi arid making them highly sensitive to climate change lioubimtseva 2004 furthermore over the past decade rising evapotranspiration has exacerbated regional ecological droughts li et al 2017 the palmer drought severity index pdsi is a widely used index that correlates with soil moisture during warm seasons in the central asian study area pdsi decreased at a rate of 0 04 yr2 from 2000 suggesting an increased risk of drought in the 21st century li et al 2017 as can be seen from the spatial distribution of drought trends fig 7 most of the areas where drought has intensified are those where npp is significantly reduced it is worth noting that droughts significantly influence interannual variations in terrestrial carbon sequestration kim et al 1992 reichstein et al 2007 scott et al 2009 evapotranspiration is a crucial variable that amplifies soil moisture loss teuling et al 2013 soil moisture is an important sensor for measuring superficial wetness and dryness levels and generally reflects the dryness and wetness of a climate available soil moisture is defined as the amount of water a plant can access in its root zone which means that spatial and temporal variations in soil moisture are closely related to vegetation growth yang et al 2010 fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of annual soil moisture trends illustrates a total decrease in the soil moisture of four specific layers 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm which is the same area where npp decreased significantly 4 discussions numerous models based on remote sensing have been developed to investigate co2 exchange between the biosphere and atmosphere at regional continental and global scales wylie et al 2007 phillips and beeri 2008 turner et al 2004 some scholars integrated hydro biogeochemical simulations by linking swat examined the impacts of climate change on water carbon coupling cycles zhao et al 2018 2020 however the biogeochemical models are often complex because they require numerous assumptions model parameterization and abundant accurate data inputs following the dissolution of the soviet union during the 1980s and 1990s data for central asia became generally scarce though currently lacking research on recent dynamic climate change impacts on regional ecological environments is highly important for maintaining the sustainable development of the silk road economic belt along with the rest of the planet central asia has experienced dramatic environmental changes since the beginning of the 21st century and the intensity of climate change is even more obvious strong variations in npp and its effects on nep have been found with our results showing that nep in most areas of central asia charted a downward course in 2000 2015 as well the capacities of low and high carbon sinks of forest land sparse vegetation and bare areas all decreased although previous studies suggested that grasslands are generally carbon sinks or near equilibrium we found that it was not unusual for grasslands to switch between carbon sinks and sources especially when influenced by extreme drought zhang et al 2011 people now have the capacity to disrupt or augment ecosystem feedback to climate on a massive scale through for example deforestation and expansion of grazing and cultivated land recent studies showed that human activities e g land use cover change and grazing were also considered important aspects that affect natural vegetation changes eldridge et al 2011 tian et al 2012 cipriotti et al 2012 arid areas with their fragile ecological environment are especially sensitive and vulnerable to human disturbance in addition the drying effects of a warmer climate also suggest that ecological concerns will be increased in the future in arid regions both global warming and the ecosystem carbon cycle have complex mutual feedback and interaction given these difficulties earth system models need to be developed to fully simulate energy water and carbon exchanges among the land ocean and atmosphere 5 conclusions in this paper the spatial distribution patterns of carbon sources sinks of vegetation in central asia was studied in detail the preliminary conclusions are as follows 1 the distribution of carbon sources and sinks shows obvious vertical zonal characteristics most carbon sources areas are mainly distributed in south central kazakhstan as well as parts of uzbekistan and turkmenistan carbon sink areas are mainly distributed in northern kazakhstan kyrghyzstan and tajikistan due to the flatness of the terrain across most of central asia carbon sources and sinks occur mainly below 1500 m carbon sources primarily occur in plains areas 0 0 5 and micro slopes 0 5 2 while carbon sinks are mainly distributed in plains areas 0 0 5 micro slopes 0 5 2 and slopes 5 15 2 spatially nep in most areas of central asia showed a downward trend in 2000 2015 especially in the northwest portion of kazakhstan whereas in the alpine areas of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan nep showed an increasing trend land use across the entire central asian region has experienced considerable changes most notable of which are the phenomena of forest reduction and the expansion of cultivated land and urban areas with the exception of the capacities of low carbon sinks where cultivated land and shrub land have increased 9 55 and 12 38 respectively the capacities of low and high carbon sinks of forest land sparse vegetation and bare areas have all decreased at the same time the capacities of low and high carbon sinks of grassland have weakened 35 66 and 46 75 respectively even though the grassland area has shown no significant decreasing trend this indicates that the quality of the grassland has declined 3 the spatial distribution of the carbon source sink change matches the spatial distribution of npp because water is the limiting factor for ecological attributes in arid and semi arid areas

use of modis in arid and semi arid areas and reflects vegetation growth and distribution jiao et al 2017 2 4 net ecosystem production nep algorithm net ecosystem production nep defined as the difference between net primary production and heterotrophic soil respiration the rate of change of stored carbon or net flux of carbon between the land and atmosphere represents the total amount of organic carbon in an ecosystem available for storage woodwell and whittaker 1968 lovett et al 2006 it is an important index for the estimation of regional carbon balance the formula is as follows 8 n

precipitation mm we used the temperature and precipitation data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 from the climatic research unit to calculate the soil microbial respiration rh then we unified the spatiotemporal resolution of rh and npp to 1 km to calculate nep based on re sampling nearest neighbor interpolation meanwhile we unified the spatiotemporal resolution of land use cover change data based on re sampling and re classification techniques and combined the data from the different source datasets to form comprehensive records 2 5 palmer drought severity index pdsi algorithm potential evapotranspiration pet is one of the inputs in the palmer drought severity index pdsi pet estimates based on the penman monteith approach are considered to be more physically realistic but require

negative nep values nep 0 indicate carbon sources white et al 1999 luyssaert et al 2008 forest land is the largest carbon pool in the terrestrial ecosystem generally considered a high carbon sink area sorensen 1993 thompson et al 1996 luyssaert et al 2008 when nep 300 gc m 2 a 1 almost all the land types in this area are forest land the vegetation carbon sequestration capacity in this area is considered to be large and the area is categorized as a high carbon sink when 0 nep 300 gc m 2 a 1 the area is categorized as a low carbon sink 3 1 spatial distribution and variations of nep 3 1 1 spatial distribution of average nep the spatial distribution map of average carbon sources and sinks in central asia from 2000 to 2015 is based on nep classifications as shown in fig 3 a from fig 3a we can see that carbon source areas form the majority and are mainly located in south central kazakhstan and parts of uzbekistan and turkmenistan low carbon sink areas are mainly distributed in northern kazakhstan kyrghyzstan and tajikistan whereas high carbon sink areas are relatively rare and are concentrated in a small number of high altitude areas of kyrgyzstan and northernmost sections of kazakhstan on the whole the distribution of carbon sources and sinks shows obvious zonal characteristics spatially nep in most area of central asia showed a downward trend in 2000 2015 fig 3b especially in the northwest area of kazakhstan whereas in the alpine areas of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan nep have increasing trends this indicates that ecological carbon sink capacity is weakening in kazakhstan while carbon sink capacity in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan is increasing 3 1 2 spatial distribution of carbon sources sinks at different elevations a digital elevation model dem of the study area is classified according to the division standards of physical geography and then superimposed on the spatial distribution map of carbon sources and sinks in central asia the number of carbon source and sink grids in each altitude range is then obtained fig 3c due to the flatness of the terrain across most of central asia areas of carbon sources and sinks occur mainly below 1500 m as the altitude increases however the areas designated as carbon source or sink gradually decrease between the altitudes of 1500 3000 m the carbon sink area is larger than the carbon source area this trend is closely related to the geomorphological features of the study area altitudes below 1500 m evolved from a plain to a hilly area to a mountainous area at 1500 to 3000 m as the altitude increases human activities decrease along with temperature and evapotranspiration precipitation on the other hand increases as does vegetation growth and coverage there is a corresponding decrease in carbon source area as well as an increase in carbon sink area at ultra high altitudes there is a progressive drop in temperature resulting in a growth inhibition of vegetation and a subsequent reduction in carbon sink area 3 1 3 spatial distribution of carbon sources sinks at different slops according to the classification standard of the international geographical union we first divided the slope into seven grades and then superimposed it on the spatial distribution map of carbon sources and sinks in the study area fig 3d illustrates the obtained number of carbon source sink grids for each slope grade range as can be seen carbon sources are mainly distributed in plains areas 0 0 5 and micro slopes 0 5 2 while carbon sinks are mainly distributed in plains areas 0 0 5 micro slopes 0 5 2 and slopes 5 15 in locations characterized as steep slopes 15 35 and cliff slopes 35 45 the carbon sink area gradually decreases due to soil erosion and the steepness of the terrain as these features are not positively associated with vegetation growth 3 1 4 spatial distribution and variations of carbon sources sinks in different vegetation types northern kazakhstan is mostly semi arid grassland the central portion of central asia is mostly arid desert shrubland and the mountainous areas of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan are covered in forest meadowland fig 4 a and b the main vegetation types in northern kazakhstan are mixed areas of cultivated land and grassland this region has a relatively moderate climate and a high average npp on the other hand the low value area of npp in central kazakhstan is mainly dry gramineae grasslands and meadows and is affected by a dry climate the higher npp value area is also located in the high mountains and intermountain basins of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan due to the climatic conditions of relatively low temperatures but abundant precipitation in these regions the vegetation types there are ecotones of grassland forestland and mountain forests for distribution and variations of carbon sources sinks in different vegetation types the total capacity of carbon sources in central asia is greater than that of carbon sinks the main vegetation type which occurs in high carbon sink areas is forest while the main vegetation types which occur in low carbon sink areas are cultivated land grassland and forest sparse vegetation and bare areas are mainly carbon source areas fig 4c and d because there is little vegetation distribution indicating desertification of the landscape based on the land use cover classification data from 2000 to 2015 land use in central asia experienced considerable change the most notable changes were the phenomena of forest reduction and the expansion of land cultivation and urban areas during the study period cultivated land area expanded by 19 while forestland decreased by 20 as a consequence the capacity of ecological carbon sinks in central asia also weakened during the same timeframe with the exception of the capacities of low carbon sinks cultivated land and shrub land increased 9 55 and 12 38 respectively meanwhile the capacities of low carbon sinks like forest land sparse vegetation and bare areas decreased by 41 52 57 84 and 42 88 respectively and the capacities of high carbon sinks like forest land shrub land sparse vegetation and bare areas decreased by 18 81 48 62 78 93 and 100 respectively it is worth noting that there was no significant decrease in grassland area during 2000 2015 even though the capacities of low and high carbon sinks of grassland fell 35 66 and 46 75 respectively this indicates that the quality of the grassland declined 3 2 attributions of nep variations the general assumption is that the spatial distribution of carbon source sink changes in any region match the spatial distribution of npp pacala et al 2001 given the existence of a stimulatory mechanism acting on terrestrial npp net ecosystem uptake is expected to be largest where npp is high and the turnover of carbon through plants and soil is slow from figs 3b and 5 a we can see that npp and nep show similar spatio temporal changes 3 2 1 variations in npp the simulation predicted an anomalous drop in npp at a rate of 1 58 gc m2 yr during 2000 2015 caused by low rainfall and anomalous warming fig 5b in terms of spatial distribution the decreasing trend in npp in northwest central asia is larger than that in the southeast and its decline in grassland areas in northwest kazakhstan is particularly obvious the growing regions are located in the southeastern regions of kazakhstan and turkmenistan as well as most parts of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan fig 5a kyrgyzstan and tajikistan have more mountainous areas the frontiers of which are mainly the ecotone of forest land and grassland affected by geographical location and climatic conditions the primary vegetation types in these two countries are crops and grassland water resources are relatively abundant here as about 75 of the water from the amu darya and syr darya rivers the two largest rivers in central asia flows through kyrgyzstan and tajikistan respectively 3 2 2 controlling factors for npp variations water temperature and radiation interact to impose complex and varying limitations on vegetation activities zhao et al 2019 to understand why npp declined in central asia we analyzed partial correlations between npp and temperature t precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet during growing seasons to determine their respective contributions fig 6 a comprehensive interpretation of interactive climatic controls on plant productivity showed that water temperature and radiation are the key factors affecting vegetation growth in higher altitude areas featuring greater amounts of precipitation temperature has a positive correlation with npp warming generally lengthens growing seasons for vegetation and promotes plant growth so the recent warming in these regions has increased npp conversely in desert regions with an arid climate e g parts of turkmenistan and uzbekistan temperature has a negative correlation with npp in the arid portions of central asia there is a positive correlation between precipitation and npp as a whole central asia is an arid and semi arid region featuring high temperatures little precipitation and strong potential evaporation the negative impact of potential evaporation on npp is obvious there 3 2 3 drought impacts on carbon sinks and sources water is the limiting factor for ecological attributes in arid and semi arid regions zhao et al 2019 a water based ecosystem is fragile in areas that are arid or semi arid making them highly sensitive to climate change lioubimtseva 2004 furthermore over the past decade rising evapotranspiration has exacerbated regional ecological droughts li et al 2017 the palmer drought severity index pdsi is a widely used index that correlates with soil moisture during warm seasons in the central asian study area pdsi decreased at a rate of 0 04 yr2 from 2000 suggesting an increased risk of drought in the 21st century li et al 2017 as can be seen from the spatial distribution of drought trends fig 7 most of the areas where drought has intensified are those where npp is significantly reduced it is worth noting that droughts significantly influence interannual variations in terrestrial carbon sequestration kim et al 1992 reichstein et al 2007 scott et al 2009 evapotranspiration is a crucial variable that amplifies soil moisture loss teuling et al 2013 soil moisture is an important sensor for measuring superficial wetness and dryness levels and generally reflects the dryness and wetness of a climate available soil moisture is defined as the amount of water a plant can access in its root zone which means that spatial and temporal variations in soil moisture are closely related to vegetation growth yang et al 2010 fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of annual soil moisture trends illustrates a total decrease in the soil moisture of four specific layers 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm which is the same area where npp decreased significantly 4 discussions numerous models based on remote sensing have been developed to investigate co2 exchange between the biosphere and atmosphere at regional continental and global scales wylie et al 2007 phillips and beeri 2008 turner et al 2004 some scholars integrated hydro biogeochemical simulations by linking swat examined the impacts of climate change on water carbon coupling cycles zhao et al 2018 2020 however the biogeochemical models are often complex because they require numerous assumptions model parameterization and abundant accurate data inputs following the dissolution of the soviet union during the 1980s and 1990s data for central asia became generally scarce though currently lacking research on recent dynamic climate change impacts on regional ecological environments is highly important for maintaining the sustainable development of the silk road economic belt along with the rest of the planet central asia has experienced dramatic environmental changes since the beginning of the 21st century and the intensity of climate change is even more obvious strong variations in npp and its effects on nep have been found with our results showing that nep in most areas of central asia charted a downward course in 2000 2015 as well the capacities of low and high carbon sinks of forest land sparse vegetation and bare areas all decreased although previous studies suggested that grasslands are generally carbon sinks or near equilibrium we found that it was not unusual for grasslands to switch between carbon sinks and sources especially when influenced by extreme drought zhang et al 2011 people now have the capacity to disrupt or augment ecosystem feedback to climate on a massive scale through for example deforestation and expansion of grazing and cultivated land recent studies showed that human activities e g land use cover change and grazing were also considered important aspects that affect natural vegetation changes eldridge et al 2011 tian et al 2012 cipriotti et al 2012 arid areas with their fragile ecological environment are especially sensitive and vulnerable to human disturbance in addition the drying effects of a warmer climate also suggest that ecological concerns will be increased in the future in arid regions both global warming and the ecosystem carbon cycle have complex mutual feedback and interaction given these difficulties earth system models need to be developed to fully simulate energy water and carbon exchanges among the land ocean and atmosphere 5 conclusions in this paper the spatial distribution patterns of carbon sources sinks of vegetation in central asia was studied in detail the preliminary conclusions are as follows 1 the distribution of carbon sources and sinks shows obvious vertical zonal characteristics most carbon sources areas are mainly distributed in south central kazakhstan as well as parts of uzbekistan and turkmenistan carbon sink areas are mainly distributed in northern kazakhstan kyrghyzstan and tajikistan due to the flatness of the terrain across most of central asia carbon sources and sinks occur mainly below 1500 m carbon sources primarily occur in plains areas 0 0 5 and micro slopes 0 5 2 while carbon sinks are mainly distributed in plains areas 0 0 5 micro slopes 0 5 2 and slopes 5 15 2 spatially nep in most areas of central asia showed a downward trend in 2000 2015 especially in the northwest portion of kazakhstan whereas in the alpine areas of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan nep showed an increasing trend land use across the entire central asian region has experienced considerable changes most notable of which are the phenomena of forest reduction and the expansion of cultivated land and urban areas with the exception of the capacities of low carbon sinks where cultivated land and shrub land have increased 9 55 and 12 38 respectively the capacities of low and high carbon sinks of forest land sparse vegetation and bare areas have all decreased at the same time the capacities of low and high carbon sinks of grassland have weakened 35 66 and 46 75 respectively even though the grassland area has shown no significant decreasing trend this indicates that the quality of the grassland has declined 3 the spatial distribution of the carbon source sink change matches the spatial distribution of npp because water is the limiting factor for ecological attributes in arid and semi arid areas

5209,irrigated agriculture has been identified as using approximately 72 of water globally australia like many places in the world is subject to water sharing plans that cross government boarders and are subject to a mixture of management policies there is a pressing need to develop a method to monitor irrigation water use to aid in water resource assessments and monitoring this paper aims to test a method previously developed which monitors irrigation water use using remotely sensed observations over the catchment scale without the need for in situ observations ground data or in depth knowledge of crops and their planting dates using conservative assumptions about agricultural land management practice irrigation is calculated as i r r a e t p the method uses three vegetation indices derived from landsat images to calculate crop coefficients k c based on multiple published relationships these are combined through the fao56 methodology using gridded rainfall and two reference evapotranspiration e t o products to find actual evapotranspiration as a e t e t o k c providing six e t o k c combinations results indicate this study method can effectively assess irrigation water use over a range of catchment sizes from 6000 to 600 000 ha although issues arise when regions have a designated low allocation volume for that season less than40 comparisons with the standardised precipitation index spi and evaporative stress index esi show that the proposed method is robust to the rapid onset and short term droughts however its performance was poor during the long term droughts with low water allocation years the study results during these years has been predominately attributed to water stress in certain crops being undetected agricultural managers skipping annual crop commodities as well as stock and domestic water use making up larger portions of total water use this is a limitation of this approach although when only comparing results in years with greater than 40 allocations the results improved significantly showing it can monitor water use effectively when adequate water is available this approach is able to accurately predict irrigation water use for the sites examined keywords remote sensing catchment hydrology water resource management murray darling basin evaporative stress index standardised precipitation index quantifying irrigation 1 introduction water resource management is vital to ensure scarce water is delivered fairly to stakeholders within connected catchments wisser et al 2008 states that irrigated agriculture is the largest water user globally this accounts for 72 of worldwide water resource in regions where prime agricultural land overlaps with limiting volumes of water this can lead to competition between users for access to adequate water water sharing plans are designed for fair and sustainable sharing of water by stakeholders resulting in healthy agricultural industries and rural communities while maintaining ecosystem sustainability this study focuses on the murray darling basin mdb in australia which has shared water between multiple domestic boundaries hart 2016 williams 2017 dovers 2007 states the mdb has reached the end of a three phase system leading to policy maturity a close to maximum regulation of streamflow and the economic cost of further development is increasing dramatically the disputes over water resources between stakeholders that cross governmental boarders are not unique to australia with issues arising globally arjoon et al 2016 bjornlund et al 2013 grafton et al 2019 tang et al 2014 water sharing plans require comprehensive metering and monitoring so managers can accurately account for water use and take this is especially important during drought when water is scarce when meters are not installed or fail an alternative method is required to quantify irrigation water use and comply with water sharing plans a potential solution to this is the use of hydrology models and or remote sensing approaches for water resource assessments national scale water account models such as the bureau of meteorology bom s australian water resource assessment landscape model awra l v6 0 frost et al 2018 currently lacks the ability to accurately simulate fluxes in irrigated areas although work is underway to introduce this feature vaze et al 2018 other catchment scale hydrology models such as swat through its auto irrigate function arnold et al 2012 simulate crop growing stages via theoretical curves this can lead to irrigation water use being misrepresented compared to reality chen et al 2017 marek et al 2016 particularly in large scale simulations abbaspour et al 2015 ultimately this can then impact the model s ability to simulate catchment hydrology although work is being done to improve the swat auto irrigate feature chen et al 2018b it still requires manual inputs of all actual management operations such as fertiliser application these crop growth irrigation models may also make assumptions about initial nutrient availability as well as other crop conditions such as lack of salinity stress or disease as di paola et al 2016 found the majority of crop models used are old and although they have been developed and recalibrated over time they require updating to reflect new research in related fields during droughts irrigators may not be able to extract adequate water for optimal growth of crops causing water stress meaning these theoretical methods could be unreliable the use of remote sensing to observe crop conditions in near real time may allow for greater accuracy in irrigation simulation as the factors hindering growth like disease water stress or salinity may be observed pereira et al 2015 remote sensing can play an important role in the agricultural sector particularly for irrigation karthikeyan et al 2020 for example chen et al 2018a discusses detecting the frequency and timing in addition to the extent of irrigated areas with positive results with a similar outcome the murray darling basin authority mdba australia used remote sensing time series over the mdb to identify irrigation extent and timing for compliance purposes through optical time series images observing connected canals and farm water storages mdba 2017 2018 2019 despite these findings these methodologies do not estimate the volume or depth of irrigation water use use of remote sensing in crop monitoring has led to the observation of actual crop conditions in agricultural studies rather than the use of theoretical growth stages pereira et al 2015 research in relation to the ability of remote sensing to provide information for agriculture such as crop growth yields losses and aspects of irrigation is discussed by karthikeyan et al 2020 with irrigation specific literature summarised by jalilvand et al 2019 the use of remote sensing allows the spatial footprint and distribution of crops to be identified to aid in irrigation simulations lee et al 2016 yeo et al 2014 the literature directly related to the quantification of irrigation the subject of this research is summarised in table 1 and discussed below techniques developed for quantifying irrigation with remote sensing has used a range of approaches the approaches that use optical sensors for irrigation generally rely on calculating a crop coefficient k c some methods are highly parameterised saadi et al 2015 which limits their use in data sparse regions or in areas where digital soil maps are unreliable the calculating of a k c allows the remote sensing technique to be compared against a well known tabulated system allen et al 1998 this is a feature unique to the optical methods the use of thermal data from satellites has been used for mapping et over irrigated agriculture senay et al 2016 2017 thermal sensors typically have a lower resolution compared to optical reducing their ability at identifying localised crop changes soil moisture satellites through the sm2rain algorithm have been used for coarse scale irrigation quantification brocca et al 2018 jalilvand et al 2019 although the coarse resolution of these satellites is a clear limitation the combination of remote sensing and modelling has been investigated using multiple techniques these techniques generally compare measurements from satellites such as aet or soil moisture with outputs from models that do not account for irrigation these are exploited to find irrigation application volumes romaguera et al 2014 zaussinger et al 2019 the assimilation of satellite soil moisture into land surface models is another technique used for quantifying irrigation water use abolafia rosenzweig et al 2019 nair and indu 2019 combining model outputs with remote sensing generally faces the same limitations as using soil moisture satellites from coarse spatial resolution and an inability to understand sub pixel variability a different approach has been to identify crop types with remote sensing and then assign typical irrigation values or a tabulated k c to quantify the water use martı n de santa olalla et al 2003 serra et al 2016 pereira et al 2015 discussed that using tabulated k c values show limitations as they represent theoretical growth whereas a remote sensing derived value will show true conditions additionally tabulated values of crop growing conditions are not necessarily locally derived which may cause additional errors allen et al 1998 d urso 2010 a previous study bretreger et al 2019b used landsat observations to calculate k c which was used in combination with gridded precipitation and reference evapotranspiration e t o using the fao56 methodology allen et al 1998 this was used to calculate irrigation depths making the assumption that runoff and aquifer recharge from irrigated water was avoided this study found reliable results when simulating irrigation water uses over farm paddock scale sites a limitation was observed when monitoring fields that crop type was unknown which will be addressed in this study additionally the methodology is not sufficiently tested over catchment scale areas with only preliminary catchment scale results reported bretreger et al 2018 this study aims to continue testing the previously developed methodology bretreger et al 2018 2019a 2019b bretreger and yeo 2019 i e monitoring irrigation water uses with remote sensing over larger catchment scale sites that contain multiple and different land uses and crop types this paper 1 applies a modified version of a previously developed method to simulate irrigation water depths at catchment scale sites without the need of in situ soil and crop information 2 demonstrates the capabilities of a tool that may lead to rapid and reliable monitoring of irrigation water use to aid in water accounting 3 identifies potential scaling issues that arise from simulating irrigation over larger scales and 4 examines the applicability of the proposed methodology during droughts the simplicity of its implementation may allow for its application into other complex water resource hydrology models that currently do not account for irrigation water application 2 material and methods 2 1 site and data description the mdb is a large interconnected river system managed with rules set out in the murray darling basin plan mdbp the mdbp defines sustainable diversion limits which have been established to achieve sharing of water resources between irrigators and communities while ensuring environmental sustainability hart 2016 water access rights are divided into two types water entitlements permanent and allocations temporary wheeler et al 2014 an allocation is a percentage of an entitlement to be used in the water year 1 july to 30 june the assigned allocation percentage is based on the level of the entitlement which can be classified as general or high security high security licences generally receiving a more reliable water allocation predominately used for higher value or perennial crops in addition stock and domestic allocations are assigned from the water storage levels in the event irrigation monitoring meters fail there is a strong reliance on self reporting which has been found to be inadequate grafton and wheeler 2018 the study areas for this paper are scattered across new south wales australia within the mdb they are in semi arid to arid climate regions they include four irrigation infrastructure operators iios which amount to five catchment sized irrigation areas see fig 1 and table 2 for the location and details of study sites 2 1 1 irrigation infrastructure operators iios irrigation infrastructure operators iios are responsible for reporting and publishing extracted water volumes to the relevant government regulator they act as an entity that will sell irrigation water and deliver water when requested by users iio areas are used for simulations in this study as they monitor and provide monthly delivery volumes to their customer base through annual reports these annual reports have been used to compile a monthly dataset of customer water deliveries coleambally irrigation 2017 murray irrigation ltd 2017 murrumbidgee irrigation ltd 2017 western murray irrigation ltd 2017 note only the most recent report of each iio is referenced although older reports were used to compile irrigation data the volume of irrigation was given as a volumetric flow reported in ml delivered to customers these flows were divided by the area of the respective irrigated land to find an irrigation depth for each region some of the extractions reported may be being used for livestock or domestic drinking water purposes which may cause minor anomalies in results as vegetation spectral response would not change to correspond with pump meter readings a summary of the iios used in this study including average annual precipitation is available in table 2 details of the region s yearly water allocations and vegetation types are available in the appendix table 1a murray irrigation is separated into two catchment areas as it operates two extraction points from the murray river as murray irrigation records and reports these values separately it allows the different regions to be simulated as separate areas the values used for validation for each of the iios are deliveries to customers with the exception of western murray irrigation western murray irrigation s extractions are used for comparisons as the supply network for this iio is piped and therefore losses are considered negligible western murray irrigation ltd 2017 there is differing time periods for monthly and yearly data as reporting styles and detail levels have changed over time 2 1 2 precipitation and evapotranspiration data gridded climate data for this study is from the bureau of meteorology bom s operational australian water resources assessment

values of c n and c d are 1600 and 0 38 respectively which is for an alfalfa reference crop these values change to account for the differences in the vegetation properties and responses during transpiration as the products are computed over a daily time step typical assumptions such as a negligible soil heat flux g are applied to this product the awra gridded products use a climatologically derived wind speed as per mcvicar et al 2008 frost et al 2017 this is a major difference compared to other gridded products in australia like silo that uses a constant 2 m s wind speed frost et al 2017 córdova et al 2015 mentions that wind speed is an important variable when simulating et in semi arid environments and has shown better results in previous studies bretreger and yeo 2019 2 1 3 remote sensing data the remote sensing data used for this paper comprises the near infrared and optical bands from the landsat 5 7 and 8 satellites satellite observations are accessed through digital earth australia dea dhu et al 2017 lewis et al 2017 which processes images through the correction process developed by li et al 2012 to obtain a normalised surface reflectance the landsat surface reflectance values were used for the calculation of the various vegetation indices that show crop properties and growing conditions that were then related to the k c dea provides landsat images with a resolution of 25 m 25 m while their revisit time is approximately 16 days the data is provided in australian albers gda94 projected coordinate system the time series of the three satellites were combined to improve the number of observations during months when multiple satellites were orbiting during periods of three satellites orbiting this greatly reduces the chance of cloud covered images as revisit time is approximately weekly the date of data used is the same as the irrigation data periods specified in table 2 the number of scenes used is approximately 3 per month of simulation i e 10 years or 120 months of irrigation data contains data from 360 scenes the use of satellite images with higher spatial or temporal frequency such as the sentinel 2 satellites were dismissed as they lack the historical backlog of images to match validation data in the form of metered water use although the areas being simulated are large enough to make up multiple pixels from a satellite such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis with a higher temporal resolution this was dismissed due to its coarse spatial resolution 1 km it will not pick up finer signals over fields and sub paddocks which highlight localised management techniques or crop stress the pixels effected by clouds were removed from satellite images using a pixel quality masking function developed by sixsmith et al 2013 which is built into dea the pixel quality masking is a combination of the function of mask fmask zhu and woodcock 2012 and automated cloud cover assessment acca irish et al 2006 methods this removal function also removed cloud and terrain shadow from the images 2 1 4 land use data land use data is obtained from catchment scale land use maps of australia which are derived by state governments and compiled by the australia bureau of agricultural and resource economics and sciences abares available at https www agriculture gov au abares aclump land use data download as the products are derived by different jurisdictions they are produced at different scales and frequencies with updates coming at irregular times this study focuses on areas within nsw where the nsw office of environment and heritage oeh has combined multiple datasets to create a state wide catchment scale map this map was used to identify irrigated land within each of the iios simulated these maps combine remote sensing images satellite and aerial images with ancillary data farm surveys etc and local knowledge the published land use maps were used as they incorporate ancillary data unavailable to the public which provide a better representation of the land use than through using remote sensing alone the published static maps are available for both 2007 nsw oeh 2010 and 2013 nsw oeh 2017 land uses the maps are clipped to only include the regions of nsw identified as irrigated land the irrigated land within each iio has increased between 2007 and 2013 which is shown in the land use maps and summarised in fig 2 table 2a located in the appendix shows the percent of each area growing different irrigated crops as both the 2007 and 2013 land use maps are available the method described in this paper is run using with the land use map that is dated closest to the year of simulation this leads to simulations from 2000 01 to 2009 10 with the 2007 land use map while from 2010 11 onwards simulations are performed with the 2013 land use map 3 methodology 3 1 irrigation water use estimation this methodology follows the techniques and reasoning described by bretreger et al 2019b the description provided here will offer a brief overview of the previous study method and the key changes made for this study over a larger area a flow chart showing the steps and how they relate is presented in fig 3 the equation used to calculate irrigation depth is described in eq 2 2 irr a e t p where irr is the irrigation depth mm month while aet and p are the actual evapotranspiration mm month and precipitation mm month respectively the lack of runoff and drainage terms from eq 2 are justified as farmers are increasingly following best practice of reducing excess water application wallace 2000 and capturing water when this occurs hsiao et al 2007 this assumption is similar to the methodology used by senay et al 2016 as they performed water balance simulations in a semi arid to arid area which is similar to our study area and the vast majority of rural nsw the change in soil moisture is considered negligible compared to other fluxes especially as the method is applied on a monthly time scale bretreger et al 2019b additionally peña arancibia et al 2014 found while identifying irrigated area extents that aet p surpluses generally occurred in irrigated areas over the mdb it was even observed in the northern section of the mdb where summer wet seasons occur as the simulation in this paper assesses a depth of irrigation the spatial extents of the catchments are accounted for when preparing the metered irrigation data the aet is derived from using the methodology described in fao56 allen et al 1998 and calculated using eq 3 3 aet et o k c where aet is the actual evapotranspiration mm month e t o is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm month and k c is the crop coefficient k c values taken from tables require knowledge of planting dates and do not account for impacts such as water stress disease or salinity comparison of tabulated and remote sensing methods have been compared by bretreger et al 2019a showing the capability of the remote sensing k c the k c values for this study are determined from remote sensing vegetation indices table 3 shows the three remote sensing k c relationships used the first method is the relationship used in the irrisat irrigation scheduling application in australia hornbuckle et al 2016 montgomery et al 2015 available at https irrisat cloud appspot com the equation is based solely on the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1974 and was developed by trout and johnson 2007 over fields containing different crop types such as watermelon cantaloupe peppers beans tomatoes lettuce onion garlic cotton pistachio almond and grapes the second relationship also relying on the ndvi was conducted by kamble et al 2013 over soybeans maize and grass crops providing a range of crop signatures in its derivation though the study found relationships that were separated into dryland agriculture irrigated agriculture and combined agriculture there was little difference between the derived equations for dryland and irrigated agriculture the relationship for combined agriculture was used in this study which returned an r2 value of 0 8259 as the first and second relationships solely relied on the ndvi they were subject to errors with non green vegetation trout and johnson 2007 the third relationship used in this study is the csiro modis rescaled evapotranspiration cmrset method guerschman et al 2009 the cmrset method uses a rescaled enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 in addition to using the residual moisture index rmi guerschman et al 2009 based on the evi and global vegetation moisture index gvmi ceccato et al 2002 though multiple model variations were presented by guerschman et al 2009 only the 2b model variant table 3 was tested as this provided the best results over australia additionally the method described by guerschman et al 2009 accounted for intercepted water evaporation when combining with e t o via eq 4 4 aet k c et o k ei p where aet is the actual evapotranspiration mm month e t o is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm month k c is the crop coefficient k ei is a fraction of a k ei max term set at 0 229 that is scaled by the rescaled evi evi r that quantifies evaporation from the leaf surface and p is the precipitation mm month given the large extent of the study sites it is unlikely that clouds will cover the site for an entire month in a case where this occurs irrigation is assumed to be zero as this would generally occur during the winter months during times of higher rain and lower pet in circumstances where a low or negative ndvi resulted in negative irrigation application the irrigation value was set to zero 3 2 drought index drought effects were assessed with a standardised precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 wmo 2012 and the evaporative stress index esi anderson et al 2011 2007 they were used to identify droughts and associated vegetation stress conditions and see how varying lengths of drought may relate to water allocations and the accuracy in the proposed study method simultaneously years with 40 allocation were considered as drought affected based on historic allocation years for the sites assessed in this paper appendix table 1a this is used as a policy proxy for drought classification allowing the performance of the proposed model to be assessed in dry periods this is used to filter years when drought is occurring to see how the lack of water may affect the irrigation estimation results a different allocation threshold value may need to be selected for different locations the spi shows how many standard deviations the rainfall lies from the long term average which changes depending on the length of time assessed in calculation the lengths calculated in this study range from a minimum of 3 months to a maximum of 5 years longer durations indicate drought impacts on slow moving hydrology fluxes such as groundwater and storage levels mishra and singh 2010 the spi for this study is calculated via the spi generator program available at https drought unl edu droughtmonitoring spi spiprogram aspx input is from a silo grid cell s daily rainfall time series from 1 january 1900 to 31 december 2018 from the midpoint of each iio for the input an spi value below 0 indicates dry conditions with values below 1 indicates a drought with lower values indicating even drier conditions wmo 2012 in addition to the spi the evaporative stress index esi anderson et al 2011 2007 was also used for analysis the esi shows vegetation stress due to a reduced et based on a ratio of aet to pet based on satellite assisted energy balance modelling the esi product was downloaded from climateserv on a 5 km grid available at https climateserv servirglobal net the length used for this study is 12 weeks the longest time length available from climateserv the system outputs esi values from 1 january 2009 to present in a similar manner to the spi the esi shows drier conditions with a negative value anderson et al 2011 compared the esi with precipitation based drought indices and found that they perform similarly up to 6 month lead times cooley et al 2019 the esi can be used for identifying rapid onset of flash droughts otkin et al 2013 2014 and has recently been tested in australia using pet and aet values from a land surface model rather than remote sensing values nguyen et al 2019 3 3 model performance metrics the comparisons for all of the sites used in this study are performed over both monthly and yearly time steps the simulated irrigation depths and metered values are compared using a root mean square error rmse this is calculated via eq 5 5 rmse t 1 t y t y t 2 t where rmse is the root mean square error mm y t is the estimated monthly irrigation depth for each month mm based on the model described in this paper y t is the metered irrigation depth for each month mm and t is the number of months that are compared this is performed for both monthly and yearly irrigation additionally a ratio of the estimated irrigation to the actual irrigation is calculated with a value of 1 showing a correctly simulated irrigation on average values below 1 are underestimations and above 1 are overestimations only yearly values are calculated for the ratio these are found by summing the monthly values for a given water year before comparing against the cumulative metered irrigation for that year 4 results the results show the simulations of irrigation water depth for each of the et o k c combinations while also presenting how these perform when comparing results with monthly and yearly observations the results also demonstrate the impacts of removing simulation periods where iios were subject to allocations of less than 40 of their entitlements allocation percentages can be found in the appendix table 1a the western murray irrigation results are not presented with the 40 allocations removed this is due to the vast majority of users within this area holding high security licences providing reliable water allocations not being assigned allocations less than 40 the four other areas are predominately covered by general allocation licences which can often be assigned allocations below 40 particularly in drought 4 1 irrigation time series the monthly irrigation water depth time series presented in fig 4 displays the 6 combinations of k c and et o this is plotted against the irrigation depth calculated from the on farm deliveries and irrigated areas from the nsw land use maps fig 4 shows the results from using all available data with the shaded sections of the plots indicating the sections that are removed in other evaluation metrics due to the 40 water allocations filter the irrigation depth is significantly overestimated in the shaded years this provides a qualitative way to see how the low allocation years due to droughts are affecting the simulation results across all years there is an overestimation which could be attributed to the assumptions in the methodology it implies the calculated irrigation quantification is the deficit between aet and p 4 2 standardised precipitation index and evaporative stress index when the spi appendix fig 1a shows periods of sustained meteorological drought i e greater than 3 4 years the proposed method reduces in accuracy the lower long term spis can be related with the years of low allocation assignment in these iios in particular coleambally 2009 10 and murray irrigation wakool 2015 16 appendix fig 1a when the spi is calculated over 3 months to 1 year the study method is still showing acceptable results with the exception of the 3 month murray irrigation wakool spi when spis with a lead time of 3 to 5 years starts to indicate longer term drought i e less than 1 the method begins to show less accuracy additionally the two murray irrigation regions are subjected to the same water allocations although the spi can differ substantially between the two areas because of spatial patterns of rainfall the esi is presented in the appendix fig 2a the 12 week esi used for comparison with the spis shows good correlation with the 2015 16 low allocation years the esi shows a continuous downward trend over this water year however it is not substantially different to esis from other years in the simulation period although the esi takes into account more water balance fluxes e g irrigation to show vegetation stress rather than just rainfall the products available for comparison are not influenced by enough lead time to show effects on water storages i e longer term drought and hence allocations the methodology used here does not seem to be significantly impacts by stress identified with a 12 week esi if the esi was calculated based on longer lead times as was done with the spi it may show similar trends with water allocation and availability the 5 km resolution of the esi may mean individual fields within the regions may make up insignificant potions of each pixel evident from fig 2 4 3 evaluation metrics table 4 shows the rmse of each simulation performed this table can be used as a comparison between the various et o k c relationships used to simulate both monthly and yearly irrigation water depths the results of when the low allocation years 40 were filtered out are also presented the best results for each study area using all the results or the filtered results are in bold and shaded grey the time series in fig 4 shows that for the most part the irrigation depth was monitored well the model missed some irrigation peaks although this mainly occurred during the low allocation years in some months the cmrset method returned significantly inaccurate results the kamble and irrisat methods do not show significant differences when using the same et o the et o is still an important factor but the results show the remote sensing equation is the more sensitive aspect of the model table 4 the ratios of estimated irrigation to observed irrigation is presented in fig 5 the average of all compared years is presented complete data results as well as filtered results are shown when removing low allocation water years from analysis the murray irrigation sites show a significant improvement in annual irrigation estimation moving from extreme over estimation to a slight over estimation the murrumbidgee and coleambally sites improved from a slight overestimation to within 10 of the average annual irrigation the standard deviation observed in these ratios shown in error bars in fig 5 has significantly decreased when removing dry years indicating the outliers of the simulation are occurring during the drier years however the same improvements were not seen on a monthly time scale as seen in table 4 the monthly statistics in this study are not significantly affected from the removal of low allocation years in some cases we see an increase in the rmse table 4 murrumbidgee irrigation and coleambally irrigation the months in these years with already low irrigation depths have a tendency to perform better due to the lack of available water i e zero metered irrigation and zero simulated irrigation when comparing this to years of high water availability there are small errors in these low irrigation months this is seen when looking at the time series of irrigation depths fig 4 over the iios assessed and comparing the simulated and recorded values from low to high allocation years the asce et o is outperformed by the fao56 et o for all simulations in simulations over coleambally irrigation the asce et o method works well monthly although it does not compare to the fao et o method when assessing on a yearly scale the improved results returned when using the fao et o method over all iios fig 5 and table 4 may be due to land uses in the area having similar leaf conductance to the grass reference crop used in the fao et o derivation the opposite is also evident in western murray irrigation as the asce et o performs almost to the same accuracy as the fao method on monthly comparison likely due to the high percentage of taller fruit nut trees grown in the region as seen in the appendix table 2a this agrees with previously published work that shows an almond orchard irrigation is accurately monitored by using the asce et o bretreger et al 2018 2019b 5 discussion 5 1 simulations of irrigation water depth across all simulations the cmrset k c is not performing as well as the linear ndvi k c relationships irrisat and kamble fig 4 fig 5 and table 4 this was also observed in previous studies performed over farm scale sites bretreger et al 2019b the irrisat and kamble methods performed better despite the limitations of only sensing green vegetation trout and johnson 2007 the ndvi is reported to saturate when making observations with a high leaf area index lai guerschman et al 2009 or when canopy cover is reduced higher values may be observed due to soil interference huete 1988 current results indicate the ndvi is working satisfactorily for these sites beeri et al 2019 shows that when identifying a k c the ndvi gives the best results compared to other vegetation indices such as the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 visible atmospherically resistant index vari gitelson et al 2002 and the enhanced vegetation index evi jiang et al 2008 the different study sites were expected to show varying accuracy with different plant phenology being observed each of the plants observed will return differing values based on their physical characteristics for each band in the optical spectrum viña et al 2011 there is evidence of significant rain events that occur near monthly divides that causes irrigation depth to be simulated in the wrong month there was a large storm event at the end of february and start of march 2012 that caused large rainfall in southern and western sections of nsw bom 2012 the gridded rainfall used in this study agrees with this observation with relatively large precipitation values for these months as a significant portion of this rainfall occurs at the end of february the approach used in this study decreases the irrigation for february while in reality this water is transpired in march this causes errors due to a soil moisture lag time caused by a lack of a soil storage term in the methodology this is seen with simulated irrigation in february 2012 fig 4 being extremely low while actual irrigation is higher due to early month irrigation conversely the simulated irrigation for march is then overestimated as the stored moisture levels will contribute to et from the crops rather than irrigation inputs this is evident in all iios tested although some are more affected than others due to the spatial patterns of the rainfall event the inaccuracies that this introduces into the model is predominately seen on month time steps as the yearly simulations still provide a close match to recorded irrigation the implementation of a higher temporal resolution i e interpolation to daily images and more images per month i e sentinel 2 and landsat blending claverie et al 2018 may partially rectify this limitation 5 2 water allocations and drought fig 5 showed large decreases in the ratio of estimated to actual irrigation when removing the years with allocations below 40 this is used as a policy proxy to identify the impacts of drought the spi and esi are also used for evaluation of drought the removed years are occurring at particularly dry times with the 2009 10 period being the end of the millennium drought drought leads to reduced water allocations through the mdbp and hence less water extraction high flows occurred over the 2010 11 to 2013 14 period in the mdb which is a likely cause for allocations to increase grafton and wheeler 2018 although the 2015 16 period showed below average streamflow and average rainfall the rainfall mostly occurred at the end of the water year bom 2016 the previous water year was below average in both streamflow and rainfall bom 2015 leading to the start of the 2015 16 year being dry and hence being assigned low allocations the decreased accuracy when water allocations are below 40 may be due to water stress sustained meteorological drought affects water resources such as groundwater and streamflow in addition to lake and reservoir levels as hydrologic system lag times are accounted for mishra and singh 2010 hence reducing water availability used in the allocation assignment process the effect of sustained negative spis of 6 12 months and 24 months has been shown to cause hydrological droughts affecting surface water and groundwater resources respectively kubicz 2018 van oel et al 2018 the years with greater accuracy are occurring simultaneously to higher spis this is thought to be due to water availability being in surplus and hence irrigators are able to manage their crops using best practice methodologies as is assumed in this method the results show the esi is not impacting ability of the method to quantify irrigation water use this may be due to the smaller rapid onset droughts that are shown from the esi nguyen et al 2019 otkin et al 2013 2014 are not impacting water allocations additionally the esi uses remote sensing observations meaning it is indicative of all water balance features including irrigation anderson et al 2013 2011 which could potentially cause stabilised moisture conditions being observed yang et al 2018 states that the performance of the esi may be degraded in regions when the vegetation cycle is intensively managed for example agricultural settings western murray irrigation contains predominately high security water licences which generally receive a substantial allocation of their licence it is not as vulnerable to seasonal availability of water with all years assessed in this study having between 95 and 100 of their entitlement appendix table 1a the accurate irrigation simulations in this region are observed despite low spis and esis this could imply that high security licences have improved drought resilience of irrigators in the region this is as intended as historically high security licences have received in excess of 100 of allocations wheeler et al 2014 additionally the western murray irrigation network is piped rather than channelled meaning there are less losses due to seepage and evaporation during conveyance western murray irrigation ltd 2017 the unfiltered results of western murray irrigation are performing to a similar or better accuracy compared to filtered results from other sites in years with less than 40 allocations it is possible that farm managers skip or reduce plantings of annual commodities such as cotton rice or dairy this is because during drought in the mdb the price of water increases greatly compared to wetter periods meaning water is sold to users with higher value commodities dixon et al 2011 wheeler et al 2014 wittwer and griffith 2011 for example farm managers in the murrumbidgee region sold large quantities of water destined for their rice plantations to irrigators for use on perennial crops in victoria and south australia during the millennium drought kirby et al 2012 this change in agricultural land may results in remote sensing images within this study observing bare earth fields as the static land use maps do not reflect this change the iio compliance reports give approximations of the land area covered by irrigated cropping each year dry years show significantly less land being irrigated compared to wetter years in extreme cases such as 2007 08 murray irrigation had 41 of their water deliveries being used for stock and domestic purposes murray irrigation ltd 2008 this portion of water use leads to the deliveries data being potentially unreliable for our purpose as pump metre readings would not correspond with on the ground changes 5 3 water stress and remote sensing it was previously found that the ndvi had difficulty identifying stress in certain crops this stress has been explored by bretreger et al 2019b in regard to wine grapes studies have identified potential issues in other crops such as but not limited to beans spinach potatoes tomatoes and corn jones et al 2004 mastrorilli et al 2010 romero et al 2017 katsoulas et al 2016 performed a review of water stress detection in greenhouses and states the ndvi has a slow response to water stress it is postulated that these longer term droughts which lead to a water allocation reductions i e below 40 are responsible for minor stresses being experienced by crops leading to the vegetation indices not being able to simulate irrigation accurately in previous studies k c values over a cotton field in queensland shows large changes between winter and the summer growing season the average k c value in winter when crops were not actively growing returned approximately 0 2 bretreger et al 2019b the impact of these k c values is mitigated by a generally higher rainfall and less et o during the winter months these small k c values may lead to the final irrigation value being zero as the metered data shows during the dry years identified over the iios when annual commodities may be skipped individual fields are returning k c values of between 0 2 and 0 3 not presented these values occurred during a period of no low precipitation and high aet leading to potentially higher irrigation estimates as per eqs 2 and 3 5 4 future considerations an aim of this paper was to investigate the potential scaling issues that may arrive from applying the previously developed method over larger extents the results in this paper indicated the effects of simulating irrigation over larger catchment areas do not lead to significantly reduced accuracy murrumbidgee irrigation which has the largest area assessed in this study produces better results than the separated murray irrigation areas the rmses and ratios found from this study show better results than paddock scale simulations bretreger et al 2019b although the different simulation spatial scale needs to be considered this may be due to all the iios being assessed having portions of land that closely match the correct stomatal and wind resistances of the fao methods appendix table 2a the work by jalilvand et al 2019 which aims to remotely sense irrigation water use as previously discussed reports an average model performance in irrigated pixels in terms of a rmse of 12 895 mm month this study has produced a lower rmse table 4 and higher spatial resolution although performed in a different region as the aggregate irrigation volume is the only comparison figure individual land managers within the study area could have their water use over or underestimated without improved spatial disaggregation of observed irrigation data this is not able to be tested the filtered results continue to slightly overestimate the irrigation in some regions figs 4 and 5 a source of error may be due to unaccounted for increases in aet some of this error is likely from model inputs or the ndvi k c conversions another explanation would be changes in k c due to factors external to this study s methodology the changes in k c causing these overestimations could be caused by groundwater withdrawal from deep rooted crops changing the spectral signatures of the canopy in reality this would result in drawing down groundwater to supplement the aet crop growth without additional irrigation inputs this contribution is likely minimal in the study areas because of land use maps removing deep rooted vegetation from analysis although it should be considered if applying this model elsewhere additionally if crop stress can be successfully identified a water stress coefficient k s may be applied allen et al 1998 incorporating stress into simulations may results in improved results in dry years the seninel 2 satellites have an improved spectral resolution compared to landsat and has been used to assess water stressed vegetation conditions successfully west et al 2018 may improve the ability to quantify irrigation in stressed conditions the use of the catchment scale land use maps as opposed to the preliminarily tested national scale maps bretreger et al 2018 are likely responsible for most of the improvements seen as irrigated land is mapped with improved resolution the best ratios of yearly simulations improved from 1 23 and 1 56 in the preliminary study to 1 09 and 1 30 in the simulations for this paper for mulwala and wakool regions respectively fig 5 additionally the use of gridded meteorological data has helped in capturing the spatial variability over the study sites the awra et o products use a climatologically derived wind speed which is likely improving simulations bretreger and yeo 2019 córdova et al 2015 found that assuming wind speeds was not a cause of major errors in the et o unless simulating in semi arid to arid climates as this study was finally the results of this methodology are only as good as the inputs used which is somewhat alluded to above as datasets like land use maps are updated more frequently or meteorological data are improved in accuracy or spatial resolution the irrigation simulations may improve 6 conclusion the results demonstrated the potential for a moderate resolution remotely sensed image such as landsat to be used to monitor irrigation water use over catchment scales it showed that the customer deliveries published by iios in australia have the potential to be used as a validation dataset for irrigation studies from the results obtained it is evident that the irrisat and kamble methods perform better over catchment scale sites tested here the cmrset method performed poorly during simulations for this work and would not be recommended for future simulations the fao et o method outperformed the asce et o method in all scenarios this may be due to the study regions predominately being covered by crops portraying similar physical characteristics to the fao short reference crop there are some regions i e western murray irrigation with large amounts of taller fruit nut trees that provided adequate results using the asce method in this study years with less than 40 allocation were removed from analysis as a policy proxy for drought classification this led to improvements of annual irrigation simulations which was predominately linked to water stress applied to crops annual commodities being skipped with water potentially carrying a higher price on the trading market and a larger portion of the total water deliveries being used for stock and domestic purposes further developments may be made using additional satellites such as sentinel 2 to improve temporal and spatial resolution of the remote sensing images as the current method shows limitation when large precipitation events occur near a monthly divide a longer or more recent metered data record is required for this to take advantage of the relatively short operational timespan of sentinel 2 the potential for alternatives to the ndvi may be considered to look at improving simulation in drought years the current method could be used as an independent tool for monitoring and assessing water use of catchment scales with relative accuracy particularly over annual time scales with the exception of murray irrigation wakool all iios provide annual filtered ratios of within 10 of the actual irrigation over monthly time scales it will still provide an accurate tool for monitoring integrating this simple method into an established water resource model may allow for more accurate large scale assessment and management additionally it may give rise to the opportunity to model irrigation and its impacts on catchment hydrology declaration of competing interest the authors declare

results and to help make informed conclusion this includes end of season general and high security allocations for each iio and the number of properties growing each irrigated commodity within each iio for each land use map the allocations available in each catchment for both general and high security entitlements is presented in table 1a these were compiled from the publically available annual reports published online coleambally irrigation 2017 murray irrigation ltd 2017 murrumbidgee irrigation ltd 2017 western murray irrigation ltd 2017 only the most recent reference has been included the nsw government decides on allocations for different catchments based on storage levels and water forecasts the actual volume of water allocated is based on the volume of the user s entitlement as murrumbidgee irrigation and coleambally irrigation are both located within the murrumbidgee catchment shown in fig 1 they have very similar allocations western murray irrigation contains mostly high security entitlements and hence they do not report general security allocations in their annual reports all other iios contain users with mostly general security licences the plots shown in fig 1a show the spis for each of the simulated iios the graphed lengths of spi ranges are 3 and 6 months and 1 2 3 4 and 5 years the grey shaded regions of the graphs show the years with low allocations implemented in the respective region the 12 week esi is shown in the plots in fig 2a the low allocation years have been included on the graph in grey shading to indicate if low allocations correspond with low esis table 2a shows the percent of properties growing each identified irrigated commodity from the 2007 to 2013 land use maps some identifications have changed i e perennial horticulture in

5209,irrigated agriculture has been identified as using approximately 72 of water globally australia like many places in the world is subject to water sharing plans that cross government boarders and are subject to a mixture of management policies there is a pressing need to develop a method to monitor irrigation water use to aid in water resource assessments and monitoring this paper aims to test a method previously developed which monitors irrigation water use using remotely sensed observations over the catchment scale without the need for in situ observations ground data or in depth knowledge of crops and their planting dates using conservative assumptions about agricultural land management practice irrigation is calculated as i r r a e t p the method uses three vegetation indices derived from landsat images to calculate crop coefficients k c based on multiple published relationships these are combined through the fao56 methodology using gridded rainfall and two reference evapotranspiration e t o products to find actual evapotranspiration as a e t e t o k c providing six e t o k c combinations results indicate this study method can effectively assess irrigation water use over a range of catchment sizes from 6000 to 600 000 ha although issues arise when regions have a designated low allocation volume for that season less than40 comparisons with the standardised precipitation index spi and evaporative stress index esi show that the proposed method is robust to the rapid onset and short term droughts however its performance was poor during the long term droughts with low water allocation years the study results during these years has been predominately attributed to water stress in certain crops being undetected agricultural managers skipping annual crop commodities as well as stock and domestic water use making up larger portions of total water use this is a limitation of this approach although when only comparing results in years with greater than 40 allocations the results improved significantly showing it can monitor water use effectively when adequate water is available this approach is able to accurately predict irrigation water use for the sites examined keywords remote sensing catchment hydrology water resource management murray darling basin evaporative stress index standardised precipitation index quantifying irrigation 1 introduction water resource management is vital to ensure scarce water is delivered fairly to stakeholders within connected catchments wisser et al 2008 states that irrigated agriculture is the largest water user globally this accounts for 72 of worldwide water resource in regions where prime agricultural land overlaps with limiting volumes of water this can lead to competition between users for access to adequate water water sharing plans are designed for fair and sustainable sharing of water by stakeholders resulting in healthy agricultural industries and rural communities while maintaining ecosystem sustainability this study focuses on the murray darling basin mdb in australia which has shared water between multiple domestic boundaries hart 2016 williams 2017 dovers 2007 states the mdb has reached the end of a three phase system leading to policy maturity a close to maximum regulation of streamflow and the economic cost of further development is increasing dramatically the disputes over water resources between stakeholders that cross governmental boarders are not unique to australia with issues arising globally arjoon et al 2016 bjornlund et al 2013 grafton et al 2019 tang et al 2014 water sharing plans require comprehensive metering and monitoring so managers can accurately account for water use and take this is especially important during drought when water is scarce when meters are not installed or fail an alternative method is required to quantify irrigation water use and comply with water sharing plans a potential solution to this is the use of hydrology models and or remote sensing approaches for water resource assessments national scale water account models such as the bureau of meteorology bom s australian water resource assessment landscape model awra l v6 0 frost et al 2018 currently lacks the ability to accurately simulate fluxes in irrigated areas although work is underway to introduce this feature vaze et al 2018 other catchment scale hydrology models such as swat through its auto irrigate function arnold et al 2012 simulate crop growing stages via theoretical curves this can lead to irrigation water use being misrepresented compared to reality chen et al 2017 marek et al 2016 particularly in large scale simulations abbaspour et al 2015 ultimately this can then impact the model s ability to simulate catchment hydrology although work is being done to improve the swat auto irrigate feature chen et al 2018b it still requires manual inputs of all actual management operations such as fertiliser application these crop growth irrigation models may also make assumptions about initial nutrient availability as well as other crop conditions such as lack of salinity stress or disease as di paola et al 2016 found the majority of crop models used are old and although they have been developed and recalibrated over time they require updating to reflect new research in related fields during droughts irrigators may not be able to extract adequate water for optimal growth of crops causing water stress meaning these theoretical methods could be unreliable the use of remote sensing to observe crop conditions in near real time may allow for greater accuracy in irrigation simulation as the factors hindering growth like disease water stress or salinity may be observed pereira et al 2015 remote sensing can play an important role in the agricultural sector particularly for irrigation karthikeyan et al 2020 for example chen et al 2018a discusses detecting the frequency and timing in addition to the extent of irrigated areas with positive results with a similar outcome the murray darling basin authority mdba australia used remote sensing time series over the mdb to identify irrigation extent and timing for compliance purposes through optical time series images observing connected canals and farm water storages mdba 2017 2018 2019 despite these findings these methodologies do not estimate the volume or depth of irrigation water use use of remote sensing in crop monitoring has led to the observation of actual crop conditions in agricultural studies rather than the use of theoretical growth stages pereira et al 2015 research in relation to the ability of remote sensing to provide information for agriculture such as crop growth yields losses and aspects of irrigation is discussed by karthikeyan et al 2020 with irrigation specific literature summarised by jalilvand et al 2019 the use of remote sensing allows the spatial footprint and distribution of crops to be identified to aid in irrigation simulations lee et al 2016 yeo et al 2014 the literature directly related to the quantification of irrigation the subject of this research is summarised in table 1 and discussed below techniques developed for quantifying irrigation with remote sensing has used a range of approaches the approaches that use optical sensors for irrigation generally rely on calculating a crop coefficient k c some methods are highly parameterised saadi et al 2015 which limits their use in data sparse regions or in areas where digital soil maps are unreliable the calculating of a k c allows the remote sensing technique to be compared against a well known tabulated system allen et al 1998 this is a feature unique to the optical methods the use of thermal data from satellites has been used for mapping et over irrigated agriculture senay et al 2016 2017 thermal sensors typically have a lower resolution compared to optical reducing their ability at identifying localised crop changes soil moisture satellites through the sm2rain algorithm have been used for coarse scale irrigation quantification brocca et al 2018 jalilvand et al 2019 although the coarse resolution of these satellites is a clear limitation the combination of remote sensing and modelling has been investigated using multiple techniques these techniques generally compare measurements from satellites such as aet or soil moisture with outputs from models that do not account for irrigation these are exploited to find irrigation application volumes romaguera et al 2014 zaussinger et al 2019 the assimilation of satellite soil moisture into land surface models is another technique used for quantifying irrigation water use abolafia rosenzweig et al 2019 nair and indu 2019 combining model outputs with remote sensing generally faces the same limitations as using soil moisture satellites from coarse spatial resolution and an inability to understand sub pixel variability a different approach has been to identify crop types with remote sensing and then assign typical irrigation values or a tabulated k c to quantify the water use martı n de santa olalla et al 2003 serra et al 2016 pereira et al 2015 discussed that using tabulated k c values show limitations as they represent theoretical growth whereas a remote sensing derived value will show true conditions additionally tabulated values of crop growing conditions are not necessarily locally derived which may cause additional errors allen et al 1998 d urso 2010 a previous study bretreger et al 2019b used landsat observations to calculate k c which was used in combination with gridded precipitation and reference evapotranspiration e t o using the fao56 methodology allen et al 1998 this was used to calculate irrigation depths making the assumption that runoff and aquifer recharge from irrigated water was avoided this study found reliable results when simulating irrigation water uses over farm paddock scale sites a limitation was observed when monitoring fields that crop type was unknown which will be addressed in this study additionally the methodology is not sufficiently tested over catchment scale areas with only preliminary catchment scale results reported bretreger et al 2018 this study aims to continue testing the previously developed methodology bretreger et al 2018 2019a 2019b bretreger and yeo 2019 i e monitoring irrigation water uses with remote sensing over larger catchment scale sites that contain multiple and different land uses and crop types this paper 1 applies a modified version of a previously developed method to simulate irrigation water depths at catchment scale sites without the need of in situ soil and crop information 2 demonstrates the capabilities of a tool that may lead to rapid and reliable monitoring of irrigation water use to aid in water accounting 3 identifies potential scaling issues that arise from simulating irrigation over larger scales and 4 examines the applicability of the proposed methodology during droughts the simplicity of its implementation may allow for its application into other complex water resource hydrology models that currently do not account for irrigation water application 2 material and methods 2 1 site and data description the mdb is a large interconnected river system managed with rules set out in the murray darling basin plan mdbp the mdbp defines sustainable diversion limits which have been established to achieve sharing of water resources between irrigators and communities while ensuring environmental sustainability hart 2016 water access rights are divided into two types water entitlements permanent and allocations temporary wheeler et al 2014 an allocation is a percentage of an entitlement to be used in the water year 1 july to 30 june the assigned allocation percentage is based on the level of the entitlement which can be classified as general or high security high security licences generally receiving a more reliable water allocation predominately used for higher value or perennial crops in addition stock and domestic allocations are assigned from the water storage levels in the event irrigation monitoring meters fail there is a strong reliance on self reporting which has been found to be inadequate grafton and wheeler 2018 the study areas for this paper are scattered across new south wales australia within the mdb they are in semi arid to arid climate regions they include four irrigation infrastructure operators iios which amount to five catchment sized irrigation areas see fig 1 and table 2 for the location and details of study sites 2 1 1 irrigation infrastructure operators iios irrigation infrastructure operators iios are responsible for reporting and publishing extracted water volumes to the relevant government regulator they act as an entity that will sell irrigation water and deliver water when requested by users iio areas are used for simulations in this study as they monitor and provide monthly delivery volumes to their customer base through annual reports these annual reports have been used to compile a monthly dataset of customer water deliveries coleambally irrigation 2017 murray irrigation ltd 2017 murrumbidgee irrigation ltd 2017 western murray irrigation ltd 2017 note only the most recent report of each iio is referenced although older reports were used to compile irrigation data the volume of irrigation was given as a volumetric flow reported in ml delivered to customers these flows were divided by the area of the respective irrigated land to find an irrigation depth for each region some of the extractions reported may be being used for livestock or domestic drinking water purposes which may cause minor anomalies in results as vegetation spectral response would not change to correspond with pump meter readings a summary of the iios used in this study including average annual precipitation is available in table 2 details of the region s yearly water allocations and vegetation types are available in the appendix table 1a murray irrigation is separated into two catchment areas as it operates two extraction points from the murray river as murray irrigation records and reports these values separately it allows the different regions to be simulated as separate areas the values used for validation for each of the iios are deliveries to customers with the exception of western murray irrigation western murray irrigation s extractions are used for comparisons as the supply network for this iio is piped and therefore losses are considered negligible western murray irrigation ltd 2017 there is differing time periods for monthly and yearly data as reporting styles and detail levels have changed over time 2 1 2 precipitation and evapotranspiration data gridded climate data for this study is from the bureau of meteorology bom s operational australian water resources assessment landscape awra l model v6 0 available at http www bom gov au water landscape frost et al 2018 this is a gridded product available in a 0 05 0 05 degree grid approximately 5 km 5 km over continental australia the climatic inputs for the awra l model are taken from the australian water availability project awap which is delivered on daily time steps and interpolated from gauging stations jones et al 2009 this study uses the precipitation and the e t o australia wide daily average bias for both precipitation and e t o is 0 frost et al 2017 jones et al 2009 the e t o has a large range although most errors with these datasets are occurring in locations of high altitude or coast regions that do not impact these study sites precipitation data for the calculation of drought indices is downloaded from the scientific information for land owners silo 5 km australian grid available at https legacy longpaddock qld gov au silo jeffrey et al 2001 it is used because the dataset spans from 1889 to present which is longer than the awra records the precipitation data is the unaltered version of the awap dataset frost et al 2018 and is downloaded on a monthly time step the e t o provides the et of a theoretical crop which is considered the reference ground cover under no water stress and sunny well drained conditions either grass or alfalfa which is scaled based on the k c to calculate a e t the e t o products downloaded include the fao56 short crop e t o allen et al 1998 and the american society of civil engineers asce tall crop e t o allen et al 2000 the process of calculating these e t o products is through a modified penman monteith equation defined by allen et al 1998 by equation 1 1 et o 0 408 δ r n g γ c n t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 c d u 2 where e t o is the reference evapotranspiration mm day δ is the slope of the vapour pressure curve kpa c r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 day g is the soil heat flux density mj m2 day γ is the psychometric constant kpa c t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s e s is the saturation vapour pressure kpa e a is the actual vapour pressure kpa c n is a constant that is a function of the time step and aerodynamic resistance and c d is a constant that is a function of the time step bulk surface resistance and aerodynamic roughness the c n and c d values vary between the fao56 and asce methods the values for fao56 are 900 and 0 34 for c n and c d respectively which corresponds to a grass reference crop for the asce calculation the values of c n and c d are 1600 and 0 38 respectively which is for an alfalfa reference crop these values change to account for the differences in the vegetation properties and responses during transpiration as the products are computed over a daily time step typical assumptions such as a negligible soil heat flux g are applied to this product the awra gridded products use a climatologically derived wind speed as per mcvicar et al 2008 frost et al 2017 this is a major difference compared to other gridded products in australia like silo that uses a constant 2 m s wind speed frost et al 2017 córdova et al 2015 mentions that wind speed is an important variable when simulating et in semi arid environments and has shown better results in previous studies bretreger and yeo 2019 2 1 3 remote sensing data the remote sensing data used for this paper comprises the near infrared and optical bands from the landsat 5 7 and 8 satellites satellite observations are accessed through digital earth australia dea dhu et al 2017 lewis et al 2017 which processes images through the correction process developed by li et al 2012 to obtain a normalised surface reflectance the landsat surface reflectance values were used for the calculation of the various vegetation indices that show crop properties and growing conditions that were then related to the k c dea provides landsat images with a resolution of 25 m 25 m while their revisit time is approximately 16 days the data is provided in australian albers gda94 projected coordinate system the time series of the three satellites were combined to improve the number of observations during months when multiple satellites were orbiting during periods of three satellites orbiting this greatly reduces the chance of cloud covered images as revisit time is approximately weekly the date of data used is the same as the irrigation data periods specified in table 2 the number of scenes used is approximately 3 per month of simulation i e 10 years or 120 months of irrigation data contains data from 360 scenes the use of satellite images with higher spatial or temporal frequency such as the sentinel 2 satellites were dismissed as they lack the historical backlog of images to match validation data in the form of metered water use although the areas being simulated are large enough to make up multiple pixels from a satellite such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis with a higher temporal resolution this was dismissed due to its coarse spatial resolution 1 km it will not pick up finer signals over fields and sub paddocks which highlight localised management techniques or crop stress the pixels effected by clouds were removed from satellite images using a pixel quality masking function developed by sixsmith et al 2013 which is built into dea the pixel quality masking is a combination of the function of mask fmask zhu and woodcock 2012 and automated cloud cover assessment acca irish et al 2006 methods this removal function also removed cloud and terrain shadow from the images 2 1 4 land use data land use data is obtained from catchment scale land use maps of australia which are derived by state governments and compiled by the australia bureau of agricultural and resource economics and sciences abares available at https www agriculture gov au abares aclump land use data download as the products are derived by different jurisdictions they are produced at different scales and frequencies with updates coming at irregular times this study focuses on areas within nsw where the nsw office of environment and heritage oeh has combined multiple datasets to create a state wide catchment scale map this map was used to identify irrigated land within each of the iios simulated these maps combine remote sensing images satellite and aerial images with ancillary data farm surveys etc and local knowledge the published land use maps were used as they incorporate ancillary data unavailable to the public which provide a better representation of the land use than through using remote sensing alone the published static maps are available for both 2007 nsw oeh 2010 and 2013 nsw oeh 2017 land uses the maps are clipped to only include the regions of nsw identified as irrigated land the irrigated land within each iio has increased between 2007 and 2013 which is shown in the land use maps and summarised in fig 2 table 2a located in the appendix shows the percent of each area growing different irrigated crops as both the 2007 and 2013 land use maps are available the method described in this paper is run using with the land use map that is dated closest to the year of simulation this leads to simulations from 2000 01 to 2009 10 with the 2007 land use map while from 2010 11 onwards simulations are performed with the 2013 land use map 3 methodology 3 1 irrigation water use estimation this methodology follows the techniques and reasoning described by bretreger et al 2019b the description provided here will offer a brief overview of the previous study method and the key changes made for this study over a larger area a flow chart showing the steps and how they relate is presented in fig 3 the equation used to calculate irrigation depth is described in eq 2 2 irr a e t p where irr is the irrigation depth mm month while aet and p are the actual evapotranspiration mm month and precipitation mm month respectively the lack of runoff and drainage terms from eq 2 are justified as farmers are increasingly following best practice of reducing excess water application wallace 2000 and capturing water when this occurs hsiao et al 2007 this assumption is similar to the methodology used by senay et al 2016 as they performed water balance simulations in a semi arid to arid area which is similar to our study area and the vast majority of rural nsw the change in soil moisture is considered negligible compared to other fluxes especially as the method is applied on a monthly time scale bretreger et al 2019b additionally peña arancibia et al 2014 found while identifying irrigated area extents that aet p surpluses generally occurred in irrigated areas over the mdb it was even observed in the northern section of the mdb where summer wet seasons occur as the simulation in this paper assesses a depth of irrigation the spatial extents of the catchments are accounted for when preparing the metered irrigation data the aet is derived from using the methodology described in fao56 allen et al 1998 and calculated using eq 3 3 aet et o k c where aet is the actual evapotranspiration mm month e t o is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm month and k c is the crop coefficient k c values taken from tables require knowledge of planting dates and do not account for impacts such as water stress disease or salinity comparison of tabulated and remote sensing methods have been compared by bretreger et al 2019a showing the capability of the remote sensing k c the k c values for this study are determined from remote sensing vegetation indices table 3 shows the three remote sensing k c relationships used the first method is the relationship used in the irrisat irrigation scheduling application in australia hornbuckle et al 2016 montgomery et al 2015 available at https irrisat cloud appspot com the equation is based solely on the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1974 and was developed by trout and johnson 2007 over fields containing different crop types such as watermelon cantaloupe peppers beans tomatoes lettuce onion garlic cotton pistachio almond and grapes the second relationship also relying on the ndvi was conducted by kamble et al 2013 over soybeans maize and grass crops providing a range of crop signatures in its derivation though the study found relationships that were separated into dryland agriculture irrigated agriculture and combined agriculture there was little difference between the derived equations for dryland and irrigated agriculture the relationship for combined agriculture was used in this study which returned an r2 value of 0 8259 as the first and second relationships solely relied on the ndvi they were subject to errors with non green vegetation trout and johnson 2007 the third relationship used in this study is the csiro modis rescaled evapotranspiration cmrset method guerschman et al 2009 the cmrset method uses a rescaled enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 in addition to using the residual moisture index rmi guerschman et al 2009 based on the evi and global vegetation moisture index gvmi ceccato et al 2002 though multiple model variations were presented by guerschman et al 2009 only the 2b model variant table 3 was tested as this provided the best results over australia additionally the method described by guerschman et al 2009 accounted for intercepted water evaporation when combining with e t o via eq 4 4 aet k c et o k ei p where aet is the actual evapotranspiration mm month e t o is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm month k c is the crop coefficient k ei is a fraction of a k ei max term set at 0 229 that is scaled by the rescaled evi evi r that quantifies evaporation from the leaf surface and p is the precipitation mm month given the large extent of the study sites it is unlikely that clouds will cover the site for an entire month in a case where this occurs irrigation is assumed to be zero as this would generally occur during the winter months during times of higher rain and lower pet in circumstances where a low or negative ndvi resulted in negative irrigation application the irrigation value was set to zero 3 2 drought index drought effects were assessed with a standardised precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 wmo 2012 and the evaporative stress index esi anderson et al 2011 2007 they were used to identify droughts and associated vegetation stress conditions and see how varying lengths of drought may relate to water allocations and the accuracy in the proposed study method simultaneously years with 40 allocation were considered as drought affected based on historic allocation years for the sites assessed in this paper appendix table 1a this is used as a policy proxy for drought classification allowing the performance of the proposed model to be assessed in dry periods this is used to filter years when drought is occurring to see how the lack of water may affect the irrigation estimation results a different allocation threshold value may need to be selected for different locations the spi shows how many standard deviations the rainfall lies from the long term average which changes depending on the length of time assessed in calculation the lengths calculated in this study range from a minimum of 3 months to a maximum of 5 years longer durations indicate drought impacts on slow moving hydrology fluxes such as groundwater and storage levels mishra and singh 2010 the spi for this study is calculated via the spi generator program available at https drought unl edu droughtmonitoring spi spiprogram aspx input is from a silo grid cell s daily rainfall time series from 1 january 1900 to 31 december 2018 from the midpoint of each iio for the input an spi value below 0 indicates dry conditions with values below 1 indicates a drought with lower values indicating even drier conditions wmo 2012 in addition to the spi the evaporative stress index esi anderson et al 2011 2007 was also used for analysis the esi shows vegetation stress due to a reduced et based on a ratio of aet to pet based on satellite assisted energy balance modelling the esi product was downloaded from climateserv on a 5 km grid available at https climateserv servirglobal net the length used for this study is 12 weeks the longest time length available from climateserv the system outputs esi values from 1 january 2009 to present in a similar manner to the spi the esi shows drier conditions with a negative value anderson et al 2011 compared the esi with precipitation based drought indices and found that they perform similarly up to 6 month lead times cooley et al 2019 the esi can be used for identifying rapid onset of flash droughts otkin et al 2013 2014 and has recently been tested in australia using pet and aet values from a land surface model rather than remote sensing values nguyen et al 2019 3 3 model performance metrics the comparisons for all of the sites used in this study are performed over both monthly and yearly time steps the simulated irrigation depths and metered values are compared using a root mean square error rmse this is calculated via eq 5 5 rmse t 1 t y t y t 2 t where rmse is the root mean square error mm y t is the estimated monthly irrigation depth for each month mm based on the model described in this paper y t is the metered irrigation depth for each month mm and t is the number of months that are compared this is performed for both monthly and yearly irrigation additionally a ratio of the estimated irrigation to the actual irrigation is calculated with a value of 1 showing a correctly simulated irrigation on average values below 1 are underestimations and above 1 are overestimations only yearly values are calculated for the ratio these are found by summing the monthly values for a given water year before comparing against the cumulative metered irrigation for that year 4 results the results show the simulations of irrigation water depth for each of the et o k c combinations while also presenting how these perform when comparing results with monthly and yearly observations the results also demonstrate the impacts of removing simulation periods where iios were subject to allocations of less than 40 of their entitlements allocation percentages can be found in the appendix table 1a the western murray irrigation results are not presented with the 40 allocations removed this is due to the vast majority of users within this area holding high security licences providing reliable water allocations not being assigned allocations less than 40 the four other areas are predominately covered by general allocation licences which can often be assigned allocations below 40 particularly in drought 4 1 irrigation time series the monthly irrigation water depth time series presented in fig 4 displays the 6 combinations of k c and et o this is plotted against the irrigation depth calculated from the on farm deliveries and irrigated areas from the nsw land use maps fig 4 shows the results from using all available data with the shaded sections of the plots indicating the sections that are removed in other evaluation metrics due to the 40 water allocations filter the irrigation depth is significantly overestimated in the shaded years this provides a qualitative way to see how the low allocation years due to droughts are affecting the simulation results across all years there is an overestimation which could be attributed to the assumptions in the methodology it implies the calculated irrigation quantification is the deficit between aet and p 4 2 standardised precipitation index and evaporative stress index when the spi appendix fig 1a shows periods of sustained meteorological drought i e greater than 3 4 years the proposed method reduces in accuracy the lower long term spis can be related with the years of low allocation assignment in these iios in particular coleambally 2009 10 and murray irrigation wakool 2015 16 appendix fig 1a when the spi is calculated over 3 months to 1 year the study method is still showing acceptable results with the exception of the 3 month murray irrigation wakool spi when spis with a lead time of 3 to 5 years starts to indicate longer term drought i e less than 1 the method begins to show less accuracy additionally the two murray irrigation regions are subjected to the same water allocations although the spi can differ substantially between the two areas because of spatial patterns of rainfall the esi is presented in the appendix fig 2a the 12 week esi used for comparison with the spis shows good correlation with the 2015 16 low allocation years the esi shows a continuous downward trend over this water year however it is not substantially different to esis from other years in the simulation period although the esi takes into account more water balance fluxes e g irrigation to show vegetation stress rather than just rainfall the products available for comparison are not influenced by enough lead time to show effects on water storages i e longer term drought and hence allocations the methodology used here does not seem to be significantly impacts by stress identified with a 12 week esi if the esi was calculated based on longer lead times as was done with the spi it may show similar trends with water allocation and availability the 5 km resolution of the esi may mean individual fields within the regions may make up insignificant potions of each pixel evident from fig 2 4 3 evaluation metrics table 4 shows the rmse of each simulation performed this table can be used as a comparison between the various et o k c relationships used to simulate both monthly and yearly irrigation water depths the results of when the low allocation years 40 were filtered out are also presented the best results for each study area using all the results or the filtered results are in bold and shaded grey the time series in fig 4 shows that for the most part the irrigation depth was monitored well the model missed some irrigation peaks although this mainly occurred during the low allocation years in some months the cmrset method returned significantly inaccurate results the kamble and irrisat methods do not show significant differences when using the same et o the et o is still an important factor but the results show the remote sensing equation is the more sensitive aspect of the model table 4 the ratios of estimated irrigation to observed irrigation is presented in fig 5 the average of all compared years is presented complete data results as well as filtered results are shown when removing low allocation water years from analysis the murray irrigation sites show a significant improvement in annual irrigation estimation moving from extreme over estimation to a slight over estimation the murrumbidgee and coleambally sites improved from a slight overestimation to within 10 of the average annual irrigation the standard deviation observed in these ratios shown in error bars in fig 5 has significantly decreased when removing dry years indicating the outliers of the simulation are occurring during the drier years however the same improvements were not seen on a monthly time scale as seen in table 4 the monthly statistics in this study are not significantly affected from the removal of low allocation years in some cases we see an increase in the rmse table 4 murrumbidgee irrigation and coleambally irrigation the months in these years with already low irrigation depths have a tendency to perform better due to the lack of available water i e zero metered irrigation and zero simulated irrigation when comparing this to years of high water availability there are small errors in these low irrigation months this is seen when looking at the time series of irrigation depths fig 4 over the iios assessed and comparing the simulated and recorded values from low to high allocation years the asce et o is outperformed by the fao56 et o for all simulations in simulations over coleambally irrigation the asce et o method works well monthly although it does not compare to the fao et o method when assessing on a yearly scale the improved results returned when using the fao et o method over all iios fig 5 and table 4 may be due to land uses in the area having similar leaf conductance to the grass reference crop used in the fao et o derivation the opposite is also evident in western murray irrigation as the asce et o performs almost to the same accuracy as the fao method on monthly comparison likely due to the high percentage of taller fruit nut trees grown in the region as seen in the appendix table 2a this agrees with previously published work that shows an almond orchard irrigation is accurately monitored by using the asce et o bretreger et al 2018 2019b 5 discussion 5 1 simulations of irrigation water depth across all simulations the cmrset k c is not performing as well as the linear ndvi k c relationships irrisat and kamble fig 4 fig 5 and table 4 this was also observed in previous studies performed over farm scale sites bretreger et al 2019b the irrisat and kamble methods performed better despite the limitations of only sensing green vegetation trout and johnson 2007 the ndvi is reported to saturate when making observations with a high leaf area index lai guerschman et al 2009 or when canopy cover is reduced higher values may be observed due to soil interference huete 1988 current results indicate the ndvi is working satisfactorily for these sites beeri et al 2019 shows that when identifying a k c the ndvi gives the best results compared to other vegetation indices such as the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 visible atmospherically resistant index vari gitelson et al 2002 and the enhanced vegetation index evi jiang et al 2008 the different study sites were expected to show varying accuracy with different plant phenology being observed each of the plants observed will return differing values based on their physical characteristics for each band in the optical spectrum viña et al 2011 there is evidence of significant rain events that occur near monthly divides that causes irrigation depth to be simulated in the wrong month there was a large storm event at the end of february and start of march 2012 that caused large rainfall in southern and western sections of nsw bom 2012 the gridded rainfall used in this study agrees with this observation with relatively large precipitation values for these months as a significant portion of this rainfall occurs at the end of february the approach used in this study decreases the irrigation for february while in reality this water is transpired in march this causes errors due to a soil moisture lag time caused by a lack of a soil storage term in the methodology this is seen with simulated irrigation in february 2012 fig 4 being extremely low while actual irrigation is higher due to early month irrigation conversely the simulated irrigation for march is then overestimated as the stored moisture levels will contribute to et from the crops rather than irrigation inputs this is evident in all iios tested although some are more affected than others due to the spatial patterns of the rainfall event the inaccuracies that this introduces into the model is predominately seen on month time steps as the yearly simulations still provide a close match to recorded irrigation the implementation of a higher temporal resolution i e interpolation to daily images and more images per month i e sentinel 2 and landsat blending claverie et al 2018 may partially rectify this limitation 5 2 water allocations and drought fig 5 showed large decreases in the ratio of estimated to actual irrigation when removing the years with allocations below 40 this is used as a policy proxy to identify the impacts of drought the spi and esi are also used for evaluation of drought the removed years are occurring at particularly dry times with the 2009 10 period being the end of the millennium drought drought leads to reduced water allocations through the mdbp and hence less water extraction high flows occurred over the 2010 11 to 2013 14 period in the mdb which is a likely cause for allocations to increase grafton and wheeler 2018 although the 2015 16 period showed below average streamflow and average rainfall the rainfall mostly occurred at the end of the water year bom 2016 the previous water year was below average in both streamflow and rainfall bom 2015 leading to the start of the 2015 16 year being dry and hence being assigned low allocations the decreased accuracy when water allocations are below 40 may be due to water stress sustained meteorological drought affects water resources such as groundwater and streamflow in addition to lake and reservoir levels as hydrologic system lag times are accounted for mishra and singh 2010 hence reducing water availability used in the allocation assignment process the effect of sustained negative spis of 6 12 months and 24 months has been shown to cause hydrological droughts affecting surface water and groundwater resources respectively kubicz 2018 van oel et al 2018 the years with greater accuracy are occurring simultaneously to higher spis this is thought to be due to water availability being in surplus and hence irrigators are able to manage their crops using best practice methodologies as is assumed in this method the results show the esi is not impacting ability of the method to quantify irrigation water use this may be due to the smaller rapid onset droughts that are shown from the esi nguyen et al 2019 otkin et al 2013 2014 are not impacting water allocations additionally the esi uses remote sensing observations meaning it is indicative of all water balance features including irrigation anderson et al 2013 2011 which could potentially cause stabilised moisture conditions being observed yang et al 2018 states that the performance of the esi may be degraded in regions when the vegetation cycle is intensively managed for example agricultural settings western murray irrigation contains predominately high security water licences which generally receive a substantial allocation of their licence it is not as vulnerable to seasonal availability of water with all years assessed in this study having between 95 and 100 of their entitlement appendix table 1a the accurate irrigation simulations in this region are observed despite low spis and esis this could imply that high security licences have improved drought resilience of irrigators in the region this is as intended as historically high security licences have received in excess of 100 of allocations wheeler et al 2014 additionally the western murray irrigation network is piped rather than channelled meaning there are less losses due to seepage and evaporation during conveyance western murray irrigation ltd 2017 the unfiltered results of western murray irrigation are performing to a similar or better accuracy compared to filtered results from other sites in years with less than 40 allocations it is possible that farm managers skip or reduce plantings of annual commodities such as cotton rice or dairy this is because during drought in the mdb the price of water increases greatly compared to wetter periods meaning water is sold to users with higher value commodities dixon et al 2011 wheeler et al 2014 wittwer and griffith 2011 for example farm managers in the murrumbidgee region sold large quantities of water destined for their rice plantations to irrigators for use on perennial crops in victoria and south australia during the millennium drought kirby et al 2012 this change in agricultural land may results in remote sensing images within this study observing bare earth fields as the static land use maps do not reflect this change the iio compliance reports give approximations of the land area covered by irrigated cropping each year dry years show significantly less land being irrigated compared to wetter years in extreme cases such as 2007 08 murray irrigation had 41 of their water deliveries being used for stock and domestic purposes murray irrigation ltd 2008 this portion of water use leads to the deliveries data being potentially unreliable for our purpose as pump metre readings would not correspond with on the ground changes 5 3 water stress and remote sensing it was previously found that the ndvi had difficulty identifying stress in certain crops this stress has been explored by bretreger et al 2019b in regard to wine grapes studies have identified potential issues in other crops such as but not limited to beans spinach potatoes tomatoes and corn jones et al 2004 mastrorilli et al 2010 romero et al 2017 katsoulas et al 2016 performed a review of water stress detection in greenhouses and states the ndvi has a slow response to water stress it is postulated that these longer term droughts which lead to a water allocation reductions i e below 40 are responsible for minor stresses being experienced by crops leading to the vegetation indices not being able to simulate irrigation accurately in previous studies k c values over a cotton field in queensland shows large changes between winter and the summer growing season the average k c value in winter when crops were not actively growing returned approximately 0 2 bretreger et al 2019b the impact of these k c values is mitigated by a generally higher rainfall and less et o during the winter months these small k c values may lead to the final irrigation value being zero as the metered data shows during the dry years identified over the iios when annual commodities may be skipped individual fields are returning k c values of between 0 2 and 0 3 not presented these values occurred during a period of no low precipitation and high aet leading to potentially higher irrigation estimates as per eqs 2 and 3 5 4 future considerations an aim of this paper was to investigate the potential scaling issues that may arrive from applying the previously developed method over larger extents the results in this paper indicated the effects of simulating irrigation over larger catchment areas do not lead to significantly reduced accuracy murrumbidgee irrigation which has the largest area assessed in this study produces better results than the separated murray irrigation areas the rmses and ratios found from this study show better results than paddock scale simulations bretreger et al 2019b although the different simulation spatial scale needs to be considered this may be due to all the iios being assessed having portions of land that closely match the correct stomatal and wind resistances of the fao methods appendix table 2a the work by jalilvand et al 2019 which aims to remotely sense irrigation water use as previously discussed reports an average model performance in irrigated pixels in terms of a rmse of 12 895 mm month this study has produced a lower rmse table 4 and higher spatial resolution although performed in a different region as the aggregate irrigation volume is the only comparison figure individual land managers within the study area could have their water use over or underestimated without improved spatial disaggregation of observed irrigation data this is not able to be tested the filtered results continue to slightly overestimate the irrigation in some regions figs 4 and 5 a source of error may be due to unaccounted for increases in aet some of this error is likely from model inputs or the ndvi k c conversions another explanation would be changes in k c due to factors external to this study s methodology the changes in k c causing these overestimations could be caused by groundwater withdrawal from deep rooted crops changing the spectral signatures of the canopy in reality this would result in drawing down groundwater to supplement the aet crop growth without additional irrigation inputs this contribution is likely minimal in the study areas because of land use maps removing deep rooted vegetation from analysis although it should be considered if applying this model elsewhere additionally if crop stress can be successfully identified a water stress coefficient k s may be applied allen et al 1998 incorporating stress into simulations may results in improved results in dry years the seninel 2 satellites have an improved spectral resolution compared to landsat and has been used to assess water stressed vegetation conditions successfully west et al 2018 may improve the ability to quantify irrigation in stressed conditions the use of the catchment scale land use maps as opposed to the preliminarily tested national scale maps bretreger et al 2018 are likely responsible for most of the improvements seen as irrigated land is mapped with improved resolution the best ratios of yearly simulations improved from 1 23 and 1 56 in the preliminary study to 1 09 and 1 30 in the simulations for this paper for mulwala and wakool regions respectively fig 5 additionally the use of gridded meteorological data has helped in capturing the spatial variability over the study sites the awra et o products use a climatologically derived wind speed which is likely improving simulations bretreger and yeo 2019 córdova et al 2015 found that assuming wind speeds was not a cause of major errors in the et o unless simulating in semi arid to arid climates as this study was finally the results of this methodology are only as good as the inputs used which is somewhat alluded to above as datasets like land use maps are updated more frequently or meteorological data are improved in accuracy or spatial resolution the irrigation simulations may improve 6 conclusion the results demonstrated the potential for a moderate resolution remotely sensed image such as landsat to be used to monitor irrigation water use over catchment scales it showed that the customer deliveries published by iios in australia have the potential to be used as a validation dataset for irrigation studies from the results obtained it is evident that the irrisat and kamble methods perform better over catchment scale sites tested here the cmrset method performed poorly during simulations for this work and would not be recommended for future simulations the fao et o method outperformed the asce et o method in all scenarios this may be due to the study regions predominately being covered by crops portraying similar physical characteristics to the fao short reference crop there are some regions i e western murray irrigation with large amounts of taller fruit nut trees that provided adequate results using the asce method in this study years with less than 40 allocation were removed from analysis as a policy proxy for drought classification this led to improvements of annual irrigation simulations which was predominately linked to water stress applied to crops annual commodities being skipped with water potentially carrying a higher price on the trading market and a larger portion of the total water deliveries being used for stock and domestic purposes further developments may be made using additional satellites such as sentinel 2 to improve temporal and spatial resolution of the remote sensing images as the current method shows limitation when large precipitation events occur near a monthly divide a longer or more recent metered data record is required for this to take advantage of the relatively short operational timespan of sentinel 2 the potential for alternatives to the ndvi may be considered to look at improving simulation in drought years the current method could be used as an independent tool for monitoring and assessing water use of catchment scales with relative accuracy particularly over annual time scales with the exception of murray irrigation wakool all iios provide annual filtered ratios of within 10 of the actual irrigation over monthly time scales it will still provide an accurate tool for monitoring integrating this simple method into an established water resource model may allow for more accurate large scale assessment and management additionally it may give rise to the opportunity to model irrigation and its impacts on catchment hydrology declaration of competing interest the authors declare

results and to help make informed conclusion this includes end of season general and high security allocations for each iio and the number of properties growing each irrigated commodity within each iio for each land use map the allocations available in each catchment for both general and high security entitlements is presented in table 1a these were compiled from the publically available annual reports published online coleambally irrigation 2017 murray irrigation ltd 2017 murrumbidgee irrigation ltd 2017 western murray irrigation ltd 2017 only the most recent reference has been included the nsw government decides on allocations for different catchments based on storage levels and water forecasts the actual volume of water allocated is based on the volume of the user s entitlement as murrumbidgee irrigation and coleambally irrigation are both located within the murrumbidgee catchment shown in fig 1 they have very similar allocations western murray irrigation contains mostly high security entitlements and hence they do not report general security allocations in their annual reports all other iios contain users with mostly general security licences the plots shown in fig 1a show the spis for each of the simulated iios the graphed lengths of spi ranges are 3 and 6 months and 1 2 3 4 and 5 years the grey shaded regions of the graphs show the years with low allocations implemented in the respective region the 12 week esi is shown in the plots in fig 2a the low allocation years have been included on the graph in grey shading to indicate if low allocations correspond with low esis table 2a shows the percent of properties growing each identified irrigated commodity from the 2007 to 2013 land use maps some identifications have changed i e perennial horticulture in 2013 contains vine fruits which was separate in 2007 e g western murray irrigation sees a large decrease in percentage of vine fruits cropping in 2013 contains a large number of crops which are identified separately in the 2007 maps e g cereals pulses seasonal vegetables etc
