19090,substantial consumption and widespread contamination of the available freshwater resources necessitate a continuing search for sustainable cost effective and energy efficient technologies for reclaiming this valuable life sustaining liquid with these key advantages capacitive deionization cdi has emerged as a promising technology for the facile removal of ions or other charged species from aqueous solutions via capacitive effects or faradaic interactions and is currently being actively explored for water treatment with particular applications in water desalination and wastewater remediation over the past decade the cdi research field has progressed enormously with a constant spring up of various cell architectures assembled with either capacitive electrodes or battery

globe in the face of climate change population growth industrial development water contamination and limited availability of freshwater elimelech and phillip 2011 porada et al 2013b tang et al 2017a yin et al 2013 owing to rich resources desalination of sea or brackish water is conducive to increasing the fresh water supply beyond what is available from the hydrological cycle with advantages of low energy consumption i e enabling ion removal at room temperatures low pressures and low voltages with additional possibility of energy recovery low environmental impact i e without the use of any added chemicals or the generation of hazardous substances simple equipment structure and convenient operation capacitive deionization cdi has emerged as a promising alternative to established water desalination technologies such as reverse osmosis electrodialysis and thermal distillation especially for desalination of waters with low to medium salinity suss et al 2015 tang et al 2016a 2016b 2017b yin et al 2013 zhang et al 2018a the study of cdi dates back to the late 1960s when it was called electrochemical demineralization and the subsequent four decades saw only intermittent advances to this technology porada et al 2013b over the last two decades however an exponential increase in the academic interest in cdi technology has occurred with various cdi cell architectures constantly springing up fig 1 leading to tremendous advances in the cdi field cdi is characterized by the facile removal of charged ionic species from aqueous solutions via electrostatic or electrochemical interactions a conventional cdi cell consists of two graphite current collectors facilitating electron transfer two porous carbon electrodes for capacitive i e non faradaic ion sorption and a spacer channel enabling the feed water to be transported see fig 2 a porada et al 2013a b tang et al 2015 this cdi cell configuration is also called flow by cdi or cdi with flow between electrodes suss et al 2015 upon applying a voltage or current potential difference typically no more than 1 23 v across the two electrodes cations and anions in the spacer channel are attracted to the cathode i e negatively charged electrode and anode i e positively charged electrode respectively and electrostatically held in the electric double layers edls formed at the carbon water interface porada et al 2013b generating a stream of purified water a step called adsorption or charging following ion adsorption the electrodes can be regenerated by short circuiting the anode and cathode or reversing polarity with the trapped ions released back into the bulk solution generating a stream of concentrated water a step called desorption or discharging in this way the purified water and brine stream are produced intermittently when the feed water flows straight through electrodes rather than between the electrodes and parallel to the applied electric field direction this cell is named flow through cdi cohen et al 2011 hawks et al 2018 see fig 2c in 2006 one important improvement over conventional cdi is the inclusion of ion exchange membranes iems in front of the electrodes which is called membrane capacitive deionization mcdi fig 2b lee et al 2006 specifically a cation exchange membrane cem is placed adjacent to the cathode and an anion exchange membrane aem is placed adjacent to the anode during charging co ions are expelled from the micropores but unable to penetrate the iems and as a result stay in the macropores of the electrode since the macropores are always electrically neutral the macropores could serve as extra storage space for counterions thereby improving the ion removal performance biesheuvel et al 2011 porada et al 2013b zhao et al 2012 2013b incorporation of iems into conventional cdi is also recognized to be an effective method to increase the lifetime of electrodes via avoiding direct water scouring and alleviating particular faradaic reactions tang et al 2017a zhang et al 2018a to improve the ion removal performance for practical applications m cdi cells can be assembled in multiple pairs to construct a stack after being placed in a housing and sealed these stacks can be connected in parallel or in series with regard to fluid flow as one of the powerful advantages of cdi compared to other desalination technologies in parallel with ion desorption the energy used to charge the electrodes during desalination can be partially recovered and utilized to charge another m cdi cell operating in the ion adsorption step see fig 3 or stored in an energy storage medium such as a supercapacitor for later use alkuran et al 2008 han et al 2015 kang et al 2016 pern√≠a et al 2012 tan et al 2018 flow by cdi and mcdi are the most widely studied and utilized cell architectures in the cdi field in recent years there has been a fast proliferation of novel cdi cell architectures including inverted capacitive deionization i cdi gao et al 2015a b flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi jeon et al 2013 hybrid capacitive deionization hcdi lee et al 2014 desalination battery pasta et al 2012 cation intercalation desalination cid smith and dmello 2016 and these have introduced several unique features and new functionalities to this field flow by cdi mcdi flow through cdi i cdi and fcdi remove ions via the mechanism of non faradaic process i e electrostatic and capacitive effects the i cdi cell arises from the modification of flow by cdi through the use of an anode with net negative surface charge and a cathode with net positive surface charge fig 2d gao et al 2015a it exhibits excellent operation longevity and an inverted adsorption desorption behavior to the flow by cdi with cell charging leading to ion desorption from the edls of the electrodes and cell discharging by short circuiting the anode and cathode leading to ion adsorption gao et al 2015b oyarzun et al 2018 the fcdi cell arises from the modification of mcdi through the use of flowing electrodes made of carbon suspension instead of the fixed electrodes between current collectors and iems fig 2e fcdi enables two major benefits relative to conventional m cdi one is the continuous ion removal and the steady production of desalted water as electrode regeneration can occur as a separate process downstream of the cell choo et al 2017 rommerskirchen et al 2018 yang et al 2017a another is the capability of desalinating high salinity feed water due to the infinite ion adsorption capacity of the flow electrode achieved by continuously introducing uncharged carbon particles into the charging cell doornbusch et al 2016 jeon et al 2013 suss et al 2015 in terms of hcdi desalination battery and cid these cells remove ions via the mechanism of faradaic process i e reversible redox reactions generally the hcdi cell consists of a faradaic i e battery electrode for cation adsorption desorption and a capacitive electrode for anion adsorption desorption byles et al 2018 siekierka et al 2018 an aem could be placed adjacent to the capacitive electrode to enhance hcdi s performance fig 2f the desalination battery cell is composed of two different battery electrodes one for cation adsorption desorption and the other for anion adsorption desorption fig 2h shanbhag et al 2017 shapira et al 2018 the cid cell is constructed by employing faradaic cation intercalation materials for both electrodes with the electrodes separated by an aem fig 2g lee et al 2018a singh et al 2018 smith and dmello 2016 owing to the superior ion sorption capacity of battery electrodes compared to traditional capacitive electrodes hcdi desalination battery and cid are receiving increasing attention in recent years suss and presser 2018 the cdi research field is rapidly growing and evolving nevertheless an informative study to provide a deep understanding of cdi technologies is still missing in the literature in this work we comprehensively reviewed the recent advances and progress made in various cell architectures of cdi including flow by cdi mcdi flow through cdi i cdi fcdi hcdi desalination battery and cid current challenges associated with the development and practical applications of various cdi and the opportunities for improving the cell design are discussed future prospects on the emerging trends in various cdi cell architectures are also presented 2 cells with capacitive electrodes 2 1 flow by capacitive deionization and membrane capacitive deionization flow by capacitive deionization flow by cdi and membrane capacitive deionization mcdi are the two most common cell architectures in the use of cdi for water treatment a remarkable number of innovations have been observed with key aspects focusing on materials application operational mode cell design faradaic reactions and theoretical models 2 1 1 materials as a key component in both flow by cdi and mcdi systems the porous electrode plays a vital role in the ion removal process because its physical and chemical properties directly determine the salt adsorption capacity sac charge efficiency desalination rate and performance stability of the cell huang et al 2017c liu et al 2015 2017b oladunni et al 2018 ideal candidates for electrode materials should possess the properties of excellent electrochemical stability low cost large ion accessible specific surface area fast ion mobility within the pore network high electronic conductivity low contact resistance between the electrode and the current collector good wettability and process ability and desirable bio inertness huang et al 2017c liu et al 2015 porada et al 2013b since carbon based electrodes meet most of the above mentioned characteristics they have been widely exploited as electrodes in the m cdi units it is no exaggeration to say that the majority of effort and focus in flow by cdi and mcdi research have been put into the synthesis and development of better electrode materials so far many forms of carbon based electrode materials have been investigated including the classical materials like carbon aerogels farmer et al 1996 jung et al 2007 activated carbon chen et al 2011 zou et al 2008 activated carbon cloth gao et al 2016 activated carbon fibers el deen et al 2014a wang et al 2012 and the new materials like carbide derived carbons porada et al 2012 2013a mesoporous carbon li et al 2009b 2017b carbon nanotubes dai et al 2005 wang et al 2007 yang et al 2014 graphenes li et al 2009a liu et al 2017c wang et al 2013 carbon based composites carbon carbon composites carbon metal oxide composites carbon polymer composites and carbon polymer metal oxide composites liu et al 2015 oladunni et al 2018 among various carbons activated carbons stand out because they are usually the most cost efficient materials thereby particularly attractive for widespread commercial applications though other carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes graphenes and carbide derived carbon might possess more superior physicochemical properties and desalination performance carbon based composite materials that take advantage of the merits of carbon and other constituent materials have become popular recently for flow by cdi and mcdi electrodes due to the relatively low sac of single component carbon material the additional carbon components for the carbon carbon composites can potentially enhance the desalination performance of pristine carbon materials primarily via adjusting the intrinsic pore size distributions improving wettability providing larger ion accessible specific surface area and higher electronic conductivity liu et al 2015 2017b the carbon metal oxide composites might exhibit improved desalination performance compared with pristine carbon materials mainly attributed to the increase in specific capacitance improvement in wettability inhibition of physical adsorption of ionic species affecting the targeted ion adsorption or alteration of the surface zeta potential of the carbon electrodes to enhance the charge efficiency liu et al 2015 2017b oladunni et al 2018 some examples of metal oxides incorporated into carbon materials are tio2 kim et al 2014 liu et al 2013 yin et al 2013 mno2 li and park 2018 liu et al 2016c el deen et al 2014c zno myint et al 2014 myint and dutta 2012 ceo2 yin et al 2013 sno2 el deen et al 2014b zro2 yasin et al 2016 2017 fe2o3 yin et al 2013 and fe3o4 gu et al 2015 li et al 2016 among which mno2 and tio2 have the advantages of low cost being eco friendly and ease of anchoring into a carbon structure most recently shi et al 2018 coated manganese oxides mno x onto the vertically aligned carbon nanotubes and found that the composites are endowed with outstanding specific capacitance and exhibited a remarkable sodium ion adsorption capacity 2 fold higher than that of pristine vertically aligned carbon nanotubes as for the carbon metal oxide composites it is also important to point out that stability of the metal oxide under the applied potential and solution environment is also critical to the electrode performance for instance zno is unstable in both acidic and basic solutions liu et al 2015 the dissolution of such metal oxides will result in contamination of the purified water and a decrease in electrode s lifetime furthermore water electrolysis and other parasitic redox reactions e g reduction of dissolved oxygen oxidation of carbon and chloride ions may occur more easily when using the carbon metal oxide composite materials because the metal oxide may change the point of zero charge of the electrode to be close to the potential of the redox reactions liu et al 2015 the incorporation of polymers into carbon materials may contribute to the ion removal performance with their suitable physicochemical properties such as pseudo capacitance inclusion of oxygen and nitrogen containing functional groups or ion exchange ability liu et al 2015 2017b among polymers utilized in the carbon polymer composites polyaniline polypyrrole chitosan and ion exchange polymers are of particular interest li et al 2017a ma et al 2016a wang et al 2014 yan et al 2014 present research also focus on tuning the surface chemistry of the existing types of carbon based electrode materials gao et al 2016 wu et al 2015a the surface properties of electrode materials such as wettability hydrophilicity and surface charge have a great impact on the desalination performance surface tuned carbon based electrode materials doped with heteroatoms or grafted with functional groups enable good wettability and electrical conductivity as well as a high specific capacitance which is beneficial to improving the desalination performance zhang et al 2018d however a decrease in the adsorption sites might result from the blockage of pores by large molecules advantages always seem to be accompanied by trade offs in these kinds of surface tuned electrode materials as such there exists substantial room for stimulating research and development of high performance carbon based materials for flow by cdi and mcdi electrodes for making cdi electrodes we cannot use single carbon particles but need a film composed of such particles film electrodes for flow by cdi and mcdi cells are commonly fabricated by compressing the slurry mixture of carbon materials active material a conductive additive e g carbon black and a polymeric binder 10 mass into a sheet followed by a drying process porada et al 2013b particularly the binder plays a key role in determining the mechanical strength electrical conductivity and performance of carbon electrodes hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf are often used as the electrode binder however these binders can reduce the wettability of an electrode and some portion of the electrode surface area may not be wetted which may result in a decrease in ion adsorption capacity additionally the rigidness of and ptfe and pvdf can generate the mechanical crack at the electrode interface and then lead to loss in electrode performance asquith et al 2015 jain et al 2018 hydrophilic polymer binders such as poly vinyl alcohol pva jain et al 2018 park and choi 2010 poly vinyl acetate pvac park et al 2011a and poly arylene ether sulfone copolymers asquith et al 2015 have been reported to be good candidates for increasing the wettability of polymer bonded carbon electrodes but their swelling and degradation tendency in aqueous solution are undesirable though a great degree of crosslinking with glutaric acid is effective to solve this problem park and choi 2010 in the efforts to find a better electrode binder an organic inorganic hybrid binder i e introduction of silicate into a resin binder has been also explored in a recent study to fabricate robust activated carbon electrodes xie et al 2017 in addition to the electrode materials there are innovations in membranes for mcdi cells ahualli et al 2017 lee et al 2011 pan et al 2018 tian et al 2014 it is well known that ion adsorption capacity and charge efficiency can be increased significantly by applying a mcdi process a process combining flow by cdi with iems however the cost of the commonly utilized commercial iems remains prohibitively high for large scale applications in addition the iems are usually thick unfavorable to assembling and have high electrical resistance moreover the weak contact adhesion between the electrodes and the iems might produce a noticeable contact resistance to overcome these limitations various ion exchange polymers have been proposed to replace the iems in mcdi devices numerous studies have indicated that the cell assembled with carbon electrodes coated with a thin layer of ion exchange polymers exhibits a better desalination performance than the conventional flow by cdi cell and in some cases an improved desalination performance than the conventional mcdi cell for example liu et al 2014 fabricated a modified mcdi cell by introducing the anion exchange polymer dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride and cation exchange polymer polyethyleneimine onto the carbon nanotube electrodes and found that the modified mcdi cell exhibited a high nacl removal of 93 much higher than that of conventional flow by cdi cell 25 or the mcdi cell with commercial iems 74 the reported cation exchange polymers so far include polyethyleneimine liu et al 2014 cross linked poly vinyl alcohol with sulfosuccinic acid kim et al 2016a and poly styrene sulfonic acid co maleic acid kim et al 2016a sulfonated bromomethylated poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide lee et al 2011 poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate ahualli et al 2017 while anion exchange polymers include dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride ahualli et al 2017 liu et al 2014 aminated polysulfone kim et al 2016a cross linked quaternized poly vinyl alcohol with glutaraldehyde jain et al 2018 tian et al 2014 aminated bromomethylated poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide lee et al 2011 alternatively it is possible to directly graft the carbon electrodes with ion selective functional groups which can act as coatings similar to the iems without adding much electrical resistance qian et al 2015 yang et al 2013 generally there are two primary aims in optimizing the electrode and membrane materials enhancing desalination performance and maintaining performance stability guided by the two goals we expect that considerable efforts will continue to be dedicated to the development of new electrode and membrane materials that could provide a desirable desalination performance or performance stability among which construction of cells consisting of asymmetric porous carbon based electrodes will represent an important research direction choi et al 2018 wu et al 2015a a third goal attracting increasing interest is the selective removal of specific ions as such selection or fabrication of electrodes and membranes that permit selective removal of cations and or anions is also a critical issue in upcoming related research 2 1 2 application flow by cdi and mcdi are currently being actively explored for water treatment with particular applications in brackish water desalination and wastewater remediation compared to the dominating desalination technologies by far such as reverse osmosis and multi stage flash distillation flow by cdi and mcdi require less energy for desalination of water with a low or moderate salt content roughly below 2 g l 1 porada et al 2013b suss et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a part of the reason is that rather than extracting the majority compound water molecules from the salt solution as in reverse osmosis and multi stage flash distillation flow by cdi and mcdi remove the minority compound nacl from the feed water porada et al 2013b suss et al 2015 starting from the 1990s when the interest in cdi revived extensive studies have been carried out to improve the performance of flow by cdi and mcdi in brackish water desalination with research efforts ranging from fabrication of new electrode membrane materials ahualli et al 2017 huang et al 2017c development of new operational modes garcia quismondo et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 design of novel cell configurations bian et al 2015 kim et al 2018b mitigation or elimination of the undesired faradaic reactions choi 2014 zhang et al 2018a to use of theoretical methods for parameter optimization hawks et al 2018 tang et al 2015 flow by cdi and mcdi are not suitable for seawater desalination due to the limited salt adsorption capacity and the higher energy consumption than that of reverse osmosis for treating seawater porada et al 2013b in wastewater remediation application flow by cdi and mcdi have proven the ability to remove various types of ionic pollutants including heavy metals e g cu ii huang et al 2014 liu et al 2017a cr iii huang et al 2016 cr vi hou et al 2018 liu et al 2011 pb ii liu et al 2017c yang et al 2014 cd ii chen et al 2017d huang et al 2016 v v bao et al 2018 fe ii chen et al 2017d liu et al 2017a fe iii chen et al 2017d li et al 2010 as iii fan et al 2016 2017 as v fan et al 2016 2017 inorganic contaminants e g ca2 chen et al 2017d seo et al 2010 mg2 chen et al 2017d no3 tang et al 2015 yeo and choi 2013 f tang et al 2015 2016b br liu et al 2016a so4 2 tang et al 2017b thamilselvan et al 2018 b oh 4 avraham et al 2011 nh4 wimalasiri et al 2015 phosphate huang et al 2017a and organic contaminants e g ionizable dyes chen et al 2017c shi et al 2014 shi and zhitomirsky 2015a b and antibiotics wang et al 2018 here it should be pointed out that some of the ionic pollutants such as arsenic chromium phosphate are amphoteric ions which are a strong function of electrolyte ph values as the electrolyte ph values can fluctuate while charging m cdi cells the removal process of such ions becomes complicated meanwhile it is worth noting that some metal ions for example copper might be reduced to elemental copper and deposited on the electrodes during charging step huang et al 2014 this ion removal process is based on the mechanism of metal electroplating instead of capacitive deionization and is unfavorable to the performance stability of m cdi as electrode regeneration is difficult for both brackish water desalination and wastewater remediation concentrated streams would be more or less produced during desorption how to dispose the concentrated streams appropriately is a problem confronting flow by cdi and mcdi s applications while directly discharging the brine solution from brackish water desalination into the environment appears to be viable dealing with the concentrated solution from wastewater remediation normally requires more complex post treatment procedures among which recovery of specific ions from the concentrate solution e g recovery of sulfate via precipitation of high value minerals tang et al 2017b recovery of ammonium via air or steam stripping zhang et al 2018b and recovery of palladium via electrowinning kim et al 2017b represents an important research direction but the premise is that the concentration of the target ion should be high enough aside from the applications of brackish water desalination and wastewater remediation flow by cdi and mcdi have also been investigated as a tool towards disinfection el deen et al 2016 ge et al 2018 laxman et al 2015 pandit et al 2017 wang et al 2015a for example a high performance capacitive deionization disinfection cell was demonstrated by wang et al 2015a where the activated carbon ac electrodes were coated with a thin layer of cationic nanohybrids of graphene oxide graft quaternized chitosan go qc with inherent antimicrobial activity the go qc ac electrode could achieve ultrahigh killing i e 99 9999 6 log reduction of 106 cfu ml 1 e coli in water flowing continuously through the cell there is a recent report on the application of flow by cdi for water disinfection using commercially activated carbon cloth electrodes but most of the bacteria were not killed but only electro adsorbed on the electrodes as bacterial cells carry negative charges induced by the presence of phosphates and lipopolysaccharides laxman et al 2015 more recently pandit et al 2017 found that for both positive and negative applied potentials with a voltage window of 0 9 v there was an inverse relationship between the formation of pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm on the carbon electrodes and the magnitude of the applied potential it was believed that the relatively high potentials affected the redox potential across the cell membrane and disrupted redox homeostasis thereby inhibiting bacterial growth with a high applied voltage 1 5 v antimicrobial activity may also result from by products generated in situ e g chlorine oxidizing radicals hydrogen peroxide through the occurrence of faradaic reactions in a m cdi cell ge et al 2018 moreover flow by cdi and mcdi have been explored for selective removal of a specific ion from multi ionic solutions assuming that the initial concentrations of ion i and ion j are equal in the treated water flow by cdi and mcdi might present weak adsorption selectivity between the two ions because of their different diffusion coefficient ion charge number hydrated radius and electronegativity and the differential separation may become more evident with operating parameters appropriately adjusted dykstra et al 2016 tang et al 2017b to increase the extent of preferential ion adsorption certain improvements could be made for instance coating the carbon electrode surface with a material with high selectivity towards one specific ion su et al 2017 zuo et al 2018 or synthesizing a composite electrode by mixing carbon particles with a material with high affinity towards the ion of concern lee et al 2017a su and hatton 2017 an alternative approach to achieve preferential removal of a certain ion is utilizing an asymmetric cdi cell to selectively enable electro oxidation or electro reduction of one ion species while removing the other ion species via coulomb force this has been recently well demonstrated in the case of the selective removal and recovery of br from a mixed solution of br and cl using an asymmetric cdi cell where the applied potential is divided between the positive and negative electrodes asymmetrically cohen et al 2018 upon electro oxidation of br br2 molecules are formed and physically adsorbed on the surface of the positive electrodes when discharging the electrodes br2 molecules are reduced back to br and return to the solution as a key component in mcdi cells membrane might also play an important role in the selective ion removal if designed appropriately one specific example is that in a mcdi cell where the cem was replaced by a monovalent cation permselective exchange membrane a selective removal of monovalent and divalent cations was achieved thereby producing divalent cation rich solution the cation removal selectivity could get higher when total dissolved solids concentration decreased and ph increased choi et al 2016 in addition to the above applications solely based on cdi technologies flow by cdi and mcdi systems can be combined with other technologies synergistically to achieve various ultimate goals feng et al 2017 forrestal et al 2015 hou et al 2018 kim et al 2012a lee et al 2009 liang et al 2015 ma et al 2015 saleem et al 2018 tan et al 2018 wen et al 2014 for example by integrating a cdi system with a bioelectrochemical system a microbial capacitive desalination cell mcdc could be developed to remove organics and salts simultaneously without using any external energy see fig 4 stoll et al 2015 microbial degradation of organic compounds in the anode chamber generated an electron flow to reduce the electron acceptors in the cathode chamber taking advantage of the potential difference across the microbial anode and the air cathode ions in the desalination chamber were electrically adsorbed in the edls of porous carbon electrodes furthermore the mcdc allowed for the free transfer of protons from the anode chamber throughout the reactor and thus prevented significant ph changes a second example is combination of constant current operated flow by cdi system with reverse osmosis ro for the production of high quality ultrapure water and freshwater from seawater minhas et al 2014 a third example is combination of mcdi system with ion exchange ie process for nitrogen recovery from low strength wastewater wang et al 2017 mcdi acted as a pretreatment to preferentially remove the coexisting ca2 and mg2 thereby eliminating the negative effects of ca2 and mg2 on the subsequent ie ammonium recovery process with an eye towards the future we believe that more application potentials of flow by cdi and mcdi will be discovered this is evidenced by the very recent work of legrand et al 2018 who used mcdi cells to capture co2 in the form of bicarbonate and carbonate ions produced from the reaction of co2 with water moreover towards the applications of water desalination and wastewater remediation research involving studying the short term or long term influence of co occurrence of inorganic compounds and natural organic matter in real waters on the performance of flow by cdi and mcdi as well as the effective post operational cleaning methods will be a significant part of future efforts 2 1 3 operational mode generally there are two kinds of designs for the flow by cdi and mcdi studies with regard to fluid flow batch mode and single pass mode batch mode refers to a configuration whereby water is fed from a small container and the effluent of the cdi cells is returned to the feeding reservoir where water conductivity is measured the recycling reservoir should be small enough so that the change in the conductivity is distinguishable and can be measured accurately during adsorption the measured conductivity steadily decreases until it levels off at a low value indicating saturation of the electrodes porada et al 2013b salamat and hidrovo 2018 in contrast single pass mode refers to a configuration whereby water is fed from a large storage container and the effluent water leaving the cdi cells is either discarded or recycled to the feeding reservoir the conductivity of the treated water is measured directly at the exit of the cdi unit the volume of feeding reservoir should be large enough to ensure that the influent conductivity only changes slightly during successive cycles when both dilute and concentrated streams return to the feeding reservoir during adsorption the measured effluent conductivity will decrease rapidly and reach a minimum value upon applying a fixed charging voltage followed by a gradual increase to the inlet value porada et al 2013b although batch mode is simpler than single pass mode single pass operation is more common and efficient for practical situations because the treated water only passes through the cdi device once instead of being recycled many times to calculate ion removal efficiency and equilibrium adsorption capacity by flow by cdi and mcdi cells one needs to measure the effluent ion concentration with time for single electrolyte the ion concentration could be determined from the conductivity of the solution for mixtures of electrolytes water samples need to be collected at appropriate intervals and the ion concentrations then analyzed using analytical methods such as ion chromatography in addition there are commonly two kinds of charging modes for the adsorption step constant voltage and constant current and three kinds of discharging modes for the desorption step zero volt reverse voltage and reverse current porada et al 2013b among them constant voltage adsorption combined with zero volt desorption cv zvd is the most common and classical option while constant current adsorption combined with zero volt desorption cc zvd or reverse current desorption cc rcd is also a good alternative for flow by cdi and mcdi cells applying different operational modes for adsorption desorption cycle may result in different desalination performance one important choice that must be made is whether operation should be at constant voltage cv or constant current cc there are various criteria for determining this choice such as the desire for a constant effluent ion concentration or a low energy consumption from the perspective of effluent ion concentration cc mode is more favorable than cv mode because in contrast to the marked change in the outflow concentration at cv mode a stable and adjustable effluent ion concentration can be obtained at cc mode from the perspective of energy consumption in literature it is often reported that cc mode is both experimentally and theoretically superior to cv mode han et al 2015 kang et al 2014 qu et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 2013b main argument in support of this claim is that in cc operation the endpoint voltage is reached only at the end of the charging step hence accompanying with an overall lower cell voltage however recently three different voices arose based on both experimental assessment and theoretical analysis wang and lin 2018 suggested that whether cc or cv charging is more efficient for a given mcdi system is largely dependent on the target adsorption to be achieved and to a less extent on the kinetic rate of charging dykstra et al 2018 found that without energy recovery there is no difference in energy consumption between cc and cv operation if 50 of the energy released during discharge could be recovered cc has a somewhat lower energy consumption than cv by fourier transforming both cc and cv signals ramachandran et al 2018 found that cc is more energy efficient while charge efficiency is high but at high salt concentrations cv will be more energy efficient in regard of the desorption step it is worth mentioning that the reverse voltage approach is not feasible in flow by cdi because the ions released from one electrode can get quickly re adsorbed into the other electrode before they exit the cells whereas it is possible to operate at reversed voltage in mcdi as the ions released from one electrode cannot move into the other electrode because of the iems biesheuvel et al 2011 salamat and hidrovo 2018 zhao et al 2012 to date effort although not much has been directed towards developing new operational modes with regard to both fluid flow and power aspects of the charging and discharging modes to improve the performance e g average concentration reduction water recovery and energy consumption of m cdi technologies and some advances have been made gao et al 2017 garcia quismondo et al 2013 kim et al 2015 lu et al 2017 ramachandran et al 2018 saleem et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 2018c with respect to fluid flow garcia quismondo et al 2016 and hassanvand et al 2017 examined the use of a new operational procedure that utilizes a brine stream which is more concentrated than the feed solution to regenerate the m cdi unit during desorption and found that this significantly increased the energy efficiency and or water recovery with respect to power aspects gao et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018c demonstrated that using alternating polarization i e reversing electrode polarity every charging step could effectively enhance the cycling stability of flow by cdi systems kim et al 2015 described a new discharging modes for the desorption step that is applying a discharging voltage lower than the charging voltage but with the same polarity whereby the charge efficiency of a flow by cdi cycle could be increased to values close to unity and the energy consumption could be reduced with only a small loss of salt adsorption capacity further ramachandran et al 2018 developed a sinusoidal voltage current operation for flow by cdi as an efficient method and identified a system inherent resonant frequency that enables maximum concentration reduction as shown in fig 5 2 1 4 cell design besides synthesis of new electrode or membrane materials with improved physico chemical properties and development of new effective operational modes coming up with novel and superior cell designs based on fundamental structures of flow by cdi and mcdi is also conducive to enhancing the desalination performance as mentioned previously in mcdi the incorporation of iems leads to a remarkable improvement in the flow by cdi cell s desalination rate salt removal efficiency and charge efficiency a further enhancement of the desalination performance has been confirmed to be attainable via constructing new designs of mcdi cell considering that the resistance of mcdi is mainly located in the spacer compartment liang et al 2013 revealed that by packing the mcdi cell s flow chamber with ion exchange resin granules the modified mcdi delivered higher desalination rates salt removal efficiency and charge efficiency than the regular mcdi electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis showed that the packing of ion exchange resin granules greatly reduced the ohmic resistance of mcdi and as a result facilitated the ion transport across the flow channel and accordingly enhanced the desalination rate in the subsequent work conducted by the same research group bian et al 2015 2016 it was found that the commercially available and inexpensive granular activated carbon particles and the activated carbon fibers exhibited similar enhancements effects when employed as the mcdi s separator packing material following this line of thinking more promising alternative to the ion exchange resin granules are expected to turn up in future research recently kim et al 2017a presented a novel multichannel mcdi mc mcdi system by introducing two side channels surrounding the carbon electrodes while a conventional mcdi channel i e middle channel is located between an aem and a cem as schematically shown in fig 6 at a high salinity gradient between side 1000 mm and middle 5 mm channels this mc mcdi cell configuration exhibited an excellent salt adsorption capacity sac of 56 mg g 1 in the middle channel which was nearly four times larger than the maximum sac achievable in a conventional cdi cell though desalination occurred in the opposite direction of the concentration gradient meanwhile the sac was accomplished with a high charge efficiency close to unity and a low energy consumption the performance enhancement stemmed from the enhanced capacitance at high molar strength in the side channels and the double ion removal process during cell voltage inversion following this work kim et al 2018a explored and proved the feasibility of the mc mcdi cell in semi continuous production of clean water with the separated middle and side channels resulting in alternating desalination and regeneration most recently kim et al 2018b further modified the mc mcdi cell with one side channel filled with a highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte 1 m nacl in h2o and the other with a highly concentrated organic electrolyte 1 m naclo4 in propylene carbonate the novel mc mcdi cell using an aqueous organic bi electrolyte allowed extension of the cell voltage to 2 4 v and thus provided a superior sac of 63 5 4 mg g 1 in the middle channel with charge efficiency of 95 future work may capitalize on the use of alternative electrolytes e g acetonitrile or alternative electrode material e g intercalation type material 2 1 5 faradaic reactions whilst non faradaic processes such as capacitive ion storage and ion transport are at the heart of the cdi phenomenon it is recognized that faradaic reactions i e redox reactions occurring on the surface of and within the carbon electrodes also play important roles in the flow by cdi and mcdi systems on the one hand as one of the two main sources of energy losses resistive and parasitic losses in m cdi fig 7 hemmatifar et al 2016 faradaic reactions result in a decrease in energy efficiency since parasitic current generated by reduction or oxidation processes at the electrodes is not effective in adsorbing ions these redox reactions may also contribute to ph fluctuations in the effluent and deterioration of electrode stability and performance bouhadana et al 2011 choi 2014 cohen et al 2013 2015 shapira et al 2016 tang et al 2017a yu et al 2018 on the other hand the in situ formed reactive species such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and or free chlorine might be positively used in combination with ultraviolet irradiation or ozone for water disinfection and or degradation of organic contaminants he et al 2016 kim et al 2016c tang et al 2017a zhang et al 2018a there are two major types of faradaic reactions existing in the flow by cdi and mcdi systems namely i anodic reactions associated with oxidation of the carbon electrode chloride ions water etc ii cathodic reactions involving dissolved oxygen do reduction and other particular ions carbon oxidation refers to the phenomenon that the carbon anode sacrificially takes part in oxidation processes with the carbon converted into functional groups containing co and carbon dioxide zhang et al 2018a of all the anodic faradaic reactions carbon oxidation is the most important and attracts the most attention considering the high likeliness of its occurrence when the flow by cdi or mcdi cell is operated routinely the redox potential for carbon oxidation is 0 207 v she oh et al 2008 and the induced negative effects that may accrue such as pore structure impairment and mass loss with subsequent decrease in carbon electrode longevity and deterioration of cdi performance zhang et al 2018a long term flow by cdi experiments have been conducted by cohen et al 2013 18 days and omosebi et al 2014 50 h both of which showed reduction of the salt adsorption capacity caused by parasitic faradaic reactions strategies to evaluate the anodic oxidation of carbon electrodes include x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray mapping fourier transform infrared spectroscopy acid base titration and cyclic voltammetry cohen et al 2013 zhang et al 2018a among which xps method is quite effective in detecting the variation in oxygen functional groups reflected by o 1s spectrum and the loss of carbon reflected by c 1s spectrum from the electrodes after continuous charging discharging cycles to mitigate and or eliminate the anodic carbon oxidation a few approaches can be utilized including synthesis of oxidation resistant materials e g titania decorated carbon electrodes srimuk et al 2016 2017c employing novel cell architectures e g inverted capacitive deionization gao et al 2015a b and applying appropriate operational modes e g constant current charging and periodic polarity reversal dykstra et al 2018 gao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018c in addition to the anodic carbon oxidation anodic oxidation of chloride ions cl and water might occur during brackish water treatment on condition that the anode potentials of flow by cdi and mcdi cells are sufficiently positive to drive these redox reactions free chlorine cl2 could be generated through the direct oxidation of cl at the anode standard electrode potential e 0 1 36 v she followed by a hydrolysis reaction to form hypochlorous acid hclo hclo and its deprotonated form clo might be further oxidized to chlorate clo3 at the anode zhang et al 2018a under a higher standard electrode potential of 1 45 v she the direct oxidation of cl to clo3 may occur zhang et al 2018a in any cases cl at the surface of the anode rather than free cl in solution is supposed to be the main contributor to the generation of clo3 and this has been confirmed by the studies of lado et al 2013 and wouters et al 2013 who showed that the production rate of clo3 in the flow by cdi system increased with greater abundance of cl in the vicinity of the anode during adsorption in terms of anodic oxidation of water it occurs at a standard electrode potential of 1 23 v she and this is the reason why the m cdi process is generally operated at charging voltages below 1 23 v however in fact the potential difference across the cell might exceed the 1 23 v threshold to compensate for the circuit system resistance and hence no water electrolysis happens in these cases tang et al 2015 2016a 2017b lastly as a beneficial effect anodic oxidation reactions may contribute to the removal of certain organic compounds e g phenol and humic substances duan et al 2015 liu et al 2016a and inorganic pollutants e g arsenic iii and bromide ion cohen et al 2018 fan et al 2016 2017 lee et al 2016 from water through a combination of faradaic and non faradaic processes among the reduction reactions that take place at the cathode dissolved oxygen do reduction is the most common as do is prevalent in feed waters to cdi cells our recent batch mode cdi studies have revealed that significant concentrations of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 could be produced during charging in flow by cdi cells with the generation of h2o2 initiated by cathodic reduction of do with subsequent consumption occurring as a result of anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction of h2o2 and the reaction rate constants increase with an increase in charging voltage 0 5 1 5 v he et al 2016 tang et al 2017a kim et al 2016c and yu et al 2018 also reported the cathodic generation of h2o2 during a single pass flow by cdi operation an almost constant h2o2 concentration in the effluent was observed throughout the entire charging step and the h2o2 generation could provide one of explanations to the ph fluctuations fig 8 a schematically displayed all the faradaic reactions that may occur in the flow by cdi cell during charging including both cathodic reduction of do and anodic oxidation of carbon electrode and water in the absence of the occurrence of electrolyte mediated redox processes in contrast to the significant amount of h2o2 in flow by cdi cells almost no h2o2 was generated in mcdi cells with h2o2 concentrations relatively time invariant and typically 2 Œºm during charging and discharging as indicated in fig 8b tang et al 2017a owing to the attachment of iems to the surfaces of the carbon electrodes accessibility of oxygen to the electrodes is limited in the mcdi case with the resultant inhibition of the occurrence of do reduction reaction responsible for significant reduction in quantity of h2o2 produced in this system incorporation of the membranes to act as a barrier to limit do access to the electrode was also reported by omosebi et al 2014 who found more distinct perturbation of do in flow by cdi than mcdi during cell operation the findings arising from these studies raise the need to re examine the potential applications of flow by cdi and mcdi cells for example despite the poorer salt removal capacity and lower charge efficiency flow by cdi might be a better choice than mcdi when treating source waters containing microorganisms and or trace organic contaminants if the in situ formed h2o2 could be effectively used as a disinfectant and or used to produce more powerful oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals apart from do reduction cathodic reduction reactions may also play an important role in the sequestration of heavy metals e g cd ii v v from water as a result of the possible deposition of the metals at the electrode bao et al 2018 huang et al 2014 2016 liu et al 2011 yang et al 2014 faradaic reactions in flow by cdi and mcdi systems are attracting increasing attention from the academic and industrial world despite the achievements presented many questions remain with additional studies required to further improve the mechanistic understanding of faradaic reactions with the goal of effectively mitigating the negative effects of these processes whilst taking advantage of their positive effects 2 1 6 theoretical model while m cdi clearly has many attractions it is a sophisticated technology requiring careful selection of design and operating parameters for particular source waters laboratory or field based investigation of the effect of each parameter on m cdi performance is difficult in view of the difficulty in manipulating some parameters and the interconnectivity of others as such quantitative evaluation of the effect of particular parameters or design options is best achieved by developing theoretical models of key non faradaic and potentially faradaic processes tang et al 2016b apart from enabling optimization of both design and operating parameters the theoretical model also serves as a useful and essential tool to reveal the underlying causes of phenomena help to gain thorough understanding of the ion removal process and predict m cdi performance in all its facets including effluent ion concentration water recovery energy consumption average salt adsorption rate ion adsorption capacity ph fluctuations and so on biesheuvel et al 2015 hemmatifar et al 2017 kim et al 2015 porada et al 2013a tang et al 2015 2016a 2016b to describe ion storage in edls an appropriate edl structure model has to be established first basically the edl model describes that across the carbon electrolyte interface in the pores inside the carbon particles the surface electrical charge in the carbon matrix is directly charge compensated by counterions in the electrolyte porada et al 2013b initial well known edl structure models include the helmholtz model and the gouy chapman stern gcs model however neither of the two models properly captures the edls structure along typical cdi electrodes pore walls the helmholtz model assumes that counterions are all condensed in a plane right next to the carbon surface and necessitates a charge efficiency of unity but in fact the counterions remain diffusively distributed in a layer close to the surface and the charge efficiency of a m cdi cell is always below unity porada et al 2013b the gcs model assumes that the diffuse layer extending from one surface is not overlapping with that of a nearby surface nevertheless in standard microporous m cdi electrodes the pores where ions are primarily adsorbed pore diameter 2 nm are much smaller than the edl thickness and hence the edls are strongly overlapped porada et al 2013b suss et al 2015 a new edl structure model termed modified donnan md model was developed in 2011 by biesheuvel et al 2011 to tackle the situation of fully overlapped edls the md model assumes that edls lining the micropore walls are strongly overlapped thereby leading to a relatively constant value of diffuse layer potential and ion concentration across the pore radius the use of modified referred to two modifications of the classical donnan approach one by including a stern layer in between the carbon matrix and the diffuse layer and the other by considering a non electrostatic attraction physi or chemisorption term for the ions transporting into the micropores in the absence of electronic charge porada et al 2013b suss et al 2015 a further improvement can be made to the md model when the salt concentration is higher than 40 mm that is making the non electrostatic attraction inversely dependent on the total micropore ion concentration biesheuvel et al 2014 kim et al 2015 the md model can be easily included in the porous electrode mass transport theory to relate the local potential drop across the edls to the local ion flux into the edls the interplay between micro and macro scale transport mechanisms in the porous electrodes and bulk flow of a cdi unit dictates the ion concentration profile at the exit for batch mode operation a one dimensional transport model has been shown to work well in describing data sets for ion adsorption and charge storage in flow by cdi cells as it can be assumed that at every moment in time the specific ion concentration within the electrode macropores is equal to that in the spacer channel pipes and recycling reservoir porada et al 2013b tang et al 2015 for single pass operation a two dimensional transport model is required to quantify the dynamic ion electrosorption process hemmatifar et al 2015 tang et al 2016a b zhao et al 2013b in the water flow direction the spacer channel needs to be divided into a certain number m of annular ideally stirred volumes or sub cells in series with equal projected area under a constant current charging the electrodes should be discretized into m sequential sub cells in the same manner as shown in fig 9 in each of the m sub cells the current i i has the same value in the spacer channel in the membrane and in the electrode but this value differs between sub cells and changes in time according to previous studies the two dimensional transport model turns out to be a good approach in capturing the ion adsorption desorption dynamics and predicting cdi performance over a range of operating conditions cell arrangements and feed water compositions not only for a monovalent salt e g nacl solution but also for simple ionic mixtures tang et al 2016a b for example tang et al 2016a investigated fluoride removal from brackish groundwaters by single pass constant current flow by cdi and found that the developed relevant two dimensional transport model provided a satisfactory reproduction of the effluent fluoride concentrations as a function of fluoride chloride feed concentrations adsorption current and pump flow rate as shown in fig 10 although the flow by cdi device used in the work of tang et al 2016a did not lower fluoride below the maximum permissible water quality levels the studies described there enabled validation of a model that could subsequently be used to determine possible system configurations and operating conditions for realization of the target for classical cdi with unmodified electrodes the ionic charge density in the edls of micropores exactly compensates the electronic charge in the carbon matrix and the md model is applicable to this case however for chemically modified electrodes modification to the md model is necessary biesheuvel et al 2015 extended the md model by including an immobile chemical charge in the charge balance regarding flow by cdi cells with fixed chemical charges within the micropores and showed that the theory was able to capture and explain a variety of key features observed in experiments including inverted operation inversion peaks and enhanced performance based on the work of biesheuvel et al 2015 he et al 2018b further incorporated the effect of variable chemical charges due to faradaic reactions of redox active species immobilized on the electrode surfaces with respect to electrode micropores containing acidic and basic surface groups that can protonate or deprotonate based on their individual equilibrium constants and the micropore and electrolyte ph environments hemmatifar et al 2017 coupled the md model with the weak electrolyte acid base equilibria theory with results demonstrating an excellent agreement between experiments and the new model different from typical flow by cdi cells where fluid flow and electric field are perpendicular generally necessitating a two dimensional model approach the flow through cdi cell is a cell design that can be well described by a one dimensional model as the feed water flows straight through electrodes and parallel to the applied electric field direction up to now a few models have been successfully developed to describe the ion adsorption desorption dynamics and variation in electrical current in flow through cdi cells and has shown the value of modelling in elaborating the phenomena occurring in various scenarios which would otherwise be difficult to elucidate in any detail guyes et al 2017a hawks et al 2018 qu et al 2018 ongoing research and efforts might make it come true to model other features important to flow through cdi cells such as the effluent ph variations and the effects of chemical surface charge in porous electrodes owing to the existence of iems modelling the ion transport and storage in mcdi cells is more complicated than that in flow by cdi cells at the two membrane solution interfaces there exists donnan equilibrium both on the edge of the membrane with the spacer channel and on the edge of the membrane with the macropores in the electrode within the iems fixed charged groups are present with a high charge density x during transport across the membrane both co ion concentration and counterion concentration gradually change but their difference remains equal to x due to electroneutrality in the membrane galama et al 2013 by making some simplifications for example excluding transport of protons or hydroxyl ions assuming perfect symmetry in the cell taking the same diffusion coefficient for the cation and anion in the membrane neglecting accumulation of ions in the membrane setting zero water flow through the membrane mathematical models for the mcdi processes based on a fully dissociated monovalent salt solution like nacl could be established these mcdi processes include desalination dynamics and performance over a wide range of possible design and operational scenarios suss et al 2015 zhao et al 2013b though the mcdi community has covered some distance towards the ultimate goal of developing a robust model that confidently describes and predicts all possible data sets the mcdi modelling is still in its infancy many questions remain with additional studies required to further improve our understanding of this technology for example the conditions examined in literature are a highly simplified subset of those likely to be experienced in treating real waters where a greater range of ph a more extensive mixtures of ions and the presence of electrode fouling agents such as natural organic matter are to be expected transport modelling for mixtures of multiple ions in mcdi is still at an initial stage no papers exist that describe the effects of membrane thickness or membrane charge density on the ion selective electrosorption 2 2 flow through capacitive deionization with some modifications of a flow by cdi cell a cell named flow through cdi could be developed in which the feed water flows straight through electrodes rather than between the electrodes and parallel to the applied electric field direction cohen et al 2011 guyes et al 2017a 2017b hawks et al 2018 qu et al 2018 the earliest work on flow through cdi dates back to 1970 and was explored by johnson et al 1970 the following four decades saw little progress to flow through cdi until avraham et al 2009 utilized flow through electrodes in a three electrode cell to attempt to improve the charge efficiency one main advantage of flow through cdi over flow by cdi is that since the separator does not act as a major channel for fluid flow the separator thickness in the flow through cdi may be minimized from typically 200 500 Œºm to around 10 Œºm provided that no short circuit happens thereby allowing for more compact cells improved desalination rates and a higher reduction in salt concentration of the feed per unit of charge cohen et al 2015 guyes et al 2017b suss et al 2012 however flow through cdi cells suffer from greater feed pressures than flow by cdi cells for the same throughput in order to enable flowing through the electrodes at reasonable feed pressures flow through cdi cells generally require use of specialized electrode materials possessing relatively large macropores with diameters above 1 Œºm for example suss et al 2012 used hierarchical carbon aerogel monolith electrodes with macropore diameters of approximately 1 Œºm while cohen et al 2011 used activated carbon fiber electrodes with 100 Œºm gaps between fibers as the flow channels in addition to the reduced feed pressures it has to be noted that the electrodes should also possess nanometer scale micropores enabling high salt adsorption the requirement of both large macropores and small micropores seems to significantly limit the range of electrode materials suitable for flow through operation however a recent work by guyes et al 2017b has demonstrated that applying laser technique to perforate an array of channels with roughly 200 Œºm aperture diameters through the commercial cdi activated carbon electrodes could contribute to orders of magnitude improvement in the electrode hydraulic permeability without adverse influence on the electrodes salt adsorption capacity or gravimetric capacitance which implies that those electrode materials with high microporosity that are commonly employed in the flow by cdi cells are likely to be tuned into attractive choices for flow through electrodes another potential drawback of flow through cdi cells is that oxidation of the positive electrodes occurs at a faster rate in flow through cdi systems relative to flow by cdi systems though nitrogen sparging to eliminate dissolved oxygen in the feed water has been shown to extend the stability of flow through cdi cells to a level comparable to flow by cdi cells cohen et al 2015 guyes et al 2017a 2017b and surface chemical treatments of carbon electrodes has been shown to enhance the charge efficiency in flow through cdi processes cohen et al 2011 2 3 inverted capacitive deionization unsustainable cdi performance mainly loss of salt separation has been observed during cdi cycling operation under a constant voltage charging mode bouhadana et al 2011 cohen et al 2013 this performance degradation is primarily attributed to the formation of oxide e g carboxylic groups layers at the carbon surface via oxidation of the anode in an aqueous solution these oxides lead to changes in the surface charge states including point of zero charge phpzc and potential of zero charge e pzc cohen et al 2013 shapira et al 2016 in order to sustain desalination performance a novel cdi cell architecture termed inverted capacitive deionization i cdi was proposed by the research group of gao et al 2015b in 2015 the i cdi system involves the use of an anode with net negative surface charge and a cathode with net positive surface charge and consequently shows a completely opposite adsorption desorption behavior to the conventional cdi system with cell charging leading to ion desorption from the edls of the electrodes and cell discharging by short circuiting the anode and cathode leading to ion adsorption fig 11 a and b oyarzun et al 2018 gao et al 2015b demonstrated the i cdi concept via the use of pristine carbon xerogel with net positive surface charge as the cathode and modified carbon xerogel with net negative surface charge containing carboxylic groups and oxidized silicon as the anode a significant enhancement in the performance stability and an increase of 530 in lifetime were observed in the i cdi system compared to a conventional cdi system operated under similar conditions due to the mitigation of carbon oxidation at the anode in a more recent work gao et al 2015a constructed an i cdi cell using an amine treated cathode with nh3 groups providing net positive surface charge and an acid treated anode with coo groups providing net negative surface charge in comparison to the previous i cdi cell where a salt removal capacity of 1 7 mg g 1 was achieved at a maximum working voltage of 0 8 0 v this i cdi cell could offer a salt removal capacity of 5 3 mg g 1 at a maximum working voltage of 1 1 0 v representing a significant improvement with regard to both salt removal capacity and working voltage window wu et al 2016 further assembled an i cdi cell equipped with a quaternized poly 4 vinylpyridine modified activated carbon cathode and a nitric acid treated activated carbon anode and the cell exhibited excellent i cdi performance the working voltage window of the i cdi cell could reach 1 4 v and its salt removal capacity could be as high as 9 6 mg g 1 instead of synthesizing new carbon electrodes to expand the working voltage window gao et al 2018 developed a novel i cdi operational mode to improve the desalination performance in the conventional i cdi operational mode i e v charge 0 8 v and v discharge 0 v 0 8 0 v the i cdi cell exhibited a salt adsorption capacity sac of 6 0 0 8 mg g 1 with a stable salt separation lasting approximately 409 h in the novel i cdi operational mode 0 4 0 4 v it was found that not only was the separation process stabilized up to approximately 420 h but the sac also increased to 7 2 0 3 mg g 1 furthermore more stable ph and dissolved oxygen do responses were observed at 0 4 0 4 v compared to 0 8 0 v a reasonable explanation for such an improved performance was that the reduced v charge mitigated carbon oxidation at the anode and do reduction at the cathode while the reduced v discharge compensated for sac gao et al 2018 most recently oyarzun et al 2018 presented an i cdi cell for nitrate removal with the cell fabricated with an activated carbon cathode modified by cetrimonium bromide and an activated carbon anode modified by sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate it turned out that a successful nitrate removal up to more than 10 mg nano3 per g of both electrodes was achieved with this i cdi system suggesting that functionalized i cdi systems might have great potential for ionic pollutant removal inverted cdi features excellent operation longevity but lacks substantial salt removal capacity which is mainly limited by its relatively small working voltage window the i cdi working voltage window is regulated by the difference between e pzc of anode and e pzc of cathode as shown in fig 11c therefore optimizing the e pzc of electrodes specifically the anode needs a more positive e pzc whereas the cathode requires a more negative e pzc to enlarge the working voltage window of i cdi is of great importance generally introduction of negatively charged functional groups can shift e pzc to a more positive value while introduction of positively charged functional groups shifts e pzc to a more negative value wu et al 2016 in i cdi systems oxidation of the anode is not regarded as an adverse effect as is the case in conventional cdi systems in fact oxygen containing functional groups formed during carbon oxidation increase the net negative surface charge and shift e pzc of the anode to a more positive value thereby favorably contributing to the expansion of the intrinsic working voltage window however it is worth mentioning here that the continued formation of oxide layers at the surface of anode might result in an increase in the resistance of the anode whereby this layer eventually suppresses ionic storage in the i cdi cell causing performance degradation gao et al 2018 2 4 flow electrode capacitive deionization for conventional m cdi cells salt removal capacity is largely constrained by the fixed electrodes making conventional m cdi only suitable for treating brackish low salinity water in addition preparation of the fixed electrodes is kind of complicated and approximately 20 of the fabricated electrodes is made up of conductive agents e g carbon black and polymer binder e g polytetrafluoroethylene that have negligible ion adsorption capacity apart from adding dead mass the presence of polymer binder may also block a large amount of pore volume of the active carbon particles suss et al 2015 moreover conventional m cdi systems operate in an intermittent manner with a deionization period freshwater produced followed by a regeneration period wastewater produced in view of these limitations of conventional m cdi systems jeon et al 2013 pioneered the use of flowing electrodes and designed an innovative cdi cell architecture termed flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi to improve the performance of m cdi as shown in figs 2e and 12a typical fcdi cell geometry is similar to that of mcdi except for the electrode part in contrast to mcdi using the fixed electrode between current collectors and iems fcdi employs the aqueous suspensions of carbon particles flowing through a serpentine channel carved on the current collector when an electrical voltage is applied between the two current collectors of an fcdi cell ions present in the feed water would migrate through iems and enter the flow electrode where they would be eventually adsorbed on the suspended carbon material or dissolved in the aqueous phase of the flow electrodes with cations concentrated in the cathode chamber and anions concentrated in the anode chamber jeon et al 2013 moreno and hatzell 2018 nativ et al 2017 yang et al 2017b representative of an electrodialytical desalination mechanism the proportion of ions accumulated in the aqueous phase of the flow electrodes increases with intensified faradaic reactions producing h anode chamber and oh cathode chamber ma et al 2018 nativ et al 2017 on the basis of continuous inflow of fresh carbon electrodes fcdi exhibits an excellent desalting efficiency in a high concentration nacl solution attributed to the infinite ion adsorption capacity of the flow electrode as compared to the limited capacity of the static electrode used in conventional m cdi doornbusch et al 2016 jeon et al 2013 meanwhile fcdi enables a continuous desalinating behavior in the unit cell and steadily produces desalted water with electrode regeneration completed downstream of the cell by simply mixing the positive and negative carbon slurries followed by carbon separation from water via settling jeon et al 2013 2014 yang et al 2016a the two important features are visually described in fig 12b studies related to fcdi under such an operational mode indicated that the effluent nacl concentration would decrease rapidly and then reach a plateau jeon et al 2013 in contrast when a conventional m cdi cell is used the effluent nacl concentration would decrease rapidly and then increase and finally return to its original value as ion adsorption on the fixed electrodes reaches equilibrium porada et al 2013b since fcdi was proposed in 2013 fcdi has attracted many researchers interest studies aimed at enhancing fcdi performance and achieving a cost effective fcdi system have been performed in various aspects mainly including 1 flow electrode as flow electrode is the key element of fcdi extensive efforts have been made to optimize the carbon materials and aqueous electrolyte constituting the flow electrode for instance hatzell et al 2015 modified granular ac with nitric acid to increase the oxygen containing surface functional groups and then used the oxidized ac for flow electrodes it was found that chemical oxidation of ac was favorable to reducing the viscosity of carbon suspension and resultantly a higher carbon content could be used without increasing pumping energy when using oxidized ac while the increased carbon loading contributed to a decrease in the deionization energy consumption and an increase in salt removal efficiency similarly park et al 2016 prepared surface modified ac suspensions ac coated with trimethylammonium for flow anode and ac coated with sulfonate for flow cathode to achieve a higher carbon loading without sacrificing the flowability viscosity considering the excellent conductivity of carbon black facilitating charge transfer liang et al 2017 added a certain dosage of carbon black with an average diameter of 12 Œºm into the ac flow electrodes leading to a decrease in the fcdi s internal resistance and consequently an improved charge efficiency ma et al 2016b developed redox active flow electrodes by adding 14 mm hydroquinone to 1 wt activated charcoal suspension and demonstrated that the presence of aqueous hydroquinone benzoquinone couple in flow electrodes enhanced electron transfer significantly and facilitated both salt adsorption and desorption processes as a result of the facile redox transformation between hydroquinone and benzoquinone yang et al 2016a fabricated flow electrodes using an aqueous electrolyte with a high salt concentration 2 44 wt and confirmed that this method was effective to reduce the internal resistance of the electrode chambers and improve fcdi s desalting efficiency thereby successfully overcoming the limitations of flow electrodes using low concentrated salt water as an electrolyte for the use of fcdi doornbusch et al 2016 developed a fcdi system leveraging upflow fluidized bed electrodes and showed that the carbon loading in the flow electrode could reach 35 wt while maintaining flowability which promised more effective electric charge percolation through the electrode than previously used flow electrodes maximum carbon loading 20 wt cohen et al 2016 introduced a novel class of suspension electrodes combining dilute slurries and dense upflow fluidized beds with results showing that a synergetic effect could be achieved in the enhancement of electrode electronic conductivity when adding dilute slurry to dense fluidized bed xu et al 2016 proposed an asymmetric fcdi system by using activated carbon ac mno2 suspension as the anode and ac suspension as the cathode so as to improve the operation voltage to 1 8 v thereby achieving a much higher salt removal efficiency than conventional fcdi 2 cell design to maximize the advantages of fcdi lower fcdi s construction investment and operation costs and simply the fcdi cell system for facile scale up several research groups have focused efforts on improving the fcdi cell design gendel et al 2014 developed a truly continuous fcdi process where water desalination brine production and electrode regeneration were all performed continuously and simultaneously the feed water is split between two fcdi cells with the same configuration but with reversed potential both carbon slurries are continuously recirculated between the two fcdi modules one producing desalinated stream and the other producing concentrated stream however this system suffers from high energy consumption originated from application of a voltage for water desalination in the first module and additionally for electrode regeneration in the second module as well as the circulation pumping of two flow electrodes following this work rommerskirchen et al 2015 further designed a continuous fcdi system that comprised only one module and one flow electrode performing the same function as that introduced by gendel et al 2014 see fig 12c the single flow electrode and single module fcdi desalination system is beneficial to reducing energy and investment costs and lowering the threshold to a large scale implementation in the majority of fcdi cell architectures the flow electrodes are separated from the feed water channel by iems as shown in figs 2e and 12a yet hatzell et al 2014a proposed a membrane free fcdi configuration that could potentially develop into a low cost system specifically two flow electrodes prepared by mixing sea or brackish water with activated carbon flow through electrode compartments with a porous separator in between at the end of electrode compartments charged carbon particles carrying counterions are sieved via the use of polymeric or non woven glass fibers to produce desalinated water after sieving the carbon can be flushed in a high concentration stream discharged and recycled for further use in an effort to simplify the fcdi cell system lee et al 2018c combined the spacer and iems into a single unit by coating the iems 17 wt poly phenylene oxide in n methyl 2 pyrrolidone as aem solution and 20 wt poly phenylene oxide in dimethylacetamide as cem solution on the surface of a porous ceramic structure acting as the spacer this combination avoids the use of costly free standing iems and makes fcdi cells readily scaled up recently as a ground breaking design a highly compact and scalable three dimensional 3d fcdi system was realized by utilizing honeycomb shaped porous lattice scaffolds and by coating an iem aem or cem solution and a graphene layer within appropriate channels as shown in fig 13 cho et al 2017 the 3d fcdi system does not require the water channel spacer layer free standing iems and thick current collectors which makes the size of each cell much smaller and more compact than typical fcdi cells thereby allowing for a high volumetric efficiency moreover the unit cell can be scaled up readily in three dimensions and the desalination efficiency and capacity significantly increase as the cell size or number is extended see fig 13 3 energy harvesting harvesting recovering energy to minimize the overall energy consumption of fcdi system is another important aspect it has been reported that during constant current discharge approximately 20 of the supplied energy in a fcdi cell charged by constant voltage could be recovered by energy extraction using an external circuit when the ions stored in the flow electrodes are released into salt water jeon et al 2014 furthermore it has been demonstrated that using a flow electrode system for continuous energy harvesting is feasible via capacitive mixing from naturally available differences in water salinity see fig 14 and concentration differences in bicarbonate ions hco3 dissolved in water from the exhaust gases of a power plant with high levels of co2 versus the low co2 concentration in air see fig 15 hatzell et al 2014b porada et al 2014 which provides a new platform for harvesting energy and has the potential to impact on the fields of energy and water technology also of note is that fcdi systems can be integrated with other technologies to provide synergy towards desalination one example is combining fcdi with neutralization dialysis nd to fabricate a cell named capacitive neutralization deionization with flow electrodes fcnd wang et al 2016 the only difference between fcdi and fcnd is that the acidic e g hcl and the alkaline e g naoh solutions are used in the flow electrode channels in place of salt solutions in fcnd cells capacitive adsorption of salt ions occurs simultaneously during the neutralization dialysis process which makes fcnd perform better than individual fcdi or nd in terms of average salt adsorption rate and salt removal efficiency a second example is coupling fcdi with nanofiltration nf with an energy efficient hybrid desalination process achieved with tunable salt rejection and high water recovery for high salinity brackish water 10000 mg l 1 nacl choi et al 2017 it turned out that the hybrid fcdi nf system provided 20 energy saving compared to the best reported energy consumption of a brackish water reverse osmosis unit beyond the application of brackish and sea water desalination fcdi has also been investigated for other applications fang et al 2018 he et al 2018a linnartz et al 2017 nativ et al 2018 yang et al 2016b zhang et al 2018b for example fcdi operated in short circuited closed cycle mode was found to be a cost effective technology for brackish water softening with the charge neutralization achieved by continuous mixing of the carbon particles significantly inhibiting scale formation on the electrode surface he et al 2018a fcdi for a salt metathesis process was demonstrated by linnartz et al 2017 where four identical fcdi cells were used to generate a concentrated valuable magnesium sulfate mgso4 solution from dilute mgcl2 and na2so4 or k2so4 solutions further fcdi systems have been employed as a method for the recovery of valuable chemicals from low strength wastewaters fang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b zhang et al 2018b combined a fcdi unit with a hydrophobic gas permeable hollow fiber membrane contactor and used the hybrid system for removal and recovery of ammonium nh4 from dilute wastewaters during operation nh4 migrates across the cem and accumulates in the fcdi cathode chamber where alkaline environment favors the conversion of nh4 to dissolved nh3 aq followed by a production of nh3 g ma et al 2016b nativ et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b nh3 g will readily diffuse through the gas permeable membrane into an acid solution and be recovered as an ammonium salt that can potentially be marketed as a fertilizer as shown in fig 16 3 cells with battery electrodes 3 1 hybrid capacitive deionization m cdi is highlighted as a desalination technology in which ions are harvested and stored in the electric double layers of capacitive electrodes the ion removal capacity of m cdi systems is somewhat limited and thus not sufficient for desalting high concentration saline water meanwhile the energy consumption of m cdi systems for treating high salinity water significantly exceeds the energy required for reverse osmosis systems srimuk et al 2017a consequently an important task for current research is to overcome the intrinsic limitations of m cdi for brackish water and make the technology accessible to higher molar concentrations inspired from the burgeoning field of energy storage such as lithium ion batteries and sodium ion batteries a highly promising approach is to replace one of the two capacitive electrodes with a battery i e faradaic electrode with this novel desalination technique referred to as hybrid capacitive deionization hcdi the typical hcdi cell architecture is shown in fig 2f and aem is not required in some cases srimuk et al 2017b apart from being able to reduce energy consumption and avoid parasitic reactions through the use of a smaller voltage window battery electrodes could offer a higher specific capacity than capacitive electrodes since ions are not just absorbed on the surface of battery electrodes but also being intercalated into their crystal structures via chemical bonds guo et al 2018 lee et al 2014 suss and presser 2018 normally a sodium battery electrode instead of a chloride battery electrode is employed because materials for sodium ion faradaic intercalation de intercalation are diverse and have been intensively investigated while materials for chloride ion faradaic intercalation de intercalation are limited lee et al 2014 first introduced the concept of hcdi in 2014 with the hcdi cell composed of a na4mn9o18 a representative positive electrode material for sodium ion batteries electrode as the cathode a porous activated carbon electrode as the anode and an aem placed adjacent to the carbon electrode prior to desalination tests a certain voltage vs ag agcl needed to be applied to the na4mn9o18 electrode for an appropriate duration of time to extract na na 4 mn 9 o 18 na 4 9 x mn 9 o 18 9 x na 9 x e desalination process was initiated by applying a positive voltage with the result that na was intercalated into na4mn9o18 electrode via chemical reactions na 4 9 x mn 9 o 18 9 x na 9 x e na 4 mn 9 o 18 while cl was physically adsorbed in the electric double layers formed at the surface of porous carbon electrode reversely desorption process occurred by applying a negative voltage to release the captured ions the hcdi system exhibited more than double the salt removal sorption capacity 31 2 mg g 1 than a conventional cdi system 13 5 mg g 1 and revealed a rapid ion removal rate and excellent stability successfully demonstrating its superior deionization performance besides na4mn9o18 other na faradaic electrodes such as na2fep2o7 kim et al 2016b nati2 po4 3 huang et al 2017b and prussian blue pb guo et al 2017 have also been explored and it was found that pairing these na battery electrodes with a capacitive activated carbon as a hcdi cell also led to significantly improved salt adsorption capacity compared to that of traditional m cdi cells fig 17 summarizes the materials that have been reported to exhibit reversible sodium ion faradaic insertion release in sodium ion batteries within the decomposition voltage of water chihara et al 2013 deng et al 2014 guo et al 2017 jung et al 2014 kim et al 2012b 2016b liu et al 2016b palomares et al 2012 park et al 2011b senguttuvan et al 2011 song et al 2014 su and wang 2013 wang et al 2015b whitacre et al 2010 wu et al 2015b 2018 yu et al 2015 zhao et al 2013a zhu et al 2013 2017 that is the potential materials that may be applied in hcdi generally materials with higher specific capacity mah g 1 are expected to store a greater amount of charge and thus provide a larger sac here it is worth noting that in addition to the pursuit of a large sac other factors should be also considered for example the poor electrical conductivity and relatively high capital cost of na battery electrode materials hinder the advancement of hcdi to some degree to address this issue an effective method is to synthesize the composite of carbon and na battery electrode materials with both characteristics of a battery and a capacitor specifically depositing thin layers of mno2 onto carbon substrates provides an efficient alternative to bulk na insertion materials i e mno2 by preserving the rich internal pore structures and excellent electrical conductivity of the carbon substrate while minimizing the mn mass required to achieve increased capacity and cation selectivity hand and cusick 2017 apart from the benefits of resolving low electrical conductivity and reducing capital cost of bulk na insertion de insertion materials it was reported that utilizing the composite of carbon and na battery electrode materials also contributes to an improved cycling performance divyapriya et al 2018 huang et al 2017b zhou et al 2018 representing an inverted version of the typical hcdi cells yoon et al 2017 constructed a hcdi cell consisting of a chloride battery electrode anode a capacitive carbon electrode cathode and a cem the chloride battery electrode was fabricated by coating a small amount of ag onto a capacitive carbon electrode via photo induced reduction reaction compared to the cdi cell assembled with a pair of capacitive carbon electrodes and one cem the ag coated hcdi cell led to an significant improvement in the deionization capacity 88 more maximum deionization rate 39 more and charge efficiency 76 92 which could be explained by the enhanced specific capacity combining the capacitance of carbon electrode and ag mediated charge transfer reaction ag cl agcl e moreover the ag coated hcdi was found to be superior to the mcdi in terms of energy consumption 3 2 desalination battery unlike a hcdi cell combing a battery electrode e g sodium manganese oxide and a capacitive electrode e g porous carbon a desalination battery cell is composed of two different battery electrodes one for cation faradaic intercalation de intercalation and the other for anion faradaic intercalation de intercalation fig 2h iems could be placed in front of each electrode to enhance performance by blocking the co ions during the capture release process generally a constant current instead of a constant voltage is applied for both desalination and salination steps and the charging discharging process is performed until the cell voltage reaches a pre determined value in desalination battery systems the unit f g 1 employed to describe the capacitance of capacitive materials becomes useless and the unit mah g 1 employed to represent the specific capacity of battery materials should be adopted since charge and cell voltage are no longer behaving like those in a capacitor the concept of desalination battery was first proposed and demonstrated by pasta et al 2012 with the cell consisting of a ag negative electrode and a na2mn5o10 positive electrode tests were conducted in a static 300 Œºl electrolyte the desalination cycle is started with charging the electrodes in the absence of mobile sodium and chloride ions rendering na2mn5o10 oxidized into mno2 during the desalination cycle cl is chemically captured from the electrolyte to the silver electrode forming agcl eq 1 while na is chemically intercalated in the bulk of mno2 electrode forming na2mn5o10 eq 2 the reverse process will happen during the desorption cycle as shown in eq 3 and eq 4 specifically a complete cycle of the agna2mn5o10 system includes four steps 1 fully charged electrodes are immersed in seawater desalination occurs by applying a negative constant current 2 removal of the desalinated water and replenishment of new seawater 3 releasing the ions incorporated in the first step and creating concentrated seawater by applying a positive constant current 4 replacing the concentrated seawater with new seawater and the system is ready for the next cycle a low energy consumption of 0 29 kwh m 3 for the desalination process removal of 25 salt was achieved using this novel cell design and fast exchange of ions between the solid and the liquid phase occurred na and cl could potentially be selectively removed however in spite of a landmark study there was no report about the adsorption capacity of the electrodes and only one cycle was carried out in the agna2mn5o10 system with the cycle repeatability unknown in addition oxidation of na2mn5o10 to mno2 prior to desalination cycle resulted in noticeable polarization causing a decreased capacity 1 adsorption process a g c

based on the pioneer work of pasta et al 2012 chen et al 2017a advanced the dual ion electrochemistry deionization system by using agcl as the negative electrode na0 44mno2 as the positive electrode and flowing nacl solution as the electrolyte feed nacl solution was pumped through the agclna0 44mno2 deionization device and then flowed back when a positive current is applied cl is electrochemically released from the agcl electrode agcl e ag cl while na is electrochemically de intercalated from the na0 44mno2 electrode na 0 44 mno 2 na 0 44 x mno 2 x na x e to the flow electrolyte when switching to negative current na and cl are extracted from the flow electrolyte to their corresponding electrodes undergoing the reverse redox reactions through 100 cycling tests the agclna0 44mno2 system was found to possess a stable and reversible salt adsorption capacity of 57 4 mg g 1 at 100 ma g 1 current density which is much higher than that obtained by traditional or hybrid cdi device the average charge efficiency is high up to 0 979 0 956 during the salt desorption adsorption process in another study by kim et al 2017c selective na separation from a solution containing diverse cations na k ca2 and mg2 using the agclna0 44mno2 system was investigated with experimental results indicating that in an electrolyte where the cations had equal molar concentrations the selectivity toward na was over 13 times higher than k and 6 8 times higher than ca2 and mg2 with respect to cl capturing intercalation electrode material silver shows several advantages stability of potential corrosion resistance and bactericidal properties pasta et al 2012 nevertheless high cost of ag 553 usd kg 1 and poor electrical conductivity of agcl will limit the usage of ag agcl electrode in practical and large scale desalination battery cells as such seeking a sustainable efficient and economical cl storage electrode is of considerable importance bi biocl electrode a recently discovered cost effective 9 8 usd kg 1 for bi and stable insoluble in a wide ph and potential range cl capture release electrode opens up new possibilities for electrochemical cl removal or desalination applications chen et al 2017b carried out a similar study to their previous work chen et al 2017a by replacing agcl electrode with biocl electrode while keeping na intercalation electrode material unchanged with this modification contributing to an enhancement in salt adsorption capacity from 57 4 mg g 1 to 68 5 mg g 1 the redox reactions occurred during salt desorption and adsorption processes in the bioclna0 44mno2 system are described as follows 6 desorption process 3 b i o c l 3 e b i b i 2 o 3 3 c l 7 n a 0 44 m n o 2 n a 0 44 x m n o 2 x n a x e 8

a c l interestingly when bi is employed as the cl storage positive electrode the electrochemical reaction involving its conversion to biocl is significantly different from that shown in eq 8 nam and choi 2017 for example in a desalination battery cell composed of a bi positive electrode and a nati2 po4 3 negative electrode desalination happens as a result of the following electrochemical reactions nam and choi 2017 11 b i c l h 2 o b i o c l 2 h 3 e 12 n a t i 2 p o 4 3 2 n a 2 e n a 3 t i 2 p o 4 3 overall reaction 13 3 2 n a t i 2 p o 4 3 b i 3 n a c l h 2 o 3 2 n a 3 t i 2 p o 4 3 b i o c l 2 h normally new seawater ph neutral is used as feedwater for desorption process however in this case the kinetics of cl release from biocl would be slow as protons are needed to facilitate reduction of biocl to bi by serving as oxygen acceptors biocl 2 h 3 e bi cl h 2 o it was suggested to address this issue by the use of an acidic solution 70 mm hcl during desorption since battery electrodes used in batch mode tests can be lifted out of the desalinated water after desalination and immersed into a different solution for desorption another possible drawback of the bi nati2 po4 3 system is an imbalance in na and cl storage as can be seen from eq 13 the molar ratio of na and cl stored in the bi nati2 po4 3 cell during desalination is 3 1 rather than 1 1 which indicates that when na in the seawater is completely removed two thirds of cl would still remain in the solution with charge neutralized by h produced during the transformation of bi to biocl a solution to this issue was proposed i e adopting a hydrogen evolution electrode to replace the nati2 po4 3 electrode to perform reduction of h to h2 while bi electrode finishes removing the remaining cl a promising desalination battery design is expected to possess properties of operational convenience low cost low energy consumption high ion removal capacity and performance stability among the desalination battery cells developed so far the bioclna0 44mno2 cell appears to be the most practical however in order to render desalination battery a truly feasible method for seawater desalination development of better combinations of cl storage battery electrode and na storage battery electrode is still required and deserves continuing research input discovering new cl or na capturing intercalation electrode material and synthesizing composite electrodes via the use of existing materials to achieve synergistic effects e g incorporation of agcl into porous carbonaceous materials to overcome the disadvantage of poor electrical conductivity of agcl represent two important research directions 3 3 cation intercalation desalination as previously described in cells of hcdi and desalination battery a na intercalation battery electrode is paired with a different electrode for cl adsorption either a capacitive electrode or an cl intercalation battery electrode considering that very few options are available for cl intercalation materials in a separate direction toward mitigating the issue of anion storage a new cell architecture referred to as cation intercalation desalination cid to reveal the underlying desalination mechanism has been recently proposed by employing na intercalation materials for both electrodes with the electrodes separated by an aem smith and dmello 2016 the typical cell configuration of cid is displayed in fig 2g from which we can see the principle of desalination the cid system operates similar to rocking chair batteries as shown by the movement of ions during alternating charging and discharging steps during charging na is removed from the negative compartment solution by the intercalating electrode while cl migrates through the membrane leaving the negative compartment solution resulting in a desalinated stream the positive compartment accepted na from the de intercalating electrode and cl passing through the membrane resulting in a concentrated stream during discharging the movement of ions is reversed as well as the desalinated and concentrated effluent tanks in contrast to cells of flow by cdi flow through cdi mcdi i cdi hcdi and desalination battery requiring a regeneration step cid cells enables a continuous production of desalinated solutions smith and dmello 2016 first introduced this novel configuration in 2016 for desalination of brackish water and seawater by using symmetric na intercalation electrodes i e electrodes with identical chemical composition but with a different degree of intercalation separated by either a porous separator commonly used in sodium ion batteries or an aem and originally referred to it as na ion desalination an ideal two dimensional porous electrode model was used to predict the performance of the proposed cells na0 44mno2 type and nati2 po4 3 type with theoretical results indicating that aem was able to achieve a higher degree of desalination than porous separator and the na0 44mno2 based cid cell enabled a 59 64 drop in influent salinity with water recovery levels up to 80 and 95 for 700 mm and 70 mm nacl influent respectively as na0 44mno2 and nati2 po4 3 are not very stable na0 44mno2 tends to degrade as a result of over dis charge while nati2 po4 3 tends to hydrolyze in moderate ph solutions smith 2017 conducted a further study in which the performance of cid cells with various membrane and flow arrangements was theoretically evaluated while the two electrodes were made from nickel hexacyanoferrate nihcf prussian blue analogue na2nife ii cn 6 as the anode and nanife iii cn 6 as the cathode see fig 18 three cid cell designs were employed a flow through cell a flow by cell and a membrane flow by cell the membrane flow by cell could be scaled up to form an electrodialysis ed stack that utilizes na intercalation electrodes rather than the gas evolution reactions typically used in ed simulation results revealed that the membrane flow by cell was superior to the other two cells i e flow through cell and flow by cell due to its flowability high capacity and low polarization additionally it was predicted that ed stacks using nihcf electrodes exhibited several advantages including improved salt adsorption capacity relative to membrane flow by cell decreasing energy consumption per volume of diluate produced with increasing stack size and capability of desalinating large volumes of water efficiently by continuously removing 0 4 0 5 m nacl from 0 7 m influent within diluate streams smith 2017 following from these two studies the cid concept was demonstrated experimentally using symmetric na intercalation electrodes kim et al 2017d porada et al 2017 and asymmetric na intercalation electrodes lee et al 2017b kim et al 2017d assembled a flow by cid cell using symmetric copper hexacyanoferrate cuhcf electrodes and investigated effects of stack size from single stacked cell to triple stacked cell on the desalination performance of brackish nacl solution experimental results were consistent with the previous predictions by smith 2017 that stacking additional aems and cems between na intercalation electrodes could increase salt adsorption capacity and reduce energy consumption per volume of diluate produced in spite of the benefits of increasing stack size it should be pointed out that a trade off is required between desalination performance and the need to minimize the number of iems due to their high cost porada et al 2017 constructed a flow behind cid cell using symmetric nihcf electrodes and successfully demonstrated its continuous desalination of brackish nacl kcl solutions moreover a threefold preferential adsorption of k over na was observed in aqueous nacl kcl mixtures which indicates the potential of nihcf electrodes for selective ion separation from mixed ionic solutions lee et al 2017b developed a batch mode cid cell using asymmetric na intercalation electrodes nanihcf as the anode and nafehcf as the cathode and evaluated its feasibility of treating actual seawater with experimental results showing that this system had a high desalination capacity 59 9 mg g 1 with efficient energy consumption and good stability considering the high cost imperfect permselectivity and finite lifespan of iems seeking for an alternative to iems in cid cells is of significance most recently liu and smith 2018 used a two dimensional porous electrode model to study the cycling behavior of cid cell that uses porous diaphragms rather than aem to limit salt diffusion between the two nihcf electrodes though losses in charge efficiency were incurred as a result of the diaphragm s lack of selectivity toward anions simulation results suggested that a similar desalination can be achieved in the diaphragm based cell relative to an aem based cell if high enough current is applied future development of cid device will benefit from on going research in sodium ion batteries the materials that have been reported to exhibit reversible sodium ion faradaic insertion release in sodium ion batteries within the decomposition voltage of water could probably be applied in cid and these materials have been summarized in fig 17 meanwhile anion intercalation desalination representing an inverted version of cid would be a research hotspot if cl intercalation materials flourish in addition while cid holds great promise some advancement could further improve performance for example by improving cell design through reduced internal resistances using forced convection of electrolyte within intercalation electrodes and flowing concentrate and dilute streams in opposing directions 4 perspectives and outlook it takes no more than two decades for the cdi community to develop into one of the most eye catching research areas and it is expected that the coming years will see a further explosive growth of cdi towards a more mature and advanced technology nowadays cdi embraces various cell architectures with either capacitive electrodes or battery electrodes including flow by cdi flow through cdi membrane cdi mcdi inverted cdi i cdi flow electrode cdi fcdi hybrid cdi hcdi desalination battery and cation intercalation desalination cid with each of them demonstrating unique features and functionalities and achieving remarkable advancements one question has arisen from the fast proliferation of cdi cell architectures which cell configuration is the most promising from our perspective it is hard to get a clear answer as each of the cdi cell architectures has unique advantages and disadvantages and none should be neglected in future research work for example flow by cdi stands out owing to its simple structure without the need of expensive iems or pumping energy requirements for flow electrodes mcdi presents higher charge efficiency than flow by cdi at the cost of significantly more expensive cell components flow through cdi allows for more compact cells and improved desalination rates but suffers from greater feed pressures than flow by cdi for the same throughput i cdi features excellent operation longevity but lacks substantial salt removal capacity fcdi exhibits continuous deionization and a high desalting efficiency but suffers from a low electronic conductivity in the flow electrodes and additional energy cost for electrode transport cdi cells with battery electrodes hcdi desalination battery and cid regularly achieve salt adsorption capacity far exceeding that of cdi cells with capacitive electrodes however battery electrodes exhibit a slower salt removal and incur a higher capital cost relative to capacitive electrodes suss and presser 2018 flow by cdi and mcdi are the two most widely studied cell architectures in the cdi field a remarkable number of innovations have been realized with key aspects focusing on materials application operational mode cell design faradaic reactions and theoretical models even so the research on flow by cdi and mcdi necessitates ongoing efforts and there are several important issues requiring a great focus in the near future 1 identifying the most appropriate pore size distribution of carbon based electrodes for ion adsorption will remain the subject of further studies while large specific surface area is a prerequisite for efficient ion adsorption some materials with inherent high surface area yield a poor ion removal performance owing to the lack of macropores allowing for fast ion transport 2 recovery of the energy released during discharge is essential if m cdi is to become a competitive water treatment technology as a consequence the energy consumption with energy recovery is most likely to be a more appropriate performance metric than the energy consumption without energy recovery in future research 3 many works in the literature show only the first or a few initial cycles and in some cases even used materials with known low stability in water therefore it is of importance to study the long term desalination performance and report the cyclic stability 4 field tests utilizing pilot scale or large scale m cdi facilities have not been adequately addressed such studies will provide valuable information about scalability system cost salinity limits and electrode membrane s behavior after long periods of operation etc meanwhile additional pre and post processing may need to be explored desalination performance and performance stability are largely determined by the electrode material with the emergence of hcdi desalination battery and cid cells the era exclusive to carbon materials for cdi electrode has ended the exploration of battery electrodes as desalination electrodes has just begun with a great promise in desalination of high salinity streams to develop new cation or anion storage faradaic electrode materials it is convenient to take inspiration from the highly developed energy storage field such as ion batteries over the past decades the energy storage field has developed hundreds of potential candidate materials a deep well to explore for desalination many of the strategies proposed to improve the function of intercalation electrodes might be also applicable to desalination systems it should be noted that it is also possible to have not just an electrode but a redox active electrolyte as the battery electrode lee et al 2018b the electric charge can be stored in the bulk electrolyte by redox activities of the electrolyte itself these redox electrolytes are promising for energy storage systems particularly when they are combined with highly porous carbon electrodes it is likely to draw inspiration from this research area to make it also applicable to the cdi field for water treatment other research efforts in battery electrodes derive from the problems remaining to be resolved for example most of battery electrodes investigated so far are only efficient for capturing a specific ion while attractive for removal of particular ions such as key pollutants or scalants in feed waters this selectivity limits their application in desalination of complex source waters containing multiple types of ions requiring removal such as most brackish water and seawater another example is related to the stability of already proposed battery electrode materials like cells with capacitive electrodes it is also important to investigate the long term performance of cells with battery electrodes or long term influence of co occurrence of inorganic compounds and natural organic matter though researchers have claimed that these battery electrodes can be operated for hundreds of cycles without obvious performance degradation undesired leakage of metal ions from the intercalation materials might happen during prolonged operation potentially causing risks when used for drinking water desalination zhang et al 2018a one exciting development in the field of cdi is the emergence of fcdi cells by continuously replenishing the electroactive region with uncharged carbon based materials fcdi systems not only exhibit excellent salt adsorption capacity 20 mg of nacl g 1 enabling treatment of high salinity water but also allow for a continuous production of freshwater combined with a continuous regeneration of the electrodes while cells with fixed electrode such as flow by cdi and mcdi have been extensively studied and their performance limits are largely known fcdi is still in the initial developing stage and many possibilities for its future advances exist since polymer binders that have counter productive effects on ion adsorption are not needed in the preparation of flow electrodes fcdi is leading to a revolutionary change in the selection of carbon materials and their synthesis one major current challenge faced by fcdi is the inefficient charge transfer between the current collectors and flow electrodes and much work remains towards addressing this issue in summary cdi is a promising water treatment technology and an exciting research field despite its related challenges with a continuing search for solutions to these challenges and a continuing springing up of novel unexplored cell architectures cdi may be considered as a key to solving the worldwide water shortage and water pollution in the future 5 conclusions sharing many similarities with supercapacitor battery technologies in the energy storage field cdi is an electrochemical water treatment process that operates by adsorbing ions in the electric double layers of capacitive electrodes via electrostatic interaction or in the crystal structures of battery electrodes via reversible faradaic intercalation the cdi field has grown exponentially over the past decade and is attracting increasing attention herein a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in various cell architectures of cdi has been presented including flow by cdi flow through cdi mcdi i cdi fcdi hcdi desalination battery and cid particularly the flow by cdi and mcdi with their key research activities subdivided into materials application operational mode cell design faradaic reactions and theoretical models current challenges associated with the development of various cdi cell architectures are discussed and future research and prospects for cdi are also suggested this review

globe in the face of climate change population growth industrial development water contamination and limited availability of freshwater elimelech and phillip 2011 porada et al 2013b tang et al 2017a yin et al 2013 owing to rich resources desalination of sea or brackish water is conducive to increasing the fresh water supply beyond what is available from the hydrological cycle with advantages of low energy consumption i e enabling ion removal at room temperatures low pressures and low voltages with additional possibility of energy recovery low environmental impact i e without the use of any added chemicals or the generation of hazardous substances simple equipment structure and convenient operation capacitive deionization cdi has emerged as a promising alternative to established water desalination technologies such as reverse osmosis electrodialysis and thermal distillation especially for desalination of waters with low to medium salinity suss et al 2015 tang et al 2016a 2016b 2017b yin et al 2013 zhang et al 2018a the study of cdi dates back to the late 1960s when it was called electrochemical demineralization and the subsequent four decades saw only intermittent advances to this technology porada et al 2013b over the last two decades however an exponential increase in the academic interest in cdi technology has occurred with various cdi cell architectures constantly springing up fig 1 leading to tremendous advances in the cdi field cdi is characterized by the facile removal of charged ionic species from aqueous solutions via electrostatic or electrochemical interactions a conventional cdi cell consists of two graphite current collectors facilitating electron transfer two porous carbon electrodes for capacitive i e non faradaic ion sorption and a spacer channel enabling the feed water to be transported see fig 2 a porada et al 2013a b tang et al 2015 this cdi cell configuration is also called flow by cdi or cdi with flow between electrodes suss et al 2015 upon applying a voltage or current potential difference typically no more than 1 23 v across the two electrodes cations and anions in the spacer channel are attracted to the cathode i e negatively charged electrode and anode i e positively charged electrode respectively and electrostatically held in the electric double layers edls formed at the carbon water interface porada et al 2013b generating a stream of purified water a step called adsorption or charging following ion adsorption the electrodes can be regenerated by short circuiting the anode and cathode or reversing polarity with the trapped ions released back into the bulk solution generating a stream of concentrated water a step called desorption or discharging in this way the purified water and brine stream are produced intermittently when the feed water flows straight through electrodes rather than between the electrodes and parallel to the applied electric field direction this cell is named flow through cdi cohen et al 2011 hawks et al 2018 see fig 2c in 2006 one important improvement over conventional cdi is the inclusion of ion exchange membranes iems in front of the electrodes which is called membrane capacitive deionization mcdi fig 2b lee et al 2006 specifically a cation exchange membrane cem is placed adjacent to the cathode and an anion exchange membrane aem is placed adjacent to the anode during charging co ions are expelled from the micropores but unable to penetrate the iems and as a result stay in the macropores of the electrode since the macropores are always electrically neutral the macropores could serve as extra storage space for counterions thereby improving the ion removal performance biesheuvel et al 2011 porada et al 2013b zhao et al 2012 2013b incorporation of iems into conventional cdi is also recognized to be an effective method to increase the lifetime of electrodes via avoiding direct water scouring and alleviating particular faradaic reactions tang et al 2017a zhang et al 2018a to improve the ion removal performance for practical applications m cdi cells can be assembled in multiple pairs to construct a stack after being placed in a housing and sealed these stacks can be connected in parallel or in series with regard to fluid flow as one of the powerful advantages of cdi compared to other desalination technologies in parallel with ion desorption the energy used to charge the electrodes during desalination can be partially recovered and utilized to charge another m cdi cell operating in the ion adsorption step see fig 3 or stored in an energy storage medium such as a supercapacitor for later use alkuran et al 2008 han et al 2015 kang et al 2016 pern√≠a et al 2012 tan et al 2018 flow by cdi and mcdi are the most widely studied and utilized cell architectures in the cdi field in recent years there has been a fast proliferation of novel cdi cell architectures including inverted capacitive deionization i cdi gao et al 2015a b flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi jeon et al 2013 hybrid capacitive deionization hcdi lee et al 2014 desalination battery pasta et al 2012 cation intercalation desalination cid smith and dmello 2016 and these have introduced several unique features and new functionalities to this field flow by cdi mcdi flow through cdi i cdi and fcdi remove ions via the mechanism of non faradaic process i e electrostatic and capacitive effects the i cdi cell arises from the modification of flow by cdi through the use of an anode with net negative surface charge and a cathode with net positive surface charge fig 2d gao et al 2015a it exhibits excellent operation longevity and an inverted adsorption desorption behavior to the flow by cdi with cell charging leading to ion desorption from the edls of the electrodes and cell discharging by short circuiting the anode and cathode leading to ion adsorption gao et al 2015b oyarzun et al 2018 the fcdi cell arises from the modification of mcdi through the use of flowing electrodes made of carbon suspension instead of the fixed electrodes between current collectors and iems fig 2e fcdi enables two major benefits relative to conventional m cdi one is the continuous ion removal and the steady production of desalted water as electrode regeneration can occur as a separate process downstream of the cell choo et al 2017 rommerskirchen et al 2018 yang et al 2017a another is the capability of desalinating high salinity feed water due to the infinite ion adsorption capacity of the flow electrode achieved by continuously introducing uncharged carbon particles into the charging cell doornbusch et al 2016 jeon et al 2013 suss et al 2015 in terms of hcdi desalination battery and cid these cells remove ions via the mechanism of faradaic process i e reversible redox reactions generally the hcdi cell consists of a faradaic i e battery electrode for cation adsorption desorption and a capacitive electrode for anion adsorption desorption byles et al 2018 siekierka et al 2018 an aem could be placed adjacent to the capacitive electrode to enhance hcdi s performance fig 2f the desalination battery cell is composed of two different battery electrodes one for cation adsorption desorption and the other for anion adsorption desorption fig 2h shanbhag et al 2017 shapira et al 2018 the cid cell is constructed by employing faradaic cation intercalation materials for both electrodes with the electrodes separated by an aem fig 2g lee et al 2018a singh et al 2018 smith and dmello 2016 owing to the superior ion sorption capacity of battery electrodes compared to traditional capacitive electrodes hcdi desalination battery and cid are receiving increasing attention in recent years suss and presser 2018 the cdi research field is rapidly growing and evolving nevertheless an informative study to provide a deep understanding of cdi technologies is still missing in the literature in this work we comprehensively reviewed the recent advances and progress made in various cell architectures of cdi including flow by cdi mcdi flow through cdi i cdi fcdi hcdi desalination battery and cid current challenges associated with the development and practical applications of various cdi and the opportunities for improving the cell design are discussed future prospects on the emerging trends in various cdi cell architectures are also presented 2 cells with capacitive electrodes 2 1 flow by capacitive deionization and membrane capacitive deionization flow by capacitive deionization flow by cdi and membrane capacitive deionization mcdi are the two most common cell architectures in the use of cdi for water treatment a remarkable number of innovations have been observed with key aspects focusing on materials application operational mode cell design faradaic reactions and theoretical models 2 1 1 materials as a key component in both flow by cdi and mcdi systems the porous electrode plays a vital role in the ion removal process because its physical and chemical properties directly determine the salt adsorption capacity sac charge efficiency desalination rate and performance stability of the cell huang et al 2017c liu et al 2015 2017b oladunni et al 2018 ideal candidates for electrode materials should possess the properties of excellent electrochemical stability low cost large ion accessible specific surface area fast ion mobility within the pore network high electronic conductivity low contact resistance between the electrode and the current collector good wettability and process ability and desirable bio inertness huang et al 2017c liu et al 2015 porada et al 2013b since carbon based electrodes meet most of the above mentioned characteristics they have been widely exploited as electrodes in the m cdi units it is no exaggeration to say that the majority of effort and focus in flow by cdi and mcdi research have been put into the synthesis and development of better electrode materials so far many forms of carbon based electrode materials have been investigated including the classical materials like carbon aerogels farmer et al 1996 jung et al 2007 activated carbon chen et al 2011 zou et al 2008 activated carbon cloth gao et al 2016 activated carbon fibers el deen et al 2014a wang et al 2012 and the new materials like carbide derived carbons porada et al 2012 2013a mesoporous carbon li et al 2009b 2017b carbon nanotubes dai et al 2005 wang et al 2007 yang et al 2014 graphenes li et al 2009a liu et al 2017c wang et al 2013 carbon based composites carbon carbon composites carbon metal oxide composites carbon polymer composites and carbon polymer metal oxide composites liu et al 2015 oladunni et al 2018 among various carbons activated carbons stand out because they are usually the most cost efficient materials thereby particularly attractive for widespread commercial applications though other carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes graphenes and carbide derived carbon might possess more superior physicochemical properties and desalination performance carbon based composite materials that take advantage of the merits of carbon and other constituent materials have become popular recently for flow by cdi and mcdi electrodes due to the relatively low sac of single component carbon material the additional carbon components for the carbon carbon composites can potentially enhance the desalination performance of pristine carbon materials primarily via adjusting the intrinsic pore size distributions improving wettability providing larger ion accessible specific surface area and higher electronic conductivity liu et al 2015 2017b the carbon metal oxide composites might exhibit improved desalination performance compared with pristine carbon materials mainly attributed to the increase in specific capacitance improvement in wettability inhibition of physical adsorption of ionic species affecting the targeted ion adsorption or alteration of the surface zeta potential of the carbon electrodes to enhance the charge efficiency liu et al 2015 2017b oladunni et al 2018 some examples of metal oxides incorporated into carbon materials are tio2 kim et al 2014 liu et al 2013 yin et al 2013 mno2 li and park 2018 liu et al 2016c el deen et al 2014c zno myint et al 2014 myint and dutta 2012 ceo2 yin et al 2013 sno2 el deen et al 2014b zro2 yasin et al 2016 2017 fe2o3 yin et al 2013 and fe3o4 gu et al 2015 li et al 2016 among which mno2 and tio2 have the advantages of low cost being eco friendly and ease of anchoring into a carbon structure most recently shi et al 2018 coated manganese oxides mno x onto the vertically aligned carbon nanotubes and found that the composites are endowed with outstanding specific capacitance and exhibited a remarkable sodium ion adsorption capacity 2 fold higher than that of pristine vertically aligned carbon nanotubes as for the carbon metal oxide composites it is also important to point out that stability of the metal oxide under the applied potential and solution environment is also critical to the electrode performance for instance zno is unstable in both acidic and basic solutions liu et al 2015 the dissolution of such metal oxides will result in contamination of the purified water and a decrease in electrode s lifetime furthermore water electrolysis and other parasitic redox reactions e g reduction of dissolved oxygen oxidation of carbon and chloride ions may occur more easily when using the carbon metal oxide composite materials because the metal oxide may change the point of zero charge of the electrode to be close to the potential of the redox reactions liu et al 2015 the incorporation of polymers into carbon materials may contribute to the ion removal performance with their suitable physicochemical properties such as pseudo capacitance inclusion of oxygen and nitrogen containing functional groups or ion exchange ability liu et al 2015 2017b among polymers utilized in the carbon polymer composites polyaniline polypyrrole chitosan and ion exchange polymers are of particular interest li et al 2017a ma et al 2016a wang et al 2014 yan et al 2014 present research also focus on tuning the surface chemistry of the existing types of carbon based electrode materials gao et al 2016 wu et al 2015a the surface properties of electrode materials such as wettability hydrophilicity and surface charge have a great impact on the desalination performance surface tuned carbon based electrode materials doped with heteroatoms or grafted with functional groups enable good wettability and electrical conductivity as well as a high specific capacitance which is beneficial to improving the desalination performance zhang et al 2018d however a decrease in the adsorption sites might result from the blockage of pores by large molecules advantages always seem to be accompanied by trade offs in these kinds of surface tuned electrode materials as such there exists substantial room for stimulating research and development of high performance carbon based materials for flow by cdi and mcdi electrodes for making cdi electrodes we cannot use single carbon particles but need a film composed of such particles film electrodes for flow by cdi and mcdi cells are commonly fabricated by compressing the slurry mixture of carbon materials active material a conductive additive e g carbon black and a polymeric binder 10 mass into a sheet followed by a drying process porada et al 2013b particularly the binder plays a key role in determining the mechanical strength electrical conductivity and performance of carbon electrodes hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf are often used as the electrode binder however these binders can reduce the wettability of an electrode and some portion of the electrode surface area may not be wetted which may result in a decrease in ion adsorption capacity additionally the rigidness of and ptfe and pvdf can generate the mechanical crack at the electrode interface and then lead to loss in electrode performance asquith et al 2015 jain et al 2018 hydrophilic polymer binders such as poly vinyl alcohol pva jain et al 2018 park and choi 2010 poly vinyl acetate pvac park et al 2011a and poly arylene ether sulfone copolymers asquith et al 2015 have been reported to be good candidates for increasing the wettability of polymer bonded carbon electrodes but their swelling and degradation tendency in aqueous solution are undesirable though a great degree of crosslinking with glutaric acid is effective to solve this problem park and choi 2010 in the efforts to find a better electrode binder an organic inorganic hybrid binder i e introduction of silicate into a resin binder has been also explored in a recent study to fabricate robust activated carbon electrodes xie et al 2017 in addition to the electrode materials there are innovations in membranes for mcdi cells ahualli et al 2017 lee et al 2011 pan et al 2018 tian et al 2014 it is well known that ion adsorption capacity and charge efficiency can be increased significantly by applying a mcdi process a process combining flow by cdi with iems however the cost of the commonly utilized commercial iems remains prohibitively high for large scale applications in addition the iems are usually thick unfavorable to assembling and have high electrical resistance moreover the weak contact adhesion between the electrodes and the iems might produce a noticeable contact resistance to overcome these limitations various ion exchange polymers have been proposed to replace the iems in mcdi devices numerous studies have indicated that the cell assembled with carbon electrodes coated with a thin layer of ion exchange polymers exhibits a better desalination performance than the conventional flow by cdi cell and in some cases an improved desalination performance than the conventional mcdi cell for example liu et al 2014 fabricated a modified mcdi cell by introducing the anion exchange polymer dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride and cation exchange polymer polyethyleneimine onto the carbon nanotube electrodes and found that the modified mcdi cell exhibited a high nacl removal of 93 much higher than that of conventional flow by cdi cell 25 or the mcdi cell with commercial iems 74 the reported cation exchange polymers so far include polyethyleneimine liu et al 2014 cross linked poly vinyl alcohol with sulfosuccinic acid kim et al 2016a and poly styrene sulfonic acid co maleic acid kim et al 2016a sulfonated bromomethylated poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide lee et al 2011 poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate ahualli et al 2017 while anion exchange polymers include dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride ahualli et al 2017 liu et al 2014 aminated polysulfone kim et al 2016a cross linked quaternized poly vinyl alcohol with glutaraldehyde jain et al 2018 tian et al 2014 aminated bromomethylated poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide lee et al 2011 alternatively it is possible to directly graft the carbon electrodes with ion selective functional groups which can act as coatings similar to the iems without adding much electrical resistance qian et al 2015 yang et al 2013 generally there are two primary aims in optimizing the electrode and membrane materials enhancing desalination performance and maintaining performance stability guided by the two goals we expect that considerable efforts will continue to be dedicated to the development of new electrode and membrane materials that could provide a desirable desalination performance or performance stability among which construction of cells consisting of asymmetric porous carbon based electrodes will represent an important research direction choi et al 2018 wu et al 2015a a third goal attracting increasing interest is the selective removal of specific ions as such selection or fabrication of electrodes and membranes that permit selective removal of cations and or anions is also a critical issue in upcoming related research 2 1 2 application flow by cdi and mcdi are currently being actively explored for water treatment with particular applications in brackish water desalination and wastewater remediation compared to the dominating desalination technologies by far such as reverse osmosis and multi stage flash distillation flow by cdi and mcdi require less energy for desalination of water with a low or moderate salt content roughly below 2 g l 1 porada et al 2013b suss et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a part of the reason is that rather than extracting the majority compound water molecules from the salt solution as in reverse osmosis and multi stage flash distillation flow by cdi and mcdi remove the minority compound nacl from the feed water porada et al 2013b suss et al 2015 starting from the 1990s when the interest in cdi revived extensive studies have been carried out to improve the performance of flow by cdi and mcdi in brackish water desalination with research efforts ranging from fabrication of new electrode membrane materials ahualli et al 2017 huang et al 2017c development of new operational modes garcia quismondo et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 design of novel cell configurations bian et al 2015 kim et al 2018b mitigation or elimination of the undesired faradaic reactions choi 2014 zhang et al 2018a to use of theoretical methods for parameter optimization hawks et al 2018 tang et al 2015 flow by cdi and mcdi are not suitable for seawater desalination due to the limited salt adsorption capacity and the higher energy consumption than that of reverse osmosis for treating seawater porada et al 2013b in wastewater remediation application flow by cdi and mcdi have proven the ability to remove various types of ionic pollutants including heavy metals e g cu ii huang et al 2014 liu et al 2017a cr iii huang et al 2016 cr vi hou et al 2018 liu et al 2011 pb ii liu et al 2017c yang et al 2014 cd ii chen et al 2017d huang et al 2016 v v bao et al 2018 fe ii chen et al 2017d liu et al 2017a fe iii chen et al 2017d li et al 2010 as iii fan et al 2016 2017 as v fan et al 2016 2017 inorganic contaminants e g ca2 chen et al 2017d seo et al 2010 mg2 chen et al 2017d no3 tang et al 2015 yeo and choi 2013 f tang et al 2015 2016b br liu et al 2016a so4 2 tang et al 2017b thamilselvan et al 2018 b oh 4 avraham et al 2011 nh4 wimalasiri et al 2015 phosphate huang et al 2017a and organic contaminants e g ionizable dyes chen et al 2017c shi et al 2014 shi and zhitomirsky 2015a b and antibiotics wang et al 2018 here it should be pointed out that some of the ionic pollutants such as arsenic chromium phosphate are amphoteric ions which are a strong function of electrolyte ph values as the electrolyte ph values can fluctuate while charging m cdi cells the removal process of such ions becomes complicated meanwhile it is worth noting that some metal ions for example copper might be reduced to elemental copper and deposited on the electrodes during charging step huang et al 2014 this ion removal process is based on the mechanism of metal electroplating instead of capacitive deionization and is unfavorable to the performance stability of m cdi as electrode regeneration is difficult for both brackish water desalination and wastewater remediation concentrated streams would be more or less produced during desorption how to dispose the concentrated streams appropriately is a problem confronting flow by cdi and mcdi s applications while directly discharging the brine solution from brackish water desalination into the environment appears to be viable dealing with the concentrated solution from wastewater remediation normally requires more complex post treatment procedures among which recovery of specific ions from the concentrate solution e g recovery of sulfate via precipitation of high value minerals tang et al 2017b recovery of ammonium via air or steam stripping zhang et al 2018b and recovery of palladium via electrowinning kim et al 2017b represents an important research direction but the premise is that the concentration of the target ion should be high enough aside from the applications of brackish water desalination and wastewater remediation flow by cdi and mcdi have also been investigated as a tool towards disinfection el deen et al 2016 ge et al 2018 laxman et al 2015 pandit et al 2017 wang et al 2015a for example a high performance capacitive deionization disinfection cell was demonstrated by wang et al 2015a where the activated carbon ac electrodes were coated with a thin layer of cationic nanohybrids of graphene oxide graft quaternized chitosan go qc with inherent antimicrobial activity the go qc ac electrode could achieve ultrahigh killing i e 99 9999 6 log reduction of 106 cfu ml 1 e coli in water flowing continuously through the cell there is a recent report on the application of flow by cdi for water disinfection using commercially activated carbon cloth electrodes but most of the bacteria were not killed but only electro adsorbed on the electrodes as bacterial cells carry negative charges induced by the presence of phosphates and lipopolysaccharides laxman et al 2015 more recently pandit et al 2017 found that for both positive and negative applied potentials with a voltage window of 0 9 v there was an inverse relationship between the formation of pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm on the carbon electrodes and the magnitude of the applied potential it was believed that the relatively high potentials affected the redox potential across the cell membrane and disrupted redox homeostasis thereby inhibiting bacterial growth with a high applied voltage 1 5 v antimicrobial activity may also result from by products generated in situ e g chlorine oxidizing radicals hydrogen peroxide through the occurrence of faradaic reactions in a m cdi cell ge et al 2018 moreover flow by cdi and mcdi have been explored for selective removal of a specific ion from multi ionic solutions assuming that the initial concentrations of ion i and ion j are equal in the treated water flow by cdi and mcdi might present weak adsorption selectivity between the two ions because of their different diffusion coefficient ion charge number hydrated radius and electronegativity and the differential separation may become more evident with operating parameters appropriately adjusted dykstra et al 2016 tang et al 2017b to increase the extent of preferential ion adsorption certain improvements could be made for instance coating the carbon electrode surface with a material with high selectivity towards one specific ion su et al 2017 zuo et al 2018 or synthesizing a composite electrode by mixing carbon particles with a material with high affinity towards the ion of concern lee et al 2017a su and hatton 2017 an alternative approach to achieve preferential removal of a certain ion is utilizing an asymmetric cdi cell to selectively enable electro oxidation or electro reduction of one ion species while removing the other ion species via coulomb force this has been recently well demonstrated in the case of the selective removal and recovery of br from a mixed solution of br and cl using an asymmetric cdi cell where the applied potential is divided between the positive and negative electrodes asymmetrically cohen et al 2018 upon electro oxidation of br br2 molecules are formed and physically adsorbed on the surface of the positive electrodes when discharging the electrodes br2 molecules are reduced back to br and return to the solution as a key component in mcdi cells membrane might also play an important role in the selective ion removal if designed appropriately one specific example is that in a mcdi cell where the cem was replaced by a monovalent cation permselective exchange membrane a selective removal of monovalent and divalent cations was achieved thereby producing divalent cation rich solution the cation removal selectivity could get higher when total dissolved solids concentration decreased and ph increased choi et al 2016 in addition to the above applications solely based on cdi technologies flow by cdi and mcdi systems can be combined with other technologies synergistically to achieve various ultimate goals feng et al 2017 forrestal et al 2015 hou et al 2018 kim et al 2012a lee et al 2009 liang et al 2015 ma et al 2015 saleem et al 2018 tan et al 2018 wen et al 2014 for example by integrating a cdi system with a bioelectrochemical system a microbial capacitive desalination cell mcdc could be developed to remove organics and salts simultaneously without using any external energy see fig 4 stoll et al 2015 microbial degradation of organic compounds in the anode chamber generated an electron flow to reduce the electron acceptors in the cathode chamber taking advantage of the potential difference across the microbial anode and the air cathode ions in the desalination chamber were electrically adsorbed in the edls of porous carbon electrodes furthermore the mcdc allowed for the free transfer of protons from the anode chamber throughout the reactor and thus prevented significant ph changes a second example is combination of constant current operated flow by cdi system with reverse osmosis ro for the production of high quality ultrapure water and freshwater from seawater minhas et al 2014 a third example is combination of mcdi system with ion exchange ie process for nitrogen recovery from low strength wastewater wang et al 2017 mcdi acted as a pretreatment to preferentially remove the coexisting ca2 and mg2 thereby eliminating the negative effects of ca2 and mg2 on the subsequent ie ammonium recovery process with an eye towards the future we believe that more application potentials of flow by cdi and mcdi will be discovered this is evidenced by the very recent work of legrand et al 2018 who used mcdi cells to capture co2 in the form of bicarbonate and carbonate ions produced from the reaction of co2 with water moreover towards the applications of water desalination and wastewater remediation research involving studying the short term or long term influence of co occurrence of inorganic compounds and natural organic matter in real waters on the performance of flow by cdi and mcdi as well as the effective post operational cleaning methods will be a significant part of future efforts 2 1 3 operational mode generally there are two kinds of designs for the flow by cdi and mcdi studies with regard to fluid flow batch mode and single pass mode batch mode refers to a configuration whereby water is fed from a small container and the effluent of the cdi cells is returned to the feeding reservoir where water conductivity is measured the recycling reservoir should be small enough so that the change in the conductivity is distinguishable and can be measured accurately during adsorption the measured conductivity steadily decreases until it levels off at a low value indicating saturation of the electrodes porada et al 2013b salamat and hidrovo 2018 in contrast single pass mode refers to a configuration whereby water is fed from a large storage container and the effluent water leaving the cdi cells is either discarded or recycled to the feeding reservoir the conductivity of the treated water is measured directly at the exit of the cdi unit the volume of feeding reservoir should be large enough to ensure that the influent conductivity only changes slightly during successive cycles when both dilute and concentrated streams return to the feeding reservoir during adsorption the measured effluent conductivity will decrease rapidly and reach a minimum value upon applying a fixed charging voltage followed by a gradual increase to the inlet value porada et al 2013b although batch mode is simpler than single pass mode single pass operation is more common and efficient for practical situations because the treated water only passes through the cdi device once instead of being recycled many times to calculate ion removal efficiency and equilibrium adsorption capacity by flow by cdi and mcdi cells one needs to measure the effluent ion concentration with time for single electrolyte the ion concentration could be determined from the conductivity of the solution for mixtures of electrolytes water samples need to be collected at appropriate intervals and the ion concentrations then analyzed using analytical methods such as ion chromatography in addition there are commonly two kinds of charging modes for the adsorption step constant voltage and constant current and three kinds of discharging modes for the desorption step zero volt reverse voltage and reverse current porada et al 2013b among them constant voltage adsorption combined with zero volt desorption cv zvd is the most common and classical option while constant current adsorption combined with zero volt desorption cc zvd or reverse current desorption cc rcd is also a good alternative for flow by cdi and mcdi cells applying different operational modes for adsorption desorption cycle may result in different desalination performance one important choice that must be made is whether operation should be at constant voltage cv or constant current cc there are various criteria for determining this choice such as the desire for a constant effluent ion concentration or a low energy consumption from the perspective of effluent ion concentration cc mode is more favorable than cv mode because in contrast to the marked change in the outflow concentration at cv mode a stable and adjustable effluent ion concentration can be obtained at cc mode from the perspective of energy consumption in literature it is often reported that cc mode is both experimentally and theoretically superior to cv mode han et al 2015 kang et al 2014 qu et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 2013b main argument in support of this claim is that in cc operation the endpoint voltage is reached only at the end of the charging step hence accompanying with an overall lower cell voltage however recently three different voices arose based on both experimental assessment and theoretical analysis wang and lin 2018 suggested that whether cc or cv charging is more efficient for a given mcdi system is largely dependent on the target adsorption to be achieved and to a less extent on the kinetic rate of charging dykstra et al 2018 found that without energy recovery there is no difference in energy consumption between cc and cv operation if 50 of the energy released during discharge could be recovered cc has a somewhat lower energy consumption than cv by fourier transforming both cc and cv signals ramachandran et al 2018 found that cc is more energy efficient while charge efficiency is high but at high salt concentrations cv will be more energy efficient in regard of the desorption step it is worth mentioning that the reverse voltage approach is not feasible in flow by cdi because the ions released from one electrode can get quickly re adsorbed into the other electrode before they exit the cells whereas it is possible to operate at reversed voltage in mcdi as the ions released from one electrode cannot move into the other electrode because of the iems biesheuvel et al 2011 salamat and hidrovo 2018 zhao et al 2012 to date effort although not much has been directed towards developing new operational modes with regard to both fluid flow and power aspects of the charging and discharging modes to improve the performance e g average concentration reduction water recovery and energy consumption of m cdi technologies and some advances have been made gao et al 2017 garcia quismondo et al 2013 kim et al 2015 lu et al 2017 ramachandran et al 2018 saleem et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 2018c with respect to fluid flow garcia quismondo et al 2016 and hassanvand et al 2017 examined the use of a new operational procedure that utilizes a brine stream which is more concentrated than the feed solution to regenerate the m cdi unit during desorption and found that this significantly increased the energy efficiency and or water recovery with respect to power aspects gao et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018c demonstrated that using alternating polarization i e reversing electrode polarity every charging step could effectively enhance the cycling stability of flow by cdi systems kim et al 2015 described a new discharging modes for the desorption step that is applying a discharging voltage lower than the charging voltage but with the same polarity whereby the charge efficiency of a flow by cdi cycle could be increased to values close to unity and the energy consumption could be reduced with only a small loss of salt adsorption capacity further ramachandran et al 2018 developed a sinusoidal voltage current operation for flow by cdi as an efficient method and identified a system inherent resonant frequency that enables maximum concentration reduction as shown in fig 5 2 1 4 cell design besides synthesis of new electrode or membrane materials with improved physico chemical properties and development of new effective operational modes coming up with novel and superior cell designs based on fundamental structures of flow by cdi and mcdi is also conducive to enhancing the desalination performance as mentioned previously in mcdi the incorporation of iems leads to a remarkable improvement in the flow by cdi cell s desalination rate salt removal efficiency and charge efficiency a further enhancement of the desalination performance has been confirmed to be attainable via constructing new designs of mcdi cell considering that the resistance of mcdi is mainly located in the spacer compartment liang et al 2013 revealed that by packing the mcdi cell s flow chamber with ion exchange resin granules the modified mcdi delivered higher desalination rates salt removal efficiency and charge efficiency than the regular mcdi electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis showed that the packing of ion exchange resin granules greatly reduced the ohmic resistance of mcdi and as a result facilitated the ion transport across the flow channel and accordingly enhanced the desalination rate in the subsequent work conducted by the same research group bian et al 2015 2016 it was found that the commercially available and inexpensive granular activated carbon particles and the activated carbon fibers exhibited similar enhancements effects when employed as the mcdi s separator packing material following this line of thinking more promising alternative to the ion exchange resin granules are expected to turn up in future research recently kim et al 2017a presented a novel multichannel mcdi mc mcdi system by introducing two side channels surrounding the carbon electrodes while a conventional mcdi channel i e middle channel is located between an aem and a cem as schematically shown in fig 6 at a high salinity gradient between side 1000 mm and middle 5 mm channels this mc mcdi cell configuration exhibited an excellent salt adsorption capacity sac of 56 mg g 1 in the middle channel which was nearly four times larger than the maximum sac achievable in a conventional cdi cell though desalination occurred in the opposite direction of the concentration gradient meanwhile the sac was accomplished with a high charge efficiency close to unity and a low energy consumption the performance enhancement stemmed from the enhanced capacitance at high molar strength in the side channels and the double ion removal process during cell voltage inversion following this work kim et al 2018a explored and proved the feasibility of the mc mcdi cell in semi continuous production of clean water with the separated middle and side channels resulting in alternating desalination and regeneration most recently kim et al 2018b further modified the mc mcdi cell with one side channel filled with a highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte 1 m nacl in h2o and the other with a highly concentrated organic electrolyte 1 m naclo4 in propylene carbonate the novel mc mcdi cell using an aqueous organic bi electrolyte allowed extension of the cell voltage to 2 4 v and thus provided a superior sac of 63 5 4 mg g 1 in the middle channel with charge efficiency of 95 future work may capitalize on the use of alternative electrolytes e g acetonitrile or alternative electrode material e g intercalation type material 2 1 5 faradaic reactions whilst non faradaic processes such as capacitive ion storage and ion transport are at the heart of the cdi phenomenon it is recognized that faradaic reactions i e redox reactions occurring on the surface of and within the carbon electrodes also play important roles in the flow by cdi and mcdi systems on the one hand as one of the two main sources of energy losses resistive and parasitic losses in m cdi fig 7 hemmatifar et al 2016 faradaic reactions result in a decrease in energy efficiency since parasitic current generated by reduction or oxidation processes at the electrodes is not effective in adsorbing ions these redox reactions may also contribute to ph fluctuations in the effluent and deterioration of electrode stability and performance bouhadana et al 2011 choi 2014 cohen et al 2013 2015 shapira et al 2016 tang et al 2017a yu et al 2018 on the other hand the in situ formed reactive species such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and or free chlorine might be positively used in combination with ultraviolet irradiation or ozone for water disinfection and or degradation of organic contaminants he et al 2016 kim et al 2016c tang et al 2017a zhang et al 2018a there are two major types of faradaic reactions existing in the flow by cdi and mcdi systems namely i anodic reactions associated with oxidation of the carbon electrode chloride ions water etc ii cathodic reactions involving dissolved oxygen do reduction and other particular ions carbon oxidation refers to the phenomenon that the carbon anode sacrificially takes part in oxidation processes with the carbon converted into functional groups containing co and carbon dioxide zhang et al 2018a of all the anodic faradaic reactions carbon oxidation is the most important and attracts the most attention considering the high likeliness of its occurrence when the flow by cdi or mcdi cell is operated routinely the redox potential for carbon oxidation is 0 207 v she oh et al 2008 and the induced negative effects that may accrue such as pore structure impairment and mass loss with subsequent decrease in carbon electrode longevity and deterioration of cdi performance zhang et al 2018a long term flow by cdi experiments have been conducted by cohen et al 2013 18 days and omosebi et al 2014 50 h both of which showed reduction of the salt adsorption capacity caused by parasitic faradaic reactions strategies to evaluate the anodic oxidation of carbon electrodes include x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray mapping fourier transform infrared spectroscopy acid base titration and cyclic voltammetry cohen et al 2013 zhang et al 2018a among which xps method is quite effective in detecting the variation in oxygen functional groups reflected by o 1s spectrum and the loss of carbon reflected by c 1s spectrum from the electrodes after continuous charging discharging cycles to mitigate and or eliminate the anodic carbon oxidation a few approaches can be utilized including synthesis of oxidation resistant materials e g titania decorated carbon electrodes srimuk et al 2016 2017c employing novel cell architectures e g inverted capacitive deionization gao et al 2015a b and applying appropriate operational modes e g constant current charging and periodic polarity reversal dykstra et al 2018 gao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018c in addition to the anodic carbon oxidation anodic oxidation of chloride ions cl and water might occur during brackish water treatment on condition that the anode potentials of flow by cdi and mcdi cells are sufficiently positive to drive these redox reactions free chlorine cl2 could be generated through the direct oxidation of cl at the anode standard electrode potential e 0 1 36 v she followed by a hydrolysis reaction to form hypochlorous acid hclo hclo and its deprotonated form clo might be further oxidized to chlorate clo3 at the anode zhang et al 2018a under a higher standard electrode potential of 1 45 v she the direct oxidation of cl to clo3 may occur zhang et al 2018a in any cases cl at the surface of the anode rather than free cl in solution is supposed to be the main contributor to the generation of clo3 and this has been confirmed by the studies of lado et al 2013 and wouters et al 2013 who showed that the production rate of clo3 in the flow by cdi system increased with greater abundance of cl in the vicinity of the anode during adsorption in terms of anodic oxidation of water it occurs at a standard electrode potential of 1 23 v she and this is the reason why the m cdi process is generally operated at charging voltages below 1 23 v however in fact the potential difference across the cell might exceed the 1 23 v threshold to compensate for the circuit system resistance and hence no water electrolysis happens in these cases tang et al 2015 2016a 2017b lastly as a beneficial effect anodic oxidation reactions may contribute to the removal of certain organic compounds e g phenol and humic substances duan et al 2015 liu et al 2016a and inorganic pollutants e g arsenic iii and bromide ion cohen et al 2018 fan et al 2016 2017 lee et al 2016 from water through a combination of faradaic and non faradaic processes among the reduction reactions that take place at the cathode dissolved oxygen do reduction is the most common as do is prevalent in feed waters to cdi cells our recent batch mode cdi studies have revealed that significant concentrations of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 could be produced during charging in flow by cdi cells with the generation of h2o2 initiated by cathodic reduction of do with subsequent consumption occurring as a result of anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction of h2o2 and the reaction rate constants increase with an increase in charging voltage 0 5 1 5 v he et al 2016 tang et al 2017a kim et al 2016c and yu et al 2018 also reported the cathodic generation of h2o2 during a single pass flow by cdi operation an almost constant h2o2 concentration in the effluent was observed throughout the entire charging step and the h2o2 generation could provide one of explanations to the ph fluctuations fig 8 a schematically displayed all the faradaic reactions that may occur in the flow by cdi cell during charging including both cathodic reduction of do and anodic oxidation of carbon electrode and water in the absence of the occurrence of electrolyte mediated redox processes in contrast to the significant amount of h2o2 in flow by cdi cells almost no h2o2 was generated in mcdi cells with h2o2 concentrations relatively time invariant and typically 2 Œºm during charging and discharging as indicated in fig 8b tang et al 2017a owing to the attachment of iems to the surfaces of the carbon electrodes accessibility of oxygen to the electrodes is limited in the mcdi case with the resultant inhibition of the occurrence of do reduction reaction responsible for significant reduction in quantity of h2o2 produced in this system incorporation of the membranes to act as a barrier to limit do access to the electrode was also reported by omosebi et al 2014 who found more distinct perturbation of do in flow by cdi than mcdi during cell operation the findings arising from these studies raise the need to re examine the potential applications of flow by cdi and mcdi cells for example despite the poorer salt removal capacity and lower charge efficiency flow by cdi might be a better choice than mcdi when treating source waters containing microorganisms and or trace organic contaminants if the in situ formed h2o2 could be effectively used as a disinfectant and or used to produce more powerful oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals apart from do reduction cathodic reduction reactions may also play an important role in the sequestration of heavy metals e g cd ii v v from water as a result of the possible deposition of the metals at the electrode bao et al 2018 huang et al 2014 2016 liu et al 2011 yang et al 2014 faradaic reactions in flow by cdi and mcdi systems are attracting increasing attention from the academic and industrial world despite the achievements presented many questions remain with additional studies required to further improve the mechanistic understanding of faradaic reactions with the goal of effectively mitigating the negative effects of these processes whilst taking advantage of their positive effects 2 1 6 theoretical model while m cdi clearly has many attractions it is a sophisticated technology requiring careful selection of design and operating parameters for particular source waters laboratory or field based investigation of the effect of each parameter on m cdi performance is difficult in view of the difficulty in manipulating some parameters and the interconnectivity of others as such quantitative evaluation of the effect of particular parameters or design options is best achieved by developing theoretical models of key non faradaic and potentially faradaic processes tang et al 2016b apart from enabling optimization of both design and operating parameters the theoretical model also serves as a useful and essential tool to reveal the underlying causes of phenomena help to gain thorough understanding of the ion removal process and predict m cdi performance in all its facets including effluent ion concentration water recovery energy consumption average salt adsorption rate ion adsorption capacity ph fluctuations and so on biesheuvel et al 2015 hemmatifar et al 2017 kim et al 2015 porada et al 2013a tang et al 2015 2016a 2016b to describe ion storage in edls an appropriate edl structure model has to be established first basically the edl model describes that across the carbon electrolyte interface in the pores inside the carbon particles the surface electrical charge in the carbon matrix is directly charge compensated by counterions in the electrolyte porada et al 2013b initial well known edl structure models include the helmholtz model and the gouy chapman stern gcs model however neither of the two models properly captures the edls structure along typical cdi electrodes pore walls the helmholtz model assumes that counterions are all condensed in a plane right next to the carbon surface and necessitates a charge efficiency of unity but in fact the counterions remain diffusively distributed in a layer close to the surface and the charge efficiency of a m cdi cell is always below unity porada et al 2013b the gcs model assumes that the diffuse layer extending from one surface is not overlapping with that of a nearby surface nevertheless in standard microporous m cdi electrodes the pores where ions are primarily adsorbed pore diameter 2 nm are much smaller than the edl thickness and hence the edls are strongly overlapped porada et al 2013b suss et al 2015 a new edl structure model termed modified donnan md model was developed in 2011 by biesheuvel et al 2011 to tackle the situation of fully overlapped edls the md model assumes that edls lining the micropore walls are strongly overlapped thereby leading to a relatively constant value of diffuse layer potential and ion concentration across the pore radius the use of modified referred to two modifications of the classical donnan approach one by including a stern layer in between the carbon matrix and the diffuse layer and the other by considering a non electrostatic attraction physi or chemisorption term for the ions transporting into the micropores in the absence of electronic charge porada et al 2013b suss et al 2015 a further improvement can be made to the md model when the salt concentration is higher than 40 mm that is making the non electrostatic attraction inversely dependent on the total micropore ion concentration biesheuvel et al 2014 kim et al 2015 the md model can be easily included in the porous electrode mass transport theory to relate the local potential drop across the edls to the local ion flux into the edls the interplay between micro and macro scale transport mechanisms in the porous electrodes and bulk flow of a cdi unit dictates the ion concentration profile at the exit for batch mode operation a one dimensional transport model has been shown to work well in describing data sets for ion adsorption and charge storage in flow by cdi cells as it can be assumed that at every moment in time the specific ion concentration within the electrode macropores is equal to that in the spacer channel pipes and recycling reservoir porada et al 2013b tang et al 2015 for single pass operation a two dimensional transport model is required to quantify the dynamic ion electrosorption process hemmatifar et al 2015 tang et al 2016a b zhao et al 2013b in the water flow direction the spacer channel needs to be divided into a certain number m of annular ideally stirred volumes or sub cells in series with equal projected area under a constant current charging the electrodes should be discretized into m sequential sub cells in the same manner as shown in fig 9 in each of the m sub cells the current i i has the same value in the spacer channel in the membrane and in the electrode but this value differs between sub cells and changes in time according to previous studies the two dimensional transport model turns out to be a good approach in capturing the ion adsorption desorption dynamics and predicting cdi performance over a range of operating conditions cell arrangements and feed water compositions not only for a monovalent salt e g nacl solution but also for simple ionic mixtures tang et al 2016a b for example tang et al 2016a investigated fluoride removal from brackish groundwaters by single pass constant current flow by cdi and found that the developed relevant two dimensional transport model provided a satisfactory reproduction of the effluent fluoride concentrations as a function of fluoride chloride feed concentrations adsorption current and pump flow rate as shown in fig 10 although the flow by cdi device used in the work of tang et al 2016a did not lower fluoride below the maximum permissible water quality levels the studies described there enabled validation of a model that could subsequently be used to determine possible system configurations and operating conditions for realization of the target for classical cdi with unmodified electrodes the ionic charge density in the edls of micropores exactly compensates the electronic charge in the carbon matrix and the md model is applicable to this case however for chemically modified electrodes modification to the md model is necessary biesheuvel et al 2015 extended the md model by including an immobile chemical charge in the charge balance regarding flow by cdi cells with fixed chemical charges within the micropores and showed that the theory was able to capture and explain a variety of key features observed in experiments including inverted operation inversion peaks and enhanced performance based on the work of biesheuvel et al 2015 he et al 2018b further incorporated the effect of variable chemical charges due to faradaic reactions of redox active species immobilized on the electrode surfaces with respect to electrode micropores containing acidic and basic surface groups that can protonate or deprotonate based on their individual equilibrium constants and the micropore and electrolyte ph environments hemmatifar et al 2017 coupled the md model with the weak electrolyte acid base equilibria theory with results demonstrating an excellent agreement between experiments and the new model different from typical flow by cdi cells where fluid flow and electric field are perpendicular generally necessitating a two dimensional model approach the flow through cdi cell is a cell design that can be well described by a one dimensional model as the feed water flows straight through electrodes and parallel to the applied electric field direction up to now a few models have been successfully developed to describe the ion adsorption desorption dynamics and variation in electrical current in flow through cdi cells and has shown the value of modelling in elaborating the phenomena occurring in various scenarios which would otherwise be difficult to elucidate in any detail guyes et al 2017a hawks et al 2018 qu et al 2018 ongoing research and efforts might make it come true to model other features important to flow through cdi cells such as the effluent ph variations and the effects of chemical surface charge in porous electrodes owing to the existence of iems modelling the ion transport and storage in mcdi cells is more complicated than that in flow by cdi cells at the two membrane solution interfaces there exists donnan equilibrium both on the edge of the membrane with the spacer channel and on the edge of the membrane with the macropores in the electrode within the iems fixed charged groups are present with a high charge density x during transport across the membrane both co ion concentration and counterion concentration gradually change but their difference remains equal to x due to electroneutrality in the membrane galama et al 2013 by making some simplifications for example excluding transport of protons or hydroxyl ions assuming perfect symmetry in the cell taking the same diffusion coefficient for the cation and anion in the membrane neglecting accumulation of ions in the membrane setting zero water flow through the membrane mathematical models for the mcdi processes based on a fully dissociated monovalent salt solution like nacl could be established these mcdi processes include desalination dynamics and performance over a wide range of possible design and operational scenarios suss et al 2015 zhao et al 2013b though the mcdi community has covered some distance towards the ultimate goal of developing a robust model that confidently describes and predicts all possible data sets the mcdi modelling is still in its infancy many questions remain with additional studies required to further improve our understanding of this technology for example the conditions examined in literature are a highly simplified subset of those likely to be experienced in treating real waters where a greater range of ph a more extensive mixtures of ions and the presence of electrode fouling agents such as natural organic matter are to be expected transport modelling for mixtures of multiple ions in mcdi is still at an initial stage no papers exist that describe the effects of membrane thickness or membrane charge density on the ion selective electrosorption 2 2 flow through capacitive deionization with some modifications of a flow by cdi cell a cell named flow through cdi could be developed in which the feed water flows straight through electrodes rather than between the electrodes and parallel to the applied electric field direction cohen et al 2011 guyes et al 2017a 2017b hawks et al 2018 qu et al 2018 the earliest work on flow through cdi dates back to 1970 and was explored by johnson et al 1970 the following four decades saw little progress to flow through cdi until avraham et al 2009 utilized flow through electrodes in a three electrode cell to attempt to improve the charge efficiency one main advantage of flow through cdi over flow by cdi is that since the separator does not act as a major channel for fluid flow the separator thickness in the flow through cdi may be minimized from typically 200 500 Œºm to around 10 Œºm provided that no short circuit happens thereby allowing for more compact cells improved desalination rates and a higher reduction in salt concentration of the feed per unit of charge cohen et al 2015 guyes et al 2017b suss et al 2012 however flow through cdi cells suffer from greater feed pressures than flow by cdi cells for the same throughput in order to enable flowing through the electrodes at reasonable feed pressures flow through cdi cells generally require use of specialized electrode materials possessing relatively large macropores with diameters above 1 Œºm for example suss et al 2012 used hierarchical carbon aerogel monolith electrodes with macropore diameters of approximately 1 Œºm while cohen et al 2011 used activated carbon fiber electrodes with 100 Œºm gaps between fibers as the flow channels in addition to the reduced feed pressures it has to be noted that the electrodes should also possess nanometer scale micropores enabling high salt adsorption the requirement of both large macropores and small micropores seems to significantly limit the range of electrode materials suitable for flow through operation however a recent work by guyes et al 2017b has demonstrated that applying laser technique to perforate an array of channels with roughly 200 Œºm aperture diameters through the commercial cdi activated carbon electrodes could contribute to orders of magnitude improvement in the electrode hydraulic permeability without adverse influence on the electrodes salt adsorption capacity or gravimetric capacitance which implies that those electrode materials with high microporosity that are commonly employed in the flow by cdi cells are likely to be tuned into attractive choices for flow through electrodes another potential drawback of flow through cdi cells is that oxidation of the positive electrodes occurs at a faster rate in flow through cdi systems relative to flow by cdi systems though nitrogen sparging to eliminate dissolved oxygen in the feed water has been shown to extend the stability of flow through cdi cells to a level comparable to flow by cdi cells cohen et al 2015 guyes et al 2017a 2017b and surface chemical treatments of carbon electrodes has been shown to enhance the charge efficiency in flow through cdi processes cohen et al 2011 2 3 inverted capacitive deionization unsustainable cdi performance mainly loss of salt separation has been observed during cdi cycling operation under a constant voltage charging mode bouhadana et al 2011 cohen et al 2013 this performance degradation is primarily attributed to the formation of oxide e g carboxylic groups layers at the carbon surface via oxidation of the anode in an aqueous solution these oxides lead to changes in the surface charge states including point of zero charge phpzc and potential of zero charge e pzc cohen et al 2013 shapira et al 2016 in order to sustain desalination performance a novel cdi cell architecture termed inverted capacitive deionization i cdi was proposed by the research group of gao et al 2015b in 2015 the i cdi system involves the use of an anode with net negative surface charge and a cathode with net positive surface charge and consequently shows a completely opposite adsorption desorption behavior to the conventional cdi system with cell charging leading to ion desorption from the edls of the electrodes and cell discharging by short circuiting the anode and cathode leading to ion adsorption fig 11 a and b oyarzun et al 2018 gao et al 2015b demonstrated the i cdi concept via the use of pristine carbon xerogel with net positive surface charge as the cathode and modified carbon xerogel with net negative surface charge containing carboxylic groups and oxidized silicon as the anode a significant enhancement in the performance stability and an increase of 530 in lifetime were observed in the i cdi system compared to a conventional cdi system operated under similar conditions due to the mitigation of carbon oxidation at the anode in a more recent work gao et al 2015a constructed an i cdi cell using an amine treated cathode with nh3 groups providing net positive surface charge and an acid treated anode with coo groups providing net negative surface charge in comparison to the previous i cdi cell where a salt removal capacity of 1 7 mg g 1 was achieved at a maximum working voltage of 0 8 0 v this i cdi cell could offer a salt removal capacity of 5 3 mg g 1 at a maximum working voltage of 1 1 0 v representing a significant improvement with regard to both salt removal capacity and working voltage window wu et al 2016 further assembled an i cdi cell equipped with a quaternized poly 4 vinylpyridine modified activated carbon cathode and a nitric acid treated activated carbon anode and the cell exhibited excellent i cdi performance the working voltage window of the i cdi cell could reach 1 4 v and its salt removal capacity could be as high as 9 6 mg g 1 instead of synthesizing new carbon electrodes to expand the working voltage window gao et al 2018 developed a novel i cdi operational mode to improve the desalination performance in the conventional i cdi operational mode i e v charge 0 8 v and v discharge 0 v 0 8 0 v the i cdi cell exhibited a salt adsorption capacity sac of 6 0 0 8 mg g 1 with a stable salt separation lasting approximately 409 h in the novel i cdi operational mode 0 4 0 4 v it was found that not only was the separation process stabilized up to approximately 420 h but the sac also increased to 7 2 0 3 mg g 1 furthermore more stable ph and dissolved oxygen do responses were observed at 0 4 0 4 v compared to 0 8 0 v a reasonable explanation for such an improved performance was that the reduced v charge mitigated carbon oxidation at the anode and do reduction at the cathode while the reduced v discharge compensated for sac gao et al 2018 most recently oyarzun et al 2018 presented an i cdi cell for nitrate removal with the cell fabricated with an activated carbon cathode modified by cetrimonium bromide and an activated carbon anode modified by sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate it turned out that a successful nitrate removal up to more than 10 mg nano3 per g of both electrodes was achieved with this i cdi system suggesting that functionalized i cdi systems might have great potential for ionic pollutant removal inverted cdi features excellent operation longevity but lacks substantial salt removal capacity which is mainly limited by its relatively small working voltage window the i cdi working voltage window is regulated by the difference between e pzc of anode and e pzc of cathode as shown in fig 11c therefore optimizing the e pzc of electrodes specifically the anode needs a more positive e pzc whereas the cathode requires a more negative e pzc to enlarge the working voltage window of i cdi is of great importance generally introduction of negatively charged functional groups can shift e pzc to a more positive value while introduction of positively charged functional groups shifts e pzc to a more negative value wu et al 2016 in i cdi systems oxidation of the anode is not regarded as an adverse effect as is the case in conventional cdi systems in fact oxygen containing functional groups formed during carbon oxidation increase the net negative surface charge and shift e pzc of the anode to a more positive value thereby favorably contributing to the expansion of the intrinsic working voltage window however it is worth mentioning here that the continued formation of oxide layers at the surface of anode might result in an increase in the resistance of the anode whereby this layer eventually suppresses ionic storage in the i cdi cell causing performance degradation gao et al 2018 2 4 flow electrode capacitive deionization for conventional m cdi cells salt removal capacity is largely constrained by the fixed electrodes making conventional m cdi only suitable for treating brackish low salinity water in addition preparation of the fixed electrodes is kind of complicated and approximately 20 of the fabricated electrodes is made up of conductive agents e g carbon black and polymer binder e g polytetrafluoroethylene that have negligible ion adsorption capacity apart from adding dead mass the presence of polymer binder may also block a large amount of pore volume of the active carbon particles suss et al 2015 moreover conventional m cdi systems operate in an intermittent manner with a deionization period freshwater produced followed by a regeneration period wastewater produced in view of these limitations of conventional m cdi systems jeon et al 2013 pioneered the use of flowing electrodes and designed an innovative cdi cell architecture termed flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi to improve the performance of m cdi as shown in figs 2e and 12a typical fcdi cell geometry is similar to that of mcdi except for the electrode part in contrast to mcdi using the fixed electrode between current collectors and iems fcdi employs the aqueous suspensions of carbon particles flowing through a serpentine channel carved on the current collector when an electrical voltage is applied between the two current collectors of an fcdi cell ions present in the feed water would migrate through iems and enter the flow electrode where they would be eventually adsorbed on the suspended carbon material or dissolved in the aqueous phase of the flow electrodes with cations concentrated in the cathode chamber and anions concentrated in the anode chamber jeon et al 2013 moreno and hatzell 2018 nativ et al 2017 yang et al 2017b representative of an electrodialytical desalination mechanism the proportion of ions accumulated in the aqueous phase of the flow electrodes increases with intensified faradaic reactions producing h anode chamber and oh cathode chamber ma et al 2018 nativ et al 2017 on the basis of continuous inflow of fresh carbon electrodes fcdi exhibits an excellent desalting efficiency in a high concentration nacl solution attributed to the infinite ion adsorption capacity of the flow electrode as compared to the limited capacity of the static electrode used in conventional m cdi doornbusch et al 2016 jeon et al 2013 meanwhile fcdi enables a continuous desalinating behavior in the unit cell and steadily produces desalted water with electrode regeneration completed downstream of the cell by simply mixing the positive and negative carbon slurries followed by carbon separation from water via settling jeon et al 2013 2014 yang et al 2016a the two important features are visually described in fig 12b studies related to fcdi under such an operational mode indicated that the effluent nacl concentration would decrease rapidly and then reach a plateau jeon et al 2013 in contrast when a conventional m cdi cell is used the effluent nacl concentration would decrease rapidly and then increase and finally return to its original value as ion adsorption on the fixed electrodes reaches equilibrium porada et al 2013b since fcdi was proposed in 2013 fcdi has attracted many researchers interest studies aimed at enhancing fcdi performance and achieving a cost effective fcdi system have been performed in various aspects mainly including 1 flow electrode as flow electrode is the key element of fcdi extensive efforts have been made to optimize the carbon materials and aqueous electrolyte constituting the flow electrode for instance hatzell et al 2015 modified granular ac with nitric acid to increase the oxygen containing surface functional groups and then used the oxidized ac for flow electrodes it was found that chemical oxidation of ac was favorable to reducing the viscosity of carbon suspension and resultantly a higher carbon content could be used without increasing pumping energy when using oxidized ac while the increased carbon loading contributed to a decrease in the deionization energy consumption and an increase in salt removal efficiency similarly park et al 2016 prepared surface modified ac suspensions ac coated with trimethylammonium for flow anode and ac coated with sulfonate for flow cathode to achieve a higher carbon loading without sacrificing the flowability viscosity considering the excellent conductivity of carbon black facilitating charge transfer liang et al 2017 added a certain dosage of carbon black with an average diameter of 12 Œºm into the ac flow electrodes leading to a decrease in the fcdi s internal resistance and consequently an improved charge efficiency ma et al 2016b developed redox active flow electrodes by adding 14 mm hydroquinone to 1 wt activated charcoal suspension and demonstrated that the presence of aqueous hydroquinone benzoquinone couple in flow electrodes enhanced electron transfer significantly and facilitated both salt adsorption and desorption processes as a result of the facile redox transformation between hydroquinone and benzoquinone yang et al 2016a fabricated flow electrodes using an aqueous electrolyte with a high salt concentration 2 44 wt and confirmed that this method was effective to reduce the internal resistance of the electrode chambers and improve fcdi s desalting efficiency thereby successfully overcoming the limitations of flow electrodes using low concentrated salt water as an electrolyte for the use of fcdi doornbusch et al 2016 developed a fcdi system leveraging upflow fluidized bed electrodes and showed that the carbon loading in the flow electrode could reach 35 wt while maintaining flowability which promised more effective electric charge percolation through the electrode than previously used flow electrodes maximum carbon loading 20 wt cohen et al 2016 introduced a novel class of suspension electrodes combining dilute slurries and dense upflow fluidized beds with results showing that a synergetic effect could be achieved in the enhancement of electrode electronic conductivity when adding dilute slurry to dense fluidized bed xu et al 2016 proposed an asymmetric fcdi system by using activated carbon ac mno2 suspension as the anode and ac suspension as the cathode so as to improve the operation voltage to 1 8 v thereby achieving a much higher salt removal efficiency than conventional fcdi 2 cell design to maximize the advantages of fcdi lower fcdi s construction investment and operation costs and simply the fcdi cell system for facile scale up several research groups have focused efforts on improving the fcdi cell design gendel et al 2014 developed a truly continuous fcdi process where water desalination brine production and electrode regeneration were all performed continuously and simultaneously the feed water is split between two fcdi cells with the same configuration but with reversed potential both carbon slurries are continuously recirculated between the two fcdi modules one producing desalinated stream and the other producing concentrated stream however this system suffers from high energy consumption originated from application of a voltage for water desalination in the first module and additionally for electrode regeneration in the second module as well as the circulation pumping of two flow electrodes following this work rommerskirchen et al 2015 further designed a continuous fcdi system that comprised only one module and one flow electrode performing the same function as that introduced by gendel et al 2014 see fig 12c the single flow electrode and single module fcdi desalination system is beneficial to reducing energy and investment costs and lowering the threshold to a large scale implementation in the majority of fcdi cell architectures the flow electrodes are separated from the feed water channel by iems as shown in figs 2e and 12a yet hatzell et al 2014a proposed a membrane free fcdi configuration that could potentially develop into a low cost system specifically two flow electrodes prepared by mixing sea or brackish water with activated carbon flow through electrode compartments with a porous separator in between at the end of electrode compartments charged carbon particles carrying counterions are sieved via the use of polymeric or non woven glass fibers to produce desalinated water after sieving the carbon can be flushed in a high concentration stream discharged and recycled for further use in an effort to simplify the fcdi cell system lee et al 2018c combined the spacer and iems into a single unit by coating the iems 17 wt poly phenylene oxide in n methyl 2 pyrrolidone as aem solution and 20 wt poly phenylene oxide in dimethylacetamide as cem solution on the surface of a porous ceramic structure acting as the spacer this combination avoids the use of costly free standing iems and makes fcdi cells readily scaled up recently as a ground breaking design a highly compact and scalable three dimensional 3d fcdi system was realized by utilizing honeycomb shaped porous lattice scaffolds and by coating an iem aem or cem solution and a graphene layer within appropriate channels as shown in fig 13 cho et al 2017 the 3d fcdi system does not require the water channel spacer layer free standing iems and thick current collectors which makes the size of each cell much smaller and more compact than typical fcdi cells thereby allowing for a high volumetric efficiency moreover the unit cell can be scaled up readily in three dimensions and the desalination efficiency and capacity significantly increase as the cell size or number is extended see fig 13 3 energy harvesting harvesting recovering energy to minimize the overall energy consumption of fcdi system is another important aspect it has been reported that during constant current discharge approximately 20 of the supplied energy in a fcdi cell charged by constant voltage could be recovered by energy extraction using an external circuit when the ions stored in the flow electrodes are released into salt water jeon et al 2014 furthermore it has been demonstrated that using a flow electrode system for continuous energy harvesting is feasible via capacitive mixing from naturally available differences in water salinity see fig 14 and concentration differences in bicarbonate ions hco3 dissolved in water from the exhaust gases of a power plant with high levels of co2 versus the low co2 concentration in air see fig 15 hatzell et al 2014b porada et al 2014 which provides a new platform for harvesting energy and has the potential to impact on the fields of energy and water technology also of note is that fcdi systems can be integrated with other technologies to provide synergy towards desalination one example is combining fcdi with neutralization dialysis nd to fabricate a cell named capacitive neutralization deionization with flow electrodes fcnd wang et al 2016 the only difference between fcdi and fcnd is that the acidic e g hcl and the alkaline e g naoh solutions are used in the flow electrode channels in place of salt solutions in fcnd cells capacitive adsorption of salt ions occurs simultaneously during the neutralization dialysis process which makes fcnd perform better than individual fcdi or nd in terms of average salt adsorption rate and salt removal efficiency a second example is coupling fcdi with nanofiltration nf with an energy efficient hybrid desalination process achieved with tunable salt rejection and high water recovery for high salinity brackish water 10000 mg l 1 nacl choi et al 2017 it turned out that the hybrid fcdi nf system provided 20 energy saving compared to the best reported energy consumption of a brackish water reverse osmosis unit beyond the application of brackish and sea water desalination fcdi has also been investigated for other applications fang et al 2018 he et al 2018a linnartz et al 2017 nativ et al 2018 yang et al 2016b zhang et al 2018b for example fcdi operated in short circuited closed cycle mode was found to be a cost effective technology for brackish water softening with the charge neutralization achieved by continuous mixing of the carbon particles significantly inhibiting scale formation on the electrode surface he et al 2018a fcdi for a salt metathesis process was demonstrated by linnartz et al 2017 where four identical fcdi cells were used to generate a concentrated valuable magnesium sulfate mgso4 solution from dilute mgcl2 and na2so4 or k2so4 solutions further fcdi systems have been employed as a method for the recovery of valuable chemicals from low strength wastewaters fang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b zhang et al 2018b combined a fcdi unit with a hydrophobic gas permeable hollow fiber membrane contactor and used the hybrid system for removal and recovery of ammonium nh4 from dilute wastewaters during operation nh4 migrates across the cem and accumulates in the fcdi cathode chamber where alkaline environment favors the conversion of nh4 to dissolved nh3 aq followed by a production of nh3 g ma et al 2016b nativ et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b nh3 g will readily diffuse through the gas permeable membrane into an acid solution and be recovered as an ammonium salt that can potentially be marketed as a fertilizer as shown in fig 16 3 cells with battery electrodes 3 1 hybrid capacitive deionization m cdi is highlighted as a desalination technology in which ions are harvested and stored in the electric double layers of capacitive electrodes the ion removal capacity of m cdi systems is somewhat limited and thus not sufficient for desalting high concentration saline water meanwhile the energy consumption of m cdi systems for treating high salinity water significantly exceeds the energy required for reverse osmosis systems srimuk et al 2017a consequently an important task for current research is to overcome the intrinsic limitations of m cdi for brackish water and make the technology accessible to higher molar concentrations inspired from the burgeoning field of energy storage such as lithium ion batteries and sodium ion batteries a highly promising approach is to replace one of the two capacitive electrodes with a battery i e faradaic electrode with this novel desalination technique referred to as hybrid capacitive deionization hcdi the typical hcdi cell architecture is shown in fig 2f and aem is not required in some cases srimuk et al 2017b apart from being able to reduce energy consumption and avoid parasitic reactions through the use of a smaller voltage window battery electrodes could offer a higher specific capacity than capacitive electrodes since ions are not just absorbed on the surface of battery electrodes but also being intercalated into their crystal structures via chemical bonds guo et al 2018 lee et al 2014 suss and presser 2018 normally a sodium battery electrode instead of a chloride battery electrode is employed because materials for sodium ion faradaic intercalation de intercalation are diverse and have been intensively investigated while materials for chloride ion faradaic intercalation de intercalation are limited lee et al 2014 first introduced the concept of hcdi in 2014 with the hcdi cell composed of a na4mn9o18 a representative positive electrode material for sodium ion batteries electrode as the cathode a porous activated carbon electrode as the anode and an aem placed adjacent to the carbon electrode prior to desalination tests a certain voltage vs ag agcl needed to be applied to the na4mn9o18 electrode for an appropriate duration of time to extract na na 4 mn 9 o 18 na 4 9 x mn 9 o 18 9 x na 9 x e desalination process was initiated by applying a positive voltage with the result that na was intercalated into na4mn9o18 electrode via chemical reactions na 4 9 x mn 9 o 18 9 x na 9 x e na 4 mn 9 o 18 while cl was physically adsorbed in the electric double layers formed at the surface of porous carbon electrode reversely desorption process occurred by applying a negative voltage to release the captured ions the hcdi system exhibited more than double the salt removal sorption capacity 31 2 mg g 1 than a conventional cdi system 13 5 mg g 1 and revealed a rapid ion removal rate and excellent stability successfully demonstrating its superior deionization performance besides na4mn9o18 other na faradaic electrodes such as na2fep2o7 kim et al 2016b nati2 po4 3 huang et al 2017b and prussian blue pb guo et al 2017 have also been explored and it was found that pairing these na battery electrodes with a capacitive activated carbon as a hcdi cell also led to significantly improved salt adsorption capacity compared to that of traditional m cdi cells fig 17 summarizes the materials that have been reported to exhibit reversible sodium ion faradaic insertion release in sodium ion batteries within the decomposition voltage of water chihara et al 2013 deng et al 2014 guo et al 2017 jung et al 2014 kim et al 2012b 2016b liu et al 2016b palomares et al 2012 park et al 2011b senguttuvan et al 2011 song et al 2014 su and wang 2013 wang et al 2015b whitacre et al 2010 wu et al 2015b 2018 yu et al 2015 zhao et al 2013a zhu et al 2013 2017 that is the potential materials that may be applied in hcdi generally materials with higher specific capacity mah g 1 are expected to store a greater amount of charge and thus provide a larger sac here it is worth noting that in addition to the pursuit of a large sac other factors should be also considered for example the poor electrical conductivity and relatively high capital cost of na battery electrode materials hinder the advancement of hcdi to some degree to address this issue an effective method is to synthesize the composite of carbon and na battery electrode materials with both characteristics of a battery and a capacitor specifically depositing thin layers of mno2 onto carbon substrates provides an efficient alternative to bulk na insertion materials i e mno2 by preserving the rich internal pore structures and excellent electrical conductivity of the carbon substrate while minimizing the mn mass required to achieve increased capacity and cation selectivity hand and cusick 2017 apart from the benefits of resolving low electrical conductivity and reducing capital cost of bulk na insertion de insertion materials it was reported that utilizing the composite of carbon and na battery electrode materials also contributes to an improved cycling performance divyapriya et al 2018 huang et al 2017b zhou et al 2018 representing an inverted version of the typical hcdi cells yoon et al 2017 constructed a hcdi cell consisting of a chloride battery electrode anode a capacitive carbon electrode cathode and a cem the chloride battery electrode was fabricated by coating a small amount of ag onto a capacitive carbon electrode via photo induced reduction reaction compared to the cdi cell assembled with a pair of capacitive carbon electrodes and one cem the ag coated hcdi cell led to an significant improvement in the deionization capacity 88 more maximum deionization rate 39 more and charge efficiency 76 92 which could be explained by the enhanced specific capacity combining the capacitance of carbon electrode and ag mediated charge transfer reaction ag cl agcl e moreover the ag coated hcdi was found to be superior to the mcdi in terms of energy consumption 3 2 desalination battery unlike a hcdi cell combing a battery electrode e g sodium manganese oxide and a capacitive electrode e g porous carbon a desalination battery cell is composed of two different battery electrodes one for cation faradaic intercalation de intercalation and the other for anion faradaic intercalation de intercalation fig 2h iems could be placed in front of each electrode to enhance performance by blocking the co ions during the capture release process generally a constant current instead of a constant voltage is applied for both desalination and salination steps and the charging discharging process is performed until the cell voltage reaches a pre determined value in desalination battery systems the unit f g 1 employed to describe the capacitance of capacitive materials becomes useless and the unit mah g 1 employed to represent the specific capacity of battery materials should be adopted since charge and cell voltage are no longer behaving like those in a capacitor the concept of desalination battery was first proposed and demonstrated by pasta et al 2012 with the cell consisting of a ag negative electrode and a na2mn5o10 positive electrode tests were conducted in a static 300 Œºl electrolyte the desalination cycle is started with charging the electrodes in the absence of mobile sodium and chloride ions rendering na2mn5o10 oxidized into mno2 during the desalination cycle cl is chemically captured from the electrolyte to the silver electrode forming agcl eq 1 while na is chemically intercalated in the bulk of mno2 electrode forming na2mn5o10 eq 2 the reverse process will happen during the desorption cycle as shown in eq 3 and eq 4 specifically a complete cycle of the agna2mn5o10 system includes four steps 1 fully charged electrodes are immersed in seawater desalination occurs by applying a negative constant current 2 removal of the desalinated water and replenishment of new seawater 3 releasing the ions incorporated in the first step and creating concentrated seawater by applying a positive constant current 4 replacing the concentrated seawater with new seawater and the system is ready for the next cycle a low energy consumption of 0 29 kwh m 3 for the desalination process removal of 25 salt was achieved using this novel cell design and fast exchange of ions between the solid and the liquid phase occurred na and cl could potentially be selectively removed however in spite of a landmark study there was no report about the adsorption capacity of the electrodes and only one cycle was carried out in the agna2mn5o10 system with the cycle repeatability unknown in addition oxidation of na2mn5o10 to mno2 prior to desalination cycle resulted in noticeable polarization causing a decreased capacity 1 adsorption process a g c

based on the pioneer work of pasta et al 2012 chen et al 2017a advanced the dual ion electrochemistry deionization system by using agcl as the negative electrode na0 44mno2 as the positive electrode and flowing nacl solution as the electrolyte feed nacl solution was pumped through the agclna0 44mno2 deionization device and then flowed back when a positive current is applied cl is electrochemically released from the agcl electrode agcl e ag cl while na is electrochemically de intercalated from the na0 44mno2 electrode na 0 44 mno 2 na 0 44 x mno 2 x na x e to the flow electrolyte when switching to negative current na and cl are extracted from the flow electrolyte to their corresponding electrodes undergoing the reverse redox reactions through 100 cycling tests the agclna0 44mno2 system was found to possess a stable and reversible salt adsorption capacity of 57 4 mg g 1 at 100 ma g 1 current density which is much higher than that obtained by traditional or hybrid cdi device the average charge efficiency is high up to 0 979 0 956 during the salt desorption adsorption process in another study by kim et al 2017c selective na separation from a solution containing diverse cations na k ca2 and mg2 using the agclna0 44mno2 system was investigated with experimental results indicating that in an electrolyte where the cations had equal molar concentrations the selectivity toward na was over 13 times higher than k and 6 8 times higher than ca2 and mg2 with respect to cl capturing intercalation electrode material silver shows several advantages stability of potential corrosion resistance and bactericidal properties pasta et al 2012 nevertheless high cost of ag 553 usd kg 1 and poor electrical conductivity of agcl will limit the usage of ag agcl electrode in practical and large scale desalination battery cells as such seeking a sustainable efficient and economical cl storage electrode is of considerable importance bi biocl electrode a recently discovered cost effective 9 8 usd kg 1 for bi and stable insoluble in a wide ph and potential range cl capture release electrode opens up new possibilities for electrochemical cl removal or desalination applications chen et al 2017b carried out a similar study to their previous work chen et al 2017a by replacing agcl electrode with biocl electrode while keeping na intercalation electrode material unchanged with this modification contributing to an enhancement in salt adsorption capacity from 57 4 mg g 1 to 68 5 mg g 1 the redox reactions occurred during salt desorption and adsorption processes in the bioclna0 44mno2 system are described as follows 6 desorption process 3 b i o c l 3 e b i b i 2 o 3 3 c l 7 n a 0 44 m n o 2 n a 0 44 x m n o 2 x n a x e 8

a c l interestingly when bi is employed as the cl storage positive electrode the electrochemical reaction involving its conversion to biocl is significantly different from that shown in eq 8 nam and choi 2017 for example in a desalination battery cell composed of a bi positive electrode and a nati2 po4 3 negative electrode desalination happens as a result of the following electrochemical

b i o c l 2 h normally new seawater ph neutral is used as feedwater for desorption process however in this case the kinetics of cl release from biocl would be slow as protons are needed to facilitate reduction of biocl to bi by serving as oxygen acceptors biocl 2 h 3 e bi cl h 2 o it was suggested to address this issue by the use of an acidic solution 70 mm hcl during desorption since battery electrodes used in batch mode tests can be lifted out of the desalinated water after desalination and immersed into a different solution for desorption another possible drawback of the bi nati2 po4 3 system is an imbalance in na and cl storage as can be seen from eq 13 the molar ratio of na and cl stored in the bi nati2 po4 3 cell during desalination is 3 1 rather than 1 1 which indicates that when na in the seawater is completely removed two thirds of cl would still remain in the solution with charge neutralized by h produced during the transformation of bi to biocl a solution to this issue was proposed i e adopting a hydrogen evolution electrode to replace the nati2 po4 3 electrode to perform reduction of h to h2 while bi electrode finishes removing the remaining cl a promising desalination battery design is expected to possess properties of operational convenience low cost low energy consumption high ion removal capacity and performance stability among the desalination battery cells developed so far the bioclna0 44mno2 cell appears to be the most practical however in order to render desalination battery a truly feasible method for seawater desalination development of better combinations of cl storage battery electrode and na storage battery electrode is still required and deserves continuing research input discovering new cl or na capturing intercalation electrode material and synthesizing composite electrodes via the use of existing materials to achieve synergistic effects e g incorporation of agcl into porous carbonaceous materials to overcome the disadvantage of poor electrical conductivity of agcl represent two important research directions 3 3 cation intercalation desalination as previously described in cells of hcdi and desalination battery a na intercalation battery electrode is paired with a different electrode for cl adsorption either a capacitive electrode or an cl intercalation battery electrode considering that very few options are available for cl intercalation materials in a separate direction toward mitigating the issue of anion storage a new cell architecture referred to as cation intercalation desalination cid to reveal the underlying desalination mechanism has been recently proposed by employing na intercalation materials for both electrodes with the electrodes separated by an aem smith and dmello 2016 the typical cell configuration of cid is displayed in fig 2g from which we can see the principle of desalination the cid system operates similar to rocking chair batteries as shown by the movement of ions during alternating charging and discharging steps during charging na is removed from the negative compartment solution by the intercalating electrode while cl migrates through the membrane leaving the negative compartment solution resulting in a desalinated stream the positive compartment accepted na from the de intercalating electrode and cl passing through the membrane resulting in a concentrated stream during discharging the movement of ions is reversed as well as the desalinated and concentrated effluent tanks in contrast to cells of flow by cdi flow through cdi mcdi i cdi hcdi and desalination battery requiring a regeneration step cid cells enables a continuous production of desalinated solutions smith and dmello 2016 first introduced this novel configuration in 2016 for desalination of brackish water and seawater by using symmetric na intercalation electrodes i e electrodes with identical chemical composition but with a different degree of intercalation separated by either a porous separator commonly used in sodium ion batteries or an aem and originally referred to it as na ion desalination an ideal two dimensional porous electrode model was used to predict the performance of the proposed cells na0 44mno2 type and nati2 po4 3 type with theoretical results indicating that aem was able to achieve a higher degree of desalination than porous separator and the na0 44mno2 based cid cell enabled a 59 64 drop in influent salinity with water recovery levels up to 80 and 95 for 700 mm and 70 mm nacl influent respectively as na0 44mno2 and nati2 po4 3 are not very stable na0 44mno2 tends to degrade as a result of over dis charge while nati2 po4 3 tends to hydrolyze in moderate ph solutions smith 2017 conducted a further study in which the performance of cid cells with various membrane and flow arrangements was theoretically evaluated while the two electrodes were made from nickel hexacyanoferrate nihcf prussian blue analogue na2nife ii cn 6 as the anode and nanife iii cn 6 as the cathode see fig 18 three cid cell designs were employed a flow through cell a flow by cell and a membrane flow by cell the membrane flow by cell could be scaled up to form an electrodialysis ed stack that utilizes na intercalation electrodes rather than the gas evolution reactions typically used in ed simulation results revealed that the membrane flow by cell was superior to the other two cells i e flow through cell and flow by cell due to its flowability high capacity and low polarization additionally it was predicted that ed stacks using nihcf electrodes exhibited several advantages including improved salt adsorption capacity relative to membrane flow by cell decreasing energy consumption per volume of diluate produced with increasing stack size and capability of desalinating large volumes of water efficiently by continuously removing 0 4 0 5 m nacl from 0 7 m influent within diluate streams smith 2017 following from these two studies the cid concept was demonstrated experimentally using symmetric na intercalation electrodes kim et al 2017d porada et al 2017 and asymmetric na intercalation electrodes lee et al 2017b kim et al 2017d assembled a flow by cid cell using symmetric copper hexacyanoferrate cuhcf electrodes and investigated effects of stack size from single stacked cell to triple stacked cell on the desalination performance of brackish nacl solution experimental results were consistent with the previous predictions by smith 2017 that stacking additional aems and cems between na intercalation electrodes could increase salt adsorption capacity and reduce energy consumption per volume of diluate produced in spite of the benefits of increasing stack size it should be pointed out that a trade off is required between desalination performance and the need to minimize the number of iems due to their high cost porada et al 2017 constructed a flow behind cid cell using symmetric nihcf electrodes and successfully demonstrated its continuous desalination of brackish nacl kcl solutions moreover a threefold preferential adsorption of k over na was observed in aqueous nacl kcl mixtures which indicates the potential of nihcf electrodes for selective ion separation from mixed ionic solutions lee et al 2017b developed a batch mode cid cell using asymmetric na intercalation electrodes nanihcf as the anode and nafehcf as the cathode and evaluated its feasibility of treating actual seawater with experimental results showing that this system had a high desalination capacity 59 9 mg g 1 with efficient energy consumption and good stability considering the high cost imperfect permselectivity and finite lifespan of iems seeking for an alternative to iems in cid cells is of significance most recently liu and smith 2018 used a two dimensional porous electrode model to study the cycling behavior of cid cell that uses porous diaphragms rather than aem to limit salt diffusion between the two nihcf electrodes though losses in charge efficiency were incurred as a result of the diaphragm s lack of selectivity toward anions simulation results suggested that a similar desalination can be achieved in the diaphragm based cell relative to an aem based cell if high enough current is applied future development of cid device will benefit from on going research in sodium ion batteries the materials that have been reported to exhibit reversible sodium ion faradaic insertion release in sodium ion batteries within the decomposition voltage of water could probably be applied in cid and these materials have been summarized in fig 17 meanwhile anion intercalation desalination representing an inverted version of cid would be a research hotspot if cl intercalation materials flourish in addition while cid holds great promise some advancement could further improve performance for example by improving cell design through reduced internal resistances using forced convection of electrolyte within intercalation electrodes and flowing concentrate and dilute streams in opposing directions 4 perspectives and outlook it takes no more than two decades for the cdi community to develop into one of the most eye catching research areas and it is expected that the coming years will see a further explosive growth of cdi towards a more mature and advanced technology nowadays cdi embraces various cell architectures with either capacitive electrodes or battery electrodes including flow by cdi flow through cdi membrane cdi mcdi inverted cdi i cdi flow electrode cdi fcdi hybrid cdi hcdi desalination battery and cation intercalation desalination cid with each of them demonstrating unique features and functionalities and achieving remarkable advancements one question has arisen from the fast proliferation of cdi cell architectures which cell configuration is the most promising from our perspective it is hard to get a clear answer as each of the cdi cell architectures has unique advantages and disadvantages and none should be neglected in future research work for example flow by cdi stands out owing to its simple structure without the need of expensive iems or pumping energy requirements for flow electrodes mcdi presents higher charge efficiency than flow by cdi at the cost of significantly more expensive cell components flow through cdi allows for more compact cells and improved desalination rates but suffers from greater feed pressures than flow by cdi for the same throughput i cdi features excellent operation longevity but lacks substantial salt removal capacity fcdi exhibits continuous deionization and a high desalting efficiency but suffers from a low electronic conductivity in the flow electrodes and additional energy cost for electrode transport cdi cells with battery electrodes hcdi desalination battery and cid regularly achieve salt adsorption capacity far exceeding that of cdi cells with capacitive electrodes however battery electrodes exhibit a slower salt removal and incur a higher capital cost relative to capacitive electrodes suss and presser 2018 flow by cdi and mcdi are the two most widely studied cell architectures in the cdi field a remarkable number of innovations have been realized with key aspects focusing on materials application operational mode cell design faradaic reactions and theoretical models even so the research on flow by cdi and mcdi necessitates ongoing efforts and there are several important issues requiring a great focus in the near future 1 identifying the most appropriate pore size distribution of carbon based electrodes for ion adsorption will remain the subject of further studies while large specific surface area is a prerequisite for efficient ion adsorption some materials with inherent high surface area yield a poor ion removal performance owing to the lack of macropores allowing for fast ion transport 2 recovery of the energy released during discharge is essential if m cdi is to become a competitive water treatment technology as a consequence the energy consumption with energy recovery is most likely to be a more appropriate performance metric than the energy consumption without energy recovery in future research 3 many works in the literature show only the first or a few initial cycles and in some cases even used materials with known low stability in water therefore it is of importance to study the long term desalination performance and report the cyclic stability 4 field tests utilizing pilot scale or large scale m cdi facilities have not been adequately addressed such studies will provide valuable information about scalability system cost salinity limits and electrode membrane s behavior after long periods of operation etc meanwhile additional pre and post processing may need to be explored desalination performance and performance stability are largely determined by the electrode material with the emergence of hcdi desalination battery and cid cells the era exclusive to carbon materials for cdi electrode has ended the exploration of battery electrodes as desalination electrodes has just begun with a great promise in desalination of high salinity streams to develop new cation or anion storage faradaic electrode materials it is convenient to take inspiration from the highly developed energy storage field such as ion batteries over the past decades the energy storage field has developed hundreds of potential candidate materials a deep well to explore for desalination many of the strategies proposed to improve the function of intercalation electrodes might be also applicable to desalination systems it should be noted that it is also possible to have not just an electrode but a redox active electrolyte as the battery electrode lee et al 2018b the electric charge can be stored in the bulk electrolyte by redox activities of the electrolyte itself these redox electrolytes are promising for energy storage systems particularly when they are combined with highly porous carbon electrodes it is likely to draw inspiration from this research area to make it also applicable to the cdi field for water treatment other research efforts in battery electrodes derive from the problems remaining to be resolved for example most of battery electrodes investigated so far are only efficient for capturing a specific ion while attractive for removal of particular ions such as key pollutants or scalants in feed waters this selectivity limits their application in desalination of complex source waters containing multiple types of ions requiring removal such as most brackish water and seawater another example is related to the stability of already proposed battery electrode materials like cells with capacitive electrodes it is also important to investigate the long term performance of cells with battery electrodes or long term influence of co occurrence of inorganic compounds and natural organic matter though researchers have claimed that these battery electrodes can be operated for hundreds of cycles without obvious performance degradation undesired leakage of metal ions from the intercalation materials might happen during prolonged operation potentially causing risks when used for drinking water desalination zhang et al 2018a one exciting development in the field of cdi is the emergence of fcdi cells by continuously replenishing the electroactive region with uncharged carbon based materials fcdi systems not only exhibit excellent salt adsorption capacity 20 mg of nacl g 1 enabling treatment of high salinity water but also allow for a continuous production of freshwater combined with a continuous regeneration of the electrodes while cells with fixed electrode such as flow by cdi and mcdi have been extensively studied and their performance limits are largely known fcdi is still in the initial developing stage and many possibilities for its future advances exist since polymer binders that have counter productive effects on ion adsorption are not needed in the preparation of flow electrodes fcdi is leading to a revolutionary change in the selection of carbon materials and their synthesis one major current challenge faced by fcdi is the inefficient charge transfer between the current collectors and flow electrodes and much work remains towards addressing this issue in summary cdi is a promising water treatment technology and an exciting research field despite its related challenges with a continuing search for solutions to these challenges and a continuing springing up of novel unexplored cell architectures cdi may be considered as a key to solving the worldwide water shortage and water pollution in the future 5 conclusions sharing many similarities with supercapacitor battery technologies in the energy storage field cdi is an electrochemical water treatment process that operates by adsorbing ions in the electric double layers of capacitive electrodes via electrostatic interaction or in the crystal structures of battery electrodes via reversible faradaic intercalation the cdi field has grown exponentially over the past decade and is attracting increasing attention herein a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in various cell architectures of cdi has been presented including flow by cdi flow through cdi mcdi i cdi fcdi hcdi desalination battery and cid particularly the flow by cdi and mcdi with their key research activities subdivided into materials application operational mode cell design faradaic reactions and theoretical models current challenges associated with the development of various cdi cell architectures are discussed and future research and prospects for cdi are also suggested this review

19091,this paper aims to stimulate discussion based on the experiences derived from the quics project quantifying uncertainty in integrated catchment studies first it briefly discusses the current state of knowledge on uncertainties in sub models of integrated catchment models and the existing frameworks for analysing uncertainty furthermore it compares the relative approaches of both building and calibrating fully integrated models or linking separate sub models it also discusses the implications of model linkage on overall uncertainty and how to define an acceptable level of model complexity this discussion includes whether we should shift our attention from uncertainties due to linkage when using linked models to uncertainties in model structure by necessary simplification or by using more parameters this discussion attempts to address the question as to whether there is an increase in uncertainty by linking these models or if a compensation effect could take place and that overall uncertainty in key water quality parameters actually decreases finally challenges in the application of uncertainty analysis in integrated catchment water quality modelling as encountered in this project are discussed and recommendations for future research areas are highlighted graphical abstract image 1 keywords uncertainty integrated catchment modelling sub models of integrated modelling water quality complexity management 1 introduction deterministic integrated catchment water quality models are often the method of choice to predict surface water quality and assist in making decisions on waste water treatment requirements sewer system upgrading or rural land use strategies e g crabtree et al 2009 benedetti et al 2013 or bach et al 2014 in theory such integrated models include both urban and rural catchment spatial and temporal scales although in practice many integrated catchment models icm often still focus on either urban areas e g rauch et al 2002 and freni and mannina 2010 or rural areas e g pang et al 2018 studies considering contributions from both rural and urban areas within a single river catchment remain rare e g honti et al 2017 deterministic integrated catchment models icms can simulate the interlinked dynamics of the catchment system enable the assessment of a range of alternative mitigating responses infrastructural regulatory and then allow the identification of an optimal response i e the lowest cost or highest value given that the beneficial impact of any response could be remote from its implementation location significant asset investment and detailed water management strategies are based on the outputs of such modelling studies however there is increasing concern that these deterministic models are leading to incorrect problem diagnosis and inefficient investment and management strategies e g schellart et al 2010 voinov and shugart 2013 because the simulation results are being used with insufficient consideration to the uncertainty contained within them software used by practitioners to simulate water quality has been created by incorporating individual models often developed by academics but generally without consideration of levels of predictive uncertainty schellart et al 2010 consequently the degree of uncertainty in water quality predictions is currently often not quantified and therefore cannot be considered in the investment decision making process the same level of predictive uncertainty may influence the decision making process differently depending on the desired objective for some modelling studies the predicted probability distributions for outcomes of interest are significantly wider than the differences between the expected values of the outcomes across different policy alternatives reichert and borsuk 2005 even when applying a robust decision making approach lempert et al 2006 deep uncertainties can have a strong influence leading to different policy optima models of integrated water systems include all aspects of uncertainty inherited from the modelled subsystems as well as uncertainty resulting from the linkage of these subsystems three dimensions of uncertainty can be distinguished source type and nature of uncertainty refsgaard et al 2007 van der keur et al 2008 walker et al 2003 sources of uncertainties in hydrology and water quality modelling can be classified into uncertainties caused by input data parameter and model structure uncertainty guzman et al 2015 however the definitions of these classifications tend to overlap or be loosely defined deletic et al 2012 tscheikner gratl et al 2017 for example hydraulic roughness can be seen as either a model input derived from pipe material specifications or from a look up table based on different river types or it can be a model parameter that needs to be calibrated bellos et al 2018b this diversity of uncertainty sources in these models makes it nontrivial to deal with them in a rigorous way and avoid confusion between them this results in a need for a consistent ontology for uncertainty assessment as already advocated by montanari 2007 for hydrology but also the need to better communicate uncertainty throughout the whole duration of the modelling process this becomes even more important when different catchment areas and models are integrated one solution could be the use of a more philosophical basis nearing et al 2016 or a more practical approach as suggested in the quics framework tscheikner gratl et al 2017 predictive uncertainty can become particularly large when interlinked hydraulic and water quality models of different spatial and temporal scales are coupled without balancing model complexity and model objectives for example if different impacts on receiving water bodies are to be modelled varying time and spatial scales must be considered see fig 1 linking a complex data intensive model of a sewer network with a coarse river quality model may result in large unforeseen uncertainties in the prediction of water quality parameters in sensitive locations so the benefit of integrating the models or choosing a very detailed description for one of the sub models is lost e g willems 2006 schellart et al 2010 additionally the interpolation techniques adopted when several sub models are linked in both spatial and temporal scale may also create significant uncertainties unfortunately end users of icms often have neither the knowledge nor the will since there is no reward or reinforcement nor the practical tools to estimate the levels of uncertainty associated with sub models of different spatial and temporal resolution currently there are also no practical tools available to describe how such uncertainties are propagated between sub models when considering water quality prediction at a catchment scale this lack of tools was the motivation of the quics project a european consortium on quantifying uncertainty in integrated catchment studies www quics eu this paper is an output of the project and aims to synthesize the learning developed in the project as researchers created new tools to quantify uncertainty across whole the catchment in the context of this project all scales were studied from the rural scale of a big catchment using a hydrological rainfall runoff model to the small scale of the flow into a gully or manhole using computational fluid dynamics cfd models furthermore several studies were performed crossing over the scales both in time and space this paper will first briefly discuss the state of the art on methods and frameworks for quantifying uncertainties in sub models of and for icms in general and on contributions on this subject delivered by the quics project second it will discuss the challenges of propagating uncertainties between different sub models such as the balance between creating uncertainty due to sub model linkage uncertainty caused by model structure simplification and the implementation of more calibration parameters and if this additional calibration is desirable finally challenges and constraints restricting the application of uncertainty analysis in icms are discussed and future research areas are highlighted 2 uncertainties in the sub models of integrated modelling integrated urban water modelling means the joint modelling of two or more systems that affect surface water bodies muschalla et al 2009 this is accomplished by computationally linking a sequence of sub models describing the various elements of the system rauch et al 2002 for integrated catchment water quality modelling we can classify five types of sub models where two or more of these can form part of an integrated catchment study see fig 2 rainfall runoff and pollutant wash off models rrm and pwm respectively they are implemented on the rural and urban sub catchment scales in the case of urban catchments they usually transform directly the rainfall to runoff and pollutant concentration at the outlet of the catchment in the case of rural runoff models they usually feed into routing models urban drainage models ud they are implemented on the sewer system scale and simulate the transport of the flow and pollutants as well as the occurring biochemical transformation processes through the urban drainage system rural runoff routing models rrm they are implemented in the river reach or landscape scale of the rural catchment and they simulate the routing of runoff and the transport of the pollutant over the rural catchment surface and sometimes including the shallow subsurface although groundwater flows did not form part of the quics study river models r they are implemented in the river reach scale and simulate the transport of flow and pollutants including the transformation processes within receiving surface water bodies wastewater treatment plant wwtp models they are implemented at a single location and they simulate the processes included in the waste water treatment plant fig 2 shows an exemplary but not exhaustive structure of such an integrated catchment study including all five sub models boxes and the linkage between them arrows it includes reference values of the spatial s and temporal t scale variability of the hydrological processes starting with the input of rainfall data into a rainfall runoff model from which the flows q as well as the concentrations c of pollutants are propagated through the entire integrated model 2 1 rainfall runoff and pollutant wash off models water quality models are generally driven by runoff hydraulic models but for example a pollutant wash off model may be directly derived from rainfall data and does not necessarily need a rainfall runoff model as intermediary step for each sub model a certain parameter set is necessary as well as for each linkage a certain amount of uncertainty must be estimated this uncertainty is highly scale dependent and so when models are linked it should be ensured that the linking variables are appropriately up or downscaled for instance rainfall predictions and uncertainties refer to a certain temporal minutes hourly daily weekly and spatial support point m2 hectare km2 catchment scale and the linked models should be able to process these scales precipitation is a key driver of integrated catchment models rainfall can be measured by different instruments such as rain gauges disdrometers microwave links weather radars and satellite and all have different challenges with either spatial coverage and or accuracy of the measurement rico ramirez et al 2015 cristiano et al 2017 highlighted that the uncertainty in the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation is an important source of error when modelling the hydrological processes in urban areas as described by cristiano et al 2017 interactions between rainfall variability urban catchment heterogeneity and hydrological response at multiple urban scales remain poorly understood weather radars can provide spatial rainfall measurements suitable for urban applications although radar rainfall measurements are prone to error cecinati et al 2017a merging radar rainfall and rain gauge measurements can bring the benefits of both instruments such as the measurement accuracy of point observations from rain gauges and better representation of the spatial distribution of precipitation from radar cecinati et al 2017b delrieu et al 2014 wadoux et al 2017 or the integration of radar and point data measurements with different accuracies cecinati et al 2018 amongst others ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 showed that the effect of the spatial resolution of precipitation on flow simulation in urban drainage models in the order of magnitude of several km2 areas decreases significantly with the increase of catchment drainage area moreno rodenas et al 2017b described the simulation of dissolved oxygen do in an approximately 800 km2 large highly urbanized lowland river catchment using different spatial and temporal aggregation of rainfall inputs and an integrated catchment simulator the results of these simulations show a negligible sensitivity to temporal aggregation of rainfall inputs between 10 and 60 min accumulation and a relevant impact of the spatial scale with a link to the storm characteristics to combined sewer overflow cso and do concentration in the receiving water body these results however can only be generalised to similar systems with an equivalent mechanistic relationship between urban areas wastewater treatment plant wwtp and river a study by schellart et al 2012 in an 11 km2 hilly urban catchment showed considerable reduction in flow peaks in the sewer system when the rainfall time scale was changed from 5 to 60 min frequency which would be expected to also significantly underestimate cso spills until now rainfall variability at sub kilometre scale and the relation between rainfall spatial and temporal resolution at such small scales has received limited attention e g ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 muthusamy et al 2017 studied spatial and temporal variability of rainfall at sub kilometre spatial scales to understand the rainfall uncertainty due to upscaling and also to select an optimal temporal averaging interval for rainfall estimation of hydrologic and hydrodynamic modelling especially for small urban catchments muthusamy 2018 used this information to examine the propagation of rainfall input uncertainty in urban pollutant wash off modelling in this study it was observed that the level of propagated uncertainty in the predicted wash off load can be smaller similar or higher to the level of the rainfall uncertainty depending on the rainfall intensity range and the first flush effect rico ramirez et al 2015 studied the application of radar rainfall to simulate flow in sewer networks in an 11 km2 catchment and showed that radar rainfall related uncertainties could explain the uncertainties observed in the simulated flow volumes in sewer networks in 55 of the observed rainfall events for the remaining rainfall events this was not the case hence additional uncertainty sources related to the urban drainage runoff model and sewer flow model structure model parameters and measured sewer flows are also contributing to uncertainty in simulated flow volumes 2 2 rural runoff routing models multi source analyses of uncertainty sources in rural hydrological models in the past years have begun to compare and analyse the contribution of several uncertainty sources in model application this interest has been particularly fostered by projecting climate change impact on hydrology the question being how much of the uncertainty inherent in future climate projections contributes to uncertainty in hydrological model outputs starting with ensembles of only model input data more and more work has been put into the consideration of further uncertainty sources by using a variety of input data sets general circulation models gcm and the emission scenarios special report on emissions scenarios sres representative concentration pathways rcps of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc hydrological models from lumped to fully distributed ones and model parameter sets samaniego et al 2017 showed that the contribution of these uncertainty sources on model outputs are consistent and led by gcm followed by hydrological model uncertainty nevertheless large differences between catchments exist in other studies hydrological model selection are equally or even more uncertain bastola et al 2011 exbrayat et al 2014 and variable in time hattermann et al 2018 a general conclusion from these studies indicates that model output uncertainty is significantly affected by catchment characteristics and boundary conditions one observable tendency of today s river catchment scale hydrological models is that input data resolution has less effect on model s output and efficiency than often assumed considering three semi and fully distributed models bormann et al 2009 showed that resolution of spatial input data on topography land use and soils did not significantly differ for spatial aggregation levels of 25 300 m in agreement with this a recent comparison of high resolution local input data compared to global data products showed that hydrological target values from the widely used soil and water assessment tool swat were only marginally affected by input data quality camargos et al 2018 this conclusion however is challenged if not only hydrological fluxes but also hydro chemical ones are considered where scale effects for swat have been detected from 100 m resolution onwards chaubey et al 2005 2 3 urban drainage models sewer water quality modelling in contrast with sewer flow modelling involves several types of additional uncertainties in pollution load inputs and sewer quality processes willems 2008 urban drainage systems comprise many different infrastructure elements buried infrastructure can be classified as the minor system such as the piped sewer network which can either be combined waste water and storm water or separated storm water only the surface drainage network such as channels or roads used as channels in storm events can then be classified as the major system finally there are micro drainage systems known in different countries as e g low impact development lid sustainable drainage systems suds or best management practices bmps piped systems come with many adjacent structures such as gullies manholes storage tanks overflow and outflow structures micro drainage systems comprise many additional structures such as green roofs infiltration trenches swales detention ponds or wetlands to consider during simulation phase hence river catchments that include urban areas and urban drainage system catchments commonly have a large hydrological heterogeneity the hydrological and hydraulic processes occurring in urban drainage strongly influence transport and dispersion of solute and particulate materials within the catchments a study on uncertainty in sediment build up in sewer systems schellart et al 2010 showed that uncertainty in hydraulic roughness particle size and uncertainty in coefficient in the sediment transport equation all contribute to uncertainty in predicted sediment build up whereas a study on uncertainty in simulation of cso volume sriwastava et al 2018 showed that the main contributor was uncertainty in runoff coefficient with limited contribution from uncertainty in hydraulic roughness and weir crest level this could be explained because sediment transport is characterized by significant nonlinearities and rainfall runoff is not although neither of these two studies took the uncertainty of rainfall into account also uncertainties connected with water quality tend to be higher than the ones associated with quantity modelling mannina and viviani 2010 furthermore the conclusions are dependent on the typology of system e g differences between gravity driven and pressure driven systems making generalization a difficult task elements in urban drainage systems such as inlets gullies and manholes where flow is turbulent and should be studied as a 3d phenomenon usually are simulated using simplified 1d models using calibration parameters to account for the true 3d behaviour lopes et al 2017 rubinato et al 2018 for understanding uncertainty introduced by simplifying a 3d structure into a 1d model such elements are being studied in detail beg et al 2018 martins et al 2018 and it is envisaged that this information can be utilised to provide levels of uncertainty related to the use of calibration parameters that account for 3d behaviour of the flow 2 4 wastewater treatment plant models urban drainage systems can negatively impact water quality of the receiving water either directly through csos or through the effluent of wwtps modelling of wwtps has become a standard in both industry and academia for a range of objectives such as wwtp design operation and control the dynamic simulators currently available combine activated sludge reactor models asm henze et al 1999 with clarifier and settling models the main weakness of wwtp models used in the simulators is the lack of balance between the hydraulic modelling very often a simple cstr completely stirred reactor tanks in series approach and the more complex biokinetic modelling parts gujer 2011 the increasing complexity with high number of model parameters and the high level of lumpedness of the wwtps processes has resulted in highly over parameterised models consequently automatic model calibration routines as used for e g the earlier mentioned rainfall runoff models or hydrodynamic sewer models may result in the numerical best fit but fail to properly describe the relevant processes to minimise this strategies and protocols have been developed hulsbeek et al 2002 for a structured model calibration aiming at minimising the uncertainties in the model output the most important sources of uncertainty are influent flows and mass loads solids retention time sludge volume index overflow rates denitrification rates and the design of the process air system belia et al 2009 the focus of uncertainty analyses in wwtp models depends on the modelling objective decision support for the design of wwtps requires anticipating developments during the entire service life relevant developments are the changes in influent flows and composition climatic conditions such as ambient temperature and changes in regulations and effluent standards changes in influent flows and composition are typically encountered by engineers in scenario analysis while the changes in regulations may be considered as deep uncertainties dominguez and gujer 2006 clearly demonstrated that already over a short period of 20 years these relevant developments may occur rendering traditional uncertainty analysis typically applied useless 2 5 river models rivers are complex non linear systems encompassing a wide range of physical chemical and biological components and processes surface water quality models assist in understanding and predicting such river processes and providing scientific background for management decisions when evaluating and implementing management measures e g asfaw et al 2018 most modern surface water quality models are composed of hydraulic including transport and dispersion thermodynamic and water quality process sub models thomann and mueller 1987 in most applications these three components are simulated sequentially there may exist subsidiary interactions between all the processes occurring however in many cases these subsidiary interactions are not perfectly understood and for the most part considered to have only a minor impact on water quality however moreno rodenas et al 2017a compared the effect of using two different descriptions for the river hydrological processes when calibrating for hydraulic flow both models affected the dynamics of do in a different manner and since hydraulic depth affects the reaerating pattern this has a very relevant impact if left unchecked the focus in uncertainty analysis of hydraulic river models is on input data hydrological geometrical and friction coefficient parametric uncertainty parametrisation of friction is based on assumption of fully turbulent flow over a rough rigid boundary hence uncertainties can be introduced in the simulation of flows where these assumptions are invalid for example in vegetated flows shucksmith et al 2011 studies such as brandimarte and woldeyes 2013 dimitriadis et al 2016 and bellos et al 2017 try to investigate uncertainty due to input data constant inflow and manning coefficient using several model structures however the heterogeneity and variation of surface waters mean that dominant water quality and transport processes and associated uncertainties are site case specific being dependent on both the hydraulic and environmental conditions as well as determinants and time length scales of interest lindenschmidt et al 2007 2 6 uncertainty analysis methods and frameworks to facilitate the analysis of uncertainty sources and their propagation in hydrological modelling a large number of methods have been proposed in the 1980s reviewed by beck 1987 and 1990s e g beven and binley 1992 uncertainty analysis ua is the process of quantifying uncertainty in model outputs that result from uncertainty in model inputs model parameters and model structure ua can be extended into sensitivity analysis sa which aims to rank the various sources of uncertainty and apportion uncertainty contributions to parameters and inputs reviews and examples of ua methods are given in beven and binley 1992 refsgaard et al 2005 brown et al 2005 vrugt and robinson 2007 blasone et al 2008 matott et al 2009 kleidorfer 2010 and guzman et al 2015 for reviews and examples of sa we refer to ferretti et al 2016 guzman et al 2015 hall et al 2009 matott et al 2009 pianosi et al 2016 saltelli et al 2006 and shin et al 2013 for statistical uncertainties the selection of the method depends on the problem statement data availability and computational expense for running the model tscheikner gratl et al 2017 in practice one frequently opts for monte carlo based methods because these are very flexible and easy to apply the main problem is the computational complexity but since the monte carlo method is well suited for parallel computing it may also be feasible for modestly complex integrative catchment models scenario analyses can be applied for cases in which uncertainties cannot easily be characterised by probability distributions b√∂rjeson et al 2006 herman et al 2015 kwakkel and jaxa rozen 2016 or for exploratory modelling kwakkel 2017 urich and rauch 2014 the identification of the most appropriate method for the problem at hand is always a trade off between the need for a strong theory based description of uncertainty simplicity and computational efficiency dotto et al 2012 several frameworks were developed to provide a common uncertainty language and repository of methods sriwastava and moreno rodenas 2017 give an extensive overview of these frameworks and their applications most notable are the frameworks of refsgaard et al 2007 and the global assessment of modelling uncertainties gamu framework of deletic et al 2012 while these frameworks have provided an excellent structure to analyse and understand uncertainty their application remains a challenge in practice the current frameworks mainly focus on quantifying the total uncertainties in the output without investigating the decomposition of uncertainty contributions into different sources although research focussing on quantifying contributions from parameters input and structural uncertainties in predictions has been done reichert and mieleitner 2009 willems 2012 2008 yang et al 2018 in many applications the uncertainty analysis is still often considered as a standalone task and not an integral part of the modelling workflow directed to update and improve model conceptualisations and further data acquisition proposed methods are seldom applicable to full scale catchment water quality models reasons are the increased computational burden local interpretation of environmental legislation or accepted best practice guides favouring for example the use of specific types of deterministic models and design rainfall that is not spatially varied in spite of many methods being available these methods are generally not utilised by practitioners with few exceptions langeveld et al 2013 experience from the quics network indicates that it is mainly the lack of incentive from local regulators and a culture of deterministic models that are accepted by regulators that prevents uptake of uncertainty analysis methods there is furthermore a lack of practical demonstration case studies that show the benefits of uncertainty analysis those benefits can translate into e g lower investment costs or lower risk of failure of programmes of measures another reason may be that mature guidance for practitioners on methods and applications does not exist to a sufficient extent pappenberger and beven 2006 in this context a framework tscheikner gratl et al 2017 and code of practice bellos et al 2018a were developed to address those challenges this lack of case studies extends also to available literature about uncertainty analysis in icms radwan et al 2004 presented a variance decomposition scheme for the modelling of dissolved oxygen in a water quality model for a stream belgium however they did not use a full integrated model but used effluent data from wwtp and urban areas as input for a river model showing that input rural and urban pollution loads were responsible for most of the do uncertainty schellart et al 2010 estimated do nh4 failure probabilities in an expert elicited forward propagation scheme for an impact based water quality model integrating urban and wwtp dynamics due to the computational expense they computed a forward uncertainty analysis scheme using the two most sensitive parameters soil moisture depth and particle size freni and mannina 2010 2012 used a full icm wwtp urban drainage and river in a small catchment in sicily they showed that urban drainage is the most dominant source of uncertainty in their system 3 linkage or how much integration is too much in integrated modelling typically one wishes to simulate a range of systems and associated processes on a spectrum of time and space dimensions together including an increasing number of sub systems and processes tends to dramatically increase the need for input data on geometry boundary conditions and process parameters however a distinction must be made between complexity of processes and complexity induced by linkage although linking models and complexity often go together this has not always to be the case it seems possible to have a model of a single system which is overly complex likewise you can have a linked model that is too simple for a specified task still the thought that adding more and more detail into a model leads to better and more accurate results is paramount to this urge for more integration but the question remains if linking together different models can always deliver enhanced modelling results and how long it takes before we have an integronster voinov and shugart 2013 or a random number generator willems 2006 the opposite trend to this drive for more integration in integrated hydrological and water quality models can be observed in the field of structural mechanics where significant effort is made in models based on finite elements method to ensure that the behaviour of material relationships at interfaces is stable and smooth and moving the focus away from ever more detailed approaches 3 1 the sensible level of detail in a sense a similarity between the level of detail strived for in integrated modelling and optimal tax theory is observed which is often described by the laffer curve when the tax rate is 0 no tax revenue is generated while when the tax rate is 100 no tax revenue is generated as well this latter observation is a strong simplification of the very complicated and long lasting discussions on optimal tax theory e g mirrlees 1971 there should be an optimum at least seen from the perspective of the tax collector between these two extremes but what this exactly is is hard if not impossible to determine and depends largely on subjective preferences and or political viewpoints a similar parallel can be observed in terms of indeterminism in the application of one of the most successful theories in modern physics quantum mechanics using quantum mechanical theory the behaviour of elementary particles atoms and to a certain extent molecules can be described in detail and with an unprecedented accuracy however modelling the behaviour of something that can be found to impact on water quality in a catchment for example a cow using the same theory seems impossible due to the prohibitive calculation efforts needed for such an enterprise transferring these concepts to integrated catchment modelling implies that the usability of the results is zero when no model is applied while when taking everything imaginable into account the usability is zero as well due to a possible explosion of propagated uncertainties in the end and or the calculation effort needed now the question arises how to determine a sensible level of detail of an integrated model this refers to level of detail of process descriptions the information needed on initial and boundary conditions and on the geometry and structure of a given problem posing the question is easier than formulating a generic answer as it is in optimal tax theory nevertheless some elements of an answer will be addressed in the following clearly define the type of results sought for in terms of parameters time and space scales identify the sub models needed and their data need identity the set of unknown data in the collection of sub models evaluate whether enough measuring data of the right quality are available for calibration of the sub models consider how the interfaces of the sub models are described and if suitable interpolation procedures are in place to transfer information from one sub model to the other identify which component of the integrated model is responsible for the largest contribution to the uncertainty and re evaluate the results of the integrated model on the usability for the original goal set when this element is left out in this manner the level of detail in terms of processes interpolation procedures geometrical data and model calibration is tuned on the usability of the results obtained 3 2 does linking of sub models result in an explosion of uncertainty estimating the global uncertainty of icms is still limited by appropriate methods to estimate the various uncertainty sources and the propagation of uncertainty nevertheless simply calibrating and investigating the uncertainty of sub modules and then only further considering the best sub model parameterization in the icm is insufficient as well multi criteria assessment of icms selecting criteria depending on the modelling objective can at least provide valuable insights to the behaviour of complex coupled models houska et al 2017 investigated the performances of coupled hydrological biogeochemical models and evaluated parameter sets that simulated well single criteria and those parameter sets that performed well for all target criteria in their monte carlo based study they needed to reduce their acceptable parameter space by 99 9 discarding the majority of model setups that performed well for single criteria another topic concerning the linkage is the directional flow of information the flow of information is a relevant factor when designing the architecture of integrated catchment modelling studies models and software can be directly linked in an output input basis only if there is an upstream to downstream unidirectional flow of information i e no feedback this is insufficient when control systems are used which propagate information from downstream state variables to actuate on upstream ones this is an existing practice in some water systems e g linking wwtp states with the control of operations in the urban drainage system it is also reasonable that in a foreseeable future extensive sensor networks e g internet of things will play an increasing role in water management chen and han 2018 this will allow for assimilating an increasing amount of data in the system wani et al 2017 and possibly to control the operation of urban systems accounting for the status of the receiving water system and treatment capacity in such cases seamless model integration is necessary to account for the multi directional information flow current numerical solver schemes are highly tailored for the individual sub model characteristics nevertheless commercial software is progressively adapting to the environment of integrated catchment modelling for instance linking 1d and 2d hydrodynamic models for flood prediction leandro et al 2009 or linking a simplified ordinary differential equation ode based integrated system to represent wwtp urban drainage and river dynamics achleitner et al 2007 solvi 2007 further development of robust multi scale solvers and software which allow for the integration of simplified and physically based processes is required given that an integrated model has a larger number of uncertainty sources than each of its sub models it is tempting to think that its output uncertainty will also be larger this impression is reinforced by the belief that uncertainty propagation is synonymous to uncertainty amplification suggesting that in a chain of models the uncertainty can only grow however this is not necessarily true in contrast there are several cases in which the output uncertainty will decrease when models are coupled because of a compensation effect an analogy can be found e g for the rainfall scaling effect ciach and krajewski 2006 we illustrate this concept with some simplified examples consider a sewer system node where n pipes join and the sewage fluxes merge and flow into a single larger pipe let the uncertainty of the chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of the effluent be equal for all pipes and quantified by a standard deviation œÉ mg l then the standard deviation of the cod concentration of the larger pipe will be some value between œÉ n and œÉ thus either smaller or equal to that of the individual pipes in fact it will only be equal to œÉ if the cod uncertainties for all pipes are perfectly correlated which is not realistic thus uncertainty decreases a similar effect occurs when models are coupled in catchment modelling consider a case where farmers apply a pesticide to their land to protect their crops part of the pesticide will reach the local ditches through sub surface and surface flow this can be modelled using a soil hydrological and chemical model next the pesticide is transported to local streams and channels as modelled by a surface hydrological model finally the pesticide reaches the river and sea as predicted by a hydraulic model while the uncertainty about the pesticide concentration in the local ditch may be extremely high it will be small in the river and sea again averaging out effects cause uncertainty to decrease in addition subsystems and consequently sub models may act as low pass filters in terms of event frequencies as e g csos only start spilling after the entire sewer system volume has been filled in the netherlands with on average 8 mm in sewer storage this results in a cso frequency of only 5 6 spills per year this means that the uncertainty in the runoff routing due to uncertain initial conditions of the sewer catchment which is relatively high for smaller storms does not strongly affect the quality of river do simulations these examples show that uncertainty often decreases when sub models are integrated of course there are also cases where the opposite occurs a simple example is when a water quantity and a water quality model are coupled to calculate the pollution load kg s of a stream or sewer pipe the load is the product of flux m3 s and concentration kg m3 and if both have a relative error of 10 then the relative error of the load will increase to a value between 14 and 20 depending on the degree of correlation between the two uncertainty sources and assuming that the correlation is non negative if it is negative which is not unlikely then the relative error will be smaller than 14 in chaotic systems small deviations in variables can have huge consequences and hence in such systems it may occur that model coupling leads to an explosion of uncertainty in the case of integrated catchment water quality modelling this might happen when an intervention is based on an uncertain system variable for instance if authorities impose restrictive measures on industry and farmers based on whether a water quality index is above or below a threshold then a small uncertainty in the water quality index may have dramatic consequences if the index is close to its threshold value in summary coupling models does not automatically lead to an increase of uncertainty it very much depends on the correlation between the processes and the scale of spatial and temporal averaging to be certain whether uncertainties amplify or cancel out it is imperative that a sound and case specific uncertainty propagation analysis is conducted 4 challenges and bottlenecks in application of uncertainty analysis in integrated water quality models despite considerable uncertainty integrated models are important for effective decision support in major investment decisions for water utilities model outputs can be justified to a regulator in a transparent comprehensible and repeatable way especially when industrial modelling practice guidance is used in the creation of sub models relative comparison between solutions is still useful to rank alternatives they are often cheaper than performing extensive and long term measurements there is a capability to simulate extreme events although calibration based on regular events may decrease the validity of the results lee jr 1973 defined seven sins for large scale models for urban planning and we would like to revisit them for integrated water quality models in the context of uncertainty to highlight remaining challenges in application although defined 45 years ago some of these points may still ring true in the ears of integrated modellers hyper comprehensiveness 1 defined as an overly complex model structure and complicatedness 2 in terms of interactions between the model components are connected to the question of linking different sub models these two points lead to the rule that not the most complex model should be selected but following ockham s razor the least complex that answers the asked question reliably in a comprehensible and verifiable way rauch et al 2002 also grossness 3 which means the level of detail for model results used for predictions may be too coarse for effective decision making relates to this aspect the objective of the modelling endeavour should be clarified and with it the scale and level of detail of the necessary results this adds to the challenge of linking models that represent processes that act on different space and time scales bl√∂schl and sivapalan 1995 distinguish between a process observation and modelling scale under the best scenario those scales should match but in integrated catchment studies this is generally not the case as for example pollutant wash off or a combined sewer overflow happens at small spatial and temporal scale but the effects can be found in the receiving water at larger spatial and temporal scales transformations based on downscaling and upscaling techniques are generally necessary to obtain the required match between scales cristiano et al 2017 the hungriness 4 for data is connected to this point in the way that an adequate amount of data is essential to define the model setup and to identify the model parameters muschalla et al 2009 different level of model integration also demands different amount and quality of data for modelling and decision making eggimann et al 2017 furthermore the lack of data in environmental studies and a common non sharing policy camargos et al 2018 and the need to satisfy local regulators sriwastava et al 2018 remain major problems for performing a complete uncertainty analysis mechanicalness 5 defined as errors caused by the computational representation of the model could in times of increasing computational resources be reinterpreted as limitations in terms of computational power availability accessibility to source code and ability to adapt model settings and computational cost a typical uncertainty analysis study requires a significant amount of simulations which cannot be performed manually therefore the modeller should find ways to automatize this process though most of the commercial software does not provide this capability even if such a capability exists sufficient documentation to guide the end user is sparse it is also common practice that several parameters e g the time step the space step the tolerance in iteration loops in commercial software are considered as default values and adaptation and changes to these parameters might result in simulation malfunctions there are several types of models which are characterised by significant computational cost for each run in the magnitude of hours days especially if they are used for real world case studies therefore a typical uncertainty analysis is often not feasible one way to cope with that is the use of adaptive or informed samplers goodman and weare 2010 hoffman and gelman 2014 laloy and vrugt 2012 and surrogate models or emulators e g for sewer hydraulics carbajal et al 2017 for hydrological models yang et al 2018 or for rainfall dynamics in 2d physically based flow models moreno rodenas et al 2018 the problem of wrongheadedness 6 can be explained by the gap between the behaviour of the model which it was built for and what it is used for models often represent rather the data available than focussing on the objectives this can lead to focusing on aspects that might not matter and forgetting about those that do and that we simply do not have data about this connects to the observation that perception of uncertainty on different inputs and parameters for existing model does not scale when used for several objectives which may change the temporal and spatial extent of the project see fig 3 the calculated level of uncertainty although the numbers do not change will be perceived differently depending on the nature of the objective being either small scale measures e g the design of a cso using only design rainfall events or strategic decisions e g water quality considerations of a whole river basin for integrated models that are used for decision making based on acute effects such as ammonia toxicity or oxygen depletion the focus is on bigger events as the sewer and wwtp act as high pass filters for smaller events and the impacts only occur when the assimilative capacity of the river is exceeded for those events the relative uncertainty due to e g initial losses decreases rapidly therefore for different objectives the same calculated level of uncertainty will result in a different objective specific level of uncertainty this difference between the calculated and objective specific uncertainty is called objective shift for example the usage of literature values for initial losses on the surface e g 4 mm are much more sensitive for the design of a cso if a 10 mm rainfall event is used than for a 50 mm one the same holds true for the calibration of models on these events similar to the selection of different input data tscheikner gratl et al 2016 vonach et al 2018 the calibration on different objectives e g different water quality parameters or water quantity influences the model behaviour the objectives of the modelling effort very much determines the characterisation of a model bennett et al 2013 it is therefore advisable although difficult in practice to apply the model in consequence only for the objective it is calibrated to due to the fact that not all sub models can be calibrated and every sub model will always be influenced by the calibration of the upstream models used as input distortion is unavoidable in practice with linked models and could only be avoided by building an integrated model from scratch tscheikner gratl et al 2017 furthermore the question arises if the importance of still statistical graspable uncertainties dwindles in comparison to deep uncertainties when the objective scale changes because if you consider a whole river basin over a period of 100 years then things such as climate change population in or decrease and land use changes could be the cause of huge uncertainties while other uncertainties that would dominate at smaller scales could diminish in importance this objective shift is one reason why the application of one model for several objectives without adapting and scaling the input data and the model could lead to poor predictions with high levels of uncertainty also uncertainty quantification is seldom scalable and therefore there exists no one fits all solution if we translate all the limitations mentioned to a common metric we end up at the sin of expensiveness 7 in practice addressing most of these issues requires monetary investments e g for software sensors experienced modellers as well as time resources these costs must be covered by the modeller and in consequence need to be billable to the decision maker in case that decision maker and modeller are different entities and although reducing uncertainty is valuable reckhow 1994 it is difficult to communicate this this influences also the point of data availability due to costs for data acquisition often data transmission and costs for data quality control which is often neglected cost minimization schemes may also lead to the application of existing models for different objectives without the necessary and costly adaptions this encompasses also a lack of performance assessment not only if the measures had the expected effect but also to collect evidence about the degree of uncertainty of model predictions there are however opportunities to use information about uncertainty in models to better understand trade offs between risks of failing environmental standards and investment costs communicating uncertainty in models as probability of failure of environmental standards as well as impact of uncertainty on investment costs sriwastava et al 2018 tends to gain interest among practitioners 5 conclusion in the course of the quics project we found several key points that we want to highlight here 1 uncertainty analysis of integrated catchment water quality modelling should be a continuous process performed in parallel to the modelling exercise rather than being an activity that is carried out after the main modelling activities this inclusion starts with the definition of the modelling goals and should be present through the model build simulation and interpretation phases of an integrated catchment modelling study 2 linking together different models is a non trivial task and requires careful and detailed handling however coupling models does not automatically lead to an increase of uncertainty results and ongoing studies from and based on the quics project highlighted with an asterisk in the references indicate that uncertainty in water quantity and quality predictions does not necessarily increase across an icm the important issue is not the scale of a model but the integration of different models developed at different spatial and temporal scales it is often at these interfaces that the modelling approaches radically changes this issue is particularly important when modelling water quality processes often the scale and temporal resolution of the hydraulic model that drives the water quality model has been developed at a different scale from the water quality process model 3 further research in uncertainty decomposition and model acceleration especially the generalisation of input based emulation into water quality dynamics is still required to allow for the implementation of uncertainty analysis frameworks in practice uncertainty analysis can lead to potentially less expensive solutions with a better understanding of risk of water quality compliance failure simplifying approaches such as the use of emulators and new upscaling downscaling techniques can be applied successfully in icm studies without a significant loss of accuracy in determining the magnitude of model uncertainties there is the potential for simplified and computationally efficient approaches for water quality uncertainty in icm studies to be developed and then used by end users that are faced with decisions on investment 4 understanding the outcomes and the inherent uncertainties of icms poses a challenge in practical application each sub model reflects the knowledge of some specialism e g hydraulics water quality wwtp performance and persons that master all these different subjects entirely are very rare this implies that in practice one needs a team of experts to understand apply and communicate the results correctly for the purpose the model was assembled for consequently more research should also be carried out on how to involve local environmental regulators and organisations in order that they can become aware and then appreciate the role of uncertainty analysis in determining what investment actions are required to meet regulatory requirements in the longer term regulators need to be explicit as to how they would incorporate uncertainty analysis into their decision making processes finally although modelling activity is highly tailored for each specific scenario further discussion on details such as globally acceptable uncertainty degrees or sub model linkage strategies is needed declaration of interests

19091,this paper aims to stimulate discussion based on the experiences derived from the quics project quantifying uncertainty in integrated catchment studies first it briefly discusses the current state of knowledge on uncertainties in sub models of integrated catchment models and the existing frameworks for analysing uncertainty furthermore it compares the relative approaches of both building and calibrating fully integrated models or linking separate sub models it also discusses the implications of model linkage on overall uncertainty and how to define an acceptable level of model complexity this discussion includes whether we should shift our attention from uncertainties due to linkage when using linked models to uncertainties in model structure by necessary simplification or by using more parameters this discussion attempts to address the question as to whether there is an increase in uncertainty by linking these models or if a compensation effect could take place and that overall uncertainty in key water quality parameters actually decreases finally challenges in the application of uncertainty analysis in integrated catchment water quality modelling as encountered in this project are discussed and recommendations for future research areas are highlighted graphical abstract image 1 keywords uncertainty integrated catchment modelling sub models of integrated modelling water quality complexity management 1 introduction deterministic integrated catchment water quality models are often the method of choice to predict surface water quality and assist in making decisions on waste water treatment requirements sewer system upgrading or rural land use strategies e g crabtree et al 2009 benedetti et al 2013 or bach et al 2014 in theory such integrated models include both urban and rural catchment spatial and temporal scales although in practice many integrated catchment models icm often still focus on either urban areas e g rauch et al 2002 and freni and mannina 2010 or rural areas e g pang et al 2018 studies considering contributions from both rural and urban areas within a single river catchment remain rare e g honti et al 2017 deterministic integrated catchment models icms can simulate the interlinked dynamics of the catchment system enable the assessment of a range of alternative mitigating responses infrastructural regulatory and then allow the identification of an optimal response i e the lowest cost or highest value given that the beneficial impact of any response could be remote from its implementation location significant asset investment and detailed water management strategies are based on the outputs of such modelling studies however there is increasing concern that these deterministic models are leading to incorrect problem diagnosis and inefficient investment and management strategies e g schellart et al 2010 voinov and shugart 2013 because the simulation results are being used with insufficient consideration to the uncertainty contained within them software used by practitioners to simulate water quality has been created by incorporating individual models often developed by academics but generally without consideration of levels of predictive uncertainty schellart et al 2010 consequently the degree of uncertainty in water quality predictions is currently often not quantified and therefore cannot be considered in the investment decision making process the same level of predictive uncertainty may influence the decision making process differently depending on the desired objective for some modelling studies the predicted probability distributions for outcomes of interest are significantly wider than the differences between the expected values of the outcomes across different policy alternatives reichert and borsuk 2005 even when applying a robust decision making approach lempert et al 2006 deep uncertainties can have a strong influence leading to different policy optima models of integrated water systems include all aspects of uncertainty inherited from the modelled subsystems as well as uncertainty resulting from the linkage of these subsystems three dimensions of uncertainty can be distinguished source type and nature of uncertainty refsgaard et al 2007 van der keur et al 2008 walker et al 2003 sources of uncertainties in hydrology and water quality modelling can be classified into uncertainties caused by input data parameter and model structure uncertainty guzman et al 2015 however the definitions of these classifications tend to overlap or be loosely defined deletic et al 2012 tscheikner gratl et al 2017 for example hydraulic roughness can be seen as either a model input derived from pipe material specifications or from a look up table based on different river types or it can be a model parameter that needs to be calibrated bellos et al 2018b this diversity of uncertainty sources in these models makes it nontrivial to deal with them in a rigorous way and avoid confusion between them this results in a need for a consistent ontology for uncertainty assessment as already advocated by montanari 2007 for hydrology but also the need to better communicate uncertainty throughout the whole duration of the modelling process this becomes even more important when different catchment areas and models are integrated one solution could be the use of a more philosophical basis nearing et al 2016 or a more practical approach as suggested in the quics framework tscheikner gratl et al 2017 predictive uncertainty can become particularly large when interlinked hydraulic and water quality models of different spatial and temporal scales are coupled without balancing model complexity and model objectives for example if different impacts on receiving water bodies are to be modelled varying time and spatial scales must be considered see fig 1 linking a complex data intensive model of a sewer network with a coarse river quality model may result in large unforeseen uncertainties in the prediction of water quality parameters in sensitive locations so the benefit of integrating the models or choosing a very detailed description for one of the sub models is lost e g willems 2006 schellart et al 2010 additionally the interpolation techniques adopted when several sub models are linked in both spatial and temporal scale may also create significant uncertainties unfortunately end users of icms often have neither the knowledge nor the will since there is no reward or reinforcement nor the practical tools to estimate the levels of uncertainty associated with sub models of different spatial and temporal resolution currently there are also no practical tools available to describe how such uncertainties are propagated between sub models when considering water quality prediction at a catchment scale this lack of tools was the motivation of the quics project a european consortium on quantifying uncertainty in integrated catchment studies www quics eu this paper is an output of the project and aims to synthesize the learning developed in the project as researchers created new tools to quantify uncertainty across whole the catchment in the context of this project all scales were studied from the rural scale of a big catchment using a hydrological rainfall runoff model to the small scale of the flow into a gully or manhole using computational fluid dynamics cfd models furthermore several studies were performed crossing over the scales both in time and space this paper will first briefly discuss the state of the art on methods and frameworks for quantifying uncertainties in sub models of and for icms in general and on contributions on this subject delivered by the quics project second it will discuss the challenges of propagating uncertainties between different sub models such as the balance between creating uncertainty due to sub model linkage uncertainty caused by model structure simplification and the implementation of more calibration parameters and if this additional calibration is desirable finally challenges and constraints restricting the application of uncertainty analysis in icms are discussed and future research areas are highlighted 2 uncertainties in the sub models of integrated modelling integrated urban water modelling means the joint modelling of two or more systems that affect surface water bodies muschalla et al 2009 this is accomplished by computationally linking a sequence of sub models describing the various elements of the system rauch et al 2002 for integrated catchment water quality modelling we can classify five types of sub models where two or more of these can form part of an integrated catchment study see fig 2 rainfall runoff and pollutant wash off models rrm and pwm respectively they are implemented on the rural and urban sub catchment scales in the case of urban catchments they usually transform directly the rainfall to runoff and pollutant concentration at the outlet of the catchment in the case of rural runoff models they usually feed into routing models urban drainage models ud they are implemented on the sewer system scale and simulate the transport of the flow and pollutants as well as the occurring biochemical transformation processes through the urban drainage system rural runoff routing models rrm they are implemented in the river reach or landscape scale of the rural catchment and they simulate the routing of runoff and the transport of the pollutant over the rural catchment surface and sometimes including the shallow subsurface although groundwater flows did not form part of the quics study river models r they are implemented in the river reach scale and simulate the transport of flow and pollutants including the transformation processes within receiving surface water bodies wastewater treatment plant wwtp models they are implemented at a single location and they simulate the processes included in the waste water treatment plant fig 2 shows an exemplary but not exhaustive structure of such an integrated catchment study including all five sub models boxes and the linkage between them arrows it includes reference values of the spatial s and temporal t scale variability of the hydrological processes starting with the input of rainfall data into a rainfall runoff model from which the flows q as well as the concentrations c of pollutants are propagated through the entire integrated model 2 1 rainfall runoff and pollutant wash off models water quality models are generally driven by runoff hydraulic models but for example a pollutant wash off model may be directly derived from rainfall data and does not necessarily need a rainfall runoff model as intermediary step for each sub model a certain parameter set is necessary as well as for each linkage a certain amount of uncertainty must be estimated this uncertainty is highly scale dependent and so when models are linked it should be ensured that the linking variables are appropriately up or downscaled for instance rainfall predictions and uncertainties refer to a certain temporal minutes hourly daily weekly and spatial support point m2 hectare km2 catchment scale and the linked models should be able to process these scales precipitation is a key driver of integrated catchment models rainfall can be measured by different instruments such as rain gauges disdrometers microwave links weather radars and satellite and all have different challenges with either spatial coverage and or accuracy of the measurement rico ramirez et al 2015 cristiano et al 2017 highlighted that the uncertainty in the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation is an important source of error when modelling the hydrological processes in urban areas as described by cristiano et al 2017 interactions between rainfall variability urban catchment heterogeneity and hydrological response at multiple urban scales remain poorly understood weather radars can provide spatial rainfall measurements suitable for urban applications although radar rainfall measurements are prone to error cecinati et al 2017a merging radar rainfall and rain gauge measurements can bring the benefits of both instruments such as the measurement accuracy of point observations from rain gauges and better representation of the spatial distribution of precipitation from radar cecinati et al 2017b delrieu et al 2014 wadoux et al 2017 or the integration of radar and point data measurements with different accuracies cecinati et al 2018 amongst others ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 showed that the effect of the spatial resolution of precipitation on flow simulation in urban drainage models in the order of magnitude of several km2 areas decreases significantly with the increase of catchment drainage area moreno rodenas et al 2017b described the simulation of dissolved oxygen do in an approximately 800 km2 large highly urbanized lowland river catchment using different spatial and temporal aggregation of rainfall inputs and an integrated catchment simulator the results of these simulations show a negligible sensitivity to temporal aggregation of rainfall inputs between 10 and 60 min accumulation and a relevant impact of the spatial scale with a link to the storm characteristics to combined sewer overflow cso and do concentration in the receiving water body these results however can only be generalised to similar systems with an equivalent mechanistic relationship between urban areas wastewater treatment plant wwtp and river a study by schellart et al 2012 in an 11 km2 hilly urban catchment showed considerable reduction in flow peaks in the sewer system when the rainfall time scale was changed from 5 to 60 min frequency which would be expected to also significantly underestimate cso spills until now rainfall variability at sub kilometre scale and the relation between rainfall spatial and temporal resolution at such small scales has received limited attention e g ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 muthusamy et al 2017 studied spatial and temporal variability of rainfall at sub kilometre spatial scales to understand the rainfall uncertainty due to upscaling and also to select an optimal temporal averaging interval for rainfall estimation of hydrologic and hydrodynamic modelling especially for small urban catchments muthusamy 2018 used this information to examine the propagation of rainfall input uncertainty in urban pollutant wash off modelling in this study it was observed that the level of propagated uncertainty in the predicted wash off load can be smaller similar or higher to the level of the rainfall uncertainty depending on the rainfall intensity range and the first flush effect rico ramirez et al 2015 studied the application of radar rainfall to simulate flow in sewer networks in an 11 km2 catchment and showed that radar rainfall related uncertainties could explain the uncertainties observed in the simulated flow volumes in sewer networks in 55 of the observed rainfall events for the remaining rainfall events this was not the case hence additional uncertainty sources related to the urban drainage runoff model and sewer flow model structure model parameters and measured sewer flows are also contributing to uncertainty in simulated flow volumes 2 2 rural runoff routing models multi source analyses of uncertainty sources in rural hydrological models in the past years have begun to compare and analyse the contribution of several uncertainty sources in model application this interest has been particularly fostered by projecting climate change impact on hydrology the question being how much of the uncertainty inherent in future climate projections contributes to uncertainty in hydrological model outputs starting with ensembles of only model input data more and more work has been put into the consideration of further uncertainty sources by using a variety of input data sets general circulation models gcm and the emission scenarios special report on emissions scenarios sres representative concentration pathways rcps of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc hydrological models from lumped to fully distributed ones and model parameter sets samaniego et al 2017 showed that the contribution of these uncertainty sources on model outputs are consistent and led by gcm followed by hydrological model uncertainty nevertheless large differences between catchments exist in other studies hydrological model selection are equally or even more uncertain bastola et al 2011 exbrayat et al 2014 and variable in time hattermann et al 2018 a general conclusion from these studies indicates that model output uncertainty is significantly affected by catchment characteristics and boundary conditions one observable tendency of today s river catchment scale hydrological models is that input data resolution has less effect on model s output and efficiency than often assumed considering three semi and fully distributed models bormann et al 2009 showed that resolution of spatial input data on topography land use and soils did not significantly differ for spatial aggregation levels of 25 300 m in agreement with this a recent comparison of high resolution local input data compared to global data products showed that hydrological target values from the widely used soil and water assessment tool swat were only marginally affected by input data quality camargos et al 2018 this conclusion however is challenged if not only hydrological fluxes but also hydro chemical ones are considered where scale effects for swat have been detected from 100 m resolution onwards chaubey et al 2005 2 3 urban drainage models sewer water quality modelling in contrast with sewer flow modelling involves several types of additional uncertainties in pollution load inputs and sewer quality processes willems 2008 urban drainage systems comprise many different infrastructure elements buried infrastructure can be classified as the minor system such as the piped sewer network which can either be combined waste water and storm water or separated storm water only the surface drainage network such as channels or roads used as channels in storm events can then be classified as the major system finally there are micro drainage systems known in different countries as e g low impact development lid sustainable drainage systems suds or best management practices bmps piped systems come with many adjacent structures such as gullies manholes storage tanks overflow and outflow structures micro drainage systems comprise many additional structures such as green roofs infiltration trenches swales detention ponds or wetlands to consider during simulation phase hence river catchments that include urban areas and urban drainage system catchments commonly have a large hydrological heterogeneity the hydrological and hydraulic processes occurring in urban drainage strongly influence transport and dispersion of solute and particulate materials within the catchments a study on uncertainty in sediment build up in sewer systems schellart et al 2010 showed that uncertainty in hydraulic roughness particle size and uncertainty in coefficient in the sediment transport equation all contribute to uncertainty in predicted sediment build up whereas a study on uncertainty in simulation of cso volume sriwastava et al 2018 showed that the main contributor was uncertainty in runoff coefficient with limited contribution from uncertainty in hydraulic roughness and weir crest level this could be explained because sediment transport is characterized by significant nonlinearities and rainfall runoff is not although neither of these two studies took the uncertainty of rainfall into account also uncertainties connected with water quality tend to be higher than the ones associated with quantity modelling mannina and viviani 2010 furthermore the conclusions are dependent on the typology of system e g differences between gravity driven and pressure driven systems making generalization a difficult task elements in urban drainage systems such as inlets gullies and manholes where flow is turbulent and should be studied as a 3d phenomenon usually are simulated using simplified 1d models using calibration parameters to account for the true 3d behaviour lopes et al 2017 rubinato et al 2018 for understanding uncertainty introduced by simplifying a 3d structure into a 1d model such elements are being studied in detail beg et al 2018 martins et al 2018 and it is envisaged that this information can be utilised to provide levels of uncertainty related to the use of calibration parameters that account for 3d behaviour of the flow 2 4 wastewater treatment plant models urban drainage systems can negatively impact water quality of the receiving water either directly through csos or through the effluent of wwtps modelling of wwtps has become a standard in both industry and academia for a range of objectives such as wwtp design operation and control the dynamic simulators currently available combine activated sludge reactor models asm henze et al 1999 with clarifier and settling models the main weakness of wwtp models used in the simulators is the lack of balance between the hydraulic modelling very often a simple cstr completely stirred reactor tanks in series approach and the more complex biokinetic modelling parts gujer 2011 the increasing complexity with high number of model parameters and the high level of lumpedness of the wwtps processes has resulted in highly over parameterised models consequently automatic model calibration routines as used for e g the earlier mentioned rainfall runoff models or hydrodynamic sewer models may result in the numerical best fit but fail to properly describe the relevant processes to minimise this strategies and protocols have been developed hulsbeek et al 2002 for a structured model calibration aiming at minimising the uncertainties in the model output the most important sources of uncertainty are influent flows and mass loads solids retention time sludge volume index overflow rates denitrification rates and the design of the process air system belia et al 2009 the focus of uncertainty analyses in wwtp models depends on the modelling objective decision support for the design of wwtps requires anticipating developments during the entire service life relevant developments are the changes in influent flows and composition climatic conditions such as ambient temperature and changes in regulations and effluent standards changes in influent flows and composition are typically encountered by engineers in scenario analysis while the changes in regulations may be considered as deep uncertainties dominguez and gujer 2006 clearly demonstrated that already over a short period of 20 years these relevant developments may occur rendering traditional uncertainty analysis typically applied useless 2 5 river models rivers are complex non linear systems encompassing a wide range of physical chemical and biological components and processes surface water quality models assist in understanding and predicting such river processes and providing scientific background for management decisions when evaluating and implementing management measures e g asfaw et al 2018 most modern surface water quality models are composed of hydraulic including transport and dispersion thermodynamic and water quality process sub models thomann and mueller 1987 in most applications these three components are simulated sequentially there may exist subsidiary interactions between all the processes occurring however in many cases these subsidiary interactions are not perfectly understood and for the most part considered to have only a minor impact on water quality however moreno rodenas et al 2017a compared the effect of using two different descriptions for the river hydrological processes when calibrating for hydraulic flow both models affected the dynamics of do in a different manner and since hydraulic depth affects the reaerating pattern this has a very relevant impact if left unchecked the focus in uncertainty analysis of hydraulic river models is on input data hydrological geometrical and friction coefficient parametric uncertainty parametrisation of friction is based on assumption of fully turbulent flow over a rough rigid boundary hence uncertainties can be introduced in the simulation of flows where these assumptions are invalid for example in vegetated flows shucksmith et al 2011 studies such as brandimarte and woldeyes 2013 dimitriadis et al 2016 and bellos et al 2017 try to investigate uncertainty due to input data constant inflow and manning coefficient using several model structures however the heterogeneity and variation of surface waters mean that dominant water quality and transport processes and associated uncertainties are site case specific being dependent on both the hydraulic and environmental conditions as well as determinants and time length scales of interest lindenschmidt et al 2007 2 6 uncertainty analysis methods and frameworks to facilitate the analysis of uncertainty sources and their propagation in hydrological modelling a large number of methods have been proposed in the 1980s reviewed by beck 1987 and 1990s e g beven and binley 1992 uncertainty analysis ua is the process of quantifying uncertainty in model outputs that result from uncertainty in model inputs model parameters and model structure ua can be extended into sensitivity analysis sa which aims to rank the various sources of uncertainty and apportion uncertainty contributions to parameters and inputs reviews and examples of ua methods are given in beven and binley 1992 refsgaard et al 2005 brown et al 2005 vrugt and robinson 2007 blasone et al 2008 matott et al 2009 kleidorfer 2010 and guzman et al 2015 for reviews and examples of sa we refer to ferretti et al 2016 guzman et al 2015 hall et al 2009 matott et al 2009 pianosi et al 2016 saltelli et al 2006 and shin et al 2013 for statistical uncertainties the selection of the method depends on the problem statement data availability and computational expense for running the model tscheikner gratl et al 2017 in practice one frequently opts for monte carlo based methods because these are very flexible and easy to apply the main problem is the computational complexity but since the monte carlo method is well suited for parallel computing it may also be feasible for modestly complex integrative catchment models scenario analyses can be applied for cases in which uncertainties cannot easily be characterised by probability distributions b√∂rjeson et al 2006 herman et al 2015 kwakkel and jaxa rozen 2016 or for exploratory modelling kwakkel 2017 urich and rauch 2014 the identification of the most appropriate method for the problem at hand is always a trade off between the need for a strong theory based description of uncertainty simplicity and computational efficiency dotto et al 2012 several frameworks were developed to provide a common uncertainty language and repository of methods sriwastava and moreno rodenas 2017 give an extensive overview of these frameworks and their applications most notable are the frameworks of refsgaard et al 2007 and the global assessment of modelling uncertainties gamu framework of deletic et al 2012 while these frameworks have provided an excellent structure to analyse and understand uncertainty their application remains a challenge in practice the current frameworks mainly focus on quantifying the total uncertainties in the output without investigating the decomposition of uncertainty contributions into different sources although research focussing on quantifying contributions from parameters input and structural uncertainties in predictions has been done reichert and mieleitner 2009 willems 2012 2008 yang et al 2018 in many applications the uncertainty analysis is still often considered as a standalone task and not an integral part of the modelling workflow directed to update and improve model conceptualisations and further data acquisition proposed methods are seldom applicable to full scale catchment water quality models reasons are the increased computational burden local interpretation of environmental legislation or accepted best practice guides favouring for example the use of specific types of deterministic models and design rainfall that is not spatially varied in spite of many methods being available these methods are generally not utilised by practitioners with few exceptions langeveld et al 2013 experience from the quics network indicates that it is mainly the lack of incentive from local regulators and a culture of deterministic models that are accepted by regulators that prevents uptake of uncertainty analysis methods there is furthermore a lack of practical demonstration case studies that show the benefits of uncertainty analysis those benefits can translate into e g lower investment costs or lower risk of failure of programmes of measures another reason may be that mature guidance for practitioners on methods and applications does not exist to a sufficient extent pappenberger and beven 2006 in this context a framework tscheikner gratl et al 2017 and code of practice bellos et al 2018a were developed to address those challenges this lack of case studies extends also to available literature about uncertainty analysis in icms radwan et al 2004 presented a variance decomposition scheme for the modelling of dissolved oxygen in a water quality model for a stream belgium however they did not use a full integrated model but used effluent data from wwtp and urban areas as input for a river model showing that input rural and urban pollution loads were responsible for most of the do uncertainty schellart et al 2010 estimated do nh4 failure probabilities in an expert elicited forward propagation scheme for an impact based water quality model integrating urban and wwtp dynamics due to the computational expense they computed a forward uncertainty analysis scheme using the two most sensitive parameters soil moisture depth and particle size freni and mannina 2010 2012 used a full icm wwtp urban drainage and river in a small catchment in sicily they showed that urban drainage is the most dominant source of uncertainty in their system 3 linkage or how much integration is too much in integrated modelling typically one wishes to simulate a range of systems and associated processes on a spectrum of time and space dimensions together including an increasing number of sub systems and processes tends to dramatically increase the need for input data on geometry boundary conditions and process parameters however a distinction must be made between complexity of processes and complexity induced by linkage although linking models and complexity often go together this has not always to be the case it seems possible to have a model of a single system which is overly complex likewise you can have a linked model that is too simple for a specified task still the thought that adding more and more detail into a model leads to better and more accurate results is paramount to this urge for more integration but the question remains if linking together different models can always deliver enhanced modelling results and how long it takes before we have an integronster voinov and shugart 2013 or a random number generator willems 2006 the opposite trend to this drive for more integration in integrated hydrological and water quality models can be observed in the field of structural mechanics where significant effort is made in models based on finite elements method to ensure that the behaviour of material relationships at interfaces is stable and smooth and moving the focus away from ever more detailed approaches 3 1 the sensible level of detail in a sense a similarity between the level of detail strived for in integrated modelling and optimal tax theory is observed which is often described by the laffer curve when the tax rate is 0 no tax revenue is generated while when the tax rate is 100 no tax revenue is generated as well this latter observation is a strong simplification of the very complicated and long lasting discussions on optimal tax theory e g mirrlees 1971 there should be an optimum at least seen from the perspective of the tax collector between these two extremes but what this exactly is is hard if not impossible to determine and depends largely on subjective preferences and or political viewpoints a similar parallel can be observed in terms of indeterminism in the application of one of the most successful theories in modern physics quantum mechanics using quantum mechanical theory the behaviour of elementary particles atoms and to a certain extent molecules can be described in detail and with an unprecedented accuracy however modelling the behaviour of something that can be found to impact on water quality in a catchment for example a cow using the same theory seems impossible due to the prohibitive calculation efforts needed for such an enterprise transferring these concepts to integrated catchment modelling implies that the usability of the results is zero when no model is applied while when taking everything imaginable into account the usability is zero as well due to a possible explosion of propagated uncertainties in the end and or the calculation effort needed now the question arises how to determine a sensible level of detail of an integrated model this refers to level of detail of process descriptions the information needed on initial and boundary conditions and on the geometry and structure of a given problem posing the question is easier than formulating a generic answer as it is in optimal tax theory nevertheless some elements of an answer will be addressed in the following clearly define the type of results sought for in terms of parameters time and space scales identify the sub models needed and their data need identity the set of unknown data in the collection of sub models evaluate whether enough measuring data of the right quality are available for calibration of the sub models consider how the interfaces of the sub models are described and if suitable interpolation procedures are in place to transfer information from one sub model to the other identify which component of the integrated model is responsible for the largest contribution to the uncertainty and re evaluate the results of the integrated model on the usability for the original goal set when this element is left out in this manner the level of detail in terms of processes interpolation procedures geometrical data and model calibration is tuned on the usability of the results obtained 3 2 does linking of sub models result in an explosion of uncertainty estimating the global uncertainty of icms is still limited by appropriate methods to estimate the various uncertainty sources and the propagation of uncertainty nevertheless simply calibrating and investigating the uncertainty of sub modules and then only further considering the best sub model parameterization in the icm is insufficient as well multi criteria assessment of icms selecting criteria depending on the modelling objective can at least provide valuable insights to the behaviour of complex coupled models houska et al 2017 investigated the performances of coupled hydrological biogeochemical models and evaluated parameter sets that simulated well single criteria and those parameter sets that performed well for all target criteria in their monte carlo based study they needed to reduce their acceptable parameter space by 99 9 discarding the majority of model setups that performed well for single criteria another topic concerning the linkage is the directional flow of information the flow of information is a relevant factor when designing the architecture of integrated catchment modelling studies models and software can be directly linked in an output input basis only if there is an upstream to downstream unidirectional flow of information i e no feedback this is insufficient when control systems are used which propagate information from downstream state variables to actuate on upstream ones this is an existing practice in some water systems e g linking wwtp states with the control of operations in the urban drainage system it is also reasonable that in a foreseeable future extensive sensor networks e g internet of things will play an increasing role in water management chen and han 2018 this will allow for assimilating an increasing amount of data in the system wani et al 2017 and possibly to control the operation of urban systems accounting for the status of the receiving water system and treatment capacity in such cases seamless model integration is necessary to account for the multi directional information flow current numerical solver schemes are highly tailored for the individual sub model characteristics nevertheless commercial software is progressively adapting to the environment of integrated catchment modelling for instance linking 1d and 2d hydrodynamic models for flood prediction leandro et al 2009 or linking a simplified ordinary differential equation ode based integrated system to represent wwtp urban drainage and river dynamics achleitner et al 2007 solvi 2007 further development of robust multi scale solvers and software which allow for the integration of simplified and physically based processes is required given that an integrated model has a larger number of uncertainty sources than each of its sub models it is tempting to think that its output uncertainty will also be larger this impression is reinforced by the belief that uncertainty propagation is synonymous to uncertainty amplification suggesting that in a chain of models the uncertainty can only grow however this is not necessarily true in contrast there are several cases in which the output uncertainty will decrease when models are coupled because of a compensation effect an analogy can be found e g for the rainfall scaling effect ciach and krajewski 2006 we illustrate this concept with some simplified examples consider a sewer system node where n pipes join and the sewage fluxes merge and flow into a single larger pipe let the uncertainty of the chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of the effluent be equal for all pipes and quantified by a standard deviation œÉ mg l then the standard deviation of the cod concentration of the larger pipe will be some value between œÉ n and œÉ thus either smaller or equal to that of the individual pipes in fact it will only be equal to œÉ if the cod uncertainties for all pipes are perfectly correlated which is not realistic thus uncertainty decreases a similar effect occurs when models are coupled in catchment modelling consider a case where farmers apply a pesticide to their land to protect their crops part of the pesticide will reach the local ditches through sub surface and surface flow this can be modelled using a soil hydrological and chemical model next the pesticide is transported to local streams and channels as modelled by a surface hydrological model finally the pesticide reaches the river and sea as predicted by a hydraulic model while the uncertainty about the pesticide concentration in the local ditch may be extremely high it will be small in the river and sea again averaging out effects cause uncertainty to decrease in addition subsystems and consequently sub models may act as low pass filters in terms of event frequencies as e g csos only start spilling after the entire sewer system volume has been filled in the netherlands with on average 8 mm in sewer storage this results in a cso frequency of only 5 6 spills per year this means that the uncertainty in the runoff routing due to uncertain initial conditions of the sewer catchment which is relatively high for smaller storms does not strongly affect the quality of river do simulations these examples show that uncertainty often decreases when sub models are integrated of course there are also cases where the opposite occurs a simple example is when a water quantity and a water quality model are coupled to calculate the pollution load kg s of a stream or sewer pipe the load is the product of flux m3 s and concentration kg m3 and if both have a relative error of 10 then the relative error of the load will increase to a value between 14 and 20 depending on the degree of correlation between the two uncertainty sources and assuming that the correlation is non negative if it is negative which is not unlikely then the relative error will be smaller than 14 in chaotic systems small deviations in variables can have huge consequences and hence in such systems it may occur that model coupling leads to an explosion of uncertainty in the case of integrated catchment water quality modelling this might happen when an intervention is based on an uncertain system variable for instance if authorities impose restrictive measures on industry and farmers based on whether a water quality index is above or below a threshold then a small uncertainty in the water quality index may have dramatic consequences if the index is close to its threshold value in summary coupling models does not automatically lead to an increase of uncertainty it very much depends on the correlation between the processes and the scale of spatial and temporal averaging to be certain whether uncertainties amplify or cancel out it is imperative that a sound and case specific uncertainty propagation analysis is conducted 4 challenges and bottlenecks in application of uncertainty analysis in integrated water quality models despite considerable uncertainty integrated models are important for effective decision support in major investment decisions for water utilities model outputs can be justified to a regulator in a transparent comprehensible and repeatable way especially when industrial modelling practice guidance is used in the creation of sub models relative comparison between solutions is still useful to rank alternatives they are often cheaper than performing extensive and long term measurements there is a capability to simulate extreme events although calibration based on regular events may decrease the validity of the results lee jr 1973 defined seven sins for large scale models for urban planning and we would like to revisit them for integrated water quality models in the context of uncertainty to highlight remaining challenges in application although defined 45 years ago some of these points may still ring true in the ears of integrated modellers hyper comprehensiveness 1 defined as an overly complex model structure and complicatedness 2 in terms of interactions between the model components are connected to the question of linking different sub models these two points lead to the rule that not the most complex model should be selected but following ockham s razor the least complex that answers the asked question reliably in a comprehensible and verifiable way rauch et al 2002 also grossness 3 which means the level of detail for model results used for predictions may be too coarse for effective decision making relates to this aspect the objective of the modelling endeavour should be clarified and with it the scale and level of detail of the necessary results this adds to the challenge of linking models that represent processes that act on different space and time scales bl√∂schl and sivapalan 1995 distinguish between a process observation and modelling scale under the best scenario those scales should match but in integrated catchment studies this is generally not the case as for example pollutant wash off or a combined sewer overflow happens at small spatial and temporal scale but the effects can be found in the receiving water at larger spatial and temporal scales transformations based on downscaling and upscaling techniques are generally necessary to obtain the required match between scales cristiano et al 2017 the hungriness 4 for data is connected to this point in the way that an adequate amount of data is essential to define the model setup and to identify the model parameters muschalla et al 2009 different level of model integration also demands different amount and quality of data for modelling and decision making eggimann et al 2017 furthermore the lack of data in environmental studies and a common non sharing policy camargos et al 2018 and the need to satisfy local regulators sriwastava et al 2018 remain major problems for performing a complete uncertainty analysis mechanicalness 5 defined as errors caused by the computational representation of the model could in times of increasing computational resources be reinterpreted as limitations in terms of computational power availability accessibility to source code and ability to adapt model settings and computational cost a typical uncertainty analysis study requires a significant amount of simulations which cannot be performed manually therefore the modeller should find ways to automatize this process though most of the commercial software does not provide this capability even if such a capability exists sufficient documentation to guide the end user is sparse it is also common practice that several parameters e g the time step the space step the tolerance in iteration loops in commercial software are considered as default values and adaptation and changes to these parameters might result in simulation malfunctions there are several types of models which are characterised by significant computational cost for each run in the magnitude of hours days especially if they are used for real world case studies therefore a typical uncertainty analysis is often not feasible one way to cope with that is the use of adaptive or informed samplers goodman and weare 2010 hoffman and gelman 2014 laloy and vrugt 2012 and surrogate models or emulators e g for sewer hydraulics carbajal et al 2017 for hydrological models yang et al 2018 or for rainfall dynamics in 2d physically based flow models moreno rodenas et al 2018 the problem of wrongheadedness 6 can be explained by the gap between the behaviour of the model which it was built for and what it is used for models often represent rather the data available than focussing on the objectives this can lead to focusing on aspects that might not matter and forgetting about those that do and that we simply do not have data about this connects to the observation that perception of uncertainty on different inputs and parameters for existing model does not scale when used for several objectives which may change the temporal and spatial extent of the project see fig 3 the calculated level of uncertainty although the numbers do not change will be perceived differently depending on the nature of the objective being either small scale measures e g the design of a cso using only design rainfall events or strategic decisions e g water quality considerations of a whole river basin for integrated models that are used for decision making based on acute effects such as ammonia toxicity or oxygen depletion the focus is on bigger events as the sewer and wwtp act as high pass filters for smaller events and the impacts only occur when the assimilative capacity of the river is exceeded for those events the relative uncertainty due to e g initial losses decreases rapidly therefore for different objectives the same calculated level of uncertainty will result in a different objective specific level of uncertainty this difference between the calculated and objective specific uncertainty is called objective shift for example the usage of literature values for initial losses on the surface e g 4 mm are much more sensitive for the design of a cso if a 10 mm rainfall event is used than for a 50 mm one the same holds true for the calibration of models on these events similar to the selection of different input data tscheikner gratl et al 2016 vonach et al 2018 the calibration on different objectives e g different water quality parameters or water quantity influences the model behaviour the objectives of the modelling effort very much determines the characterisation of a model bennett et al 2013 it is therefore advisable although difficult in practice to apply the model in consequence only for the objective it is calibrated to due to the fact that not all sub models can be calibrated and every sub model will always be influenced by the calibration of the upstream models used as input distortion is unavoidable in practice with linked models and could only be avoided by building an integrated model from scratch tscheikner gratl et al 2017 furthermore the question arises if the importance of still statistical graspable uncertainties dwindles in comparison to deep uncertainties when the objective scale changes because if you consider a whole river basin over a period of 100 years then things such as climate change population in or decrease and land use changes could be the cause of huge uncertainties while other uncertainties that would dominate at smaller scales could diminish in importance this objective shift is one reason why the application of one model for several objectives without adapting and scaling the input data and the model could lead to poor predictions with high levels of uncertainty also uncertainty quantification is seldom scalable and therefore there exists no one fits all solution if we translate all the limitations mentioned to a common metric we end up at the sin of expensiveness 7 in practice addressing most of these issues requires monetary investments e g for software sensors experienced modellers as well as time resources these costs must be covered by the modeller and in consequence need to be billable to the decision maker in case that decision maker and modeller are different entities and although reducing uncertainty is valuable reckhow 1994 it is difficult to communicate this this influences also the point of data availability due to costs for data acquisition often data transmission and costs for data quality control which is often neglected cost minimization schemes may also lead to the application of existing models for different objectives without the necessary and costly adaptions this encompasses also a lack of performance assessment not only if the measures had the expected effect but also to collect evidence about the degree of uncertainty of model predictions there are however opportunities to use information about uncertainty in models to better understand trade offs between risks of failing environmental standards and investment costs communicating uncertainty in models as probability of failure of environmental standards as well as impact of uncertainty on investment costs sriwastava et al 2018 tends to gain interest among practitioners 5 conclusion in the course of the quics project we found several key points that we want to highlight here 1 uncertainty analysis of integrated catchment water quality modelling should be a continuous process performed in parallel to the modelling exercise rather than being an activity that is carried out after the main modelling activities this inclusion starts with the definition of the modelling goals and should be present through the model build simulation and interpretation phases of an integrated catchment modelling study 2 linking together different models is a non trivial task and requires careful and detailed handling however coupling models does not automatically lead to an increase of uncertainty results and ongoing studies from and based on the quics project highlighted with an asterisk in the references indicate that uncertainty in water quantity and quality predictions does not necessarily increase across an icm the important issue is not the scale of a model but the integration of different models developed at different spatial and temporal scales it is often at these interfaces that the modelling approaches radically changes this issue is particularly important when modelling water quality processes often the scale and temporal resolution of the hydraulic model that drives the water quality model has been developed at a different scale from the water quality process model 3 further research in uncertainty decomposition and model acceleration especially the generalisation of input based emulation into water quality dynamics is still required to allow for the implementation of uncertainty analysis frameworks in practice uncertainty analysis can lead to potentially less expensive solutions with a better understanding of risk of water quality compliance failure simplifying approaches such as the use of emulators and new upscaling downscaling techniques can be applied successfully in icm studies without a significant loss of accuracy in determining the magnitude of model uncertainties there is the potential for simplified and computationally efficient approaches for water quality uncertainty in icm studies to be developed and then used by end users that are faced with decisions on investment 4 understanding the outcomes and the inherent uncertainties of icms poses a challenge in practical application each sub model reflects the knowledge of some specialism e g hydraulics water quality wwtp performance and persons that master all these different subjects entirely are very rare this implies that in practice one needs a team of experts to understand apply and communicate the results correctly for the purpose the model was assembled for consequently more research should also be carried out on how to involve local environmental regulators and organisations in order that they can become aware and then appreciate the role of uncertainty analysis in determining what investment actions are required to meet regulatory requirements in the longer term regulators need to be explicit as to how they would incorporate uncertainty analysis into their decision making processes finally although modelling activity is highly tailored for each specific scenario further discussion on details such as globally acceptable uncertainty degrees or sub model linkage strategies is needed declaration of interests

19092,fluidized bed bioreactors fbr are characterized by two phase mixture of fluid and solid in which the bed of solid particles is fluidized by means of downward or upward recirculation stream fbrs are widely used for multiple environmental engineering solutions such as wastewater treatment as well as some industrial applications fbr offers many benefits such as compact bioreactor size due to short hydraulic retention time long biomass retention on the carrier high conversion rates due to fully mixed conditions and consequently high mass transfer rates no channelling of flow dilution of influent concentrations due to recycle flow suitability for enrichment of microbes with low k m values the disadvantages of fbrs include bioreactor size limitations due to the height to diameter ratio high energy requirements due to high recycle ratios and long start up period for biofilm formation this paper critically reviews some of the key studies on biomass enrichment via immobilisation of low growth yield microorganisms high rates via fully mixed conditions technical developments in fbrs and ways of overcoming toxic effects via solution recycling this technology has many potential new uses as well as hydrodynamic characteristics which enable high rate environmental engineering and industrial applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilm fluidized bed bioreactor high rate water treatment wastewater treatment 1 introduction fluidized bed bioreactors fbrs are characterized by solid biomass carrier that is suspended using high liquid or gas flow rates that allow the carrier to be fluidized and behave as though it was a fluid fluidized bed bioreactors were originally developed for wastewater treatment whilst this technology has also many other potential uses biological treatment of organic and inorganic environmental contaminants is often challenged by low contaminant concentrations their toxicity and or low energy yields from contaminant degradation to the microorganisms catalysing the reactions fbrs can overcome many of these challenges and hence have been widely studied for many applications fig 1 this technology has been widely applied in environmental engineering field for many purposes including domestic wastewater treatment biodegradation of recalcitrant organic compounds reduction oxidation of organic or inorganic contaminants bio precipitation of various inorganic compounds via oxidation reduction reactions and bio energy generation as can be seen from the upper right corner of fig 1 since 1970s nearly 2000 scientific contributions have been published on fbrs with an increasing momentum since 1990 s although the fbrs can be used for various purposes in multiple fields this paper focuses on the history technological advances as well as advantages and disadvantages of this technology in environmental engineering field see fig 2 since 1980 s fbrs have been increasingly used as an effective technology to treat water and wastewater firstly manhattan college new york the u s epa municipal environmental research laboratory merl cincinnati ohio and the water research centre medmenham england collaborated to develop fbr technology for wastewater treatment in a 1980 conference in manchester wrc umist conference on biological fluidized bed treatment of water and wastewater manchester england fbr technology was hailed as the most significant advance in the field of wastewater treatment in the last fifty years although there was no full scale plant at that time the first full scale fbr in the us was installed at the reno sparks wastewater treatment plant in the early 1980s and remains the largest full scale fbr treating domestic wastewater as of 2009 water environment federation 2010 in the 1980s general motors manufacturing facilities installed 12 aerobic fbrs using developed process configuration by dorroliver inc sutton and mishra 1994 almost at the same time anaerobic fbrs were constructed in 1982 at a soy protein factory in muscatine iowa u s heijnen et al 1989 in 1999 an industrial wastewater with a phenolic load of 1120 kg day 1 was treated using fbr having two towers of 9 m diameter and 8 5 m height supplied by dorr oliver b v amsterdam the netherlands sutton et al 1999 in the same time frame the most important commercial developments in this field was the start up of several anaerobic two stage fbr plants by biothane b v delft the netherlands for industrial wastewater heijnen et al 1989 the first two plants were constructed in delft in the netherlands and prouvy in france and anaflux process was developed by degremont s a holst et al 1997 all the constructed fbr systems are highly efficient due to the high biomass concentration reaching 30 90 kg m 3 together with efficient gas liquid mass transfer created by high up flow liquid velocities reaching 10 m h 1 holst et al 1997 according to wef manual practice and asce manuals and reports in 2010 water environment federation 2010 more than 80 full scale fbrs have been installed with two thirds of them were treating industrial wastewater in 1999 the rest were treating municipal wastewater treatment of a variety of wastewaters has been investigated at both laboratory and pilot scale fbrs which may allow expansion or upgrading of plants to meet more stringent future standards fbr system have been applied for various environmental fields applications for specific purposes of fbr have two main reasons the first of which is to minimize physical limitations by providing high degree mixing of water solid phase and the second is to support the microbial growth and enrichment therefore fbr allows high substrate loading rates to enrich slow growing biomass especially for the treatment of wastewater containing toxic chemicals treatment this technology offers many advantages because recirculation of the water dilutes the concentration of the influent to a non toxic level for bacteria and provides completely mixed or semi completely mixed conditions the outstanding advantages of fbr systems include high concentration of biomass very large surface area for biomass attachment dilution of the influent with effluent to reduce shock effects of toxicant spikes as well as higher loading rates efficient mass transfer for all treatment systems previous fbr publications often focus on specific aspects such as process modelling shen et al 2012 and or use in specific applications such as low temperature bioremediation of polychlorophenols puhakka and melin 1998 biological iron oxidation nurmi et al 2009 anaerobic sulfate treatment kaksonen et al 2006 and acid mine drainage treatment using sulfate reduction based processes kaksonen and puhakka 2007 papirio et al 2013 as well as bio hydrogen production koskinen et al 2007 some papers review the use of fbr technology in particular fields such as wastewater treatment bello et al 2017 nelson et al 2017 burghate and ingole 2013 however a review analysing mechanisms behind the good performance of fbr applications for various non conventional environmental engineering solutions is missing the following sections discuss on fbrs as means of selective enrichment of low growth yield microoganisms overcoming toxic effects on microorganisms as well as high rate performances for a number of environmental engineering applications 2 biomass enrichment via immobilisation of low yield microorganisms aerobic and anaerobic polychlorophenol polycp degradation iron oxidation anaerobic ammonium oxidation and reductive dechlorination of chloroethenes are examples of the biological processes which release little energy for biomass growth in addition bioprocessing at suboptimally low substrate concentrations or temperatures decreases reaction rates and consequently further decreases microbial growth yields and emphasizes the need for efficient retainment of enriched microorganisms in the system immobilisation of microorganisms with extremely low growth yields is important for engineering applications typical low growth yield microrganisms are chemolithotrophs catalysing the oxidations of various inorganic compounds that have found important applications in environmental engineering gibbs free energy values of several oxidation or reduction processes are shown in table 1 in the applications such as bioremediation of chlorinated organic compounds the influent substrate concentrations are typically at levels or well below the effluent concentrations of conventional wastewater treatment further chlorinated organic compounds are already highly oxidized and thus provide little energy from oxidative mineralization for these reasons wash out of cells cannot be afforded and therefore these bioprocesses require very long biomass retention times melin et al 1997 polychlorinated phenols are highly oxidized compounds and thus their oxidation provides little energy for microorganisms m√§kinen et al 1993 measured a net growth yield of 0 03 mg of volatile suspended solids vss per mg of chlorophenols cps removed or 0 09 mg of vss mg total organic carbon toc removed 1 anaerobic microorganisms have also low growth yields and or low maximum degradation rates which means long cell retention times are required to enrich the competent biomass cell yields for reductive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene have been reported to be in the range of 0 10 0 15 g per g chloride released holliger et al 1998 maymo gatell et al 1997 therefore fbrs with long sludge retention times srts allow enrichment of reductively dechlorinating microorganisms able to carry on the slowest reactions such as dechlorination of vinyl chloride to ethene ballapragada et al 1997 or 2 4 dcp ortho dechlorination magar et al 1999 during sequential dechlorination of tetrachloroethene and pentachlorophenol respectively chemolithoautotrophic anaerobic ammonium oxidizing microorganisms anammox have extremely slow growth rates of 2 17 days for a review see terada et al 2011 chen et al 2013 reported a net growth yield of 0 03 g vss g nh4 n 1 for anammox bacteria the very long srt requiring anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria were first discovered from a denitrifying fluidized bed bioreactor mulder et al 1995 fbrs along with other long srt reactor configurations have been developed for the anammox strous et al 1997 iron is a key element in bioleaching of valuable metals from sulfide ores during bioleaching iron has a key role in biooxidation process affecting microbial growth leaching efficiency and precipitate formation the valuable metals from low grade sulfide minerals in bioleaching process are solubilized with biogenic ferric iron and sulfuric acid the final effluents from bioleaching processes have high concentrations of dissolved iron and sulfate the iron in final effluent is mainly present as ferrous iron and has to be oxidized by acidophilic microorganisms followed by precipitation for an effective removal ferrous iron is a weak reductant and a parsimonious energy source for acidophilic microorganisms such as acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ferguson and ingledew 2008 the product ferric iron on the other hand is a powerful oxidizing agent for a variety of sulfidic minerals thus acidophilic iron oxidizing microorganisms are commonly used for biotechnological applications in mineral processing johnson et al 2012 the kinetic aspects of iron oxidation were reviewed by nemati et al 1998 including cell yields from earlier works to range between 8 and 20 mg cells g iron 1 more recently blight and ralph 2008 reported a growth yield of 3 1 mg dry cell biomass g iron 1 for iron oxidizing bacteria in batch cultivation as iron oxidation releases little energy these microorganisms must oxidise a lot of iron in order to sustain growth this is from technological point of view very beneficial however high rates of iron oxidation often result in oxygen limitation and require specific reactor designs to overcome this limitation fbrs with high biomass hold up carrier material such as activated carbon have proven efficient in retaining iron oxidizing biomass kinnunen and puhakka 2004 van der meer et al 2007 activated carbon carrier retained 3 7 109 cells g 1 and the formation of jarosite precipitates formed on the top of activated carbon carrier layer and coating the activated carbon carriers further enhanced the attachment of bacteria in the system fbr jarosite precipitates contained 3 1 1010 cells g 1 indicating that jarosite formation improves iron oxidizing biomass build up in the fbr system kinnunen and puhakka 2004 activated carbon bound leptospirillum ferriphilum dominated iron oxidizing cultures maintained their activity at environmental extremes including ph below 1 ferrous and ferric iron concentrations of 24 g l 1 and cu2 concentration of 2 g l 1 kinnunen and puhakka 2005 the iron oxidizing fbrs were successfully applied for ferric iron lixiviant regeneration kinnunen and puhakka 2004 and the removal of excess iron and sulfate from barren heap bioleaching liquors √∂zkaya et al 2007 nurmi et al 2009 and 2010a other low growth yield cultures selectively enriched in fbrs include marine ammonia to nitrite oxidizers melin et al 1996 4 chlorophenol mineralizing denitrifiers melin et al 1993 lake water natural organic matter degraders kolehmainen et al 2010 and autotrophic denitrifiers combining the use of reduced sulfur compounds as electron donors with nitrate and or nitrite reduction kim et al 2004 tang and nemati 2010 sahinkaya et al 2015 zou et al 2016 di capua et al 2017a 3 high rates via fully mixed conditions high recirculation in fbrs may cause hydraulic regime to approach completely mixed conditions khanongnuch et al 2018 conducted a residence time distribution rtd test using 10 ml of a 1 m kcl solution as a tracer at two different flow rates of 360 and 108 ml h 1 they used morrill dispersion index mdi to evaluate the flow characteristics in the fbr for plug flow and completely mixed conditions the mid values are 2 and 22 respectively in the fbr the mid values were 9 and 11 for two different flow rates indicating hydraulic regime as semi complete mixing 3 1 high rate transformation of chlorinated organics the first paper on high rate bioremediation of chlorinated organics in fbrs at ambient groundwater temperature of 4 10 c was published by j√§rvinen et al 1994 during the treatment of trichlorophenol tcp tetrachlorophenol tecp and pentachlorophenol pcp contaminated groundwater over 99 9 mineralization of cps was achieved with the effluent concentrations of 0 003 mg l 1 or less at a cp loading rate of up to 740 mg l 1d 1 or hrt s of 1 4 5 h even at 4 c batch kinetic studies of specific maximum degradation rates and half saturation constants showed that the fbr process selectively enriched microorganisms able to degrade the contaminants to very low concentrations due to a high affinity for the poly cp substrates melin et al 1997 and 1998a this process was taken in use for large scale groundwater remediation at ambient temperature of 8 c degrading 2 4 6 tcp 2 3 4 6 tecp and pcp by over 99 over 99 and over 96 respectively langwaldt and puhakka 2002 and continued operation for 10 years between 1994 and 2004 tiirola et al 2002 langwaldt et al 2008 molecular analysis of the 16s rrna gene of the bacterial community of the long term operated over 6 years fbr system revealed a stable bacterial community with a low species diversity the dominant organisms in the fbr was novosphingobium sp strain mt1 which was characterized by low growth rate optimized number of rrna operons and ability to aggregate tiirola et al 2002 the ks for 2 3 46 tecp of novospingobium sp strain mt1 was 2 1 mg l 1 and the strain degraded cps faster at 8 c than at room temperature m√§nnist√∂ et al 2001 reductive transformations of chlorinated organic compounds are often incomplete and may result in undesired end products of bioremediation chlorinated solvents such as chloroethenes are typical groundwater contaminants reductive transformation of tetrachloroethene occurs via trichloroethene cis dichloroethene and vinyl chloride to ethene vinyl chloride is toxic very slow to degrade and thus often accumulates ballapragada et al 1997 revealed in fbrs that by maintaining low steady state concentrations of hydrogen dechlorinating microorganisms outcompeted methanogens as indicated by determined ks half saturation kinetic constant values of 20 and 1000 micro mol mg protein d 1 for dechlorinators and methanogens respectively thus the process resulted in efficient dechlorination of chloroethenes at low h2 partial pressures this was accomplished in fbrs provided with both liquid and gas phase recycle flows reductive dechlorination of aromatic chlorinated compounds such as pentachlorophenol is also often incomplete for a review see mohn and tiedje 1992 the fate and kinetic behaviour of pcp and its degradation products in fbrs were investigated by magar et al 1999 fully mixed conditions in fbrs result in a reactor substrate and metabolite concentration being the same as in the effluent hence fbr biofilm microorganisms are typically exposed to low substrate concentrations which serves as a selective factor for the enrichment of microbes with low substrate affinities this helps to achieve very good quality effluents 3 2 high rate biological iron oxidation a number of studies have aimed at reaching high rates of biological iron oxidation with acidophilic microorganisms using various reactor configurations such as packed bed bioreactor fluidized bed bioreactor airlift bioreactor continuously stirred tank bioreactor cstr and membrane bioreactor mbr iron oxidation performance for various bioreactor types as well as hydraulic retention time and dominated microbial species in bioreactor are shown in table 2 among the bioreactor configurations used fbrs had the highest volumetric iron oxidation rates table 2 to our knowledge the first research on high rate biological iron oxidation in fbr was conducted by kinnunen and puhakka 2004 they aimed to develop a high rate fbr for ferric sulfate production and reported iron oxidation rate of 8 2 kg fe ii m3 h 1 after 7 months of continuous enrichment and air aeration at 37 c at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 0 6 h in their observation oxygen supply became the rate limiting factor and accordingly they studied the effect of aeration gas composition with the gas mixture of 99 5 o2 0 5 co2 vol vol they detected the highest iron oxidation rate of 26 4 kg fe ii l h 1 at hrt of 0 2 h in fbr √∂zkaya et al 2007 and nurmi et al 2009 recorded biological iron oxidation rates of 10 7 kg fe ii l h 1 and 8 2 kg fe ii l h 1 at hydraulic retention times of 2 h and 1 h respectively with long term bioreactor operations 3 3 high rate biohydrogen production biological hydrogen production is a potential approach for the production of sustainable energy carriers for a review see hallenbeck and ghosh 2009 a comparison of biohydrogen production rates in fbrs and other bioreactor configurations with similar substrates and bioreactor conditions is shown in table 3 biohydrogen production was compared between bioreactors such as fbr fixed bed completely stirred tank bioreactor cstr and up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb table 3 the highest hydrogen production rate of 65 5 l h2 l d 1 or 2 59 mol h2 l d 1 was obtained with galactose in a fbr at a hrt of 2 h at 35 c sivagurunathan et al 2017 similarly zhang et al 2007 reported hydrogen production rate of 56 6 l l h2 l d 1 in a fbr with glucose lin et al 2009 reported the highest hydrogen production rate of 43 2 l h2 l d 1 in a fbr with sucrose 3 4 high rate sulfate reduction biological sulfate reduction is important for the treatment of acid mine drainage which contains high sulfate and metal concentrations and has acidic ph the performance of several bioreactor configurations have been tested for sulfate reducing bacteria for treating mining wastewaters and for the recovery of metals the fbr is an efficient way to control and remediate acidic mine drainage because of high biomass retention resistance to inhibitors high organic sulfate and metal loadings at low hrt for reviews see papirio et al 2013 and kaksonen and puhakka 2007 considering these potential advantages for the first time kaksonen et al 2003a and b hypothesized that the fbr process would be an effective treatment system for acidic mine drainage kaksonen et al 2003b optimized metal sulfide precipitation determined performance and ethanol oxidation kinetics and the effects of hrt and sulfide toxicity in fbr treatment of acidic sulfate metal containing wastewater kaksonen et al 2004a later the biodiversity of the fbrs were investigated in detail kaksonen et al 2004b c kaksonen et al 2006 first concluded that fbrs are well suited for the combined removal of metals acidity and sulfate from wastewater since the recycle flow in the fbrs dilutes high influent concentrations kaksonen and puhakka 2007 also proposed that downflow fbrs allow the recovery of metal sulfides at the bottom of the bioreactor kaksonen and puhakka 2007 which was later demonstrated by sahinkaya and gungor 2010 sahinkaya et al 2007a b reported that the rate of acetate oxidation limited the sulfidogenic treatment of metal containing wastewater at 8 and 65 c auvinen et al 2009 recorded that long term operation of a low temperature 9 c fbr resulted in enrichment of formate utilizing psychrotolerant mesophilic sulfate reducing bacteria kaksonen et al 2007 2008 also isolated novel thermophilic sulfate reducers from sulfidogenic fbrs 3 5 anaerobic ammonium oxidation in a denitrifying bioprocess the first publication on anammox process was presented in a biotechnology congress by graaf et al 1990 then a fbr based anammox process has been patented by mulder 1992 1993 with the us patent numbers of 5078884 and 5259959 in 1995 mulder et al reported that nh4 was disappearing from a denitrifying fluidized bed bioreactor treating effluent from a methanogenic bioreactor a maximum ammonium removal rate of 0 4 kg n m3 d 1 was observed in their study this worthy discovery by mulder et al 1995 has led to the novel bioprocess of anaerobic ammonium oxidation given the name anammox anaerobic ammonium oxidation and the enrichment of anammox micro organisms was reported by graaf et al 1996 with the conversion rate by the enrichment culture in a fbr of 3 kg nh4 m3 d 1 jetten et al 2001 reported that the anammox biomass efficiently removed ammonium in a fbr over nitrite with the nitrogen load increasing from 0 2 kg ntot m3 d 1 to 2 6 ntot m3 d 1 over one year the growth rate and yield of anammox bacteria are quite low and the use of fbr with efficient cell retainment can improve the performance stability as mentioned above morales et al 2015 reported that anammox bacteria need a minimum solid retention time srt of 85 d at 15 c similarly sun et al 2018 operated an anammox membrane bioreactor at 25 c and reported that when srt was over 500 d the vss content increased gradually from 125 mg l 1 to 5590 mg l 1 and the maximum nitrogen removal rate was 1 18 kg n m3 d 1 the decrease of srt to 50 d caused a gradual decline in sludge concentration and the maximum nitrogen removal rate decreased to 0 67 g total n g vss d 1 3 6 high rate autotrophic denitrification nutrient removal from wastewater is becoming more important due to stringent discharge standards hence novel processes are being developed for this purpose in recent years sulfur based sahinkaya and dursun 2012 and thiosulfate based autotorophic denitrification processes di capua et al 2017a zou et al 2016 have been investigated using various bioreactor alternatives under different operational conditions potential electron donors for autotrophic denitrification i e reduction of no3 and or no2 reduction to n2 using co2 and hco3 as carbon source include h2 and sulfur compounds s2o3 2 s2 s¬∫ s4o6 2 so3 2 sulfur based autotrophic denitrification offers two main advantages over heterotrophic denitrification namely no need for carbon source and decreased waste sludge generation thiosulfate driven denitrification is a highly energy efficient di capua et al 2016 although packed bed bioreactor technology is commonly used for sulfur based denitrification studies it is reported that operational problems di capua et al 2015 and high loading rates of no3 limits denitrification efficiency due to low sulfur dissolution rate in this type of bioreactors kim et al 2004 although fbrs can overcome problems encountered in packed bed bioreactor system there are a few fbr reports so far on sulfur based denitrification kim et al 2004 zou et al 2016 di capua et al 2017a the driving forces to use high rate thiosulfate driven denitrification in fbrs are high active biomass concentration a high specific surface area uniform mixing a smaller pressure drop than in fixed bed biofilm systems tolerance to no3 shock loadings and influent concentrations diluted due to recycle flow zou et al 2016 operated two thiosulfate based denitrification driven fbrs with thiobacillus denitrificans dominated biofilms at two different temperatures of 20 and 30 c they achieved high rate reduction of 1230 mg no3 l 1 at ph of 5 8 di capua et al 2017a studied thiosulfate denitrification in a fbr under feed ph ranges from 7 0 to 5 25 they reported denitrification efficiency greater than 99 even at bioreactor ph of 5 30 the effect of continuous co2 feeding on denitrification rate in a fbr at ph values lower than 5 0 was investigated complete denitrification was achieved even at ph of 4 75 in fbr with a carbonation unit which was a record among published papers in another study zou et al 2016 investigated autotrophic denitrification and denitritation with thiosulfate for nitrate and nitrite removal at temperatures of 20 c and 30 c in fbr they reported complete nitrate removal with a nitrate loading rate of 600 mg l h 1 at a hrt of 10 min and effluent ph of 5 8 these findings demonstrated that fbrs hold potential for thiosulfate driven denitrification of acidic wastewaters studies illustrated that besides acidic ph fbr biofilms have high resistance to extremely low temperatures di capua et al 2017a and high heavy metal concentrations di capua et al 2017b thiosulfate based denitrifying fbr tolerated up to 174 mg l 1 ni due to high concentrations of ni complexing smp di capua et al 2017b 3 7 high rate fungal fbrs although bacteria and archaea are commonly used in fbrs the use of fungi has also received attention in recent years fungal bioreactors may have advantages due to their rich degrading enzymes ability to withstand harsh conditions loading fluctuations low ph and nutrient tolerance see espinosa ortiz et al 2016 for review fungal fbrs have also been used for treatment of industrial wastewater blanquez et al 2007 investigated the impact of hrt on the decolorization efficiency of grey lanaset g textile dye in a trametes versicolor attached fbr decolorization efficiency was quite high 80 at various hrts ranging from 18 to 120 h with corresponding removal rates of 6 73 to 1 16 mg l 1 h 1 studies have also illustrated that biotransformation of pharmaceutically active compounds using white rot fungi and their oxidoreductase enzymes is promising due to low cost and environmentally friendly solution see naghdi et al 2018 for review cruz morato et al 2014 studied the hospital wastewater treatment by fungal bioreactor and the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptor compounds were evaluated the study was conducted using a batch fbr under sterile and non sterile conditions with trametes versicolor pellets under non sterile conditions 46 out of the 51 pharmaceutical active compounds were partially or completely removed under sterile environment total pharmaceutical active compounds elimination performance was 83 2 hence the fungal fbr has performed well for the biodegradation of recalcitrant pharmaceutical active compounds although the treatment of industrial wastewater or recalcitrant compound using fungal bioreactor may have some advantages transition to non sterile conditions may be challenging due to competition with the indigenous microorganisms mir tutusaus et al 2016 in this context mir tutusaus et al 2016 studied the coagulation flocculation and uv radiation processes as pretreatments for the hospital wastewater treatment using a fungal bioreactor the results illustrated that a coagulation flocculation pretreatment coupled to a fungal treatment in an air pulsed fbr improved the operation duration due to maintaining fungal activity for 28 days without biomass reinoculation in this context a recent study mir tutusaus et al 2018 reviewed the white rot fungal technologies for micropollutant biodegradation and the advantages limitations and a range of solutions to overcome the limitations have been reviewed 4 technical developments in fluidized bed bioreactors commonly used aerobic and anaerobic fbr configurations are shown in fig 3 a and fig 3b respectively fbr technology has been successfully adapted for specific purposes in many scientific fields this section summarises new developments in fbr technology see fig 4 4 1 fbr with the separation of solid products hydrometallurgical effluent streams from sulfide mineral processing typically contain high concentrations of iron and sulfate therefore iron and sulfate removal from these streams is essential in the management of bioleaching process kinnunen and puhakka 2004 2005 achieved high rate and highly effective biological iron oxidation with a fbr this process was developed for ferric lixiviant production the first study for fbr facilitated ferric precipitation was carried out at tampere university of technology nurmi et al 2010b ozkaya et al 2007 on integrated biological iron oxidation and precipitation processes excess iron and sulfate removal is essential to overcome undesired iron precipitation causing in other parts of the process circuit negative effects such as blockage of pumps valves pipes and the creation of kinetic barriers for bioleaching due to jarosite formation even at low ph nurmi et al 2010a ozkaya et al 2007 the integrated system was comprised of a fbr and a gravity settler as illustrated in fig 3 similarly an integrated fbr and gravity settler system was used for the removal of arsenic from a synthetic arsenic containing acidic solution ahoranta et al 2016 the effect of ph on arsenic removal efficiency and precipitate stability was investigated at ph ranges from 3 0 to 1 6 the results showed that the integrated system has potential for the removal of arsenic iron and sulfate from bioleaching effluents and low ph acid mine drainage 4 2 downward fluidization inverse fluidized bed bioreactors ifbr and inverse turbulent bed bioreactors itbr fluidized bed bioreactors have traditionally relied on carrier material which is heavier than water and that is fluidized upward nikolov and karamanev 1990 explored the characteristics of an ideal biofilm bioreactor and based on the evaluation proposed an inverse fluidized bed bioreactor ifbr for biofilm research in ifbr carrier particles are lighter than water and water moves downward resulting in downward expansion of the bed the ifbr developed by nikolov and karamanev 1990 had an internal draft tube causing the liquid to circulate in the bioreactor due to airlift principle however not all ifbrs have such a draft tube in ifbr the bed expansion can be achieved by recirculating liquid from the bottom to the top of the bioreactor another variation of inverse fluidization is so called inverse turbulent bed bioreactor itbr which utilises the recycling of biogas from the top of the bioreactor to the bottom to achieve bed expansion buffi√®re et al 2000 arnaiz et al 2003 carrier materials used for inverse fluidization include styrofoam spheres nikolov and karamanev 1990 polystyrene beads choi et al 1995 sabarunisha begum and radha 2013 low density polyethylene particles castilla et al 2000 and extendosphere small silica particles with an air bubble inside arnaiz et al 2003 alvarado lassman et al 2008 cheng et al 2017 inverse fluidization has been utilised for both aerobic and anaerobic bioprocesses examples of applications include the anaerobic treatment of brewery wastewaters alvarado lassman et al 2008 and wine distillery wastewaters arnaiz et al 2005 biological selenate reduction cheng et al 2017 acidic sulfate and metal containing wastewaters sahinkaya and gungor 2010 aerobic starch wastewater treatment rajasimman and karthikeyan 2009 and aerobic phenol biodegradation kryst and karamanev 2001 sabarunisha begum and radha 2013 one of the advantages of downflow fluidization over traditional upflow fluidized bed bioreactors is that in bioreactors with inverse fluidization the bottom of the bioreactor can be used for settling for example sahinkaya and gungor 2010 suggested that the metal sulfide precipitates formed in down flow fluidized bed bioreactors could be separated from biomass by settling at the bottom of the bioreactor however when comparing upflow and downflow fluidized bed bioreactors for biological sulfate reduction and metal precipitation sahinkaya and gungor 2010 observed that the utilisation of electron donor for sulfate reduction was more efficient in the upflow fluidized bed bioreactor whereas methanogenes were more dominant in the downflow fluidized bed bioreactor which may be due to lover attachment ability of the srb to the media compared to the methanogenic archaea 4 3 fluidized bed membrane bioreactors fbmbr fluidized beds have been integrated with the ultra micro filtration membranes to create fluidized bed membrane bioreactors fbmrs to improve the biomass retainment and performance of processes which rely on slow growing microorganisms yoo et al 2012 studied domestic wastewater treatment using a laboratory scale staged anaerobic fbmr the process consisted of two separate fbrs the first one was a conventional anaerobic fbr and the second one was an fbmr the reactors were fed with the domestic wastewater from primary settling granular activated carbon gac fluidization prevented membrane fouling during 192 days of operation at 25 c and the effluent chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod concentrations averaged 25 mg l 1 and 7 mg l 1 respectively at a hrt of 2 3 h the energy potential of the produced methane was greater than the energy requirement in another study bae et al 2014 compared the single and staged anaerobic fbmr and concluded that single stage anaerobic fbr was a viable alternative to staged fbmr which may reduce the construction and maintenance cost after successful results in lab scale bioreactors the same group shin et al 2014 evaluated the performance of staged anaerobic fbmr in pilot scale with domestic wastewater from primary settling at varying temperatures of 8 30 c the effluent cod and bod concentrations averaged 23 mg l 1 and 7 mg l 1 respectively the operational energy need of 0 23 kw h m3 1 could be met with the methane generation in the process although the process gave satisfactory results two years operation of the fbmr with gac media severally damaged the membrane and hence membrane integrity could be an operational problem in long term use shin et al 2016 in order to reduce membrane fouling and the damage caused by gac fluidization the same group evaluated the use of ceramic membrane in a single stage lab scale fbmr for the treatment of synthetic low strength domestic wastewater aslam et al 2017 the bioreactor was operated continuously for 395 days at 25 c and fluxes of 14 5 17 l m2 membrane area h 1 lmh the process produced high permeate quality 23 mg l 1 cod at the effluent with low energy requirement of 0 039 kw h m3 1 which was only 17 of the energy to be produced from methane generated see fig 5 the superiority of the anaerobic mbr for domestic wastewater treatment at low or moderate temperatures has been shown in the literature shin et al 2014 however the fouling of the membrane is the main problem d√ºppenbecker et al 2017 used glass beads in a ceramic membrane incorporated fbmr the fluidized glass beads significantly reduced membrane fouling due to scouring effect provided in the study an external cross flow membrane fig 6 process also helped to adjust the operational conditions in order to investigate the impact of pore size and material on the process performance a zro2 ultrafiltration uf membrane molecular weight cut off mwco 100 kda a tio2 microfiltration mf membrane 0 4 Œºm and a al2o3 ultrafiltration membrane 0 05 Œºm were comparatively studied for the treatment of real domestic wastewater at 20 c for 46 days in the novel fbmr fouling rates were reduced more than 95 even at low cross flow velocities of 0 073 and 0 074 m s 1 no increase in trans membrane pressure tmp during 46 days operation was observed for both uf membranes in the case of mf membrane the tmp increased to around 50 kpa during the operation due to internal fouling which could not be addressed by physical scouring of glass beads the overall cod removal performance of the process was 80 83 and did not changed with the membrane type severe damage was observed on the membranes over time but the microfiltration membrane showed the highest resistance the required total energy was 0 31 kw h m3 1 for the filtration d√ºppenbecker et al 2017 see fig 7 in another study gao et al 2014a investigated integrated anaerobic fbmr for domestic wastewater treatment at 35 c the cod removal performance was significantly affected by the hrt as the performance was approximately 76 74 and 54 at hrts of 8 6 and 4 h respectively average flux in the hollow fibre microfiltration membrane containing fbmr was 0 27 m3 m2 d 1 corresponding to approximately 11 25 lmh increasing gac concentration in the bioreactor significantly decreased fouling hence the developed process has potential to be used for domestic wastewater treatment the treatment of domestic wastewater using anaerobic processes is challenging especially at low temperatures several studies illustrated that low temperature caused decreased performance of anaerobic processes smith et al 2013 mbr processes may offer improved process performance due to giving more chance to degrade soluble microbial products smps generated in the process keeping them in the bioreactor for longer time ho et al 2007 however decreased permeability of the membrane due to increased foulants at low temperatures is a significant problem gao et al 2014b in this regards gao et al 2014b investigated the treatment of domestic wastewater using an integrated fbmr process at moderate to low temperature conditions the cod removal performance and methanogenic activity of the process decreased with decreasing temperature the cod removal performances were 74 67 and 51 at temperature of 35 25 and 15 c respectively the corresponding methanogenic activities were 0 17 0 15 and 0 1 l l d 1 respectively the hrt and flux were kept constant at 6 h and 7 1 lmh respectively as the temperature decreased volatile fatty acids vfas especially acetic acid accumulated in the bioreactor membrane fouling increased as the temperature decreased probably due to increased smps and proteins became the dominant component of the membrane foulants fbrs may also be combined with mbr processes to allow simultaneous removal of carbon nitrogen and phosphorous from wastewater alemu et al 2014 reported that in an intermittently aerated fbmr process efficient nh4 n and cod removals 98 could be achieved 4 4 fluidized bed bioelectrochemical systems fb bess in addition to membrane bioreactors fluidized beds fbs have also been combined with various bioelectrochemical systems bes to improve their performance bes are electrochemical devices that contain anodes and cathodes connected via an electrical circuit and sometimes separated by an ion exchange membrane microbial fuel cells mfcs facilitate the anodic oxidation of reduced compounds such as organics with the concomitant generation of electricity while microbial electrolysis cells mecs require energy input in a form of applied voltage to generate hydrogen at the cathode fluidized beds have been incorporated to both anodic and cathodic compartments of bess as compared to traditional packed bed bess the benefits of fb bess include less clogging issues as compared to packed bed bess lower electrical resistance as the distance between particles and current collector is small and hence ability to use large bes volumes improved power density as the fluidized operation enables more efficient electrical discharge enhanced current and power production chemical oxygen demand removal and coulombic efficiencies liu et al 2014a huang et al 2011 developed a two chamber anaerobic fluidized bed afb mfc that utilised fluidized porous polymer carrier in the anodic compartment for electricity generation during alcohol distillery wastewater treatment the anode and cathode were made of carbon fiber paper and the anodic and cathodic compartments were separated with a proton exchange membrane the afb mfc achieved 124 mw m2 1 power density and removed 80 90 chemical oxygen demand kong et al 2011 developed a single cell afb mfc that utilised an air cathode and granular activated carbon gac or graphite granules as fluidized carriers maximum power density was higher with granular graphite 530 mw m2 1 than with gac 410 mw m2 1 liu et al 2014b demonstrated that biofilm covered gac particles had capacitor like behaviour by comparing maximum power densities achieved with fluidized by stirring gac 951 10 mw m2 1 packed bed gac 813 2 mw m2 1 and without gac 525 mw m2 1 based on the observation they proposed flowable electrode reactors where anode biofilms can be electrically charged in a separate storage tank and then rapidly discharged in compact anode chambers liu et al 2014b the fluidization of anodic carrier particles has also been utilised in the fb mec or microbial fluidized electrolysis cell mfeec developed by liu et al 2014a for hydrogen production the single chamber tubular system had fluidized gac and graphite anode current collector in the bottom part of the mec and a cylindrical stainless steel cathode at the top part of the system recirculation flow was used for the carrier fluidization the fluidized carrier allowed higher current densities and hydrogen recoveries than control systems that did not have recirculation or gac liu et al 2014a cusick et al 2014 developed a fb mec that relies on cathodic carrier fluidization for electrochemical struvite precipitation from digestate the fluidized carrier promoted bulk phase struvite precipitation and minimised scaling of the cathode as a result of scouring effect of the particles moreover the energy consumption from pumping and power supply 0 2 w h 1 1 7 5 w h g p 1 at an applied voltage of 1 0 v was significantly lower than for struvite precipitation methods which reply on ph adjustment such as aeration and naoh addition cusick et al 2014 the anodic chamber removed 1 1 2 1 g cod l d 1 and 7 12 mm ammonium from acetate 1 g l 1 supplemented digestate in addition to modifications of fbrs mentioned above some specific modifications can be used to improve the performance and the applicability of the process moreira et al 1996 modified the hydraulics of fbr by gas pulsation to control pellet morphology of filamentous fungi aspergillus niger and phanerochaete chrysosporium the non pulsing reactor could be operated only for 14 days due to excessive growth of mycelia however operation at an optimum pulsation frequency caused narrower pellet size distribution which improved the fluidization performance and enhanced the citric acid production by aspergillus niger and manganese peroxidase production by phanerochaete chrysosporium 5 overcoming toxic effects via solution recycling many organic and inorganic environmental contaminants are toxic to microorganisms in concentrations present in the water to be treated fbr recycle flow with effluent contaminant concentrations efficiently dilutes the feed concentrations avoiding inhibitory effects on microorganisms table 4 in the case of polychlorophenol bioremediation influent concentrations and especially that of pcp are potentially toxic for degrader microorganisms m√§nnist√∂ et al 1999 the k i for pcp of a fluidized bed enrichment culture was 5 1 mg l 1 melin et al 1997 demonstrating that recycle flow of the fbr maintains the reactor concentrations well below toxic levels mining and metallurgical process waters and acid mine drainage often contain high concentrations of metals their treatment using sulfate reducing bacteria srb requires a process configuration that precipitates the metals and neutralizes acidity prior to becoming in contact with srb fluidized bed biofilms have shown to avoid metal and acid toxicity via dilution of the feed by recycle flow kaksonen et al 2003 6 fbr disadvantages and operational issues as described in previous chapters a key advantage of fbr is having high specific surface area for biofilm growth which ensure a high active biomass concentration from 12 g vss l 1 up to 40 g vss l 1 for carboneous compound and nitrification water environment federation 2010 grady et al 1999 however aerobic processes can result in oxygen limitation due to high biomass concentration high attached biomass concentration also presents significant advantages for anaerobic wastewater treatment including possibility to use high loads and low hrts high performance and low toxicity to biomass recent studies aslam et al 2017 bae et al 2014 have also illustrated that anaerobic fbrs may be combined with membrane processes and provide many advantages including high treatment performance high biogas production and low membrane fouling due to scouring of the cake layer developed on the membrane by the fluidized media hence fbr technology can also be improved further to provide alternative solution to environmental problems other important advantages of the processes are the possibility of eliminating the settling tank due to maintaining biomass on the media and the smaller area requirement compared to conventional biological stirred tank reactors due to vertical set up of the fbrs the main disadvantage of fbrs is the pumping cost to maintain upward velocity for bed expansion and fluidization the power of the recycle pump has to overcome the sum of frictional resistance and density differences between fluid and expanded bed biofilm coated media with high biomass concentration increases this difference and therefore pumping cost is one of the most critical disadvantages of fbrs u s epa in 1993 reported four main disadvantages of fbr limitations on reactor size to maintain the ratio of height to diameter energy requirements to maintain high recycle ratios difficulties in biomass control and media selection imprecision in process control because of difficulty in monitoring biomass concentration in addition liquid distributors for reactor influent are often costly for full scale systems long start up period is required for biofilm formation and clogging in the flow distributor can prevent uniform fluidization rabah and dahab 2004 moreover fbr drawbacks include the cost of reactor packing the need to control the packing level as well as deterioration of many carrier materials due to friction forces 7 conclusion this review article discussed recent developments and applications of fluidized bed technology for multiple environmental engineering solutions together with a historical perspective of development benefits of fbrs include efficient mixing allowing high mass transfer rates and avoidance of bed clogging a high surface area for biofilm formation allowing high biomass retainment and high biomass concentrations avoiding high influent concentrations potentially toxic feed constituents and substrate shock loadings high resistance to system upsets a smaller pressure drop than in fixed bed biofilm systems small reactor foot print selective for microbes with low k m values and biomass enrichment via immobilisation of low yield microorganisms easy to integrate with other unit processes possibility of eliminating a settling tank the most notable disadvantages of fbrs include reactor size limitations due to the height to diameter ratio and high energy requirements due to high recycle ratios considering the beneficial fbr characteristics fbrs are expected to become increasingly applied in water wastewater treatment as well as in many physical and chemical process applications such as incineration phosphate recovery advanced oxidation processes fbr technology can also be further developed and combined with other processes such as membrane processes to provide alternative solution to several environmental problems in addition to treatment the fbr process may also be used to recover many valuable materials from wastewaters such as heavy metals using sulfate reducing processes in addition to bacteria and archaea fbr may also be used for fungal bioconversion of recalcitrant organic compounds from wastewaters hence although fbrs have been used for long time for wastewater treatment there are several new approaches which need further studies 
19092,fluidized bed bioreactors fbr are characterized by two phase mixture of fluid and solid in which the bed of solid particles is fluidized by means of downward or upward recirculation stream fbrs are widely used for multiple environmental engineering solutions such as wastewater treatment as well as some industrial applications fbr offers many benefits such as compact bioreactor size due to short hydraulic retention time long biomass retention on the carrier high conversion rates due to fully mixed conditions and consequently high mass transfer rates no channelling of flow dilution of influent concentrations due to recycle flow suitability for enrichment of microbes with low k m values the disadvantages of fbrs include bioreactor size limitations due to the height to diameter ratio high energy requirements due to high recycle ratios and long start up period for biofilm formation this paper critically reviews some of the key studies on biomass enrichment via immobilisation of low growth yield microorganisms high rates via fully mixed conditions technical developments in fbrs and ways of overcoming toxic effects via solution recycling this technology has many potential new uses as well as hydrodynamic characteristics which enable high rate environmental engineering and industrial applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilm fluidized bed bioreactor high rate water treatment wastewater treatment 1 introduction fluidized bed bioreactors fbrs are characterized by solid biomass carrier that is suspended using high liquid or gas flow rates that allow the carrier to be fluidized and behave as though it was a fluid fluidized bed bioreactors were originally developed for wastewater treatment whilst this technology has also many other potential uses biological treatment of organic and inorganic environmental contaminants is often challenged by low contaminant concentrations their toxicity and or low energy yields from contaminant degradation to the microorganisms catalysing the reactions fbrs can overcome many of these challenges and hence have been widely studied for many applications fig 1 this technology has been widely applied in environmental engineering field for many purposes including domestic wastewater treatment biodegradation of recalcitrant organic compounds reduction oxidation of organic or inorganic contaminants bio precipitation of various inorganic compounds via oxidation reduction reactions and bio energy generation as can be seen from the upper right corner of fig 1 since 1970s nearly 2000 scientific contributions have been published on fbrs with an increasing momentum since 1990 s although the fbrs can be used for various purposes in multiple fields this paper focuses on the history technological advances as well as advantages and disadvantages of this technology in environmental engineering field see fig 2 since 1980 s fbrs have been increasingly used as an effective technology to treat water and wastewater firstly manhattan college new york the u s epa municipal environmental research laboratory merl cincinnati ohio and the water research centre medmenham england collaborated to develop fbr technology for wastewater treatment in a 1980 conference in manchester wrc umist conference on biological fluidized bed treatment of water and wastewater manchester england fbr technology was hailed as the most significant advance in the field of wastewater treatment in the last fifty years although there was no full scale plant at that time the first full scale fbr in the us was installed at the reno sparks wastewater treatment plant in the early 1980s and remains the largest full scale fbr treating domestic wastewater as of 2009 water environment federation 2010 in the 1980s general motors manufacturing facilities installed 12 aerobic fbrs using developed process configuration by dorroliver inc sutton and mishra 1994 almost at the same time anaerobic fbrs were constructed in 1982 at a soy protein factory in muscatine iowa u s heijnen et al 1989 in 1999 an industrial wastewater with a phenolic load of 1120 kg day 1 was treated using fbr having two towers of 9 m diameter and 8 5 m height supplied by dorr oliver b v amsterdam the netherlands sutton et al 1999 in the same time frame the most important commercial developments in this field was the start up of several anaerobic two stage fbr plants by biothane b v delft the netherlands for industrial wastewater heijnen et al 1989 the first two plants were constructed in delft in the netherlands and prouvy in france and anaflux process was developed by degremont s a holst et al 1997 all the constructed fbr systems are highly efficient due to the high biomass concentration reaching 30 90 kg m 3 together with efficient gas liquid mass transfer created by high up flow liquid velocities reaching 10 m h 1 holst et al 1997 according to wef manual practice and asce manuals and reports in 2010 water environment federation 2010 more than 80 full scale fbrs have been installed with two thirds of them were treating industrial wastewater in 1999 the rest were treating municipal wastewater treatment of a variety of wastewaters has been investigated at both laboratory and pilot scale fbrs which may allow expansion or upgrading of plants to meet more stringent future standards fbr system have been applied for various environmental fields applications for specific purposes of fbr have two main reasons the first of which is to minimize physical limitations by providing high degree mixing of water solid phase and the second is to support the microbial growth and enrichment therefore fbr allows high substrate loading rates to enrich slow growing biomass especially for the treatment of wastewater containing toxic chemicals treatment this technology offers many advantages because recirculation of the water dilutes the concentration of the influent to a non toxic level for bacteria and provides completely mixed or semi completely mixed conditions the outstanding advantages of fbr systems include high concentration of biomass very large surface area for biomass attachment dilution of the influent with effluent to reduce shock effects of toxicant spikes as well as higher loading rates efficient mass transfer for all treatment systems previous fbr publications often focus on specific aspects such as process modelling shen et al 2012 and or use in specific applications such as low temperature bioremediation of polychlorophenols puhakka and melin 1998 biological iron oxidation nurmi et al 2009 anaerobic sulfate treatment kaksonen et al 2006 and acid mine drainage treatment using sulfate reduction based processes kaksonen and puhakka 2007 papirio et al 2013 as well as bio hydrogen production koskinen et al 2007 some papers review the use of fbr technology in particular fields such as wastewater treatment bello et al 2017 nelson et al 2017 burghate and ingole 2013 however a review analysing mechanisms behind the good performance of fbr applications for various non conventional environmental engineering solutions is missing the following sections discuss on fbrs as means of selective enrichment of low growth yield microoganisms overcoming toxic effects on microorganisms as well as high rate performances for a number of environmental engineering applications 2 biomass enrichment via immobilisation of low yield microorganisms aerobic and anaerobic polychlorophenol polycp degradation iron oxidation anaerobic ammonium oxidation and reductive dechlorination of chloroethenes are examples of the biological processes which release little energy for biomass growth in addition bioprocessing at suboptimally low substrate concentrations or temperatures decreases reaction rates and consequently further decreases microbial growth yields and emphasizes the need for efficient retainment of enriched microorganisms in the system immobilisation of microorganisms with extremely low growth yields is important for engineering applications typical low growth yield microrganisms are chemolithotrophs catalysing the oxidations of various inorganic compounds that have found important applications in environmental engineering gibbs free energy values of several oxidation or reduction processes are shown in table 1 in the applications such as bioremediation of chlorinated organic compounds the influent substrate concentrations are typically at levels or well below the effluent concentrations of conventional wastewater treatment further chlorinated organic compounds are already highly oxidized and thus provide little energy from oxidative mineralization for these reasons wash out of cells cannot be afforded and therefore these bioprocesses require very long biomass retention times melin et al 1997 polychlorinated phenols are highly oxidized compounds and thus their oxidation provides little energy for microorganisms m√§kinen et al 1993 measured a net growth yield of 0 03 mg of volatile suspended solids vss per mg of chlorophenols cps removed or 0 09 mg of vss mg total organic carbon toc removed 1 anaerobic microorganisms have also low growth yields and or low maximum degradation rates which means long cell retention times are required to enrich the competent biomass cell yields for reductive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene have been reported to be in the range of 0 10 0 15 g per g chloride released holliger et al 1998 maymo gatell et al 1997 therefore fbrs with long sludge retention times srts allow enrichment of reductively dechlorinating microorganisms able to carry on the slowest reactions such as dechlorination of vinyl chloride to ethene ballapragada et al 1997 or 2 4 dcp ortho dechlorination magar et al 1999 during sequential dechlorination of tetrachloroethene and pentachlorophenol respectively chemolithoautotrophic anaerobic ammonium oxidizing microorganisms anammox have extremely slow growth rates of 2 17 days for a review see terada et al 2011 chen et al 2013 reported a net growth yield of 0 03 g vss g nh4 n 1 for anammox bacteria the very long srt requiring anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria were first discovered from a denitrifying fluidized bed bioreactor mulder et al 1995 fbrs along with other long srt reactor configurations have been developed for the anammox strous et al 1997 iron is a key element in bioleaching of valuable metals from sulfide ores during bioleaching iron has a key role in biooxidation process affecting microbial growth leaching efficiency and precipitate formation the valuable metals from low grade sulfide minerals in bioleaching process are solubilized with biogenic ferric iron and sulfuric acid the final effluents from bioleaching processes have high concentrations of dissolved iron and sulfate the iron in final effluent is mainly present as ferrous iron and has to be oxidized by acidophilic microorganisms followed by precipitation for an effective removal ferrous iron is a weak reductant and a parsimonious energy source for acidophilic microorganisms such as acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ferguson and ingledew 2008 the product ferric iron on the other hand is a powerful oxidizing agent for a variety of sulfidic minerals thus acidophilic iron oxidizing microorganisms are commonly used for biotechnological applications in mineral processing johnson et al 2012 the kinetic aspects of iron oxidation were reviewed by nemati et al 1998 including cell yields from earlier works to range between 8 and 20 mg cells g iron 1 more recently blight and ralph 2008 reported a growth yield of 3 1 mg dry cell biomass g iron 1 for iron oxidizing bacteria in batch cultivation as iron oxidation releases little energy these microorganisms must oxidise a lot of iron in order to sustain growth this is from technological point of view very beneficial however high rates of iron oxidation often result in oxygen limitation and require specific reactor designs to overcome this limitation fbrs with high biomass hold up carrier material such as activated carbon have proven efficient in retaining iron oxidizing biomass kinnunen and puhakka 2004 van der meer et al 2007 activated carbon carrier retained 3 7 109 cells g 1 and the formation of jarosite precipitates formed on the top of activated carbon carrier layer and coating the activated carbon carriers further enhanced the attachment of bacteria in the system fbr jarosite precipitates contained 3 1 1010 cells g 1 indicating that jarosite formation improves iron oxidizing biomass build up in the fbr system kinnunen and puhakka 2004 activated carbon bound leptospirillum ferriphilum dominated iron oxidizing cultures maintained their activity at environmental extremes including ph below 1 ferrous and ferric iron concentrations of 24 g l 1 and cu2 concentration of 2 g l 1 kinnunen and puhakka 2005 the iron oxidizing fbrs were successfully applied for ferric iron lixiviant regeneration kinnunen and puhakka 2004 and the removal of excess iron and sulfate from barren heap bioleaching liquors √∂zkaya et al 2007 nurmi et al 2009 and 2010a other low growth yield cultures selectively enriched in fbrs include marine ammonia to nitrite oxidizers melin et al 1996 4 chlorophenol mineralizing denitrifiers melin et al 1993 lake water natural organic matter degraders kolehmainen et al 2010 and autotrophic denitrifiers combining the use of reduced sulfur compounds as electron donors with nitrate and or nitrite reduction kim et al 2004 tang and nemati 2010 sahinkaya et al 2015 zou et al 2016 di capua et al 2017a 3 high rates via fully mixed conditions high recirculation in fbrs may cause hydraulic regime to approach completely mixed conditions khanongnuch et al 2018 conducted a residence time distribution rtd test using 10 ml of a 1 m kcl solution as a tracer at two different flow rates of 360 and 108 ml h 1 they used morrill dispersion index mdi to evaluate the flow characteristics in the fbr for plug flow and completely mixed conditions the mid values are 2 and 22 respectively in the fbr the mid values were 9 and 11 for two different flow rates indicating hydraulic regime as semi complete mixing 3 1 high rate transformation of chlorinated organics the first paper on high rate bioremediation of chlorinated organics in fbrs at ambient groundwater temperature of 4 10 c was published by j√§rvinen et al 1994 during the treatment of trichlorophenol tcp tetrachlorophenol tecp and pentachlorophenol pcp contaminated groundwater over 99 9 mineralization of cps was achieved with the effluent concentrations of 0 003 mg l 1 or less at a cp loading rate of up to 740 mg l 1d 1 or hrt s of 1 4 5 h even at 4 c batch kinetic studies of specific maximum degradation rates and half saturation constants showed that the fbr process selectively enriched microorganisms able to degrade the contaminants to very low concentrations due to a high affinity for the poly cp substrates melin et al 1997 and 1998a this process was taken in use for large scale groundwater remediation at ambient temperature of 8 c degrading 2 4 6 tcp 2 3 4 6 tecp and pcp by over 99 over 99 and over 96 respectively langwaldt and puhakka 2002 and continued operation for 10 years between 1994 and 2004 tiirola et al 2002 langwaldt et al 2008 molecular analysis of the 16s rrna gene of the bacterial community of the long term operated over 6 years fbr system revealed a stable bacterial community with a low species diversity the dominant organisms in the fbr was novosphingobium sp strain mt1 which was characterized by low growth rate optimized number of rrna operons and ability to aggregate tiirola et al 2002 the ks for 2 3 46 tecp of novospingobium sp strain mt1 was 2 1 mg l 1 and the strain degraded cps faster at 8 c than at room temperature m√§nnist√∂ et al 2001 reductive transformations of chlorinated organic compounds are often incomplete and may result in undesired end products of bioremediation chlorinated solvents such as chloroethenes are typical groundwater contaminants reductive transformation of tetrachloroethene occurs via trichloroethene cis dichloroethene and vinyl chloride to ethene vinyl chloride is toxic very slow to degrade and thus often accumulates ballapragada et al 1997 revealed in fbrs that by maintaining low steady state concentrations of hydrogen dechlorinating microorganisms outcompeted methanogens as indicated by determined ks half saturation kinetic constant values of 20 and 1000 micro mol mg protein d 1 for dechlorinators and methanogens respectively thus the process resulted in efficient dechlorination of chloroethenes at low h2 partial pressures this was accomplished in fbrs provided with both liquid and gas phase recycle flows reductive dechlorination of aromatic chlorinated compounds such as pentachlorophenol is also often incomplete for a review see mohn and tiedje 1992 the fate and kinetic behaviour of pcp and its degradation products in fbrs were investigated by magar et al 1999 fully mixed conditions in fbrs result in a reactor substrate and metabolite concentration being the same as in the effluent hence fbr biofilm microorganisms are typically exposed to low substrate concentrations which serves as a selective factor for the enrichment of microbes with low substrate affinities this helps to achieve very good quality effluents 3 2 high rate biological iron oxidation a number of studies have aimed at reaching high rates of biological iron oxidation with acidophilic microorganisms using various reactor configurations such as packed bed bioreactor fluidized bed bioreactor airlift bioreactor continuously stirred tank bioreactor cstr and membrane bioreactor mbr iron oxidation performance for various bioreactor types as well as hydraulic retention time and dominated microbial species in bioreactor are shown in table 2 among the bioreactor configurations used fbrs had the highest volumetric iron oxidation rates table 2 to our knowledge the first research on high rate biological iron oxidation in fbr was conducted by kinnunen and puhakka 2004 they aimed to develop a high rate fbr for ferric sulfate production and reported iron oxidation rate of 8 2 kg fe ii m3 h 1 after 7 months of continuous enrichment and air aeration at 37 c at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 0 6 h in their observation oxygen supply became the rate limiting factor and accordingly they studied the effect of aeration gas composition with the gas mixture of 99 5 o2 0 5 co2 vol vol they detected the highest iron oxidation rate of 26 4 kg fe ii l h 1 at hrt of 0 2 h in fbr √∂zkaya et al 2007 and nurmi et al 2009 recorded biological iron oxidation rates of 10 7 kg fe ii l h 1 and 8 2 kg fe ii l h 1 at hydraulic retention times of 2 h and 1 h respectively with long term bioreactor operations 3 3 high rate biohydrogen production biological hydrogen production is a potential approach for the production of sustainable energy carriers for a review see hallenbeck and ghosh 2009 a comparison of biohydrogen production rates in fbrs and other bioreactor configurations with similar substrates and bioreactor conditions is shown in table 3 biohydrogen production was compared between bioreactors such as fbr fixed bed completely stirred tank bioreactor cstr and up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb table 3 the highest hydrogen production rate of 65 5 l h2 l d 1 or 2 59 mol h2 l d 1 was obtained with galactose in a fbr at a hrt of 2 h at 35 c sivagurunathan et al 2017 similarly zhang et al 2007 reported hydrogen production rate of 56 6 l l h2 l d 1 in a fbr with glucose lin et al 2009 reported the highest hydrogen production rate of 43 2 l h2 l d 1 in a fbr with sucrose 3 4 high rate sulfate reduction biological sulfate reduction is important for the treatment of acid mine drainage which contains high sulfate and metal concentrations and has acidic ph the performance of several bioreactor configurations have been tested for sulfate reducing bacteria for treating mining wastewaters and for the recovery of metals the fbr is an efficient way to control and remediate acidic mine drainage because of high biomass retention resistance to inhibitors high organic sulfate and metal loadings at low hrt for reviews see papirio et al 2013 and kaksonen and puhakka 2007 considering these potential advantages for the first time kaksonen et al 2003a and b hypothesized that the fbr process would be an effective treatment system for acidic mine drainage kaksonen et al 2003b optimized metal sulfide precipitation determined performance and ethanol oxidation kinetics and the effects of hrt and sulfide toxicity in fbr treatment of acidic sulfate metal containing wastewater kaksonen et al 2004a later the biodiversity of the fbrs were investigated in detail kaksonen et al 2004b c kaksonen et al 2006 first concluded that fbrs are well suited for the combined removal of metals acidity and sulfate from wastewater since the recycle flow in the fbrs dilutes high influent concentrations kaksonen and puhakka 2007 also proposed that downflow fbrs allow the recovery of metal sulfides at the bottom of the bioreactor kaksonen and puhakka 2007 which was later demonstrated by sahinkaya and gungor 2010 sahinkaya et al 2007a b reported that the rate of acetate oxidation limited the sulfidogenic treatment of metal containing wastewater at 8 and 65 c auvinen et al 2009 recorded that long term operation of a low temperature 9 c fbr resulted in enrichment of formate utilizing psychrotolerant mesophilic sulfate reducing bacteria kaksonen et al 2007 2008 also isolated novel thermophilic sulfate reducers from sulfidogenic fbrs 3 5 anaerobic ammonium oxidation in a denitrifying bioprocess the first publication on anammox process was presented in a biotechnology congress by graaf et al 1990 then a fbr based anammox process has been patented by mulder 1992 1993 with the us patent numbers of 5078884 and 5259959 in 1995 mulder et al reported that nh4 was disappearing from a denitrifying fluidized bed bioreactor treating effluent from a methanogenic bioreactor a maximum ammonium removal rate of 0 4 kg n m3 d 1 was observed in their study this worthy discovery by mulder et al 1995 has led to the novel bioprocess of anaerobic ammonium oxidation given the name anammox anaerobic ammonium oxidation and the enrichment of anammox micro organisms was reported by graaf et al 1996 with the conversion rate by the enrichment culture in a fbr of 3 kg nh4 m3 d 1 jetten et al 2001 reported that the anammox biomass efficiently removed ammonium in a fbr over nitrite with the nitrogen load increasing from 0 2 kg ntot m3 d 1 to 2 6 ntot m3 d 1 over one year the growth rate and yield of anammox bacteria are quite low and the use of fbr with efficient cell retainment can improve the performance stability as mentioned above morales et al 2015 reported that anammox bacteria need a minimum solid retention time srt of 85 d at 15 c similarly sun et al 2018 operated an anammox membrane bioreactor at 25 c and reported that when srt was over 500 d the vss content increased gradually from 125 mg l 1 to 5590 mg l 1 and the maximum nitrogen removal rate was 1 18 kg n m3 d 1 the decrease of srt to 50 d caused a gradual decline in sludge concentration and the maximum nitrogen removal rate decreased to 0 67 g total n g vss d 1 3 6 high rate autotrophic denitrification nutrient removal from wastewater is becoming more important due to stringent discharge standards hence novel processes are being developed for this purpose in recent years sulfur based sahinkaya and dursun 2012 and thiosulfate based autotorophic denitrification processes di capua et al 2017a zou et al 2016 have been investigated using various bioreactor alternatives under different operational conditions potential electron donors for autotrophic denitrification i e reduction of no3 and or no2 reduction to n2 using co2 and hco3 as carbon source include h2 and sulfur compounds s2o3 2 s2 s¬∫ s4o6 2 so3 2 sulfur based autotrophic denitrification offers two main advantages over heterotrophic denitrification namely no need for carbon source and decreased waste sludge generation thiosulfate driven denitrification is a highly energy efficient di capua et al 2016 although packed bed bioreactor technology is commonly used for sulfur based denitrification studies it is reported that operational problems di capua et al 2015 and high loading rates of no3 limits denitrification efficiency due to low sulfur dissolution rate in this type of bioreactors kim et al 2004 although fbrs can overcome problems encountered in packed bed bioreactor system there are a few fbr reports so far on sulfur based denitrification kim et al 2004 zou et al 2016 di capua et al 2017a the driving forces to use high rate thiosulfate driven denitrification in fbrs are high active biomass concentration a high specific surface area uniform mixing a smaller pressure drop than in fixed bed biofilm systems tolerance to no3 shock loadings and influent concentrations diluted due to recycle flow zou et al 2016 operated two thiosulfate based denitrification driven fbrs with thiobacillus denitrificans dominated biofilms at two different temperatures of 20 and 30 c they achieved high rate reduction of 1230 mg no3 l 1 at ph of 5 8 di capua et al 2017a studied thiosulfate denitrification in a fbr under feed ph ranges from 7 0 to 5 25 they reported denitrification efficiency greater than 99 even at bioreactor ph of 5 30 the effect of continuous co2 feeding on denitrification rate in a fbr at ph values lower than 5 0 was investigated complete denitrification was achieved even at ph of 4 75 in fbr with a carbonation unit which was a record among published papers in another study zou et al 2016 investigated autotrophic denitrification and denitritation with thiosulfate for nitrate and nitrite removal at temperatures of 20 c and 30 c in fbr they reported complete nitrate removal with a nitrate loading rate of 600 mg l h 1 at a hrt of 10 min and effluent ph of 5 8 these findings demonstrated that fbrs hold potential for thiosulfate driven denitrification of acidic wastewaters studies illustrated that besides acidic ph fbr biofilms have high resistance to extremely low temperatures di capua et al 2017a and high heavy metal concentrations di capua et al 2017b thiosulfate based denitrifying fbr tolerated up to 174 mg l 1 ni due to high concentrations of ni complexing smp di capua et al 2017b 3 7 high rate fungal fbrs although bacteria and archaea are commonly used in fbrs the use of fungi has also received attention in recent years fungal bioreactors may have advantages due to their rich degrading enzymes ability to withstand harsh conditions loading fluctuations low ph and nutrient tolerance see espinosa ortiz et al 2016 for review fungal fbrs have also been used for treatment of industrial wastewater blanquez et al 2007 investigated the impact of hrt on the decolorization efficiency of grey lanaset g textile dye in a trametes versicolor attached fbr decolorization efficiency was quite high 80 at various hrts ranging from 18 to 120 h with corresponding removal rates of 6 73 to 1 16 mg l 1 h 1 studies have also illustrated that biotransformation of pharmaceutically active compounds using white rot fungi and their oxidoreductase enzymes is promising due to low cost and environmentally friendly solution see naghdi et al 2018 for review cruz morato et al 2014 studied the hospital wastewater treatment by fungal bioreactor and the removal efficiencies of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptor compounds were evaluated the study was conducted using a batch fbr under sterile and non sterile conditions with trametes versicolor pellets under non sterile conditions 46 out of the 51 pharmaceutical active compounds were partially or completely removed under sterile environment total pharmaceutical active compounds elimination performance was 83 2 hence the fungal fbr has performed well for the biodegradation of recalcitrant pharmaceutical active compounds although the treatment of industrial wastewater or recalcitrant compound using fungal bioreactor may have some advantages transition to non sterile conditions may be challenging due to competition with the indigenous microorganisms mir tutusaus et al 2016 in this context mir tutusaus et al 2016 studied the coagulation flocculation and uv radiation processes as pretreatments for the hospital wastewater treatment using a fungal bioreactor the results illustrated that a coagulation flocculation pretreatment coupled to a fungal treatment in an air pulsed fbr improved the operation duration due to maintaining fungal activity for 28 days without biomass reinoculation in this context a recent study mir tutusaus et al 2018 reviewed the white rot fungal technologies for micropollutant biodegradation and the advantages limitations and a range of solutions to overcome the limitations have been reviewed 4 technical developments in fluidized bed bioreactors commonly used aerobic and anaerobic fbr configurations are shown in fig 3 a and fig 3b respectively fbr technology has been successfully adapted for specific purposes in many scientific fields this section summarises new developments in fbr technology see fig 4 4 1 fbr with the separation of solid products hydrometallurgical effluent streams from sulfide mineral processing typically contain high concentrations of iron and sulfate therefore iron and sulfate removal from these streams is essential in the management of bioleaching process kinnunen and puhakka 2004 2005 achieved high rate and highly effective biological iron oxidation with a fbr this process was developed for ferric lixiviant production the first study for fbr facilitated ferric precipitation was carried out at tampere university of technology nurmi et al 2010b ozkaya et al 2007 on integrated biological iron oxidation and precipitation processes excess iron and sulfate removal is essential to overcome undesired iron precipitation causing in other parts of the process circuit negative effects such as blockage of pumps valves pipes and the creation of kinetic barriers for bioleaching due to jarosite formation even at low ph nurmi et al 2010a ozkaya et al 2007 the integrated system was comprised of a fbr and a gravity settler as illustrated in fig 3 similarly an integrated fbr and gravity settler system was used for the removal of arsenic from a synthetic arsenic containing acidic solution ahoranta et al 2016 the effect of ph on arsenic removal efficiency and precipitate stability was investigated at ph ranges from 3 0 to 1 6 the results showed that the integrated system has potential for the removal of arsenic iron and sulfate from bioleaching effluents and low ph acid mine drainage 4 2 downward fluidization inverse fluidized bed bioreactors ifbr and inverse turbulent bed bioreactors itbr fluidized bed bioreactors have traditionally relied on carrier material which is heavier than water and that is fluidized upward nikolov and karamanev 1990 explored the characteristics of an ideal biofilm bioreactor and based on the evaluation proposed an inverse fluidized bed bioreactor ifbr for biofilm research in ifbr carrier particles are lighter than water and water moves downward resulting in downward expansion of the bed the ifbr developed by nikolov and karamanev 1990 had an internal draft tube causing the liquid to circulate in the bioreactor due to airlift principle however not all ifbrs have such a draft tube in ifbr the bed expansion can be achieved by recirculating liquid from the bottom to the top of the bioreactor another variation of inverse fluidization is so called inverse turbulent bed bioreactor itbr which utilises the recycling of biogas from the top of the bioreactor to the bottom to achieve bed expansion buffi√®re et al 2000 arnaiz et al 2003 carrier materials used for inverse fluidization include styrofoam spheres nikolov and karamanev 1990 polystyrene beads choi et al 1995 sabarunisha begum and radha 2013 low density polyethylene particles castilla et al 2000 and extendosphere small silica particles with an air bubble inside arnaiz et al 2003 alvarado lassman et al 2008 cheng et al 2017 inverse fluidization has been utilised for both aerobic and anaerobic bioprocesses examples of applications include the anaerobic treatment of brewery wastewaters alvarado lassman et al 2008 and wine distillery wastewaters arnaiz et al 2005 biological selenate reduction cheng et al 2017 acidic sulfate and metal containing wastewaters sahinkaya and gungor 2010 aerobic starch wastewater treatment rajasimman and karthikeyan 2009 and aerobic phenol biodegradation kryst and karamanev 2001 sabarunisha begum and radha 2013 one of the advantages of downflow fluidization over traditional upflow fluidized bed bioreactors is that in bioreactors with inverse fluidization the bottom of the bioreactor can be used for settling for example sahinkaya and gungor 2010 suggested that the metal sulfide precipitates formed in down flow fluidized bed bioreactors could be separated from biomass by settling at the bottom of the bioreactor however when comparing upflow and downflow fluidized bed bioreactors for biological sulfate reduction and metal precipitation sahinkaya and gungor 2010 observed that the utilisation of electron donor for sulfate reduction was more efficient in the upflow fluidized bed bioreactor whereas methanogenes were more dominant in the downflow fluidized bed bioreactor which may be due to lover attachment ability of the srb to the media compared to the methanogenic archaea 4 3 fluidized bed membrane bioreactors fbmbr fluidized beds have been integrated with the ultra micro filtration membranes to create fluidized bed membrane bioreactors fbmrs to improve the biomass retainment and performance of processes which rely on slow growing microorganisms yoo et al 2012 studied domestic wastewater treatment using a laboratory scale staged anaerobic fbmr the process consisted of two separate fbrs the first one was a conventional anaerobic fbr and the second one was an fbmr the reactors were fed with the domestic wastewater from primary settling granular activated carbon gac fluidization prevented membrane fouling during 192 days of operation at 25 c and the effluent chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod concentrations averaged 25 mg l 1 and 7 mg l 1 respectively at a hrt of 2 3 h the energy potential of the produced methane was greater than the energy requirement in another study bae et al 2014 compared the single and staged anaerobic fbmr and concluded that single stage anaerobic fbr was a viable alternative to staged fbmr which may reduce the construction and maintenance cost after successful results in lab scale bioreactors the same group shin et al 2014 evaluated the performance of staged anaerobic fbmr in pilot scale with domestic wastewater from primary settling at varying temperatures of 8 30 c the effluent cod and bod concentrations averaged 23 mg l 1 and 7 mg l 1 respectively the operational energy need of 0 23 kw h m3 1 could be met with the methane generation in the process although the process gave satisfactory results two years operation of the fbmr with gac media severally damaged the membrane and hence membrane integrity could be an operational problem in long term use shin et al 2016 in order to reduce membrane fouling and the damage caused by gac fluidization the same group evaluated the use of ceramic membrane in a single stage lab scale fbmr for the treatment of synthetic low strength domestic wastewater aslam et al 2017 the bioreactor was operated continuously for 395 days at 25 c and fluxes of 14 5 17 l m2 membrane area h 1 lmh the process produced high permeate quality 23 mg l 1 cod at the effluent with low energy requirement of 0 039 kw h m3 1 which was only 17 of the energy to be produced from methane generated see fig 5 the superiority of the anaerobic mbr for domestic wastewater treatment at low or moderate temperatures has been shown in the literature shin et al 2014 however the fouling of the membrane is the main problem d√ºppenbecker et al 2017 used glass beads in a ceramic membrane incorporated fbmr the fluidized glass beads significantly reduced membrane fouling due to scouring effect provided in the study an external cross flow membrane fig 6 process also helped to adjust the operational conditions in order to investigate the impact of pore size and material on the process performance a zro2 ultrafiltration uf membrane molecular weight cut off mwco 100 kda a tio2 microfiltration mf membrane 0 4 Œºm and a al2o3 ultrafiltration membrane 0 05 Œºm were comparatively studied for the treatment of real domestic wastewater at 20 c for 46 days in the novel fbmr fouling rates were reduced more than 95 even at low cross flow velocities of 0 073 and 0 074 m s 1 no increase in trans membrane pressure tmp during 46 days operation was observed for both uf membranes in the case of mf membrane the tmp increased to around 50 kpa during the operation due to internal fouling which could not be addressed by physical scouring of glass beads the overall cod removal performance of the process was 80 83 and did not changed with the membrane type severe damage was observed on the membranes over time but the microfiltration membrane showed the highest resistance the required total energy was 0 31 kw h m3 1 for the filtration d√ºppenbecker et al 2017 see fig 7 in another study gao et al 2014a investigated integrated anaerobic fbmr for domestic wastewater treatment at 35 c the cod removal performance was significantly affected by the hrt as the performance was approximately 76 74 and 54 at hrts of 8 6 and 4 h respectively average flux in the hollow fibre microfiltration membrane containing fbmr was 0 27 m3 m2 d 1 corresponding to approximately 11 25 lmh increasing gac concentration in the bioreactor significantly decreased fouling hence the developed process has potential to be used for domestic wastewater treatment the treatment of domestic wastewater using anaerobic processes is challenging especially at low temperatures several studies illustrated that low temperature caused decreased performance of anaerobic processes smith et al 2013 mbr processes may offer improved process performance due to giving more chance to degrade soluble microbial products smps generated in the process keeping them in the bioreactor for longer time ho et al 2007 however decreased permeability of the membrane due to increased foulants at low temperatures is a significant problem gao et al 2014b in this regards gao et al 2014b investigated the treatment of domestic wastewater using an integrated fbmr process at moderate to low temperature conditions the cod removal performance and methanogenic activity of the process decreased with decreasing temperature the cod removal performances were 74 67 and 51 at temperature of 35 25 and 15 c respectively the corresponding methanogenic activities were 0 17 0 15 and 0 1 l l d 1 respectively the hrt and flux were kept constant at 6 h and 7 1 lmh respectively as the temperature decreased volatile fatty acids vfas especially acetic acid accumulated in the bioreactor membrane fouling increased as the temperature decreased probably due to increased smps and proteins became the dominant component of the membrane foulants fbrs may also be combined with mbr processes to allow simultaneous removal of carbon nitrogen and phosphorous from wastewater alemu et al 2014 reported that in an intermittently aerated fbmr process efficient nh4 n and cod removals 98 could be achieved 4 4 fluidized bed bioelectrochemical systems fb bess in addition to membrane bioreactors fluidized beds fbs have also been combined with various bioelectrochemical systems bes to improve their performance bes are electrochemical devices that contain anodes and cathodes connected via an electrical circuit and sometimes separated by an ion exchange membrane microbial fuel cells mfcs facilitate the anodic oxidation of reduced compounds such as organics with the concomitant generation of electricity while microbial electrolysis cells mecs require energy input in a form of applied voltage to generate hydrogen at the cathode fluidized beds have been incorporated to both anodic and cathodic compartments of bess as compared to traditional packed bed bess the benefits of fb bess include less clogging issues as compared to packed bed bess lower electrical resistance as the distance between particles and current collector is small and hence ability to use large bes volumes improved power density as the fluidized operation enables more efficient electrical discharge enhanced current and power production chemical oxygen demand removal and coulombic efficiencies liu et al 2014a huang et al 2011 developed a two chamber anaerobic fluidized bed afb mfc that utilised fluidized porous polymer carrier in the anodic compartment for electricity generation during alcohol distillery wastewater treatment the anode and cathode were made of carbon fiber paper and the anodic and cathodic compartments were separated with a proton exchange membrane the afb mfc achieved 124 mw m2 1 power density and removed 80 90 chemical oxygen demand kong et al 2011 developed a single cell afb mfc that utilised an air cathode and granular activated carbon gac or graphite granules as fluidized carriers maximum power density was higher with granular graphite 530 mw m2 1 than with gac 410 mw m2 1 liu et al 2014b demonstrated that biofilm covered gac particles had capacitor like behaviour by comparing maximum power densities achieved with fluidized by stirring gac 951 10 mw m2 1 packed bed gac 813 2 mw m2 1 and without gac 525 mw m2 1 based on the observation they proposed flowable electrode reactors where anode biofilms can be electrically charged in a separate storage tank and then rapidly discharged in compact anode chambers liu et al 2014b the fluidization of anodic carrier particles has also been utilised in the fb mec or microbial fluidized electrolysis cell mfeec developed by liu et al 2014a for hydrogen production the single chamber tubular system had fluidized gac and graphite anode current collector in the bottom part of the mec and a cylindrical stainless steel cathode at the top part of the system recirculation flow was used for the carrier fluidization the fluidized carrier allowed higher current densities and hydrogen recoveries than control systems that did not have recirculation or gac liu et al 2014a cusick et al 2014 developed a fb mec that relies on cathodic carrier fluidization for electrochemical struvite precipitation from digestate the fluidized carrier promoted bulk phase struvite precipitation and minimised scaling of the cathode as a result of scouring effect of the particles moreover the energy consumption from pumping and power supply 0 2 w h 1 1 7 5 w h g p 1 at an applied voltage of 1 0 v was significantly lower than for struvite precipitation methods which reply on ph adjustment such as aeration and naoh addition cusick et al 2014 the anodic chamber removed 1 1 2 1 g cod l d 1 and 7 12 mm ammonium from acetate 1 g l 1 supplemented digestate in addition to modifications of fbrs mentioned above some specific modifications can be used to improve the performance and the applicability of the process moreira et al 1996 modified the hydraulics of fbr by gas pulsation to control pellet morphology of filamentous fungi aspergillus niger and phanerochaete chrysosporium the non pulsing reactor could be operated only for 14 days due to excessive growth of mycelia however operation at an optimum pulsation frequency caused narrower pellet size distribution which improved the fluidization performance and enhanced the citric acid production by aspergillus niger and manganese peroxidase production by phanerochaete chrysosporium 5 overcoming toxic effects via solution recycling many organic and inorganic environmental contaminants are toxic to microorganisms in concentrations present in the water to be treated fbr recycle flow with effluent contaminant concentrations efficiently dilutes the feed concentrations avoiding inhibitory effects on microorganisms table 4 in the case of polychlorophenol bioremediation influent concentrations and especially that of pcp are potentially toxic for degrader microorganisms m√§nnist√∂ et al 1999 the k i for pcp of a fluidized bed enrichment culture was 5 1 mg l 1 melin et al 1997 demonstrating that recycle flow of the fbr maintains the reactor concentrations well below toxic levels mining and metallurgical process waters and acid mine drainage often contain high concentrations of metals their treatment using sulfate reducing bacteria srb requires a process configuration that precipitates the metals and neutralizes acidity prior to becoming in contact with srb fluidized bed biofilms have shown to avoid metal and acid toxicity via dilution of the feed by recycle flow kaksonen et al 2003 6 fbr disadvantages and operational issues as described in previous chapters a key advantage of fbr is having high specific surface area for biofilm growth which ensure a high active biomass concentration from 12 g vss l 1 up to 40 g vss l 1 for carboneous compound and nitrification water environment federation 2010 grady et al 1999 however aerobic processes can result in oxygen limitation due to high biomass concentration high attached biomass concentration also presents significant advantages for anaerobic wastewater treatment including possibility to use high loads and low hrts high performance and low toxicity to biomass recent studies aslam et al 2017 bae et al 2014 have also illustrated that anaerobic fbrs may be combined with membrane processes and provide many advantages including high treatment performance high biogas production and low membrane fouling due to scouring of the cake layer developed on the membrane by the fluidized media hence fbr technology can also be improved further to provide alternative solution to environmental problems other important advantages of the processes are the possibility of eliminating the settling tank due to maintaining biomass on the media and the smaller area requirement compared to conventional biological stirred tank reactors due to vertical set up of the fbrs the main disadvantage of fbrs is the pumping cost to maintain upward velocity for bed expansion and fluidization the power of the recycle pump has to overcome the sum of frictional resistance and density differences between fluid and expanded bed biofilm coated media with high biomass concentration increases this difference and therefore pumping cost is one of the most critical disadvantages of fbrs u s epa in 1993 reported four main disadvantages of fbr limitations on reactor size to maintain the ratio of height to diameter energy requirements to maintain high recycle ratios difficulties in biomass control and media selection imprecision in process control because of difficulty in monitoring biomass concentration in addition liquid distributors for reactor influent are often costly for full scale systems long start up period is required for biofilm formation and clogging in the flow distributor can prevent uniform fluidization rabah and dahab 2004 moreover fbr drawbacks include the cost of reactor packing the need to control the packing level as well as deterioration of many carrier materials due to friction forces 7 conclusion this review article discussed recent developments and applications of fluidized bed technology for multiple environmental engineering solutions together with a historical perspective of development benefits of fbrs include efficient mixing allowing high mass transfer rates and avoidance of bed clogging a high surface area for biofilm formation allowing high biomass retainment and high biomass concentrations avoiding high influent concentrations potentially toxic feed constituents and substrate shock loadings high resistance to system upsets a smaller pressure drop than in fixed bed biofilm systems small reactor foot print selective for microbes with low k m values and biomass enrichment via immobilisation of low yield microorganisms easy to integrate with other unit processes possibility of eliminating a settling tank the most notable disadvantages of fbrs include reactor size limitations due to the height to diameter ratio and high energy requirements due to high recycle ratios considering the beneficial fbr characteristics fbrs are expected to become increasingly applied in water wastewater treatment as well as in many physical and chemical process applications such as incineration phosphate recovery advanced oxidation processes fbr technology can also be further developed and combined with other processes such as membrane processes to provide alternative solution to several environmental problems in addition to treatment the fbr process may also be used to recover many valuable materials from wastewaters such as heavy metals using sulfate reducing processes in addition to bacteria and archaea fbr may also be used for fungal bioconversion of recalcitrant organic compounds from wastewaters hence although fbrs have been used for long time for wastewater treatment there are several new approaches which need further studies 
19093,biofouling severely impacts operational performance of membrane systems increasing the cost of water production understanding the effect of critical parameters of feed water such as biodegradable substrate concentration on the developed biofilm characteristics enables development of more effective biofouling control strategies in this study the effect of substrate concentration on the biofilm characteristics was examined using membrane fouling simulators mfss a feed channel pressure drop pd increase of 200 mbar was used as a benchmark to study the developed biofilm the amount and characteristics of the formed biofilm were analysed in relation to membrane performance indicators feed channel pressure drop and permeate flux the effect of the characteristics of the biofilm developed at three substrate concentrations on the removal efficiency of the different biofilms was evaluated applying acid base cleaning results showed that a higher feed water substrate concentration caused a higher biomass amount a faster pd increase but a lower permeate flux decline the permeate flux decline was affected by the spatial location and the physical characteristics of the biofilm rather than the total amount of biofilm the slower growing biofilm developed at the lowest substrate concentration was harder to remove by naoh hcl cleanings than the biofilm developed at the higher substrate concentrations effective biofilm removal is essential to prevent a fast biofilm regrowth after cleaning while substrate limitation is a generally accepted biofouling control strategy delaying biofouling development of advanced cleaning methods to remove biofilms formed under substrate limited conditions is of paramount importance keywords reverse osmosis performance

flemming and schaule 1988 flemming 1997 s√°nchez 2018 the development of a biofilm defined as bacterial cells embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances is affected by several interrelated factors including water temperature salinity bacterial cell concentration organic carbon concentration and composition and operating conditions such as the cross flow velocity ridgeway 2003 biofilms grow utilizing biodegradable substrates present in the water biofilm formation is characterized by different phases starting by formation of a conditioning film layer on the pristine membrane and spacer surface followed by bacterial attachment and growth the different types of substrates in the feed water shape the conditioning film layer characteristics furthermore the ability of biofilm associated bacteria to sense prevailing substrate conditions accordingly modifying their structural organization species composition and eps production has been documented wolfaardt et al 1994 james et al 1995 nielsen et al 2000 bester et al 2011 in fact flemming 2016 has impeccably described the biofilm as the perfect slime in acknowledgment to the multifunctional versatility and adaptability of the biofilm matrix consequently biofilm growth is the result of the bacterial response to existing conditions mass transfer of substrate to the attached bacteria and subsequent conversion of the substrate therefore biomass yield and biomass density are important to understand the influence of the concentration and transport rate of the growth limiting substrate on biofilm development understanding the comparative kinetics of growth relating the substrate concentration to the specific growth rate of the different species present is essential at high substrate concentrations rapidly growing bacteria will outcompete efficiently growing bacteria while at low substrate concentrations efficient growth is favored over rapid growth pfeiffer et al 2001 roller and schmidt 2015 a phenomenon well known and understood as the difference between r and k strategists andrews and harris 1986 biomass bacterial cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps density and its physical structural characteristics are hard to understand the hydrodynamic conditions in the membrane system and the physiological characteristics of the group of organisms growing will govern the biomass density van loosdrecht et al 1995 liu et al 2004 kroukamp et al 2010 tijhuis et al 1996 observed that a lower substrate loading and a higher detachment force yielded smooth and strong biofilms in a biofilm airlift suspension reactor while a higher substrate loading lead to rough and weak biofilms the physical characteristics of the biofilm has been fully attributed to the eps matrix that the bacteria produce after attachment to any surface the eps has been postulated to contribute most to the hydraulic resistance of biofilms chong et al 2008 dreszer et al 2013 vrouwenvelder et al 2016 the variation in the nature of the eps molecules produced by the bacteria under different operating conditions as well as the eps concentration result in biofilms with varying hydraulic resistance affecting membrane performance differently a better understanding of the physical characteristics of developed biofilm can be made through examining the conditions that under which the biofilm developed the hydrodynamic conditions and the predominant substrate conditions peyton 1996 telgmann et al 2004 brink and nicol 2014 farhat et al 2016a allen et al 2018 limiting the substrate concentration of the feed water is considered a suitable approach to control biofouling in ro membranes hence it is worthwhile to explore the characteristics of a biofilm developed under three substrate concentrations in this study the effect of growing a biofilm under different carbon concentrations maintaining the same hydrodynamic conditions was investigated it is well established that a faster development of biofilm will occur at higher feed water substrate concentrations in this study we investigated the developed biofilm characteristics the biofilm impact on membrane performance indicators such as feed channel pressure drop and permeate flux and the cleanability using conventional naoh hcl cleanings of the membranes was investigated for three feed water biodegradable nutrient concentrations 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup biofilms were grown in membrane fouling simulators mfss containing a 20 cm 4 cm coupon of a membrane a feed spacer

granular activated carbon filters were used to remove residual chlorine from tap water 2 2 operating conditions feed water was pumped through the mfs at a flow rate of 17 l h 1 equivalent to a linear flow velocity of 0 17 m s 1 representative for practice vrouwenvelder et al 2009a bucs et al 2015 a substrate stock solution containing sodium acetate sodium nitrate and sodium phosphate in a mass ratio c n p of 100 20 10 was added to the feed water acetate and this mass ratio are commonly used creber et al 2010 araujo et al 2012 three substrate concentrations 1000 250 and 30 Œºg l 1 c were used to enhance biofilm formation in the mfs all chemicals were purchased in analytical grade from sigma aldrich the ph value of the substrate solution was set at 11 by adding sodium hydroxide in order to restrict bacterial growth in the 10 l substrate bottle the concentrated substrate solution was dosed into the feed water prior to the mfs at a flow rate of 0 03 l h 1 the dosing flow rate of the substrate solution 0 03 l h 1 to the monitor feed water was low compared to the feed water flow rate 17 0 l h 1 the reference feed flow therefore the high ph value of the substrate solution had no effect on the ph of the feed water of 7 8 all experiments were run in duplicates and the figures show the average and standard deviation from the two runs 2 3 chemical cleaning a recirculating loop was added by connecting a digital gear pump ew 74014 12 cole parmer usa upstream of the mfs for the dosage of the cleaning chemical a second connection was made downstream of the mfs to return the chemicals to the cleaning solution bottle between the pump and the mfs a membrane filter 10 Œºm pore size was placed to avoid the recirculation of biofilm particles which may be released from the biofilm in the mfs subsequently 1 l of naoh and hcl were recirculated for 1 h at 17 l h 1 with the gear pump the concentrations of 0 01 mol l 1 naoh ph 12 and 0 1 mol l 1 hcl ph 1 used were similar to the ones applied in practice beyer et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 naoh was heated to 35 c with a thermostatic water bath isotemp 210 fisher scientific usa and the tubing covered with insulating foam to maintain the temperature in the system the mfs was flushed with feed water for 5 min after both the naoh and the subsequent hcl cleaning to remove the cleaning solutions to avoid biofilm sloughing the water flow was gradually reduced to 0 l h 1 and increased again to 17 l h 1 naoh hcl cleaning was performed once a feed channel pressure drop increase of 200 mbar was reached 2 4 monitoring of fouling 2 4 1 normalized pressure drop and permeate flux six identical mfss were operated in parallel simultaneously the development of fouling was monitored by measuring the pressure drop increase over the feed spacer channel of the mfs and the decline in permeate flow all experiments were stopped once a normalized pressure drop increase of 200 mbar was reached the pressure drop for each mfs was normalized to the initial starting pressure drop of 20 3 mbar 2 4 2 biomass quantification sheets of membrane and spacer taken from the monitor were analysed at the end of the experiment for adenosine triphosphate atp and total organic carbon toc to characterize the accumulated fouling sections of membrane and feed spacers were taken from the mfss the sections 16 cm2 were placed in a capped tube in 40 ml sterile tap water for atp analysis or ultrapure water for toc analysis to determine the amount of biomass the tubes with the membrane sections were placed in an ultrasonic water bath branson 5510mth output 135 w 40 khz low energy sonic treatment 2 min followed by mixing on a vortex few seconds was repeated two times when the liquid was visually not homogeneous or when all biomass was not removed from the materials additional time interval treatments were applied with a sonifier probe q700 qsonica sonicator usa for 1 2 min sample kept on ice until the liquid was homogenous next water

and quantification of extracellular polymeric substances eps to analyse the eps the biofouled membranes were put into 10 ml phosphate buffered saline pbs and the biomass bacteria and eps was separated from the membranes using 2 min of vortexing and 5 min of low energy sonic treatment in an ultrasonic water bath branson 5510mth output 135 w 40 khz the eps was extracted following the formaldehyde naoh method established by liu and fang 2002 in their study liu and fang 2002 revealed that the formaldehyde naoh process extracted the highest amounts of eps and the authors quantified dna and extracellular dna and based on the results concluded that all evidences suggested that the formaldehyde naoh extraction process did not cause cell lysis and thus the extracted eps were not contaminated by the intracellular substances in brief the whole 10 ml eps suspended in pbs was treated using 0 06 ml formaldehyde 36 5 sigma aldrich mo usa at 4 c for 1 h and incubated with 4 ml 1 n naoh at 4 c for 3 h after treatment the samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 20000 g the supernatant was filtered through a 0 2 Œºm pore size membrane and dialyzed using a 3500 da dialysis membrane

fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba scientific japan under excitation of 240 450 nm and emission of 290 600 nm at a speed of 1500 nm min 1 a voltage of 700 v and a response time of 2 s feem peaks were identified according to baghoth et al 2011 the carbohydrates were measured following the sulfuric acid phenol method masuko et al 2005 in brief 200 Œºl of the sample was mixed with 600 Œºl sulfuric acid and 120 Œºl 5 phenol the samples were then incubated at 90 c for 5 min and left to cool down the absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a spectra a max 340pc microplate reader molecular

resolution images at 36 khz a scan rate volumetric images were created using the maximum intensity profile algorithm included in the instrument software thorlabs sd oct system software version 3 2 1 for a rectangular area of 2 mm 5 mm using 200 b scans and 500 a scans of 619 pixels corresponding to a physical depth of 1 1 mm 3 results 3 1 effect of substrate concentration on biofilm development 3 1 1 membrane performance indicators the feed channel pressure drop pd development was recorded for all mfs experiments at three substrate concentrations a normalized pd increase of 200 mbar was used as the criterion for stopping the experiments the exponential pd increase with time was indicative of biofilm formation the pd increase reached 200 mbar in approximately five days for 1000 Œºg l 1 c 10 days for 250 Œºg l 1 c and 32 days for 30 Œºg l 1 c fig 1 the developed biofilm impact on permeate flux decline is shown in fig 2 at 2 bar the initial permeate flux for the brackish water ro membrane using tap water was 20 l m 2 h 1 biofilm that developed at the lowest substrate concentration 30 Œºg l 1 c resulted in a 45 decrease in permeate flux compared to a 25 decrease for the biofilm that developed at the highest substrate concentration 1000 Œºg l 1 c the biofilm that developed at the highest substrate concentration reached the 200 mbar pd increase fastest but caused less permeate flux decline than the biofilm developed at the lowest substrate concentration 30 Œºg l 1 c 3 1 2 biomass indicators highest toc and atp concentrations were measured for the biofilm developed at the highest substrate concentration fig 3 a and b since the length of the experimental runs and the dosed concentrations were different the total amount of acetate carbon dosed until the end of experiment was also different the calculated amounts of dosed substrate are shown in fig s1 in supplementary material a yield value was defined as the amount of toc or atp produced per amount of acetate carbon dosed not taking into account the toc and atp leaving the system in the water or the detached biomass compared to the biofilm developed at 1000 Œºg l 1 c the biofilm developed at 250 Œºg l 1 c had a lower toc and atp concentration but the resulting yields were not significantly different t test p 0 05 the toc yield was the same while the atp yield was marginally lower 14 lower only however the biofilm developed at 30 Œºg l 1 c had a lower toc and a significantly lower t test p 0 05 atp yield per amount of acetate carbon dosed lower by 36 and 85 respectively suggesting carbon limitation where the energy is mainly used for bacterial cell maintenance or a shift in the growing population rather than biomass formation eps extraction and characterization was performed for all the biofilms all biofilms developed had a higher protein than carbohydrate concentration fig 4 both the protein and the carbohydrate concentration increased with increasing feed water substrate concentration a fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem plot was determined for the extracted eps from biofilms developed at the three substrate concentrations four main regions could be distinguished in the feem plot i humic like ex 280 nm em 380 nm ii protein like ex 250 280 nm em 380 nm iii fulvic acid like ex 220 250 nm em 380 nm and iv tyrosine like ex 220 250 nm em 330 380 nm the feem plot showed that the relative intensity of the protein peaks was the highest peak ii fig 5 a b and c in all eps samples biofilms developed at 250 Œºg l 1 c had similar peaks compared to biofilms that developed at 1000 Œºg l 1 c the main peaks were protein like substances peak ii and tyrosine like substances peak iv fig 5 a and b on the other hand the feem plot for the biofilm that developed at 30 Œºg l 1 c revealed a larger variety in the components present with the presence of the four main peaks the humic like substances peak from the biofilm developed using 30 Œºg l 1 c fig 5c was not present in the feem plot of the biofilms developed at higher substrate concentrations the difference in composition and amount of biofilm under the different substrate concentrations caused the same pd increase emphasizing the importance of the effect of biofilm characteristics and composition on membrane performance indicators 3 1 3 biofilm spatial distribution two dimensional optical coherence tomography oct images were taken on the last day of the experiments when a pd increase of 200 mbar was reached fig 6 the oct images revealed biofilm development in the feed channel on both the membrane and feed spacer for all substrate concentrations distinctively biofilm developed predominantly on the feed spacer at 1000 Œºg l 1 c substrate concentration while major biofilm development was observed on the membrane when substrate concentration was the lowest 30 Œºg l 1 c a thin biofilm layer 20 Œºm was detected on the membrane at 1000 Œºg l 1 c while average membrane biofilm thickness was about 5 times higher 105 Œºm for 30 Œºg l 1 c the distinct differences in spatial biofilm distribution at the different substrate concentrations clearly played a role in the observed decline in membrane performance parameters the feed water nutrient concentration determined the spatial biofilm distribution affecting the membrane performance indicators 3 2 biofilm cleanability chemical cleaning by subsequently dosing naoh and hcl was applied to evaluate the cleanability of the biofilms developed at the three nutrient concentrations the pd was recorded before and after cleaning to evaluate performance restoration a stronger pd reduction was observed after cleaning for the biofilms that developed faster at the two highest substrate concentrations compared to the slower growing biofilm at the lowest substrate concentration fig 7 chemical cleaning with naoh and hcl was able to achieve similar biofilm inactivation higher than 80 for all biofilms developed irrespective of the substrate concentration used fig 8 a and b however the toc removal was not the same for the different biofilms fig 9 chemical cleaning with naoh and hcl was able to achieve a better toc removal for the biofilm developed at the two highest substrate concentrations compared to the lowest substrate concentration fig 9b however for the highest substrate concentrations the quantity of toc remaining after cleaning was still higher than for the lowest substrate concentrations fig 9a but with less impact on the feed channel pressure drop chemical cleaning showed different removal efficiencies of proteins and carbohydrates fig 10 in general proteins were better removed than carbohydrates for the biofilm developed at 1000 Œºg l 1 c a significant reduction of the protein and carbohydrate content was observed with about 20 and 30 protein and carbohydrate remaining respectively on the contrary a higher percentage of proteins and carbohydrates remaining after cleaning was seen for the biofilms developed at the two lower substrate concentrations fig 10b the feem plot showed a large reduction for the intensity of most peaks fig 5d e and f the average protein peak reduction 80 for 1000 and 250 Œºg l 1 c and 45 for 30 Œºg l 1 c was higher than the average tyrosine like substance peak reduction 60 for 1000 and 250 Œºg l 1 c and 40 for 30 Œºg l 1 c humic like substances peak i only detected in the biofilm that developed at 30 Œºg l 1 c had an average reduction of 75 the chemical cleaning efficiency using naoh and hcl was prominently affected by the different biofilm characteristics the eps nature and concentration as a result of the different prevailing substrate concentrations 4 discussion 4 1 substrate concentration and biofilm characteristics in this study the effect of biodegradable substrate availability on bacterial growth was characterized by biofilm formation and composition pressure drop increase permeability decline and membrane cleanability was examined in a review bossier and verstraete 1996 reported that low substrate concentrations promoting slow growth rates trigger bacterial cell surface changes i altering bacterial cell morphology resulting in smaller cells and ii increasing the strength of bacterial attachment to surfaces petrova and sauer 2012 allen et al 2018 observed that at low substrate concentration grown biofilms were significantly more adhesive james et al 1995 observed that at high substrate concentrations bacterial cells had a bacillar cell morphology with a loose surface interaction while at low substrate concentrations the cells had a firmly attached coccoid morphology the explanation of these differences is that substrate concentration affects the eps composition flemming et al 2007 thus changing the adhesiveness of eps lin et al 2014 the fact that biofilms are impacted by varying growth conditions underlined the importance to study the changes in biofilm characteristics by varying the substrate concentration in relation to ro biofouling when addressing ro biofouling the impact of biofilms on membrane performance is characterized by the membrane performance indicators feed channel pd and permeate flux in this study the criterion for stopping the experiments was a pd increase of 200 mbar the characteristics of the developed biofilm were dependent on the substrate concentration the biofilm formation at substrate concentrations of 250 and 1000 Œºg l 1 c was not substrate limited within five days the highest substrate concentration resulted in the highest biomass amount fig 1 together with the lowest permeate flux decline fig 2 on the contrary the biofilm that developed at 30 Œºg l 1 c was substrate limited after a running time of 32 days this substrate concentration of 30 Œºg l 1 c resulted in the lowest amount of biomass with the highest permeate flux decline figs 2 and 3 a significant observation from these results was that the biomass amount was not related to permeate flux decline and the pd increase at 30 Œºg l 1 c a 200 mbar pd increase was caused by a much lower biomass amount than at 1000 Œºg l 1 c it is proposed that the eps nature concentration and properties play a predominant part in the hydraulic resistence of biofilms dreszer et al 2013 derlon et al 2016 vrouwenvelder et al 2016 desmond et al 2018 as reported by flemming et al 2007 and herrling et al 2017 the eps properties and the biofilm spatial distribution have a strong impact on permeate flux as the porosity of this gel layer controls the water permeation rate the biofilm developed at the lowest substrate concentration of 30 Œºg l 1 c had a larger variety in the eps components present where humic like substances occurrence was observed humic like substance have higher resistance to shear forces and contribute to a more stable and cohesive biofilm structure liu et al 2004 ras et al 2013 cao et al 2017 moreover comparing the amount of biomass produced and the eps content proteins and carbohydrates for the different biofilms shows that the eps concentration for the biofilm developed at the lowest substrate concentration of 30 Œºg l 1 c was the highest in agreement with van loosdrecht et al 1995 kroukamp et al 2010 who reported that a fluffy loose biofilm more prone to sloughing developed at the highest substrate concentrations while a denser stiffer biofilm was formed at the lowest substrate concentration slow growing biofilms developing under varying limitation conditions has repeatedly been characterized as denser biofilms with a lower bacterial cell to eps ratio van loosdrecht et al 1995 liu et al 2004 farhat et al 2016b another key observation at the substrate concentration of 30 Œºg l 1 c was the biofilm coverage on the membrane where an average of 105 Œºm thick biofilm was measured from the oct images taken on the last day of the experiment at a pd increase of 200 mbar fig 6 compared to a very thin biofilm layer 20 Œºm present on the membrane for the 1000 Œºg l 1 c however considering the intrinsic hydraulic transmembrane resistance of ro membranes biofilms play a minor role dreszer et al 2013 it is still not fully understood how eps and their associated physical structures influence hydraulic transport through the biofilm but dreszer et al 2013 showed that for nf and ro systems the decline of membrane performance is not predominantly caused by an increase of biofilm resistance therefore the influence of the feed spacer presence spacer biofouling vrouwenvelder et al 2009b and the increase in feed concentrate pressure drop is dominating the performance decline 4 2 biofilm characteristics and chemical cleaning chemical cleaning is unavoidable to restore membrane performance beyer et al 2017 though the main inactivation action of the different chemical cleaning agents typically applied for biofouling control is through bacterial cell and tissue lysis a primary requirement from cleaning chemicals is enhanced removal of biomass the chemical reactions that typically occur are hydrolisis peptization solubilization dispersion chelation sequestering and suspending tr√§g√•rdh 1989 alkaline cleaning is usually used for organic fouling removal in this study the same chemical cleaning protocol naoh and hcl was applied on three different biofilms developed under varying substrate conditions to investigate removal efficiency of the different biofilms and to highlight the role the formed eps matrix is playing in achieving this removal efficiency the highest biomass removal efficiency was observed for the biofilm developed at the highest substrate concentrations 1000 Œºg l 1 c at the lowest substrate concentration with a lower biomass amount naoh and hcl cleanings were less effective in removing the biomass and restoring membrane performance the more stable and cohesive biofilm structure with a higher eps concentration and a wider variety of eps components fig 5 explains the lowest biofilm removal efficiency at low feed water substrate concentrations 30 Œºg l 1 c the lower efficiency is due to the hindered diffusion of the cleaning chemical naoh and hcl into the biofilm due to the more cohesive and dense biofilm structure moreover although proteins and carbohydrates are closely interwoven the discrepancy in removal efficacy between proteins and carbohydrates is attributed to the lower penetration ability of cleaning chemical into the dense biofilm structure and the spatial localization of proteins and carbohydrates 4 3 limiting substrates to control biofouling all recently published studies addressing biofouling concluded that biofouling cannot be avoided shifting the focus to control strategies aiming for i delayed biofilm formation ii reduced or delayed impact of accumulated biofilm on performance and iii biofilm removal by advanced cleaning strategies bucs et al 2018 research focussing on extensive pre treatment to limit the amount of biodegradable substrates in the feed water showed success only in delaying biofilm formation flemming 2002 the primary reason is that a very low amount of biodegradable substrates remains in the feed water and with the large amount of water provided per membrane surface with time even minimal amounts of substrate microgram per litre level egli 2010 in the feed water lead to a significant organic substrate supply for biofilm growth occurring over weeks or even months of membrane operation bucs et al 2018 biofilm growth delay is still a feasible control strategy as it allows membrane operation for longer periods before an unacceptable decline in performance is reached however results from this study raise a main concern regarding the inefficient cleanability of biofouled membrane systems with conventional cleaning chemicals such as naoh hcl of biofilms developed under low substrate concentrations bacteria inactivation in the biofilm rather than removal of accumulated biofilm will increase the frequency and rate of biofilm regrowth thereby restricting the effect of substrate limitation to delay biofouling through extensive pre treatment effective cleaning can be achieved only when both the chemical and physical interactions between the cleaning chemical and the biofilm are favourable ang et al 2006 therefore research focussing on novel cleaning chemicals and strategies for better solubilization of the eps matrix followed by removal of the biofilm is recommended to achieve a breakthrough in biofouling control 5 conclusions three substrate concentrations 1000 250 and 30 Œºg l 1 c were used to grow a biofilm in membrane fouling simulators the feed channel pressure drop pd and permeate flux were monitored and a feed channel pressure drop pd increase of 200 mbar was used as a benchmark to study the developed biofilm the main objective was to investigate the effect of the differences in the developed biofilm characteristics on the pd increase permeate flux decline and membrane cleanability the main study findings can be summarized by a faster biofilm development occurred at a high biodegradable substrate concentration in feed water causing a faster increase in feed channel pressure drop biofilm that developed under high substrate conditions resulted in less permeate flux decline attributed to the spatial location and composition of the biofilm substrate concentration affected the developed biofilm structure and therefore its cleanability slowly growing biofilms developing under low substrate conditions were harder to remove during conventional cleanings the same pd can be caused by biofilms differing in composition and spatial distribution therefore impacting the permeate flux and the cleanability efficiency differently declaration of interest none

19093,biofouling severely impacts operational performance of membrane systems increasing the cost of water production understanding the effect of critical parameters of feed water such as biodegradable substrate concentration on the developed biofilm characteristics enables development of more effective biofouling control strategies in this study the effect of substrate concentration on the biofilm characteristics was examined using membrane fouling simulators mfss a feed channel pressure drop pd increase of 200 mbar was used as a benchmark to study the developed biofilm the amount and characteristics of the formed biofilm were analysed in relation to membrane performance indicators feed channel pressure drop and permeate flux the effect of the characteristics of the biofilm developed at three substrate concentrations on the removal efficiency of the different biofilms was evaluated applying acid base cleaning results showed that a higher feed water substrate concentration caused a higher biomass amount a faster pd increase but a lower permeate flux decline the permeate flux decline was affected by the spatial location and the physical characteristics of the biofilm rather than the total amount of biofilm the slower growing biofilm developed at the lowest substrate concentration was harder to remove by naoh hcl cleanings than the biofilm developed at the higher substrate concentrations effective biofilm removal is essential to prevent a fast biofilm regrowth after cleaning while substrate limitation is a generally accepted biofouling control strategy delaying biofouling development of advanced cleaning methods to remove biofilms formed under substrate limited conditions is of paramount importance keywords reverse osmosis performance

water production with an almost five times lower energy consumption than five decades ago elimelech and phillip 2011 fane 2018 fouling remains the main hurdle in the application of ro desalination imbrogno et al 2017 resulting in the deterioration of the produced permeate quality and quantity causing increased costs of the water production as i more energy is required to produce the same amount

of a biofilm resulting in an intolerable loss of system performance roe et al 1994 in practice a 15 increase in feed channel pressure drop or a 10 decrease in permeate flux is considered unacceptable

applying extensive pre treatment flemming et al 1997 biofilm formation a prerequisite for the occurrence of biofouling is influenced by the ro plant feed water characteristics and operating conditions flemming and schaule 1988 flemming 1997 s√°nchez 2018 the development of a biofilm defined as bacterial cells embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances is affected by several interrelated factors including water temperature salinity bacterial cell concentration organic carbon concentration and composition and operating conditions such as the cross flow velocity ridgeway 2003 biofilms grow utilizing biodegradable substrates present in the water biofilm formation is characterized by different phases starting by formation of a conditioning film layer on the pristine membrane and spacer surface followed by bacterial attachment and growth the different types of substrates in the feed water shape the conditioning film layer characteristics furthermore the ability of biofilm associated bacteria to sense prevailing substrate conditions accordingly modifying their structural organization species composition and eps production has been documented wolfaardt et al 1994 james et al 1995 nielsen et al 2000 bester et al 2011 in fact flemming 2016 has impeccably described the biofilm as the perfect slime in acknowledgment to the multifunctional versatility and adaptability of the biofilm matrix consequently biofilm growth is the result of the bacterial response to existing conditions mass transfer of substrate to the attached bacteria and subsequent conversion of the substrate therefore biomass yield and biomass density are important to understand the influence of the concentration and transport rate of the growth limiting substrate on biofilm development understanding the comparative kinetics of growth relating the substrate concentration to the specific growth rate of the different species present is essential at high substrate concentrations rapidly growing bacteria will outcompete efficiently growing bacteria while at low substrate concentrations efficient growth is favored over rapid growth pfeiffer et al 2001 roller and schmidt 2015 a phenomenon well known and understood as the difference between r and k strategists andrews and harris 1986 biomass bacterial cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps density and its physical structural characteristics are hard to understand the hydrodynamic conditions in the membrane system and the physiological characteristics of the group of organisms growing will govern the biomass density van loosdrecht et al 1995 liu et al 2004 kroukamp et al 2010 tijhuis et al 1996 observed that a lower substrate loading and a higher detachment force yielded smooth and strong biofilms in a biofilm airlift suspension reactor while a higher substrate loading lead to rough and weak biofilms the physical characteristics of the biofilm has been fully attributed to the eps matrix that the bacteria produce after attachment to any surface the eps has been postulated to contribute most to the hydraulic resistance of biofilms chong et al 2008 dreszer et al 2013 vrouwenvelder et al 2016 the variation in the nature of the eps molecules produced by the bacteria under different operating conditions as well as the eps concentration result in biofilms with varying hydraulic resistance affecting membrane performance differently a better understanding of the physical characteristics of developed biofilm can be made through examining the conditions that under which the biofilm developed the hydrodynamic conditions and the predominant substrate conditions peyton 1996 telgmann et al 2004 brink and nicol 2014 farhat et al 2016a allen et al 2018 limiting the substrate concentration of the feed water is considered a suitable approach to control biofouling in ro membranes hence it is worthwhile to explore the characteristics of a biofilm developed under three substrate concentrations in this study the effect of growing a biofilm under different carbon concentrations maintaining the same hydrodynamic conditions was investigated it is well established that a faster development of biofilm will occur at higher feed water substrate concentrations in this study we investigated the developed biofilm characteristics the biofilm impact on membrane performance indicators such as feed channel pressure drop and permeate flux and the cleanability using conventional naoh hcl cleanings of the membranes was investigated for three feed water biodegradable nutrient concentrations 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup biofilms were grown in membrane fouling simulators mfss containing a 20 cm 4 cm coupon of a membrane a feed spacer

wound membrane modules as applied in practice for water treatment vrouwenvelder et al 2007 bucs et al 2016 the feed and permeate spacer and ro membrane sheets were taken from virgin spiral wound membrane elements tw30 4040 dow filmtec usa the feed spacer consisted of a sheet of 34 mil 864 Œºm thick diamond shaped polypropylene spacer the feed spacer was placed in the mfs with the same orientation as in spiral wound membrane elements 45 contact angle with the feed flow the system was fed continuously with nutrient enriched tap water and the setup consisted of a feed flow mass flow

granular activated carbon filters were used to remove residual chlorine from tap water 2 2 operating conditions feed water was pumped through the mfs at a flow rate of 17 l h 1 equivalent to a linear flow velocity of 0 17 m s 1 representative for practice vrouwenvelder et al 2009a bucs et al 2015 a substrate stock solution containing sodium acetate sodium nitrate and sodium phosphate in a mass ratio c n p of 100 20 10 was added to the feed water acetate and this mass ratio are commonly used creber et al 2010 araujo et al 2012 three substrate concentrations 1000 250 and 30 Œºg l 1 c were used to enhance biofilm formation in the mfs all chemicals were purchased in analytical grade from sigma aldrich the ph value of the substrate solution was set at 11 by adding sodium hydroxide in order to restrict bacterial growth in the 10 l substrate bottle the concentrated substrate solution was dosed into the feed water prior to the mfs at a flow rate of 0 03 l h 1 the dosing flow rate of the substrate solution 0 03 l h 1 to the monitor feed water was low compared to the feed water flow rate 17 0 l h 1 the reference feed flow therefore the high ph value of the substrate solution had no effect on the ph of the feed water of 7 8 all experiments were run in duplicates and the figures show the average and standard deviation from the two runs 2 3 chemical cleaning a recirculating loop was added by connecting a digital gear pump ew 74014 12 cole parmer usa upstream of the mfs for the dosage of the cleaning chemical a second connection was made downstream of the mfs to return the chemicals to the cleaning solution bottle between the pump and the mfs a membrane filter 10 Œºm pore size was placed to avoid the recirculation of biofilm particles which may be released from the biofilm in the mfs subsequently 1 l of naoh and hcl were recirculated for 1 h at 17 l h 1 with the gear pump the concentrations of 0 01 mol l 1 naoh ph 12 and 0 1 mol l 1 hcl ph 1 used were similar to the ones applied in practice beyer et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 naoh was heated to 35 c with a thermostatic water bath isotemp 210 fisher scientific usa and the tubing covered with insulating foam to maintain the temperature in the system the mfs was flushed with feed water for 5 min after both the naoh and the subsequent hcl cleaning to remove the cleaning solutions to avoid biofilm sloughing the water flow was gradually reduced to 0 l h 1 and increased again to 17 l h 1 naoh hcl cleaning was performed once a feed channel pressure drop increase of 200 mbar was reached 2 4 monitoring of fouling 2 4 1 normalized pressure drop and permeate flux six identical mfss were operated in parallel simultaneously the development of fouling was monitored by measuring the pressure drop increase over the feed spacer channel of the mfs and the decline in permeate flow all experiments were stopped once a normalized pressure drop increase of 200 mbar was reached the pressure drop for each mfs was normalized to the initial starting pressure drop of 20 3 mbar 2 4 2 biomass quantification sheets of membrane and spacer taken from the monitor were analysed at the end of the experiment for adenosine triphosphate atp and total organic carbon toc to characterize the accumulated fouling sections of membrane and feed spacers were taken from the mfss the sections 16 cm2 were placed in a capped tube in 40 ml sterile tap water for atp analysis or ultrapure water for toc analysis to determine the amount of biomass the tubes with the membrane sections were placed in an ultrasonic water bath branson 5510mth output 135 w 40 khz low energy sonic treatment 2 min followed by mixing on a vortex few seconds was repeated two times when the liquid was visually not homogeneous or when all biomass was not removed from the materials additional time interval treatments were applied with a sonifier probe q700 qsonica sonicator usa for 1 2 min sample kept on ice until the liquid was homogenous next water collected from the tubes was used to determine the biomass parameters atp and toc atp was measured using a luminometer celsis advance charles river laboratories inc usa and toc was measured as non purgeable organic carbon with a total organic carbon analyser toc vcph shimadzu japan equipped with a high sensitive catalyst high sense tc catalyst shimadzu japan the toc concentration of the sample for each run was the average of the three measurements samples were run in duplicates to prepare a calibration curve a stock solution of potassium hydrogen phthalate toc standard solution icc 033 5 ultra scientific usa was diluted with nanopure water to obtain solutions with carbon concentrations between 0 and 10 mg c l 1 the detection limit of the method was about 0 1 mg c l 1 2 4 3 extraction and quantification of extracellular polymeric substances eps to analyse the eps the biofouled membranes were put into 10 ml phosphate buffered saline pbs and the biomass bacteria and eps was separated from the membranes using 2 min of vortexing and 5 min of low energy sonic treatment in an ultrasonic water bath branson 5510mth output 135 w 40 khz the eps was extracted following the formaldehyde naoh method established by liu and fang 2002 in their study liu and fang 2002 revealed that the formaldehyde naoh process extracted the highest amounts of eps and the authors quantified dna and extracellular dna and based on the results concluded that all evidences suggested that the formaldehyde naoh extraction process did not cause cell lysis and thus the extracted eps were not contaminated by the intracellular substances in brief the whole 10 ml eps suspended in pbs was treated using 0 06 ml formaldehyde 36 5 sigma aldrich mo usa at 4 c for 1 h and incubated with 4 ml 1 n naoh at 4 c for 3 h after treatment the samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 20000 g the supernatant was filtered through a 0 2 Œºm pore size membrane and dialyzed using a 3500 da dialysis membrane thermo fisher scientific usa for 24 h the dialyzed samples were lyophilized for 48 h and re suspended in 10 ml of mq water the fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem was measured using a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba scientific japan under excitation of 240 450 nm and emission of 290 600 nm at a speed of 1500 nm min 1 a voltage of 700 v and a response time of 2 s feem peaks were identified according to baghoth et al 2011 the carbohydrates were measured following the sulfuric acid phenol method masuko et al 2005 in brief 200 Œºl of the sample was mixed with 600 Œºl sulfuric acid and 120 Œºl 5 phenol the samples were then incubated at 90 c for 5 min and left to cool down the absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a spectra a max 340pc microplate reader molecular

resolution images at 36 khz a scan rate volumetric images were created using the maximum intensity profile algorithm included in the instrument software thorlabs sd oct system software version 3 2 1 for a rectangular area of 2 mm 5 mm using 200 b scans and 500 a scans of 619 pixels corresponding to a physical depth of 1 1 mm 3 results 3 1 effect of substrate concentration on biofilm development 3 1 1 membrane performance indicators the feed channel pressure drop pd development was recorded for all mfs experiments at three substrate concentrations a normalized pd increase of 200 mbar was used as the criterion for stopping the experiments the exponential pd increase with time was indicative of biofilm formation the pd increase reached 200 mbar in approximately five days for 1000 Œºg l 1 c 10 days for 250 Œºg l 1 c and 32 days for 30 Œºg l 1 c fig 1 the developed biofilm impact on permeate flux decline is shown in fig 2 at 2 bar the initial permeate flux for the brackish water ro membrane using tap water was 20 l m 2 h 1 biofilm that developed at the lowest substrate concentration 30 Œºg l 1 c resulted in a 45 decrease in permeate flux compared to a 25 decrease for the biofilm that developed at the highest substrate concentration 1000 Œºg l 1 c the biofilm that developed at the highest substrate concentration reached the 200 mbar pd increase fastest but caused less permeate flux decline than the biofilm developed at the lowest substrate concentration 30 Œºg l 1 c 3 1 2 biomass indicators highest toc and atp concentrations were measured for the biofilm developed at the highest substrate concentration fig 3 a and b since the length of the experimental runs and the dosed concentrations were different the total amount of acetate carbon dosed until the end of experiment was also different the calculated amounts of dosed substrate are shown in fig s1 in supplementary material a yield value was defined as the amount of toc or atp produced per amount of acetate carbon dosed not taking into account the toc and atp leaving the system in the water or the detached biomass compared to the biofilm developed at 1000 Œºg l 1 c the biofilm developed at 250 Œºg l 1 c had a lower toc and atp concentration but the resulting yields were not significantly different t test p 0 05 the toc yield was the same while the atp yield was marginally lower 14 lower only however the biofilm developed at 30 Œºg l 1 c had a lower toc and a significantly lower t test p 0 05 atp yield per amount of acetate carbon dosed lower by 36 and 85 respectively suggesting carbon limitation where the energy is mainly used for bacterial cell maintenance or a shift in the growing population rather than biomass formation eps extraction and characterization was performed for all the biofilms all biofilms developed had a higher protein than carbohydrate concentration fig 4 both the protein and the carbohydrate concentration increased with increasing feed water substrate concentration a fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem plot was determined for the extracted eps from biofilms developed at the three substrate concentrations four main regions could be distinguished in the feem plot i humic like ex 280 nm em 380 nm ii protein like ex 250 280 nm em 380 nm iii fulvic acid like ex 220 250 nm em 380 nm and iv tyrosine like ex 220 250 nm em 330 380 nm the feem plot showed that the relative intensity of the protein peaks was the highest peak ii fig 5 a b and c in all eps samples biofilms developed at 250 Œºg l 1 c had similar peaks compared to biofilms that developed at 1000 Œºg l 1 c the main peaks were protein like substances peak ii and tyrosine like substances peak iv fig 5 a and b on the other hand the feem plot for the biofilm that developed at 30 Œºg l 1 c revealed a larger variety in the components present with the presence of the four main peaks the humic like substances peak from the biofilm developed using 30 Œºg l 1 c fig 5c was not present in the feem plot of the biofilms developed at higher substrate concentrations the difference in composition and amount of biofilm under the different substrate concentrations caused the same pd increase emphasizing the importance of the effect of biofilm characteristics and composition on membrane performance indicators 3 1 3 biofilm spatial distribution two dimensional optical coherence tomography oct images were taken on the last day of the experiments when a pd increase of 200 mbar was reached fig 6 the oct images revealed biofilm development in the feed channel on both the membrane and feed spacer for all substrate concentrations distinctively biofilm developed predominantly on the feed spacer at 1000 Œºg l 1 c substrate concentration while major biofilm development was observed on the membrane when substrate concentration was the lowest 30 Œºg l 1 c a thin biofilm layer 20 Œºm was detected on the membrane at 1000 Œºg l 1 c while average membrane biofilm thickness was about 5 times higher 105 Œºm for 30 Œºg l 1 c the distinct differences in spatial biofilm distribution at the different substrate concentrations clearly played a role in the observed decline in membrane performance parameters the feed water nutrient concentration determined the spatial biofilm distribution affecting the membrane performance indicators 3 2 biofilm cleanability chemical cleaning by subsequently dosing naoh and hcl was applied to evaluate the cleanability of the biofilms developed at the three nutrient concentrations the pd was recorded before and after cleaning to evaluate performance restoration a stronger pd reduction was observed after cleaning for the biofilms that developed faster at the two highest substrate concentrations compared to the slower growing biofilm at the lowest substrate concentration fig 7 chemical cleaning with naoh and hcl was able to achieve similar biofilm inactivation higher than 80 for all biofilms developed irrespective of the substrate concentration used fig 8 a and b however the toc removal was not the same for the different biofilms fig 9 chemical cleaning with naoh and hcl was able to achieve a better toc removal for the biofilm developed at the two highest substrate concentrations compared to the lowest substrate concentration fig 9b however for the highest substrate concentrations the quantity of toc remaining after cleaning was still higher than for the lowest substrate concentrations fig 9a but with less impact on the feed channel pressure drop chemical cleaning showed different removal efficiencies of proteins and carbohydrates fig 10 in general proteins were better removed than carbohydrates for the biofilm developed at 1000 Œºg l 1 c a significant reduction of the protein and carbohydrate content was observed with about 20 and 30 protein and carbohydrate remaining respectively on the contrary a higher percentage of proteins and carbohydrates remaining after cleaning was seen for the biofilms developed at the two lower substrate concentrations fig 10b the feem plot showed a large reduction for the intensity of most peaks fig 5d e and f the average protein peak reduction 80 for 1000 and 250 Œºg l 1 c and 45 for 30 Œºg l 1 c was higher than the average tyrosine like substance peak reduction 60 for 1000 and 250 Œºg l 1 c and 40 for 30 Œºg l 1 c humic like substances peak i only detected in the biofilm that developed at 30 Œºg l 1 c had an average reduction of 75 the chemical cleaning efficiency using naoh and hcl was prominently affected by the different biofilm characteristics the eps nature and concentration as a result of the different prevailing substrate concentrations 4 discussion 4 1 substrate concentration and biofilm characteristics in this study the effect of biodegradable substrate availability on bacterial growth was characterized by biofilm formation and composition pressure drop increase permeability decline and membrane cleanability was examined in a review bossier and verstraete 1996 reported that low substrate concentrations promoting slow growth rates trigger bacterial cell surface changes i altering bacterial cell morphology resulting in smaller cells and ii increasing the strength of bacterial attachment to surfaces petrova and sauer 2012 allen et al 2018 observed that at low substrate concentration grown biofilms were significantly more adhesive james et al 1995 observed that at high substrate concentrations bacterial cells had a bacillar cell morphology with a loose surface interaction while at low substrate concentrations the cells had a firmly attached coccoid morphology the explanation of these differences is that substrate concentration affects the eps composition flemming et al 2007 thus changing the adhesiveness of eps lin et al 2014 the fact that biofilms are impacted by varying growth conditions underlined the importance to study the changes in biofilm characteristics by varying the substrate concentration in relation to ro biofouling when addressing ro biofouling the impact of biofilms on membrane performance is characterized by the membrane performance indicators feed channel pd and permeate flux in this study the criterion for stopping the experiments was a pd increase of 200 mbar the characteristics of the developed biofilm were dependent on the substrate concentration the biofilm formation at substrate concentrations of 250 and 1000 Œºg l 1 c was not substrate limited within five days the highest substrate concentration resulted in the highest biomass amount fig 1 together with the lowest permeate flux decline fig 2 on the contrary the biofilm that developed at 30 Œºg l 1 c was substrate limited after a running time of 32 days this substrate concentration of 30 Œºg l 1 c resulted in the lowest amount of biomass with the highest permeate flux decline figs 2 and 3 a significant observation from these results was that the biomass amount was not related to permeate flux decline and the pd increase at 30 Œºg l 1 c a 200 mbar pd increase was caused by a much lower biomass amount than at 1000 Œºg l 1 c it is proposed that the eps nature concentration and properties play a predominant part in the hydraulic resistence of biofilms dreszer et al 2013 derlon et al 2016 vrouwenvelder et al 2016 desmond et al 2018 as reported by flemming et al 2007 and herrling et al 2017 the eps properties and the biofilm spatial distribution have a strong impact on permeate flux as the porosity of this gel layer controls the water permeation rate the biofilm developed at the lowest substrate concentration of 30 Œºg l 1 c had a larger variety in the eps components present where humic like substances occurrence was observed humic like substance have higher resistance to shear forces and contribute to a more stable and cohesive biofilm structure liu et al 2004 ras et al 2013 cao et al 2017 moreover comparing the amount of biomass produced and the eps content proteins and carbohydrates for the different biofilms shows that the eps concentration for the biofilm developed at the lowest substrate concentration of 30 Œºg l 1 c was the highest in agreement with van loosdrecht et al 1995 kroukamp et al 2010 who reported that a fluffy loose biofilm more prone to sloughing developed at the highest substrate concentrations while a denser stiffer biofilm was formed at the lowest substrate concentration slow growing biofilms developing under varying limitation conditions has repeatedly been characterized as denser biofilms with a lower bacterial cell to eps ratio van loosdrecht et al 1995 liu et al 2004 farhat et al 2016b another key observation at the substrate concentration of 30 Œºg l 1 c was the biofilm coverage on the membrane where an average of 105 Œºm thick biofilm was measured from the oct images taken on the last day of the experiment at a pd increase of 200 mbar fig 6 compared to a very thin biofilm layer 20 Œºm present on the membrane for the 1000 Œºg l 1 c however considering the intrinsic hydraulic transmembrane resistance of ro membranes biofilms play a minor role dreszer et al 2013 it is still not fully understood how eps and their associated physical structures influence hydraulic transport through the biofilm but dreszer et al 2013 showed that for nf and ro systems the decline of membrane performance is not predominantly caused by an increase of biofilm resistance therefore the influence of the feed spacer presence spacer biofouling vrouwenvelder et al 2009b and the increase in feed concentrate pressure drop is dominating the performance decline 4 2 biofilm characteristics and chemical cleaning chemical cleaning is unavoidable to restore membrane performance beyer et al 2017 though the main inactivation action of the different chemical cleaning agents typically applied for biofouling control is through bacterial cell and tissue lysis a primary requirement from cleaning chemicals is enhanced removal of biomass the chemical reactions that typically occur are hydrolisis peptization solubilization dispersion chelation sequestering and suspending tr√§g√•rdh 1989 alkaline cleaning is usually used for organic fouling removal in this study the same chemical cleaning protocol naoh and hcl was applied on three different biofilms developed under varying substrate conditions to investigate removal efficiency of the different biofilms and to highlight the role the formed eps matrix is playing in achieving this removal efficiency the highest biomass removal efficiency was observed for the biofilm developed at the highest substrate concentrations 1000 Œºg l 1 c at the lowest substrate concentration with a lower biomass amount naoh and hcl cleanings were less effective in removing the biomass and restoring membrane performance the more stable and cohesive biofilm structure with a higher eps concentration and a wider variety of eps components fig 5 explains the lowest biofilm removal efficiency at low feed water substrate concentrations 30 Œºg l 1 c the lower efficiency is due to the hindered diffusion of the cleaning chemical naoh and hcl into the biofilm due to the more cohesive and dense biofilm structure moreover although proteins and carbohydrates are closely interwoven the discrepancy in removal efficacy between proteins and carbohydrates is attributed to the lower penetration ability of cleaning chemical into the dense biofilm structure and the spatial localization of proteins and carbohydrates 4 3 limiting substrates to control biofouling all recently published studies addressing biofouling concluded that biofouling cannot be avoided shifting the focus to control strategies aiming for i delayed biofilm formation ii reduced or delayed impact of accumulated biofilm on performance and iii biofilm removal by advanced cleaning strategies bucs et al 2018 research focussing on extensive pre treatment to limit the amount of biodegradable substrates in the feed water showed success only in delaying biofilm formation flemming 2002 the primary reason is that a very low amount of biodegradable substrates remains in the feed water and with the large amount of water provided per membrane surface with time even minimal amounts of substrate microgram per litre level egli 2010 in the feed water lead to a significant organic substrate supply for biofilm growth occurring over weeks or even months of membrane operation bucs et al 2018 biofilm growth delay is still a feasible control strategy as it allows membrane operation for longer periods before an unacceptable decline in performance is reached however results from this study raise a main concern regarding the inefficient cleanability of biofouled membrane systems with conventional cleaning chemicals such as naoh hcl of biofilms developed under low substrate concentrations bacteria inactivation in the biofilm rather than removal of accumulated biofilm will increase the frequency and rate of biofilm regrowth thereby restricting the effect of substrate limitation to delay biofouling through extensive pre treatment effective cleaning can be achieved only when both the chemical and physical interactions between the cleaning chemical and the biofilm are favourable ang et al 2006 therefore research focussing on novel cleaning chemicals and strategies for better solubilization of the eps matrix followed by removal of the biofilm is recommended to achieve a breakthrough in biofouling control 5 conclusions three substrate concentrations 1000 250 and 30 Œºg l 1 c were used to grow a biofilm in membrane fouling simulators the feed channel pressure drop pd and permeate flux were monitored and a feed channel pressure drop pd increase of 200 mbar was used as a benchmark to study the developed biofilm the main objective was to investigate the effect of the differences in the developed biofilm characteristics on the pd increase permeate flux decline and membrane cleanability the main study findings can be summarized by a faster biofilm development occurred at a high biodegradable substrate concentration in feed water causing a faster increase in feed channel pressure drop biofilm that developed under high substrate conditions resulted in less permeate flux decline attributed to the spatial location and composition of the biofilm substrate concentration affected the developed biofilm structure and therefore its cleanability slowly growing biofilms developing under low substrate conditions were harder to remove during conventional cleanings the same pd can be caused by biofilms differing in composition and spatial distribution therefore impacting the permeate flux and the cleanability efficiency differently declaration of interest none

19094,the frequent detection of artificial sweeteners ass in wastewater and surface water gives rise to concerns about their removal acesulfame ace and sucralose suc are two ass that are difficult to remove the ultraviolet persulfate uv ps advanced oxidation technology aot is being considered as an effective process for the degradation of micropollutants in wastewater however the study of the degradation of ass in real wastewater by the uv ps is minimal this study investigated the kinetics and modeling of ace and suc degradation in wastewater by the uv ps process both ace and suc could be degraded effectively using this process the degradation of ace was mainly attributed to uv photolysis 51 ho 26 and so4 16 while that of suc was mainly attributed to ho 68 and so4 27 the second order rate constants of ass with so4 were significantly lower than that with ho three major transformation products tps of ace and four major tps of suc were identified additionally the effects and mechanisms of the water matrices such as hco3 cl no3 and natural organic matter nom on ass degradation were investigated through response surface methodology rsm nom and cl significantly inhibited the degradation of ace in the uv ps system whereas nom and hco3 played a main inhibition role on the degradation of suc a water matrices parameter model for predicting ass degradation in real wastewater was established by rsm for the first time and the removal of ace and suc was well predicted by the model graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv persulfate artificial sweeteners reactive species predicting model based on water matrices real wastewater 1 introduction artificial sweeteners ass as sugar substitutes have received more attention due to their prevalent appearance as an ingredient in food beverages confectionary pharmaceuticals and personal care products lange et al 2012 among the ass acesulfame ace and sucralose suc have been frequently detected in different environmental compartments e g surface water scheurer et al 2011 groundwater van stempvoort et al 2013 seawater mead et al 2009 and wastewater li et al 2018b however due to their chemical stability conventional wastewater treatment technologies such as biodegradation ngoc han et al 2015 and chlorination scheurer et al 2010 are not efficient for ace and suc degradation torres et al 2011 for instance the concentrations of suc and ace were 1 0 and 15 mg l 1 in the in the wastewater treatment processes wwtps of tianjin china gan et al 2013 scheurer et al 2009 reported that ace and suc were removed only by about 40 and 20 in wwtps because of the inability of conventional wwtps to remove ass more efficient advanced treatment technology for the degradation of ass is needed advanced oxidation technologies aots based on the production of hydroxyl radical ho and sulfate radical so4 at ambient temperature and pressure are effective for the degradation of recalcitrant micropollutants in water xiao et al 2014 recently aots based on so4 have attracted more interest due to the high redox potential of so4 2 5 3 1 v which is comparable to ho 1 8 2 7 v so4 can be produced from activation of persulfate through heat antoniou et al 2010 ultrasound irradiation nasseri et al 2017 electrochemical process ledjeri et al 2016 uv photolysis he et al 2013 base peroxide epold and dulova 2015 or catalyzers among these activation methods ultraviolet persulfate uv ps not only consumes less energy but also does not cause heavy metal pollution ou et al 2017 for instance zhang et al 2016 investigated the degradation of sulfonamide antibiotics in the uv ps and uv h2o2 processes and found that the uv ps treatment can effectively remove the sulfonamide antibiotics in synthetic wastewater he et al 2014 demonstrated that the uv ps was more efficient than uv h2o2 in degrading cylindrospermopsin to date little information has been reported on the specific action of ass with uv ps especially the removal of ass in real wastewater diverse reactive species such as ho and so4 that coexist in the uv ps process contribute to the degradation of micropollutants in the uv ps system fu et al 2019 the degradation of the target pollutant in the uv ps process is attributed to uv direct photolysis as well as ho and so4 assisted indirect photolysis xiao et al 2016 however the actions of reactive species on the degradation of ass in the uv ps process are currently unclear the degradation of micropollutants in different types of water varies due to the different water matrices xiao et al 2016 reported that the removal of methylparaben and ethylparaben in real wastewater was much lower than that in ultrapure water the presence of substances in real wastewater made the a notable difference water matrix components such as natural organic matter nom affect the effectiveness of the uv ps process through scavenging radicals and filtering uv light wang et al 2016 anions such as hco3 cl and no3 affect the degradation through scavenging ho and so4 to form new radicals however the effects of the water matrix on different micropollutants degradation are specific and it is likely caused by different rates with radicals and require further investigation it is necessary to explore the effect of water matrices on the degradation of ass in the uv ps process and understand the degradation in real wastewater the objectives of this study are 1 to determine the reaction rates of ho and so4 with ass and the relative contributions of the reactive species to the degradation in the uv ps process 2 to identify the major transformation products tps of ass by the uv ps process 3 to investigate the effect and mechanism of water matrices on the ass degradation and 4 to estimate the degradation of ass in real wastewater by uv ps using the predicting model the result could provide useful information on the application of the uv ps process for the removal of ass in real wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials ace suc naproxen npx and tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa with purities higher than

of second order rate constants the second order rate constants of ass with ho and so4 were determined based on competition kinetics in ultrapure water using pcba as a reference compound lian et al 2017 reaction solutions containing 1 Œºm of both ass and pcba at ph 7 were used to perform the uv uv ps tba and uv h2o2 experiments respectively the concentrations of ps and h2o2 were both 20 Œºm additionally 1 mm tba was added in the solution to scavenge ho in uv ps system the second order rate constants of ass with co3 were determined in uv and uv h2o2 na2co3 systems using npx as a reference compound 2 5 Œºm of ace suc and npx were added in the reaction solutions co3 was generated from the photolysis of 0 1 m na2co3 and 3 mm h2o2 under uv irradiation 2 3 kintecus simulation of the

concentrations of radicals within different hco3 concentrations a model contained 99 reactions as shown in table s3 and most of the bimolecular reaction rate constants for photochemical and chemical reactions were obtained from the literature 2 4 analysis 2 4 1 measurement of the ass concentration the quantifications of the ass were performed using an uplc ms waters xevo tq s uplc ms usa with an

analyses were conducted using the spss 17 0 software program spss inc chicago il 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of ass by the uv persulfate process 3 1 1 relative contributions of reactive species reactive species such as ho and so4 contribute to the degradation of ass in the uv ps system fig 1 shows the time dependent degradation of ace fig 1a and suc fig 1b in uv ps uv ps uv ps tba uv ps meoh system results indicate that the degradation efficiency of ace is much higher than that of suc in the uv ps process in uv system ace showed a significant decrease 50 72 while no obvious removal of suc was observed in uv ps system ace could be degraded completely in 1800 s while the removal of suc was approximately 88 in 2700 s meoh reacts with ho 9 7 106 m 1s 1 and so4 3 2 106 m 1s 1 both at high rates and the reaction rate of tba with ho and so4 was 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 and 4 9 1 105 m 1s 1 respectively xiao et al 2016 meoh is considered as an effective quencher for both ho and so4 while tba is a quencher for ho so meoh and tba could be used to distinguish the contribution of ho and so4 the degradation of ace and suc followed the pseudo first order kinetics pattern fig 2 shows the specific first order rate constants k for uv photolysis ho so4 and ps the contributions of uv photolysis ho so4 and ps can be calculated through the ratio of respective k to k the pseudo first order rate constants in uv ps process it is easy to observe that the pseudo first order rate constants of ace degradation decreased by 26 09 and 42 03 with the addition of tba and meoh respectively the pseudo first order rate constants of suc degradation decreased by 68 81 and 96 11 with the addition of tba and meoh the addition of meoh and tba decreased the degradation of ass in uv ps process which suggested that both ho and so4 were involved in the degradation of ass additionally it was found that ace and suc could be slightly removed by ps it is caused by the reaction of ass and ps the uv ps process produces ho and so4 and so4 can be transformed to ho through eqs 1 and 2 waldemer et al 2007 the relative contribution of uv photolysis ho so4 and ps to the overall degradation of ace and suc was calculated approximately 26 09 and 68 81 of the degradation for ace and suc was achieved by ho respectively so4 contributed 15 94 for ace and 27 30 for suc and ps only contributed 7 85 for ace and 5 52 for suc it revealed that uv photolysis makes the greatest contribution to the degradation of ace while ho and so4 play a dominant role in degrading suc the result that ho was proved to have an important role is in agreements with the findings in the degradation of ace by the uv induced ferrous ion activated ps process kattel et al 2017 1 so4 h2o ho h so4 2 2 so4 oh ho so4 2 3 1 2 second order rate constants for ho and so4 with ass in order to compare the reactivity of two radicals in ass degradation the second order rate constants of ass with ho and so4 were determined according to competition kinetics pcba was chosen as a reference compound for determining the second order rate constants the secondary order rate constant of pcba with ho and so4 is reported to be 5 0 109 m 1s 1 and 3 6 108 m 1s 1 respectively the second order rate constants of ho and so4 with ass were determined in uv uv h2o2 and uv ps tba the tba was added to the solution to scavenge ho in uv ps system the second order rate constants of the target compounds reacting with ho so4 and co3 were derived from eq 3 yang et al 2017 by plotting ln t t 0 k t uv against the degradation of the reference compound ln r r 0 k r uv which revealed a linear function with a slope that could be used to calculate k radical t lian et al 2017 3 i n t t 0 k t u v k r a d i c a l t k r a d i c a l r i n r r 0 k r u v where k radical t and k radical r represent the second order rate constants m 1s 1 for the target compound and the reference compound respectively the k t uv and k r uv were the measured pseudo first order rate constant s 1 of the target compound and the reference compound under direct photolysis respectively fig s1 shows the competition kinetics of the target compounds versus the specific reference compound pcba with ho and so4 in uv h2o2 and uv ps tba systems respectively in the uv h2o2 system the calculated second order rate constants of ace and suc with ho were 5 21 108 m 1s 1 k ho ace and 5 16 108 m 1s 1 k ho suc and the two constants are similar in the uv ps tba system the second order rate constants of ace and suc with so4 were estimated as 6 81 107 m 1s 1 k s o 4 a c e and 1 31 107 m 1s 1 k s o 4 s u c and k s o 4 a c e is slightly higher than k s o 4 s u c the high reaction rate constants for ho and so4 with ass suggested that the uv ps process should be effective in the degradation of ass of note the value of the second order rate constants of ass with so4 were significantly lower than the second order rate constants of ass with ho this may mean that ho has a greater impact on the degradation of ass in uv ps process than so4 this conclusion explains the results of the radical scavenging tests in theory fig 2 it is reported that the second order rate constant of propranolol with so4 is lower than that with ho lian et al 2017 however for iodoacetic acid the conclusion is the opposite and it suggested that so4 is more reactive than ho with iodoacetic acid xiao et al 2016 the difference may be caused by the selectivity of so4 or special structure while reacting with many organic substrates 3 2 identification of tps uv irradiation in the ps system causes ass degradation producing a range of tps the major tps were tentatively identified by lc ms ms analysis the structure for the tps of ass were proposed based on the full scan mode obtained from lc ms ms analysis and the information available from previous studies gan et al 2014 tables 2 and 3 show the data and the proposed structures for the major tps moreover the ms2 spectra of the tps and its proposed structures are presented in figs s2 and s3 as shown three major products of ace in the uv ps system were detected while four major products of suc were identified tp 3 of ace which is formed by the addition of water at the c c bond can be produced with radicals gan et al 2014 tp 1 and tp 2 of ace were identified and reported through photodegradation li et al 2016 moreover the tp 1 and tp 2 of ace were reported to display an augmented toxicity relative to the parent compound in embryo development li et al 2016 this indicates that the toxicity of tps needs further assessment tp 1 and tp 3 of suc were formed through suc breakage tp 1 was derived from the fructose moiety while tp 3 was derived from the ring opening of glycoside moiety xu et al 2017 tp 2 of suc might be initiated by the oxidation of oh group on the methyl group and the c c bond might be formed with hcl elimination hu et al 2017 the direct cleavage of the glycoside bond of suc might occur and form tp 4 3 3 effects of water matrices on ass degradation the results above revealed that ho and so4 contributed the degradation of ass in the uv ps process bicarbonate chlorine nitrate and nom were the parameters that affect the action of ho and so4 the rsm was used to investigate the effects of water matrices on ass degradation in the uv ps process the 4 factor bicarbonate x 1 chlorine x 2 nitrate x 3 and nom x 4 bbd experimental result of the two responses the removal of ace y 1 and suc y 2 after 1800 s are listed in table s2 the legitimacy of using the model equations was confirmed through analysis of variance anova and the results are summarized in table s4 and table s5 the f values of y 1 and y 2 were 38 26 and 135 92 respectively and their corresponding p values were less than 0 0001 so the models are significant the lack of fit term was not significant p value 0 05 indicating that the residual error was not significant fig 3 a d shows the effects of four factor bicarbonate chlorine nitrate and nom on the degradation of ass based on the rsm 3 3 1 effect of bicarbonate according to the results in fig 3a the presence of hco3 at concentrations ranging from 1 to 4 mm inhibited the degradation of ace and suc in uv ps system of note from table s4 and fig 3a it can be seen that hco3 in the system could inhibit suc degradation more significantly than ace in uv ps system because its greater f value the negative effect of hco3 in uv ps system might be due to hco3 reacting with ho and so4 to produce a less reactive species co3 according to eqs 4 and 5 tan et al 2013 a similar finding was reported in the degradation of 2 4 di tert butylphenol by the uv ps process the k 0 decreased from 7 87 104 s 1 to 5 62 104 s 1 increasing hco3 0 from 0 to 50 mm wang et al 2016 however the addition of hco3 showed an increase effect in the degradation of oxytetracycline by the uv ps process liu et al 2016 the difference may be caused by the different second order rate constants with co3 4 so4 hco3 so4 2 co3 h 5 ho hco3 h2o co3 the second order rate constants of ass with co3 were determined in uv and uv h2o2 na2co3 system using npx as a reference compound fixed proportions of na2co3 and h2o2 can generate co3 under uv irradiation the second order rate constant of npx with co3 is 5 6 107 m 1s 1 wols et al 2015 the second order rate constants of ass with co3 were estimated as 4 65 106 m 1s 1 k co3 ace and 3 14 105 m 1s 1 k co3 suc see fig s4 and the second order rate constants of ass with co3 were lower than that with ho and so4 these results were in agreement with the result that the addition of hco3 inhibit the degradation of ass in the uv ps process to investigate the difference in the degree of inhibition of ace and suc tba and meoh were added to inhibit the reaction between ass with ho and so4 by comparison the reaction rate of co3 with meoh and tba were extremely low fig 4 shows the specific k the pseudo first order rate constants for uv direct photolysis ho so4 and others including cl cl2 no2 etc and co3 for ass degradation in uv ps system in the presence of 0 2 4 8 mm hco3 the presence of hco3 decreased the k of the ass and the decrease in k increased with the increasing hco3 concentration while the k o t h e r s c o 3 of the ass exhibited a slight increase however the k s o 4 of both ace and suc and the k u v of ace could maintain an unsteady stability with increasing hco3 concentration kinetic modeling simulated radical concentrations of the uv ps derived using kintecus 5 5 assuming there were no target organics in the solution the modeling results table 4 shows that the concentrations of co3 increased with increased hco3 concentration while so4 decreased slightly and ho was significantly reduced for suc k h o significantly decreased by 27 for suc but only decreased by 7 for ace the decrease in the degradation of suc was attributable to ho and indicated the high scavenging effect of hco3 on ho ho makes a greater contribution to the degradation of suc than ace the k s o 4 of ass underwent only insignificant changes with increased hco3 0 mainly because the concentration of so4 seldom varies the increase in the k o t h e r s c o 3 of ass was attributable to a large amount of co3 produced by hco3 however the increase was not obvious because of the low second order rate constants of ass with co3 as reported k h o is also sensitive to the hco3 dosage in the uv chlorine process and it causes the inhibition of micropollutants degradation wu et al 2017 3 3 2 effect of chlorine ion fig 3b displays the effect of cl on the degradations of ass in uv ps system as seen in fig 3b the degradations of ace and suc were inhibited by an increased concentration of cl 1 4 mm ho and so4 can react with cl to produce relatively weaker chlorine containing reactive species such as cl cloh and cl2 according to eqs 6 8 and these chlorine containing reactive species are relatively weaker species compared to ho and so4 feng et al 2017 and they have a lower redox potentials 2 4 v than so4 chen et al 2017b thereby resulting in some inhibition of ace and suc degradations 6 so4 cl so4 2 cl 7 ho cl cloh 8 cl cl cl2 in the rsm experiment the chlorine radicals had a lower reactivity with ass compared to ho and so4 and the scavenging of ho and so4 by cl was more obvious hence the presence of cl significantly reduced the degradation of ass this is consistent with the findings of previous studies on degradations of indomethacin by the uv ps process li et al 2018a some studies showed that the addition of cl can enhance the degradation of micropollutants chen et al 2017a the opposite conclusion is due to the different activity of target pollutants with chlorine ion 3 3 3 effect of nitrate the effect of nitrate 0 1 1 mm on the degradations of ass in uv ps system is shown in fig 3c interestingly it seemed that a lower concentration of no3 0 1 0 5 mm accelerated the degradation rate of ace slightly while the reaction was inhibited at a higher level of no3 0 5 1 mm in addition an inhibition effect on the degradation of suc was observed in the presence of 0 1 1 mm no3 in fact no3 had dual effects on the one hand no3 can absorb light in the uv range and generate the nitrite radical no2 and oxygen radical o according to eq 9 keen et al 2012 moreover o can enhance ass oxidation upon reaction with water to generate ho eq 10 on the other hand so4 generated reacts with no3 to produce no3 redox potential 2 5 v according to eq 11 chen et al 2011 when the no3 concentration is at a low level the generated o can enhance the degradations the inhibition effect was probably due to the fact that no3 acted primarily as a so4 scavenger besides the difference between ace and suc can be caused by a higher reactivity of ace no3 suppressed the degradation of micropollutants in most case luo et al 2016 while a small part of the studies showed the promotion of no3 liu et al 2016 9 no3 ‚ÑéŒΩ no2 o 10 o h2o ho ho 11 so4 no3 so4 2 no3 3 3 4 effect of nom in the present study humic acid 6 15 mg l 1 was applied as a representative of aquatic nom to investigate its potential influence on the degradation of ace and suc in the uv ps system and the results are presented in fig 3d the degradations of ass were obviously inhibited by the addition of ha the inhibitory effect of nom on ass degradation could be explained as follows 1 nom can affect the oxidation reaction based on radicals through scavenging radicals and reverse the radical intermediates to the parent compound feng et al 2017 2 in addition the nom can act as an inner filter of uv light at 254 nm with extinction coefficient of 3 15 l m 1 mg 1 luo et al 2016 which can have an inhibitory effect for the photolysis of ace and the production of so4 this is consistent with the findings of previous studies on the degradation of chlorotriazine pesticides and the decrease is attributed to the scavenging of ho and so4 by nom lutze et al 2015 3 4 prediction model for ass degradation in real wastewater based on the 4 factor bicarbonate x 1 chlorine x 2 nitrate x 3 and nom x 4 rsm experiment the removal of ace y 1 and suc y

66x 4 2 three real wastewater samples from secondary sedimentation effluents of three wttps were used to elucidate the degradation efficiencies of ass in uv ps system and the application of the kinetic model in real wastewater fig 5 shows the experimental removal and the predicted values by the model eqs 12 and 13 the removal of ace and suc could be well predicted by the model and the four selected substances are the major influencing factors clearly the removal of ace and suc shows great difference in both real wastewater and milli q water and the presence of substances in real wastewater leads to the decrease in addition the removal of ace in three wttps were similar while the removal of suc in three wttps were obviously different this illustrates that the four substances inhibit suc degradation more significantly than ace in the uv ps process this agrees with the effects of water matrices on ass degradations besides the lowest removal of suc in wttp3 may be caused by the high concentrations of ha and cl moreover it can be seen that the experiment data were lower than the predicted values fig 5 the discrepancy between predicted values and experimental values can be explained by the presence of large quantities of substances such as other pollutants metal ions and microbes in real wastewater the real concentration of nom was higher than the measured concentration of ha furthermore the reaction rate constant of nom with radicals ho and so4 in the real wastewater was likely different from the experimental data because of the variability in the properties of nom besides other water components such as bromine ion ferric iron and the coexisting micropollutants may also result in a discrepancy qian et al 2016 additionally these findings indicate that nom and hco3 played an important inhibition role of ass degradation in uv ps system water with a low concentration of nom and hco3 is preferred for removing ass more by the uv ps process 4 conclusions both ace and suc in water can be removed effectively by uv ps process the degradation of ace was mainly attributable to uv photolysis ho and so4 while that of suc was mainly attributable to ho and so4 the second order rate constants for ace and suc reacting with so4 were estimated to be 6 81 107 m 1s 1 and 1 31 107 m 1s 1 and those for ace and suc reacting with ho were determined to be 5 21 108 m 1s 1 and 5 16 108 m 1s 1 respectively bicarbonate inhibited the degradation of ass through inhibiting the contributions of ho but did not significantly affect that of so4 increasing concentration of chlorine and nom increased the degradation of ass in the uv ps system while nitrate has inhibitory effect on the degradation of suc but has dual effects on that of ace the uv ps process was also effective in removing ass in real wastewater and the predicting model simulated by response surface methodology could describe the removal of ass in different wastewater samples additionally these findings suggested that a water with low concentration of nom cl and hco3 will be preferred or an efficient pretreatment that removes nom cl and hco3 can enhance the removal of the ace and suc by the uv ps process possible degradation pathways of ass in the uv ps process have been proposed for future research the toxicity of residual degradation products should be evaluated these results and ideas

19094,the frequent detection of artificial sweeteners ass in wastewater and surface water gives rise to concerns about their removal acesulfame ace and sucralose suc are two ass that are difficult to remove the ultraviolet persulfate uv ps advanced oxidation technology aot is being considered as an effective process for the degradation of micropollutants in wastewater however the study of the degradation of ass in real wastewater by the uv ps is minimal this study investigated the kinetics and modeling of ace and suc degradation in wastewater by the uv ps process both ace and suc could be degraded effectively using this process the degradation of ace was mainly attributed to uv photolysis 51 ho 26 and so4 16 while that of suc was mainly attributed to ho 68 and so4 27 the second order rate constants of ass with so4 were significantly lower than that with ho three major transformation products tps of ace and four major tps of suc were identified additionally the effects and mechanisms of the water matrices such as hco3 cl no3 and natural organic matter nom on ass degradation were investigated through response surface methodology rsm nom and cl significantly inhibited the degradation of ace in the uv ps system whereas nom and hco3 played a main inhibition role on the degradation of suc a water matrices parameter model for predicting ass degradation in real wastewater was established by rsm for the first time and the removal of ace and suc was well predicted by the model graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv persulfate artificial sweeteners reactive species predicting model based on water matrices real wastewater 1 introduction artificial sweeteners ass as sugar substitutes have received more attention due to their prevalent appearance as an ingredient in food beverages confectionary pharmaceuticals and personal care products lange et al 2012 among the ass acesulfame ace and sucralose suc have been frequently detected in different environmental compartments e g surface water scheurer et al 2011 groundwater van stempvoort et al 2013 seawater mead et al 2009 and wastewater li et al 2018b however due to their chemical stability conventional wastewater treatment technologies such as biodegradation ngoc han et al 2015 and chlorination scheurer et al 2010 are not efficient for ace and suc degradation torres et al 2011 for instance the concentrations of suc and ace were 1 0 and 15 mg l 1 in the in the wastewater treatment processes wwtps of tianjin china gan et al 2013 scheurer et al 2009 reported that ace and suc were removed only by about 40 and 20 in wwtps because of the inability of conventional wwtps to remove ass more efficient advanced treatment technology for the degradation of ass is needed advanced oxidation technologies aots based on the production of hydroxyl radical ho and sulfate radical so4 at ambient temperature and pressure are effective for the degradation of recalcitrant micropollutants in water xiao et al 2014 recently aots based on so4 have attracted more interest due to the high redox potential of so4 2 5 3 1 v which is comparable to ho 1 8 2 7 v so4 can be produced from activation of persulfate through heat antoniou et al 2010 ultrasound irradiation nasseri et al 2017 electrochemical process ledjeri et al 2016 uv photolysis he et al 2013 base peroxide epold and dulova 2015 or catalyzers among these activation methods ultraviolet persulfate uv ps not only consumes less energy but also does not cause heavy metal pollution ou et al 2017 for instance zhang et al 2016 investigated the degradation of sulfonamide antibiotics in the uv ps and uv h2o2 processes and found that the uv ps treatment can effectively remove the sulfonamide antibiotics in synthetic wastewater he et al 2014 demonstrated that the uv ps was more efficient than uv h2o2 in degrading cylindrospermopsin to date little information has been reported on the specific action of ass with uv ps especially the removal of ass in real wastewater diverse reactive species such as ho and so4 that coexist in the uv ps process contribute to the degradation of micropollutants in the uv ps system fu et al 2019 the degradation of the target pollutant in the uv ps process is attributed to uv direct photolysis as well as ho and so4 assisted indirect photolysis xiao et al 2016 however the actions of reactive species on the degradation of ass in the uv ps process are currently unclear the degradation of micropollutants in different types of water varies due to the different water matrices xiao et al 2016 reported that the removal of methylparaben and ethylparaben in real wastewater was much lower than that in ultrapure water the presence of substances in real wastewater made the a notable difference water matrix components such as natural organic matter nom affect the effectiveness of the uv ps process through scavenging radicals and filtering uv light wang et al 2016 anions such as hco3 cl and no3 affect the degradation through scavenging ho and so4 to form new radicals however the effects of the water matrix on different micropollutants degradation are specific and it is likely caused by different rates with radicals and require further investigation it is necessary to explore the effect of water matrices on the degradation of ass in the uv ps process and understand the degradation in real wastewater the objectives of this study are 1 to determine the reaction rates of ho and so4 with ass and the relative contributions of the reactive species to the degradation in the uv ps process 2 to identify the major transformation products tps of ass by the uv ps process 3 to investigate the effect and mechanism of water matrices on the ass degradation and 4 to estimate the degradation of ass in real wastewater by uv ps using the predicting model the result could provide useful information on the application of the uv ps process for the removal of ass in real wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials ace suc naproxen npx and tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa with purities higher than

of second order rate constants the second order rate constants of ass with ho and so4 were determined based on competition kinetics in ultrapure water using pcba as a reference compound lian et al 2017 reaction solutions containing 1 Œºm of both ass and pcba at ph 7 were used to perform the uv uv ps tba and uv h2o2 experiments respectively the concentrations of ps and h2o2 were both 20 Œºm additionally 1 mm tba was added in the solution to scavenge ho in uv ps system the second order rate constants of ass with co3 were determined in uv and uv h2o2 na2co3 systems using npx as a reference compound 2 5 Œºm of ace suc and npx were added in the reaction solutions co3 was generated from the photolysis of 0 1 m na2co3 and 3 mm h2o2 under uv irradiation 2 3 kintecus simulation of the concentrations of reactive species a kinetic model simulating the steady concentrations of the reactive species was performed using version 5 5 of the kintecus software in order to simulate the concentrations of radicals within different hco3 concentrations a model contained 99 reactions as shown in table s3 and most of the bimolecular reaction rate constants for photochemical and chemical reactions were obtained from the literature 2 4 analysis 2 4 1 measurement of the ass concentration the quantifications of the ass were performed using an uplc ms waters xevo tq s uplc ms usa with an

analyses were conducted using the spss 17 0 software program spss inc chicago il 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of ass by the uv persulfate process 3 1 1 relative contributions of reactive species reactive species such as ho and so4 contribute to the degradation of ass in the uv ps system fig 1 shows the time dependent degradation of ace fig 1a and suc fig 1b in uv ps uv ps uv ps tba uv ps meoh system results indicate that the degradation efficiency of ace is much higher than that of suc in the uv ps process in uv system ace showed a significant decrease 50 72 while no obvious removal of suc was observed in uv ps system ace could be degraded completely in 1800 s while the removal of suc was approximately 88 in 2700 s meoh reacts with ho 9 7 106 m 1s 1 and so4 3 2 106 m 1s 1 both at high rates and the reaction rate of tba with ho and so4 was 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 and 4 9 1 105 m 1s 1 respectively xiao et al 2016 meoh is considered as an effective quencher for both ho and so4 while tba is a quencher for ho so meoh and tba could be used to distinguish the contribution of ho and so4 the degradation of ace and suc followed the pseudo first order kinetics pattern fig 2 shows the specific first order rate constants k for uv photolysis ho so4 and ps the contributions of uv photolysis ho so4 and ps can be calculated through the ratio of respective k to k the pseudo first order rate constants in uv ps process it is easy to observe that the pseudo first order rate constants of ace degradation decreased by 26 09 and 42 03 with the addition of tba and meoh respectively the pseudo first order rate constants of suc degradation decreased by 68 81 and 96 11 with the addition of tba and meoh the addition of meoh and tba decreased the degradation of ass in uv ps process which suggested that both ho and so4 were involved in the degradation of ass additionally it was found that ace and suc could be slightly removed by ps it is caused by the reaction of ass and ps the uv ps process produces ho and so4 and so4 can be transformed to ho through eqs 1 and 2 waldemer et al 2007 the relative contribution of uv photolysis ho so4 and ps to the overall degradation of ace and suc was calculated approximately 26 09 and 68 81 of the degradation for ace and suc was achieved by ho respectively so4 contributed 15 94 for ace and 27 30 for suc and ps only contributed 7 85 for ace and 5 52 for suc it revealed that uv photolysis makes the greatest contribution to the degradation of ace while ho and so4 play a dominant role in degrading suc the result that ho was proved to have an important role is in agreements with the findings in the degradation of ace by the uv induced ferrous ion activated ps process kattel et al 2017 1 so4 h2o ho h so4 2 2 so4 oh ho so4 2 3 1 2 second order rate constants for ho and so4 with ass in order to compare the reactivity of two radicals in ass degradation the second order rate constants of ass with ho and so4 were determined according to competition kinetics pcba was chosen as a reference compound for determining the second order rate constants the secondary order rate constant of pcba with ho and so4 is reported to be 5 0 109 m 1s 1 and 3 6 108 m 1s 1 respectively the second order rate constants of ho and so4 with ass were determined in uv uv h2o2 and uv ps tba the tba was added to the solution to scavenge ho in uv ps system the second order rate constants of the target compounds reacting with ho so4 and co3 were derived from eq 3 yang et al 2017 by plotting ln t t 0 k t uv against the degradation of the reference compound ln r r 0 k r uv which revealed a linear function with a slope that could be used to calculate k radical t lian et al 2017 3 i n t t 0 k t u v k r a d i c a l t k r a d i c a l r i n r r 0 k r u v where k radical t and k radical r represent the second order rate constants m 1s 1 for the target compound and the reference compound respectively the k t uv and k r uv were the measured pseudo first order rate constant s 1 of the target compound and the reference compound under direct photolysis respectively fig s1 shows the competition kinetics of the target compounds versus the specific reference compound pcba with ho and so4 in uv h2o2 and uv ps tba systems respectively in the uv h2o2 system the calculated second order rate constants of ace and suc with ho were 5 21 108 m 1s 1 k ho ace and 5 16 108 m 1s 1 k ho suc and the two constants are similar in the uv ps tba system the second order rate constants of ace and suc with so4 were estimated as 6 81 107 m 1s 1 k s o 4 a c e and 1 31 107 m 1s 1 k s o 4 s u c and k s o 4 a c e is slightly higher than k s o 4 s u c the high reaction rate constants for ho and so4 with ass suggested that the uv ps process should be effective in the degradation of ass of note the value of the second order rate constants of ass with so4 were significantly lower than the second order rate constants of ass with ho this may mean that ho has a greater impact on the degradation of ass in uv ps process than so4 this conclusion explains the results of the radical scavenging tests in theory fig 2 it is reported that the second order rate constant of propranolol with so4 is lower than that with ho lian et al 2017 however for iodoacetic acid the conclusion is the opposite and it suggested that so4 is more reactive than ho with iodoacetic acid xiao et al 2016 the difference may be caused by the selectivity of so4 or special structure while reacting with many organic substrates 3 2 identification of tps uv irradiation in the ps system causes ass degradation producing a range of tps the major tps were tentatively identified by lc ms ms analysis the structure for the tps of ass were proposed based on the full scan mode obtained from lc ms ms analysis and the information available from previous studies gan et al 2014 tables 2 and 3 show the data and the proposed structures for the major tps moreover the ms2 spectra of the tps and its proposed structures are presented in figs s2 and s3 as shown three major products of ace in the uv ps system were detected while four major products of suc were identified tp 3 of ace which is formed by the addition of water at the c c bond can be produced with radicals gan et al 2014 tp 1 and tp 2 of ace were identified and reported through photodegradation li et al 2016 moreover the tp 1 and tp 2 of ace were reported to display an augmented toxicity relative to the parent compound in embryo development li et al 2016 this indicates that the toxicity of tps needs further assessment tp 1 and tp 3 of suc were formed through suc breakage tp 1 was derived from the fructose moiety while tp 3 was derived from the ring opening of glycoside moiety xu et al 2017 tp 2 of suc might be initiated by the oxidation of oh group on the methyl group and the c c bond might be formed with hcl elimination hu et al 2017 the direct cleavage of the glycoside bond of suc might occur and form tp 4 3 3 effects of water matrices on ass degradation the results above revealed that ho and so4 contributed the degradation of ass in the uv ps process bicarbonate chlorine nitrate and nom were the parameters that affect the action of ho and so4 the rsm was used to investigate the effects of water matrices on ass degradation in the uv ps process the 4 factor bicarbonate x 1 chlorine x 2 nitrate x 3 and nom x 4 bbd experimental result of the two responses the removal of ace y 1 and suc y 2 after 1800 s are listed in table s2 the legitimacy of using the model equations was confirmed through analysis of variance anova and the results are summarized in table s4 and table s5 the f values of y 1 and y 2 were 38 26 and 135 92 respectively and their corresponding p values were less than 0 0001 so the models are significant the lack of fit term was not significant p value 0 05 indicating that the residual error was not significant fig 3 a d shows the effects of four factor bicarbonate chlorine nitrate and nom on the degradation of ass based on the rsm 3 3 1 effect of bicarbonate according to the results in fig 3a the presence of hco3 at concentrations ranging from 1 to 4 mm inhibited the degradation of ace and suc in uv ps system of note from table s4 and fig 3a it can be seen that hco3 in the system could inhibit suc degradation more significantly than ace in uv ps system because its greater f value the negative effect of hco3 in uv ps system might be due to hco3 reacting with ho and so4 to produce a less reactive species co3 according to eqs 4 and 5 tan et al 2013 a similar finding was reported in the degradation of 2 4 di tert butylphenol by the uv ps process the k 0 decreased from 7 87 104 s 1 to 5 62 104 s 1 increasing hco3 0 from 0 to 50 mm wang et al 2016 however the addition of hco3 showed an increase effect in the degradation of oxytetracycline by the uv ps process liu et al 2016 the difference may be caused by the different second order rate constants with co3 4 so4 hco3 so4 2 co3 h 5 ho hco3 h2o co3 the second order rate constants of ass with co3 were determined in uv and uv h2o2 na2co3 system using npx as a reference compound fixed proportions of na2co3 and h2o2 can generate co3 under uv irradiation the second order rate constant of npx with co3 is 5 6 107 m 1s 1 wols et al 2015 the second order rate constants of ass with co3 were estimated as 4 65 106 m 1s 1 k co3 ace and 3 14 105 m 1s 1 k co3 suc see fig s4 and the second order rate constants of ass with co3 were lower than that with ho and so4 these results were in agreement with the result that the addition of hco3 inhibit the degradation of ass in the uv ps process to investigate the difference in the degree of inhibition of ace and suc tba and meoh were added to inhibit the reaction between ass with ho and so4 by comparison the reaction rate of co3 with meoh and tba were extremely low fig 4 shows the specific k the pseudo first order rate constants for uv direct photolysis ho so4 and others including cl cl2 no2 etc and co3 for ass degradation in uv ps system in the presence of 0 2 4 8 mm hco3 the presence of hco3 decreased the k of the ass and the decrease in k increased with the increasing hco3 concentration while the k o t h e r s c o 3 of the ass exhibited a slight increase however the k s o 4 of both ace and suc and the k u v of ace could maintain an unsteady stability with increasing hco3 concentration kinetic modeling simulated radical concentrations of the uv ps derived using kintecus 5 5 assuming there were no target organics in the solution the modeling results table 4 shows that the concentrations of co3 increased with increased hco3 concentration while so4 decreased slightly and ho was significantly reduced for suc k h o significantly decreased by 27 for suc but only decreased by 7 for ace the decrease in the degradation of suc was attributable to ho and indicated the high scavenging effect of hco3 on ho ho makes a greater contribution to the degradation of suc than ace the k s o 4 of ass underwent only insignificant changes with increased hco3 0 mainly because the concentration of so4 seldom varies the increase in the k o t h e r s c o 3 of ass was attributable to a large amount of co3 produced by hco3 however the increase was not obvious because of the low second order rate constants of ass with co3 as reported k h o is also sensitive to the hco3 dosage in the uv chlorine process and it causes the inhibition of micropollutants degradation wu et al 2017 3 3 2 effect of chlorine ion fig 3b displays the effect of cl on the degradations of ass in uv ps system as seen in fig 3b the degradations of ace and suc were inhibited by an increased concentration of cl 1 4 mm ho and so4 can react with cl to produce relatively weaker chlorine containing reactive species such as cl cloh and cl2 according to eqs 6 8 and these chlorine containing reactive species are relatively weaker species compared to ho and so4 feng et al 2017 and they have a lower redox potentials 2 4 v than so4 chen et al 2017b thereby resulting in some inhibition of ace and suc degradations 6 so4 cl so4 2 cl 7 ho cl cloh 8 cl cl cl2 in the rsm experiment the chlorine radicals had a lower reactivity with ass compared to ho and so4 and the scavenging of ho and so4 by cl was more obvious hence the presence of cl significantly reduced the degradation of ass this is consistent with the findings of previous studies on degradations of indomethacin by the uv ps process li et al 2018a some studies showed that the addition of cl can enhance the degradation of micropollutants chen et al 2017a the opposite conclusion is due to the different activity of target pollutants with chlorine ion 3 3 3 effect of nitrate the effect of nitrate 0 1 1 mm on the degradations of ass in uv ps system is shown in fig 3c interestingly it seemed that a lower concentration of no3 0 1 0 5 mm accelerated the degradation rate of ace slightly while the reaction was inhibited at a higher level of no3 0 5 1 mm in addition an inhibition effect on the degradation of suc was observed in the presence of 0 1 1 mm no3 in fact no3 had dual effects on the one hand no3 can absorb light in the uv range and generate the nitrite radical no2 and oxygen radical o according to eq 9 keen et al 2012 moreover o can enhance ass oxidation upon reaction with water to generate ho eq 10 on the other hand so4 generated reacts with no3 to produce no3 redox potential 2 5 v according to eq 11 chen et al 2011 when the no3 concentration is at a low level the generated o can enhance the degradations the inhibition effect was probably due to the fact that no3 acted primarily as a so4 scavenger besides the difference between ace and suc can be caused by a higher reactivity of ace no3 suppressed the degradation of micropollutants in most case luo et al 2016 while a small part of the studies showed the promotion of no3 liu et al 2016 9 no3 ‚ÑéŒΩ no2 o 10 o h2o ho ho 11 so4 no3 so4 2 no3 3 3 4 effect of nom in the present study humic acid 6 15 mg l 1 was applied as a representative of aquatic nom to investigate its potential influence on the degradation of ace and suc in the uv ps system and the results are presented in fig 3d the degradations of ass were obviously inhibited by the addition of ha the inhibitory effect of nom on ass degradation could be explained as follows 1 nom can affect the oxidation reaction based on radicals through scavenging radicals and reverse the radical intermediates to the parent compound feng et al 2017 2 in addition the nom can act as an inner filter of uv light at 254 nm with extinction coefficient of 3 15 l m 1 mg 1 luo et al 2016 which can have an inhibitory effect for the photolysis of ace and the production of so4 this is consistent with the findings of previous studies on the degradation of chlorotriazine pesticides and the decrease is attributed to the scavenging of ho and so4 by nom lutze et al 2015 3 4 prediction model for ass degradation in real wastewater based on the 4 factor bicarbonate x 1 chlorine x 2 nitrate x 3 and nom x 4 rsm experiment the removal of ace y 1 and suc y

66x 4 2 three real wastewater samples from secondary sedimentation effluents of three wttps were used to elucidate the degradation efficiencies of ass in uv ps system and the application of the kinetic model in real wastewater fig 5 shows the experimental removal and the predicted values by the model eqs 12 and 13 the removal of ace and suc could be well predicted by the model and the four selected substances are the major influencing factors clearly the removal of ace and suc shows great difference in both real wastewater and milli q water and the presence of substances in real wastewater leads to the decrease in addition the removal of ace in three wttps were similar while the removal of suc in three wttps were obviously different this illustrates that the four substances inhibit suc degradation more significantly than ace in the uv ps process this agrees with the effects of water matrices on ass degradations besides the lowest removal of suc in wttp3 may be caused by the high concentrations of ha and cl moreover it can be seen that the experiment data were lower than the predicted values fig 5 the discrepancy between predicted values and experimental values can be explained by the presence of large quantities of substances such as other pollutants metal ions and microbes in real wastewater the real concentration of nom was higher than the measured concentration of ha furthermore the reaction rate constant of nom with radicals ho and so4 in the real wastewater was likely different from the experimental data because of the variability in the properties of nom besides other water components such as bromine ion ferric iron and the coexisting micropollutants may also result in a discrepancy qian et al 2016 additionally these findings indicate that nom and hco3 played an important inhibition role of ass degradation in uv ps system water with a low concentration of nom and hco3 is preferred for removing ass more by the uv ps process 4 conclusions both ace and suc in water can be removed effectively by uv ps process the degradation of ace was mainly attributable to uv photolysis ho and so4 while that of suc was mainly attributable to ho and so4 the second order rate constants for ace and suc reacting with so4 were estimated to be 6 81 107 m 1s 1 and 1 31 107 m 1s 1 and those for ace and suc reacting with ho were determined to be 5 21 108 m 1s 1 and 5 16 108 m 1s 1 respectively bicarbonate inhibited the degradation of ass through inhibiting the contributions of ho but did not significantly affect that of so4 increasing concentration of chlorine and nom increased the degradation of ass in the uv ps system while nitrate has inhibitory effect on the degradation of suc but has dual effects on that of ace the uv ps process was also effective in removing ass in real wastewater and the predicting model simulated by response surface methodology could describe the removal of ass in different wastewater samples additionally these findings suggested that a water with low concentration of nom cl and hco3 will be preferred or an efficient pretreatment that removes nom cl and hco3 can enhance the removal of the ace and suc by the uv ps process possible degradation pathways of ass in the uv ps process have been proposed for future research the toxicity of residual degradation products should be evaluated these results and ideas
