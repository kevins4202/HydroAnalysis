10220,groundwater gw depletion and recurring floods have become a major concern among researchers and planners across the world to rejuvenate stressed aquifer and moderate flood impacts a modified version of managed aquifer recharge mar consisting of a cluster of ten recharge wells rws embedded in a community pond with an area of 2625 m2 and utilizing diverted floodwater was tested on a pilot scale in ramganga sub basin india the approach could recharge a maximum of 72426 m3 of floodwater in 78 days during the wet season the pond intervention minimized clogging of rws by retaining maximum silt load of 68 01 hydro geochemically majority of water samples were of mg hco3 and ca hco3type ion exchange processes and weathering of carbonate and silicates were the controlling factors determining water quality of the area total dissolved solids fluoride iron zinc manganese chromium cobalt nickel mercury phosphate nitrate and ammonical nitrogen were found within the permissible limits as laid down by world health organization except arsenic and lead which seems to be the inherent problem in the area as evidenced by water quality analysis of farmers tube wells located upstream and down streams of the recharge site the coliform presence in the 88 23 of sampled gw may thwart from direct use for drinking whereas it was fit for irrigation looking the benefits of modified mar as a proactive gw quality improvement with good aquifer recharge it is recommended for scaling up of the intervention across the gw stressed parts of the whole ram ganga basin and similar hydro geological regions elsewhere keywords groundwater recharge groundwater quality managed aquifer recharge toxic elements floodwater 1 introduction climate change is likely to impact rainfall patterns leading to higher uncertainty and difficulties in the management of both drought and flood events bhaskar et al 2014 food and agricultural organization fao 2015 estimated loss of about 80 billion us dollar due to decline in crop and livestock production in 67 countries caused by climatic disaster like floods drought etc during 2003 2013 such disasters may also affect the quality and quantity of surface as well as gw across the globe by the end of 21st century jimenez cisneros et al 2014 in estimation around 1 2 billion people or almost one fifth of the world s population live in areas of physical scarcity of water and 500 million people are approaching this situation undp 2006 konikow and kendy 2005 has reported that the gw depleted excessively across the globe which included major regions of north africa the middle east south and central asia north china north america and australia in india out of 6607 gw assessment units about 1071 units were over exploited mowr 2015 increase in gw exploitation in india was also projected from 710 billion cubic meter bcm in the year 2010 1180 bcm by 2050 cwc 2014 to meet domestic industrial and irrigation needs of burgeoning population to overcome the problem of declining gw table managed aquifer recharge mar utilizing the vast storage and buffering capacity of aquifer bouwer 2002 dillon et al 2006 du et al 2009 morin et al 2009 presents a good potential but the major obstacle in mar across the globe is clogging and or siltation due to the suspended solids present in recharge water resulting in continuous decline of recharge rates and ultimately failure of the system thus a modified version of recharge technique constituting a cluster of mar structures in a pond was designed with a novel concept to minimize mar clogging by reducing recharge stream velocity through pond storage it targeted excess wet season runoff that posed flood risk downstream to recharge gw for irrigation hence a terminology underground transfer of floods for irrigation utfi was coined for this specific technique of mar pavelic et al 2012 origin of the utfi approach emerged as a spin off from a pilot scale mar trial conducted in a sub basin of the chao phraya river basin thailand where 28 of the wet season discharges from the basin 3370 mcm yr 1 were harvested to refill the vast alluvial aquifers in the central plains these were extensively utilized for irrigation of rice and sugarcane pavelic et al 2012 however the major concern in mar approach is the water quality of source water which is not evaluated properly introduction of chemical lee and lee 1995 and biological megha et al 2015 contaminants into the aquifer can adversely impact the longevity of a recharge project the gw contaminations with cadmium arsenic cobalt chromium copper mercury nickel lead tin and zinc has been reported dwivedi and vankar 2014 in ganga basin of uttar pradesh india and the cause ascribed to industrial sources a significant concentration of metals and metalloids salinity nitrate and fluoride has been reported sharma et al 2003 rajmohan and amarasinghe 2016 in the sediments of ramganga basin which is increasing attributed for exponentially with time globally the agricultural activities involving the use of agrochemicals was the major cause of nitrate contamination in gw babiker et al 2004 chowdary et al 2005 wick et al 2012 bhutiani et al 2016 as per central ground water board cgwb 2009 artificial recharge had been very effective in diluting the concentration of fluoride an earlier research cssri 2016 also showed a significant decrease in fluoride content in gw from 2 43 mg l 1 to 0 823 mg l 1 due to dilution effect when recharged with rain water therefore it was hypothesized that the utfi intervention may help not only in recharging the stressed aquifers but also act as a mitigation approach for gw pollution from various contaminants if any by diluting the inherent geo genic or anthropogenic however the success of artificial gw recharge is dependent on the minimum contamination loads of the source of water therefore water quality is the principle area of concern in development of mar for its multi purpose use guidelines framed by world health organization who 2008 for drinking and irrigation water bis 2001 needs serious consideration to achieve this objective an study was carried out to assess the influence of floodwater composition on the hydrogeological chemistry and gw quality under piloting and testing of utfi in ramganga sub basin ganges basin to establish the possibility for wider implementation across similar hydro geological conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 description of study area district rampur lies over alluvial deposits of the quaternary period brought by river systems of ganga and ram ganga the various geomorphic units described under the districts are tarai tract with shallow water table condition meander flood plains younger alluvial plains older alluvial plains and ravenous tract fig 1 our study area lies in the older alluvial flood plains which covers 80 of the district the soil is fine textured and rich in organic matter in the area there are four aquifers present down to 440 m below ground level the depth of the first aquifer extends down to 60 90 m depth which is being used mostly for irrigation purpose many private tube wells were drilled and used for irrigation needs paddy sugarcane and wheat are the main crops of the region the gw is under risk due to its over abstraction resulting in the drastic drop of water table 10 17 cm year 1 in the area the depth of gw table varied between 4 and 8 m during june to september and 8 12 m during october to may tripathi 2009 the present study on mar was implemented at jiwai jadid village 28 783517 n 79 201536 e in rampur district uttar pradesh india under ramganga sub basin ganges basin during 2016 2018 fig 2 which is formed by alluvial sediments temperature in this region varies from 43 c to 30 c during summer and 25 c to 5 c in winter season with average annual rainfall of about 990 mm occurring during southwest monsoon period flash flood is the common feature of the region which had affected nearly 207 villages in year 2015 dfpr 2015 the population is largely agrarian topography is more or less flat with elevation of about 189 m in the east to 185 m in the west the ephemeral pilakhar river which is a tributary of the ramganga flowing to the western side of the village is a major source of irrigation water through pilakhar canal total discharge in the canal is about 350 400 cusecs in a year the floodwater of pilakhar river flowing into canal was used for gw recharge during wet season in this study 2 2 survey and designing of mar structure the mar structures were constructed in village community pond fig 3 located adjoining to the pilakhar canal during survey and analysis the soil was found to be clayey in nature up to about 3 4 m depth from the bottom of the pond with poor infiltration rate dimension of the pond was 75 m 35 m which was excavated up to a depth of 2 m ten recharge wells rw were established in the pond out of which five had filter diameter of 3 m and other five with 1 5 m diameter each recharge well consisted of a pvc pipe 150 mm dia surrounded by pea gravel filter filled in a brick masonry built around them the height of these structures from the bottom of the pond was 1 m depths of recharge wells of 3 m and 1 5 m diameter filter chambers were 30 m and 24 m respectively fig 4 shows the detailed design depicting plan and sectional view of the recharge structure during the monsoon months july to september the recharge was carried out by siphoning floodwater into the pond from pilakhar minor canal after passing through a de silting chamber dead storage was 1 m was maintained in pond during the recharge period a total of nine piezometers p1 p2 p9 with 30 m depth were also installed along the direction of gw flow from north to south to monitor gw levels and sampling for water quality the p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 and p7 were within 50 m reach of recharge site whereas p8 and p9 were placed at 600 m and 900 m respectively the visual modflow v 4 6 groundwater model was used to identify flow direction 2 3 recharge rate measurement of the whole system the pond of irregular shape was divided into different uniform elemental segment the points on sloped embankment were marked against incremental pond depth the volume of each element was calculated for given depth of pond and summed up for estimating total volume of water in pond at that particular depth similarly for another incremental pond depth incremental surface area and associated volume of the pond was estimated a regression analysis between estimated volumes and pond depths was used to develop a functional relationship as given below 1 v h t 1164 8333 h t 133 6666 h t 2 where vht volume of water present in

recharge m3 2 4 monitoring and sampling activities pilot operations were conducted over three years from 2016 to 18 but the detailed water quality analysis was conducted in 2017 in order to understand the cumulative effect of the recharge on water quality the water samples were collected from two recharge wells rw1 3 m diameter and rw2 1 5 m diameter and nine piezometers during pre recharge period prp january april and june 2017 during recharge period drp july august and september 2017 and post recharge period porp october november and december 2017 the floodwater quality during recharge was also monitored periodically to assess the water quality of the area water samples were also collected from the farmers tube wells used for irrigating crops which were situated about 500 m upstream and downstream of the recharge site 2 5 silt load assessment the pea gravels were taken out from filter and about a kg of samples in triplicate was collected from the bulk it was manually cleaned with fresh water the suspended silt and washed gravels were oven dried separately and weighed for computing total average silt load deposition in filter the density of the pea gravel was estimated as 1600 kg m 3 for measuring silt load in pond 1 m2 size polythene sheets were placed at the bottom of the pond at 15 sites before start of recharge after recharge completion and drying of the pond the deposited silt on each polythene sheet was collected in the month of april oven dried and average weight of silt deposited was recorded the total silt load of pond was calculated by multiplying its average weight with area of pond s bottom 1950 m2 in order to assess the silt deposited in rw after first recharge in 2016 its depth was measured and subtracted from the actual depth for computing total silt weight the recharge wells were cleaned by employing air compressor before second recharge season in 2017 2 6 chemical analysis of water the ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined potentiometrically using ph and ec electrodes with orion ion analyzer sodium potassium calcium magnesium chloride sulphate carbonate and bicarbonate were determined by following procedure as laid down by american public health association apha 2005 sodium adsorption ratio sar of the water samples were estimated according to the generic equation 4 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 residual sodium carbonate rsc was computed using equation r s c c o 3 2 h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 richards 1954 the toxic elements of iron zinc manganese arsenic lead chromium cobalt mercury and nickel in water samples were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms make agilent 7700 series fluoride in water samples was determined by fluoride ion selective electrode fise as described by jha et al 2015 total dissolved solids tds were determined by taking known volume of water sample and drying in oven at 105 c an ion selective electrode ise was used to measure the nitrate no3 concentration in the water sample apha 2005 ammonical nitrogen nh4 n was measured by kjeldhal method saez plaza et al 2013 and phosphate was analyzed by spectrophotometry method johanna 1995 2 7 most probable number mpn per 100 ml test for coliform the coliform group includes both aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram negative bacteria which ferment lactose with gas formation within 48 h at 37 c the number of the coliform groups was estimated by the multiple tube dilution test as per the indian standards method bis 2003 which includes series of presumptive test confirmed test and completed test 2 8 characterization of surface and groundwater graphical method 2 8 1 piper trilinear diagram several graphical methods zaporozac 1972 guler et al 2002 have been used for visualization and classification of hydro geochemical data in which the most widely accepted is piper trilinear diagram piper 1944 used to infer hydro geochemical facie the diagram has been widely used to study the similarities and differences in the composition of waters and to classify them into certain chemical type an attempt was made in the present study to characterize the hydro geochemical data using rockware aq qa version 1 1 1 and by knowing the hydro chemical facies of water generally known as water type using piper diagram 2 9 statistical analysis the data was analyzed for mean and standard deviation the pair t test was used at 5 level of significance for testing the mean effect of elements present in floodwater and gw during prp and porp 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of mar system on recharge rate volume and groundwater level the initial recharge rates were observed to be 997 2499 and 1978 m3 day 1 during 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively which reduced to 72 5 88 4 and 95 7 in the corresponding years fig 5 with maximum total recharge volume 72426 m3 during 2017 reduction in the recharge rates was mainly due to the entry of silt 1254 kg in rws and clogging of recharge wells clogging is the major constraint for aquifer storage and recovery asr as well as in failure of artificial recharge systems jeong et al 2018 the decline in the recharge rate with respect to time was also due to decrease in storage capacity of aquifer and gravity head difference between pond water and gw level hollander et al 2009 this study corroborates the results of earlier researcher bhattacharya 2010 where the injection rate decreased to 92 due to clogging tuinhof and heederik 2003 also reported a decline in the recharge rate capacity from 2 4 to 0 116 m day 1 53 5 decline the pre compressor cleaning of the rws in 2017 enhanced the initial rate of recharge and total recharge volume while it reduced in 2018 during porp because of non cleaning of the rws this suggested that cleaning of rw is helpful in the increasing the gw recharge and subsequently rise of gw table the gw table analysis prior to 2018 recharge also depicted maximum rise of 66 7 compare to 2016 and 2017 a steady rise in gw levels during the recharge season and falling gradually during the dry season indicated the extensive gw extraction for irrigation in the project area in the present study it was also observed that pond played a significant role in minimizing clogging of rws by retaining maximum of the total silt load 68 01 while as only 7 0 of the total silt load was deposited in rws fig 6 3 2 water quality parameters 3 2 1 chemistry of floodwater chemistry of the floodwater is the determining factor in the assessment of gw quality in the present study the ph of floodwater flowing through canal was found alkaline in nature which varied from 7 69 to 8 40 and electrical conductivity ec was in the range of 0 51 0 62 ds m 1 in water mg2 4 5 meq l 1 and ca2 2 0 meq l 1 was dominant while na and k concentrations were relatively low table 1 the dominance of anion concentration followed the order hco3 cl so4 2 co3 2 the periodical characterization revealed the water to be mg hco3 type however water quality characteristics of floodwater depend upon its origin interaction with rocks and minerals dissolution in its route and anthropogenic sources of contaminations mohapatra et al 2011 singh et al 2011 belkhiria et al 2012 sodium adsorption ratio sar and residual sodium carbonate rsc in the water was within the acceptable limit as per guideline for quality of irrigation water bis 2001 suggesting the water to be good quality for irrigation use further total dissolved solid tds which is one of the important parameters in water quality assessment and helps in dissolution and transport of the ions was also within the permissible limit 1000 mgl 1 as prescribed by who 1996 for drinking water that varied between 302 and 463 mgl 1 this was also in line with the earlier findings singh 2018 who reported tds between 280 and 685 mgl 1 in the ramganga river bureau of indian standards bis 2012 had also recommended the acceptable limit of tds as 500 mgl 1 in drinking water 3 3 hydro chemical and biological evaluation of groundwater the descriptive study of the gw piezometers and recharge wells revealed a wide variation in ph ranging from 6 74 to 8 43 with a mean of 7 61 the water was dominated with bicarbonates and magnesium ions having dominance order of hco3 cl so4 co3 anions and mg ca na k cations table 2 the result was in agreement with the findings of earlier research jha et al 2015 where the gw was characterized as bicarbonate type in ganga river basin the negative rsc value found in water indicated that sodium buildup is unlikely due to sufficient ca2 and mg2 ions being precipitated as carbonate with no na hazards and classified as fit for irrigation this was found to be in agreement with the earlier findings naseem et al 2010 tathy et al 2011 omotoso and ojo 2012 the sar is also an index of sodium hazards in water which was very low and varied from 0 34 to 1 01 the prescribed limit for sar in irrigation water is 10 mmole1 2l 1 2 bis 2001 the tds were found maximum in the piezometers p5 and p7 and varied between 576 mg l 1 to 630 mg l 1 during prp while the maximum tds of floodwater was 463 mg l 1 only in this period fig 7 in drp and porp the tds was low 288 462 mgl 1 in all the piezometers due to dilution effect by injecting floodwater 72 426 5 m3 the similar trend was observed in rw1 and rw2 the tds exceeded the desirable limit of 500 mgl 1 as laid down by world health organisation who 2008 and bureau of indian standards bis 2012 in most of the samples during pre recharge period while it was acceptable in drp and porp the evolution of hydro chemical parameters of gw can also be understood by plotting the concentration of major cations and anions in the piper diagram which gives the similarities and differences in the composition of waters besides classifying them into certain chemical types jha et al 2013 in the piper diagram major ions are plotted in the two base triangles as major cation ca2 mg2 na k and major anion cl so42 co3 2 hco3 in milli equivalent percentages and the overall information from the two triangles are combined together on a quadrilateral the diagram fig 8 showed that most of the water samples analyzed in prp fall in the field of mg hco3 which is dominant followed by mixed types of ca hco3 and ca mg cl types during porp 87 of the water samples dominated by mg hco3 type and 13 constituted both of ca hco3 and mg cl type the fecal coliform test mpn per 100 ml revealed the coliform contamination in 88 23 of the water samples which varied from its absence to 1600 counts with a mean of 507 8 mpn per 100 ml the fecal pollution in gw of the project area is not surprising as similar observations have been reported ghosh 1995 harikumar and chandran 2013 sorensen et al 2016 from indian states and the causes ascribed to the lack of sanitary interventions in rural villages 3 4 geochemical process evaluation the geochemical variations in the ionic composition of gw was studied by plotting scatter diagrams on x y coordinate guler et al 2002 in order to identify the prevailing mechanism and hydro geochemical processes the mineral weathering carbonate and silicate known to contribute to the gw chemistry and it happens when 1 1 ratio between total cation and alkalinity is maintained fig 9 in the present study the sample points are close to the 1 1 equiline indicating dissolution of minerals as an important geochemical process hem 1985 in order to predict whether carbonate or silicate weathering is the dominant process a scatter diagram of ca mg versus hco3 so4 was drawn for prp drp and porp carbonate weathering was the dominant hydro geochemical processes fig 10a as most of the points lie above the 1 1 equiline which was in agreement with jha and mishra 2016 whereas in drp the points falling along the equiline suggested that these ions have resulted from the weathering of both carbonates and silicate minerals during porp the mixing process might have resulted in the dissolution of some silicate minerals the na k versus total cations tz fig 10b also indicated carbonate weathering during pre recharge and recharge period on the other hand in porp both silicate and carbonate weathering were prevalent the silicate weathering is indicated with the points lying below the equiline of na k vs tz scatter plot the cation exchange reactions are also important geochemical reaction which controls the distribution and occurrence of ions in gw senthilkumar and elango 2013 the plot for ca mg versus so4 hco3 is also a major indicator to identify ion exchange process activated in the study area if ion exchange is the process then the points shift to right side of plot due to excess so4 hco3 cerling et al 1989 fisher and mulican 1997 if reverse ion exchange is the process points shift towards left due to excess ca mg during pre recharge and recharge period the dominant exchange process was reverse ion exchange whereas during porp both ion exchange and reverse ion exchange process occurred the ion exchange process may be due to the excess bicarbonates cation exchange process can also be identified using a relationship between the na and cl ions high concentration of na with respect to cl or depletion of na with respect to cl is the evidence of cation exchange reactions rajmohan and elango 2004 in the normal ion exchange reaction ca is retained in the aquifer material and na is released to water the prevalence of na in water may be due to cation exchange process and agricultural and industrial inputs guo and wang 2004 the excess na generated by ion exchange reaction is not balanced by cl but by alkalinity or so4 similarly in the reverse ion exchange na is retained by aquifer materials and ca is released to water in this case excess cl over na in drp and prp fig 10c was balanced by ca and mg hence excess cl over na is a good indication for ion exchange reactions during porp however almost equal na and cl in water indicated occurrence of silicate weathering and release of na ion in order to balance excess cl ion these results corroborated with earlier findings sarin et al 1989 singh and hasnain 1999 where na ion was released during silicate weathering 3 5 toxic elements and other contamination in flood and groundwater floods may play a crucial role in mobilization of potentially toxic elements from the upper reach deposits and exceeds environmental quality standards posing ecotoxic risks to gw the iron fe concentration in gw in prp and porp was found to be similar which implied that use of floodwater for recharging had no significant impact on the iron concentration in gw in prp its mean concentration was 228 04 µg l 1 whereas in porp its concentration was 229 10 µg l 1 table 3 the fe concentration is gw was found to be within the permissible limit in all samples as specified by bis 2012 however kumar et al 2017 had reported higher fe concentration of 3820 µg l 1 in gw samples and 6294 µg l 1 in surface water samples in ramganga basin might be due to both anthropogenic and geogenic contaminations rajmohan and amarasinghe 2016 the mean value of zinc zn concentrations in prp was found to be 28 14 µg l 1whereas in porp the value decreased to 11 45 µg l 1 it was within the permissible limit as laid down by bis 2012 the concentration of zn was lower than the value earlier reported tiwari et al 2016 in the rampur area which ranged between 66 and 114 µg l 1 the mn concentration in the floodwater was 30 8 µg l 1 but its concentration in the gw in prp and porp were 15 40 µg l 1 and 17 63 µg l 1 respectively which was within the permissible limit of 100 µg l 1 decreased concentration of mn with respect to floodwater may probably be due to the preferential adsorption of mn with the silt or clay which is in agreement with the finding of rybicka 1983 who found 80 98 of zn and mn adsorption on clay the arsenic as concentrations in floodwater was significantly higher than both prp and porp which was statistically identical but exceeded the permissible limit of 10 µg l 1 as laid down by world health organisation who 2008 table 3 however it was within the acceptable limit prescribed by bis 2012 arsenic contamination might be due to the discharge of the industrial effluents into the river pilakhar a tributary of the ramganga cpcb 2007 msme 2017 which was the source of floodwater in the pilakhar canal saba and umar 2016 reported a higher value of as than the permissible limits in moradabad area which comes under ramganga sub basin the presence of significant concentration of toxic elements has also been reported sharma et al 2003 in the sediments of ramganga basin due to increasing industrialization and urbanization the contamination of as in the gw has its geogenic origin too besides anthropogenic sources as evidenced by the earlier findings yasunori et al 2012 jha et al 2017 that river basin of the ganga brahmaputra and meghna are the worst affected in india and bangladesh the lead pb concentration during pre recharge period in gw was 2 80 µg l 1 which was within the permissible limit the chromium cr cobalt co and nickel ni were also present within the permissible limit in floodwater prp and porp stages maximum concentration of 860 µg l 1 cr has been reported by rajmohan et al 2017 in the gw of ramganga sub basin mercury hg in the flood and gw during prp was 3 84 and 1 88 µg l 1 respectively which decreased to 1 12 µg l 1 during porp and was within the permissible limit of 6 µg l 1 who 2008 in the ganga river too which is distributary of ramganga the hg was found to be 1 9 µg l 1 sinha and loganathan 2015 the fluoride f concentration in the floodwater in prp and porp were 410 µg l 1 309 63 µg l 1 and 277 04 µg l 1 respectively which was within the permissible limit of 1000 µg l 1 bis 2012 and µg l 1 who 2008 the nitrate no3 and ammonical nitrogen nh4 n concentration in the floodwater was found within the prescribed limit of who 2008 the phosphate po4 concentration in floodwater was 60 µg l 1 in the ganga river system at haridwar uttrakhand the phosphate concentration was found in the range of 50 80 µg l 1 bhutiani et al 2016 in our study the toxic element analysis in the farmers tube well ftw waters located at up and down stream revealed higher as 16 2 32 5 µg l 1 and pb 13 6 15 7 µg l 1 concentration than the acceptable limit prescribed by the world health organisation who 2008 shown in fig 11 this suggested that there is prevalence of high toxic element concentrations in the gw of the area and the intervention of modified version of mar helped in reducing toxicological exposure by diluting the concentration of the contaminants in gw the earlier researchers debernardi et al 2005 farooq et al 2011 nishikiori et al 2012 lasagna et al 2013 also reported that dilution is playing a determining role in lowering the contaminants in different parts of the world 4 conclusion the modified version of mar known as utfi through a cluster of rws embedded in community pond utilizing diverted floodwater is identified as a potential approach of recharging gw with maximum recharge rate of 2499 m3 day 1 the approach helped in minimization of clogging of rws by retaining maximum silt load of 68 01 in the pond a significant volume of recharge water made the gw table to rise and improved gw quality by dilution effect the tds fluoride iron zinc manganese chromium cobalt nickel mercury phosphate nitrate and ammonical nitrogen were found within the permissible limits as laid down by world health organization the existence of as and pb contaminations above the permissible limits in the farmers tube wells located both at upstream and down streams of the recharge site revealed an inherent toxic elements problem in the area further the presence of coliform in the 88 23 of sampled gw may cause a concern for direct use for drinking however the sar and rsc values indicated the water to be fit for irrigation purpose looking at the benefits of the approach as a proactive gw quality improvement with capable aquifer recharge it is recommended for scaling up of the intervention across the gw stressed parts of the whole ram ganga basin and similar hydro geological regions elsewhere declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement we acknowledge international water management institute iwmi colombo sri lanka for generous funding

10220,groundwater gw depletion and recurring floods have become a major concern among researchers and planners across the world to rejuvenate stressed aquifer and moderate flood impacts a modified version of managed aquifer recharge mar consisting of a cluster of ten recharge wells rws embedded in a community pond with an area of 2625 m2 and utilizing diverted floodwater was tested on a pilot scale in ramganga sub basin india the approach could recharge a maximum of 72426 m3 of floodwater in 78 days during the wet season the pond intervention minimized clogging of rws by retaining maximum silt load of 68 01 hydro geochemically majority of water samples were of mg hco3 and ca hco3type ion exchange processes and weathering of carbonate and silicates were the controlling factors determining water quality of the area total dissolved solids fluoride iron zinc manganese chromium cobalt nickel mercury phosphate nitrate and ammonical nitrogen were found within the permissible limits as laid down by world health organization except arsenic and lead which seems to be the inherent problem in the area as evidenced by water quality analysis of farmers tube wells located upstream and down streams of the recharge site the coliform presence in the 88 23 of sampled gw may thwart from direct use for drinking whereas it was fit for irrigation looking the benefits of modified mar as a proactive gw quality improvement with good aquifer recharge it is recommended for scaling up of the intervention across the gw stressed parts of the whole ram ganga basin and similar hydro geological regions elsewhere keywords groundwater recharge groundwater quality managed aquifer recharge toxic elements floodwater 1 introduction climate change is likely to impact rainfall patterns leading to higher uncertainty and difficulties in the management of both drought and flood events bhaskar et al 2014 food and agricultural organization fao 2015 estimated loss of about 80 billion us dollar due to decline in crop and livestock production in 67 countries caused by climatic disaster like floods drought etc during 2003 2013 such disasters may also affect the quality and quantity of surface as well as gw across the globe by the end of 21st century jimenez cisneros et al 2014 in estimation around 1 2 billion people or almost one fifth of the world s population live in areas of physical scarcity of water and 500 million people are approaching this situation undp 2006 konikow and kendy 2005 has reported that the gw depleted excessively across the globe which included major regions of north africa the middle east south and central asia north china north america and australia in india out of 6607 gw assessment units about 1071 units were over exploited mowr 2015 increase in gw exploitation in india was also projected from 710 billion cubic meter bcm in the year 2010 1180 bcm by 2050 cwc 2014 to meet domestic industrial and irrigation needs of burgeoning population to overcome the problem of declining gw table managed aquifer recharge mar utilizing the vast storage and buffering capacity of aquifer bouwer 2002 dillon et al 2006 du et al 2009 morin et al 2009 presents a good potential but the major obstacle in mar across the globe is clogging and or siltation due to the suspended solids present in recharge water resulting in continuous decline of recharge rates and ultimately failure of the system thus a modified version of recharge technique constituting a cluster of mar structures in a pond was designed with a novel concept to minimize mar clogging by reducing recharge stream velocity through pond storage it targeted excess wet season runoff that posed flood risk downstream to recharge gw for irrigation hence a terminology underground transfer of floods for irrigation utfi was coined for this specific technique of mar pavelic et al 2012 origin of the utfi approach emerged as a spin off from a pilot scale mar trial conducted in a sub basin of the chao phraya river basin thailand where 28 of the wet season discharges from the basin 3370 mcm yr 1 were harvested to refill the vast alluvial aquifers in the central plains these were extensively utilized for irrigation of rice and sugarcane pavelic et al 2012 however the major concern in mar approach is the water quality of source water which is not evaluated properly introduction of chemical lee and lee 1995 and biological megha et al 2015 contaminants into the aquifer can adversely impact the longevity of a recharge project the gw contaminations with cadmium arsenic cobalt chromium copper mercury nickel lead tin and zinc has been reported dwivedi and vankar 2014 in ganga basin of uttar pradesh india and the cause ascribed to industrial sources a significant concentration of metals and metalloids salinity nitrate and fluoride has been reported sharma et al 2003 rajmohan and amarasinghe 2016 in the sediments of ramganga basin which is increasing attributed for exponentially with time globally the agricultural activities involving the use of agrochemicals was the major cause of nitrate contamination in gw babiker et al 2004 chowdary et al 2005 wick et al 2012 bhutiani et al 2016 as per central ground water board cgwb 2009 artificial recharge had been very effective in diluting the concentration of fluoride an earlier research cssri 2016 also showed a significant decrease in fluoride content in gw from 2 43 mg l 1 to 0 823 mg l 1 due to dilution effect when recharged with rain water therefore it was hypothesized that the utfi intervention may help not only in recharging the stressed aquifers but also act as a mitigation approach for gw pollution from various contaminants if any by diluting the inherent geo genic or anthropogenic however the success of artificial gw recharge is dependent on the minimum contamination loads of the source of water therefore water quality is the principle area of concern in development of mar for its multi purpose use guidelines framed by world health organization who 2008 for drinking and irrigation water bis 2001 needs serious consideration to achieve this objective an study was carried out to assess the influence of floodwater composition on the hydrogeological chemistry and gw quality under piloting and testing of utfi in ramganga sub basin ganges basin to establish the possibility for wider implementation across similar hydro geological conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 description of study area district rampur lies over alluvial deposits of the quaternary period brought by river systems of ganga and ram ganga the various geomorphic units described under the districts are tarai tract with shallow water table condition meander flood plains younger alluvial plains older alluvial plains and ravenous tract fig 1 our study area lies in the older alluvial flood plains which covers 80 of the district the soil is fine textured and rich in organic matter in the area there are four aquifers present down to 440 m below ground level the depth of the first aquifer extends down to 60 90 m depth which is being used mostly for irrigation purpose many private tube wells were drilled and used for irrigation needs paddy sugarcane and wheat are the main crops of the region the gw is under risk due to its over abstraction resulting in the drastic drop of water table 10 17 cm year 1 in the area the depth of gw table varied between 4 and 8 m during june to september and 8 12 m during october to may tripathi 2009 the present study on mar was implemented at jiwai jadid village 28 783517 n 79 201536 e in rampur district uttar pradesh india under ramganga sub basin ganges basin during 2016 2018 fig 2 which is formed by alluvial sediments temperature in this region varies from 43 c to 30 c during summer and 25 c to 5 c in winter season with average annual rainfall of about 990 mm occurring during southwest monsoon period flash flood is the common feature of the region which had affected nearly 207 villages in year 2015 dfpr 2015 the population is largely agrarian topography is more or less flat with elevation of about 189 m in the east to 185 m in the west the ephemeral pilakhar river which is a tributary of the ramganga flowing to the western side of the village is a major source of irrigation water through pilakhar canal total discharge in the canal is about 350 400 cusecs in a year the floodwater of pilakhar river flowing into canal was used for gw recharge during wet season in this study 2 2 survey and designing of mar structure the mar structures were constructed in village community pond fig 3 located adjoining to the pilakhar canal during survey and analysis the soil was found to be clayey in nature up to about 3 4 m depth from the bottom of the pond with poor infiltration rate dimension of the pond was 75 m 35 m which was excavated up to a depth of 2 m ten recharge wells rw were established in the pond out of which five had filter diameter of 3 m and other five with 1 5 m diameter each recharge well consisted of a pvc pipe 150 mm dia surrounded by pea gravel filter filled in a brick masonry built around them the height of these structures from the bottom of the pond was 1 m depths of recharge wells of 3 m and 1 5 m diameter filter chambers were 30 m and 24 m respectively fig 4 shows the detailed design depicting plan and sectional view of the recharge structure during the monsoon months july to september the recharge was carried out by siphoning floodwater into the pond from pilakhar minor canal after passing through a de silting chamber dead storage was 1 m was maintained in pond during the recharge period a total of nine piezometers p1 p2 p9 with 30 m depth were also installed along the direction of gw flow from north to south to monitor gw levels and sampling for water quality the p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 and p7 were within 50 m reach of recharge site whereas p8 and p9 were placed at 600 m and 900 m respectively the visual modflow v 4 6 groundwater model was used to identify flow direction 2 3 recharge rate measurement of the whole system the pond of irregular shape was divided into different uniform elemental segment the points on sloped embankment were marked against incremental pond depth the volume of each element was calculated for given depth of pond and summed up for estimating total volume of water in pond at that particular depth similarly for another incremental pond depth incremental surface area and associated volume of the pond was estimated a regression analysis between estimated volumes and pond depths was used to develop a functional relationship as given below 1 v h t 1164 8333 h t 133 6666 h t 2 where vht volume of water present in

recharge m3 2 4 monitoring and sampling activities pilot operations were conducted over three years from 2016 to 18 but the detailed water quality analysis was conducted in 2017 in order to understand the cumulative effect of the recharge on water quality the water samples were collected from two recharge wells rw1 3 m diameter and rw2 1 5 m diameter and nine piezometers during pre recharge period prp january april and june 2017 during recharge period drp july august and september 2017 and post recharge period porp october november and december 2017 the floodwater quality during recharge was also monitored periodically to assess the water quality of the area water samples were also collected from the farmers tube wells used for irrigating crops which were situated about 500 m upstream and downstream of the recharge site 2 5 silt load assessment the pea gravels were taken out from filter and about a kg of samples in triplicate was collected from the bulk it was manually cleaned with fresh water the suspended silt and washed gravels were oven dried separately and weighed for computing total average silt load deposition in filter the density of the pea gravel was estimated as 1600 kg m 3 for measuring silt load in pond 1 m2 size polythene sheets were placed at the bottom of the pond at 15 sites before start of recharge after recharge completion and drying of the pond the deposited silt on each polythene sheet was collected in the month of april oven dried and average weight of silt deposited was recorded the total silt load of pond was calculated by multiplying its average weight with area of pond s bottom 1950 m2 in order to assess the silt deposited in rw after first recharge in 2016 its depth was measured and subtracted from the actual depth for computing total silt weight the recharge wells were cleaned by employing air compressor before second recharge season in 2017 2 6 chemical analysis of water the ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined potentiometrically using ph and ec electrodes with orion ion analyzer sodium potassium calcium magnesium chloride sulphate carbonate and bicarbonate were determined by following procedure as laid down by american public health association apha 2005 sodium adsorption ratio sar of the water samples were estimated according to the generic equation 4 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 residual sodium carbonate rsc was computed using equation r s c c o 3 2 h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 richards 1954 the toxic elements of iron zinc manganese arsenic lead chromium cobalt mercury and nickel in water samples were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms make agilent 7700 series fluoride in water samples was determined by fluoride ion selective electrode fise as described by jha et al 2015 total dissolved solids tds were determined by taking known volume of water sample and drying in oven at 105 c an ion selective electrode ise was used to measure the nitrate no3 concentration in the water sample apha 2005 ammonical nitrogen nh4 n was measured by kjeldhal method saez plaza et al 2013 and phosphate was analyzed by spectrophotometry method johanna 1995 2 7 most probable number mpn per 100 ml test for coliform the coliform group includes both aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram negative bacteria which ferment lactose with gas formation within 48 h at 37 c the number of the coliform groups was estimated by the multiple tube dilution test as per the indian standards method bis 2003 which includes series of presumptive test confirmed test and completed test 2 8 characterization of surface and groundwater graphical method 2 8 1 piper trilinear diagram several graphical methods zaporozac 1972 guler et al 2002 have been used for visualization and classification of hydro geochemical data in which the most widely accepted is piper trilinear diagram piper 1944 used to infer hydro geochemical facie the diagram has been widely used to study the similarities and differences in the composition of waters and to classify them into certain chemical type an attempt was made in the present study to characterize the hydro geochemical data using rockware aq qa version 1 1 1 and by knowing the hydro chemical facies of water generally known as water type using piper diagram 2 9 statistical analysis the data was analyzed for mean and standard deviation the pair t test was used at 5 level of significance for testing the mean effect of elements present in floodwater and gw during prp and porp 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of mar system on recharge rate volume and groundwater level the initial recharge rates were observed to be 997 2499 and 1978 m3 day 1 during 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively which reduced to 72 5 88 4 and 95 7 in the corresponding years fig 5 with maximum total recharge volume 72426 m3 during 2017 reduction in the recharge rates was mainly due to the entry of silt 1254 kg in rws and clogging of recharge wells clogging is the major constraint for aquifer storage and recovery asr as well as in failure of artificial recharge systems jeong et al 2018 the decline in the recharge rate with respect to time was also due to decrease in storage capacity of aquifer and gravity head difference between pond water and gw level hollander et al 2009 this study corroborates the results of earlier researcher bhattacharya 2010 where the injection rate decreased to 92 due to clogging tuinhof and heederik 2003 also reported a decline in the recharge rate capacity from 2 4 to 0 116 m day 1 53 5 decline the pre compressor cleaning of the rws in 2017 enhanced the initial rate of recharge and total recharge volume while it reduced in 2018 during porp because of non cleaning of the rws this suggested that cleaning of rw is helpful in the increasing the gw recharge and subsequently rise of gw table the gw table analysis prior to 2018 recharge also depicted maximum rise of 66 7 compare to 2016 and 2017 a steady rise in gw levels during the recharge season and falling gradually during the dry season indicated the extensive gw extraction for irrigation in the project area in the present study it was also observed that pond played a significant role in minimizing clogging of rws by retaining maximum of the total silt load 68 01 while as only 7 0 of the total silt load was deposited in rws fig 6 3 2 water quality parameters 3 2 1 chemistry of floodwater chemistry of the floodwater is the determining factor in the assessment of gw quality in the present study the ph of floodwater flowing through canal was found alkaline in nature which varied from 7 69 to 8 40 and electrical conductivity ec was in the range of 0 51 0 62 ds m 1 in water mg2 4 5 meq l 1 and ca2 2 0 meq l 1 was dominant while na and k concentrations were relatively low table 1 the dominance of anion concentration followed the order hco3 cl so4 2 co3 2 the periodical characterization revealed the water to be mg hco3 type however water quality characteristics of floodwater depend upon its origin interaction with rocks and minerals dissolution in its route and anthropogenic sources of contaminations mohapatra et al 2011 singh et al 2011 belkhiria et al 2012 sodium adsorption ratio sar and residual sodium carbonate rsc in the water was within the acceptable limit as per guideline for quality of irrigation water bis 2001 suggesting the water to be good quality for irrigation use further total dissolved solid tds which is one of the important parameters in water quality assessment and helps in dissolution and transport of the ions was also within the permissible limit 1000 mgl 1 as prescribed by who 1996 for drinking water that varied between 302 and 463 mgl 1 this was also in line with the earlier findings singh 2018 who reported tds between 280 and 685 mgl 1 in the ramganga river bureau of indian standards bis 2012 had also recommended the acceptable limit of tds as 500 mgl 1 in drinking water 3 3 hydro chemical and biological evaluation of groundwater the descriptive study of the gw piezometers and recharge wells revealed a wide variation in ph ranging from 6 74 to 8 43 with a mean of 7 61 the water was dominated with bicarbonates and magnesium ions having dominance order of hco3 cl so4 co3 anions and mg ca na k cations table 2 the result was in agreement with the findings of earlier research jha et al 2015 where the gw was characterized as bicarbonate type in ganga river basin the negative rsc value found in water indicated that sodium buildup is unlikely due to sufficient ca2 and mg2 ions being precipitated as carbonate with no na hazards and classified as fit for irrigation this was found to be in agreement with the earlier findings naseem et al 2010 tathy et al 2011 omotoso and ojo 2012 the sar is also an index of sodium hazards in water which was very low and varied from 0 34 to 1 01 the prescribed limit for sar in irrigation water is 10 mmole1 2l 1 2 bis 2001 the tds were found maximum in the piezometers p5 and p7 and varied between 576 mg l 1 to 630 mg l 1 during prp while the maximum tds of floodwater was 463 mg l 1 only in this period fig 7 in drp and porp the tds was low 288 462 mgl 1 in all the piezometers due to dilution effect by injecting floodwater 72 426 5 m3 the similar trend was observed in rw1 and rw2 the tds exceeded the desirable limit of 500 mgl 1 as laid down by world health organisation who 2008 and bureau of indian standards bis 2012 in most of the samples during pre recharge period while it was acceptable in drp and porp the evolution of hydro chemical parameters of gw can also be understood by plotting the concentration of major cations and anions in the piper diagram which gives the similarities and differences in the composition of waters besides classifying them into certain chemical types jha et al 2013 in the piper diagram major ions are plotted in the two base triangles as major cation ca2 mg2 na k and major anion cl so42 co3 2 hco3 in milli equivalent percentages and the overall information from the two triangles are combined together on a quadrilateral the diagram fig 8 showed that most of the water samples analyzed in prp fall in the field of mg hco3 which is dominant followed by mixed types of ca hco3 and ca mg cl types during porp 87 of the water samples dominated by mg hco3 type and 13 constituted both of ca hco3 and mg cl type the fecal coliform test mpn per 100 ml revealed the coliform contamination in 88 23 of the water samples which varied from its absence to 1600 counts with a mean of 507 8 mpn per 100 ml the fecal pollution in gw of the project area is not surprising as similar observations have been reported ghosh 1995 harikumar and chandran 2013 sorensen et al 2016 from indian states and the causes ascribed to the lack of sanitary interventions in rural villages 3 4 geochemical process evaluation the geochemical variations in the ionic composition of gw was studied by plotting scatter diagrams on x y coordinate guler et al 2002 in order to identify the prevailing mechanism and hydro geochemical processes the mineral weathering carbonate and silicate known to contribute to the gw chemistry and it happens when 1 1 ratio between total cation and alkalinity is maintained fig 9 in the present study the sample points are close to the 1 1 equiline indicating dissolution of minerals as an important geochemical process hem 1985 in order to predict whether carbonate or silicate weathering is the dominant process a scatter diagram of ca mg versus hco3 so4 was drawn for prp drp and porp carbonate weathering was the dominant hydro geochemical processes fig 10a as most of the points lie above the 1 1 equiline which was in agreement with jha and mishra 2016 whereas in drp the points falling along the equiline suggested that these ions have resulted from the weathering of both carbonates and silicate minerals during porp the mixing process might have resulted in the dissolution of some silicate minerals the na k versus total cations tz fig 10b also indicated carbonate weathering during pre recharge and recharge period on the other hand in porp both silicate and carbonate weathering were prevalent the silicate weathering is indicated with the points lying below the equiline of na k vs tz scatter plot the cation exchange reactions are also important geochemical reaction which controls the distribution and occurrence of ions in gw senthilkumar and elango 2013 the plot for ca mg versus so4 hco3 is also a major indicator to identify ion exchange process activated in the study area if ion exchange is the process then the points shift to right side of plot due to excess so4 hco3 cerling et al 1989 fisher and mulican 1997 if reverse ion exchange is the process points shift towards left due to excess ca mg during pre recharge and recharge period the dominant exchange process was reverse ion exchange whereas during porp both ion exchange and reverse ion exchange process occurred the ion exchange process may be due to the excess bicarbonates cation exchange process can also be identified using a relationship between the na and cl ions high concentration of na with respect to cl or depletion of na with respect to cl is the evidence of cation exchange reactions rajmohan and elango 2004 in the normal ion exchange reaction ca is retained in the aquifer material and na is released to water the prevalence of na in water may be due to cation exchange process and agricultural and industrial inputs guo and wang 2004 the excess na generated by ion exchange reaction is not balanced by cl but by alkalinity or so4 similarly in the reverse ion exchange na is retained by aquifer materials and ca is released to water in this case excess cl over na in drp and prp fig 10c was balanced by ca and mg hence excess cl over na is a good indication for ion exchange reactions during porp however almost equal na and cl in water indicated occurrence of silicate weathering and release of na ion in order to balance excess cl ion these results corroborated with earlier findings sarin et al 1989 singh and hasnain 1999 where na ion was released during silicate weathering 3 5 toxic elements and other contamination in flood and groundwater floods may play a crucial role in mobilization of potentially toxic elements from the upper reach deposits and exceeds environmental quality standards posing ecotoxic risks to gw the iron fe concentration in gw in prp and porp was found to be similar which implied that use of floodwater for recharging had no significant impact on the iron concentration in gw in prp its mean concentration was 228 04 µg l 1 whereas in porp its concentration was 229 10 µg l 1 table 3 the fe concentration is gw was found to be within the permissible limit in all samples as specified by bis 2012 however kumar et al 2017 had reported higher fe concentration of 3820 µg l 1 in gw samples and 6294 µg l 1 in surface water samples in ramganga basin might be due to both anthropogenic and geogenic contaminations rajmohan and amarasinghe 2016 the mean value of zinc zn concentrations in prp was found to be 28 14 µg l 1whereas in porp the value decreased to 11 45 µg l 1 it was within the permissible limit as laid down by bis 2012 the concentration of zn was lower than the value earlier reported tiwari et al 2016 in the rampur area which ranged between 66 and 114 µg l 1 the mn concentration in the floodwater was 30 8 µg l 1 but its concentration in the gw in prp and porp were 15 40 µg l 1 and 17 63 µg l 1 respectively which was within the permissible limit of 100 µg l 1 decreased concentration of mn with respect to floodwater may probably be due to the preferential adsorption of mn with the silt or clay which is in agreement with the finding of rybicka 1983 who found 80 98 of zn and mn adsorption on clay the arsenic as concentrations in floodwater was significantly higher than both prp and porp which was statistically identical but exceeded the permissible limit of 10 µg l 1 as laid down by world health organisation who 2008 table 3 however it was within the acceptable limit prescribed by bis 2012 arsenic contamination might be due to the discharge of the industrial effluents into the river pilakhar a tributary of the ramganga cpcb 2007 msme 2017 which was the source of floodwater in the pilakhar canal saba and umar 2016 reported a higher value of as than the permissible limits in moradabad area which comes under ramganga sub basin the presence of significant concentration of toxic elements has also been reported sharma et al 2003 in the sediments of ramganga basin due to increasing industrialization and urbanization the contamination of as in the gw has its geogenic origin too besides anthropogenic sources as evidenced by the earlier findings yasunori et al 2012 jha et al 2017 that river basin of the ganga brahmaputra and meghna are the worst affected in india and bangladesh the lead pb concentration during pre recharge period in gw was 2 80 µg l 1 which was within the permissible limit the chromium cr cobalt co and nickel ni were also present within the permissible limit in floodwater prp and porp stages maximum concentration of 860 µg l 1 cr has been reported by rajmohan et al 2017 in the gw of ramganga sub basin mercury hg in the flood and gw during prp was 3 84 and 1 88 µg l 1 respectively which decreased to 1 12 µg l 1 during porp and was within the permissible limit of 6 µg l 1 who 2008 in the ganga river too which is distributary of ramganga the hg was found to be 1 9 µg l 1 sinha and loganathan 2015 the fluoride f concentration in the floodwater in prp and porp were 410 µg l 1 309 63 µg l 1 and 277 04 µg l 1 respectively which was within the permissible limit of 1000 µg l 1 bis 2012 and µg l 1 who 2008 the nitrate no3 and ammonical nitrogen nh4 n concentration in the floodwater was found within the prescribed limit of who 2008 the phosphate po4 concentration in floodwater was 60 µg l 1 in the ganga river system at haridwar uttrakhand the phosphate concentration was found in the range of 50 80 µg l 1 bhutiani et al 2016 in our study the toxic element analysis in the farmers tube well ftw waters located at up and down stream revealed higher as 16 2 32 5 µg l 1 and pb 13 6 15 7 µg l 1 concentration than the acceptable limit prescribed by the world health organisation who 2008 shown in fig 11 this suggested that there is prevalence of high toxic element concentrations in the gw of the area and the intervention of modified version of mar helped in reducing toxicological exposure by diluting the concentration of the contaminants in gw the earlier researchers debernardi et al 2005 farooq et al 2011 nishikiori et al 2012 lasagna et al 2013 also reported that dilution is playing a determining role in lowering the contaminants in different parts of the world 4 conclusion the modified version of mar known as utfi through a cluster of rws embedded in community pond utilizing diverted floodwater is identified as a potential approach of recharging gw with maximum recharge rate of 2499 m3 day 1 the approach helped in minimization of clogging of rws by retaining maximum silt load of 68 01 in the pond a significant volume of recharge water made the gw table to rise and improved gw quality by dilution effect the tds fluoride iron zinc manganese chromium cobalt nickel mercury phosphate nitrate and ammonical nitrogen were found within the permissible limits as laid down by world health organization the existence of as and pb contaminations above the permissible limits in the farmers tube wells located both at upstream and down streams of the recharge site revealed an inherent toxic elements problem in the area further the presence of coliform in the 88 23 of sampled gw may cause a concern for direct use for drinking however the sar and rsc values indicated the water to be fit for irrigation purpose looking at the benefits of the approach as a proactive gw quality improvement with capable aquifer recharge it is recommended for scaling up of the intervention across the gw stressed parts of the whole ram ganga basin and similar hydro geological regions elsewhere declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

kansas 1 introduction irrigation water pumping that exceeded the recharge over the past decades has decreased water levels of ogallala aquifer mcguire 2012 in the central great plains and western kansas the decrease in groundwater levels have reduced well capacity buchanan et al 2009 where many producers are unable to meet the discharge rate needed to meet high water needs of crops during the sensitive growth stages kda 2009 rogers and lamm 2012 tolk et al 2012 numerous studies have shown that the groundwater that producers rely on for irrigated agriculture will be no longer available unless measures are in place for efficient management of the groundwater buchanan et al 2009 mcguire 2012 despite the declined pumping rate due to excessive withdrawals compared to the recharged amount for irrigated agriculture in western kansas maize zea mays l a high water consumptive crop is the preferred irrigated crop option due to relatively higher economic returns klocke et al 2014 araya et al 2019 therefore there has been greater interest for sustainable use of irrigation water for extending the life span of the ogallala aquifer while enhancing crop productivity and profitability in western kansas and the central great plains regions with growing water shortage and increasing food demand under uncertain and variable climate sustainable use of water resources has been one of the primary focus in the region there have been many experimental studies conducted related to water management strategies under water constrained regions such as limiting irrigation during the late vegetative period comas et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 applying crop water production function strategy for evaluating optimal water allocation and net return varzi et al 2019 applying deficit irrigation for enhancing water productivity klocke et al 2006 klocke et al 2012 klocke et al 2014 developing high yielding hybrids with higher water use efficiency tolk et al 2012 reducing total area of high water consumptive crops klocke et al 2014 use of irrigation technology that reduces evaporation howell 2001 decreasing irrigated land use of new technologies and cropping systems rogers and lamm 2012 schneekloth et al 2004 suggested several water management strategies under water limited conditions such as reducing irrigated land reduced amount of irrigation per given area rotating high with less water consumptive crops multiple cropping growth stage based irrigation strategy using residues to increase rain infiltration and reduce evaporation the preferred crop in the region maize is very sensitive to water stress doorenbos and pruitt 1977 doorenbos and kassam 1979 cakir 2004 farre and faci 2009 recent experimental findings showed that irrigation scheduling that target certain less sensitive crop growth stages could reduce water consumption and improve water productivities without significant yield reduction comas et al 2019 for example zhang et al 2019 conducted an experiment on growth stage based deficit irrigation and reported that water deficit during maturation had stronger impact than that water deficit that occurred during the late vegetative stage water deficit during late vegetative affects the number of seeds and leaf weight photosynthesis while water deficit during the maturity period affects grain filling rate zhang et al 2019 similarly comas et al 2019 reported that maize treated with deficit irrigation during the late vegetative stage with no or with slight water stress on other stages improved water productivity achieving high yield as those treated with full irrigation comas et al 2019 cakir 2004 also reported water deficit during vegetative stage reduce plant height while moisture stress during the ear formation and grain filling period milk stage reduce grain yield and dry biomass cakir 2004 these studies have documented important information that can have a potential impact on water use for agriculture however even though field experiments can provide reliable information for optimum irrigation management must consider the balance of workability easiness or simplicity to be implemented by farmers and investment for adoption in addition irrigation demand could vary by season location and soil type and experimental findings cannot be directly extrapolated due to climate and soil variabilities across years and locations saseendran et al 2008 such studies can timely and efficiently be performed using modeling studies this is because field experiments are costly time consuming and confounded by different environmental conditions to reduce cost and develop robust recommendations accounting for long term climate soils crops and management conditions cropping system models can be used as an option to develop robust management decisions araya et al 2017a 2017b 2018 boote et al 2010 dejonge et al 2011 jones et al 2003 kisekka et al 2016 evaluating irrigation scheduling using modeling technique for maize under a widely adopted irrigation technology center pivot irrigation system can contribute to optimize irrigation water management kisekka et al 2016 the ceres maize model in dssat csm hoogenboom et al 2019 have been successfully implemented for extrapolating experimental finding relevant to strategizing irrigation water management for maize across varying years and locations and cropping system by integrating relevant information saseendran et al 2008 dejonge et al 2011 kisekka et al 2016 once calibrated and validated based on experimental data the model have been proved to be a valuable tool for irrigation scheduling and crop management practices araya et al 2017 dejonge et al 2011 kisekka et al 2016 saseendran et al 2008 dejonge et al 2012 there have been many modeling studies conducted related to improved water management under water constrained regions such as improving irrigation management or irrigation scheduling technique lamm et al 2006 distributing optimum allocation of limited irrigation between vegetative and reproductive growth stage saseendran et al 2008 allocating limited irrigation to critical growth stages araya et al 2017b applying deficit irrigation for enhancing water productivity and economic return kisekka et al 2016 kisekka et al 2016 used thresholds of pasw as irrigation triggers for maize grown on ulysses silt loam soils in western kansas to understand the effect of irrigation trigger thresholds on yield and net return however there has been limited information on whether the impact of these irrigation triggers on yield and wp of maize could vary by soil type and irrigation frequency evaluating different combinations of irrigation frequency by different pasw under different soil types could provide decision guide to maize producers in optimizing yield irrigation water productivities and identify the irrigation strategies that works for center pivot irrigation system understanding the impacts of different combinations of irrigation scheduling techniques could also help to explore alternative irrigation strategies that meet the targeted yield while optimizing water use under different soil types contributing to lengthening of the aquifer life span and enhancing sustainability of the environment in the ogallala region the objectives of this study were to use a calibrated and validated dssat ceres maize crop model to i evaluate maize yield and water productivity wp under various irrigation frequencies triggered by different pasw levels and ii to assess the optimum irrigation frequency and pasw irrigation trigger for maximum yield and wp on three different soils in western kansas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site was geographically located between the latitudes of 37 44 and 38 0 and longitudes of 100 39 to 101 6 in finney county in western kansas the elevation of the study area is approximately 887 m above sea level with climate categorized as semiarid kisekka et al 2016 the long term 1950 2013 annual rainfall is approximately 455 mm araya et al 2017a 2017b the long term average growing season precipitation maximum and minimum daily temperatures may to october are approximately 349 mm 28 3 and 12 3 celsius respectively the study area has an average frost free period of about 170 days klocke et al 2011 the major soils in finney county are richfield silt loam ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand the soil physical and chemical characteristics of these soils are presented in table 1 2 2 model description decision support system for agro technology transfer cropping system model here after dssat computes daily change in soil water as a function of various factors including climate soil characteristics irrigation applied and more dssat model uses the tipping bucket soil water balance approach jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 the available soil water is determined by soil water characteristics of each layer that include drainage upper limit field capacity drainage lower limit permanent wilting point and saturation water content of the soils soil water module calculates drainage when soil water is above the field capacity and estimates infiltration by subtracting runoff from the rainfall or irrigation jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 the runoff is estimated based on curve number method as described by soil conservation service 1972 and later modified by williams et al 1984 upward flow caused due to soil evaporation and transpiration is estimated by soil plant atmosphere sub module in dssat jones et al 2003 soldevilla martinez et al 2013 this simulation study was carried out using dssat model version 4 7 1 001 hoogenboom et al 2017 the model can simulate the expected yield as a function of various irrigation scheduling strategies the irrigation scheduling features in dssat 4 7 1 hoogenboom et al 2017 allows the impact of combinations of various irrigation treatments on crop yield water use or water productivity to be evaluated 2 3 dssat model calibration and validation the dssat model hoogenboom et al 2015 was calibrated and validated araya et al 2017a based on experimental data the percent of deviation between the simulated and observed days to flowering and days to maturity was low 0 similarly the low normalized root mean square of error and percent of deviation of 0 and 0 for days to flowering and 3 5 and 4 6 for days to maturity respectively which indicate the model accurately simulated the phenology of the experimental maize the model was calibrated considering priestly taylor approach priestley and taylor 1972 the dataset for grain yield biomass and crop evapotranspiration were simulated with index of agreement of 0 92 0 93 and 0 79 respectively whereas the validation dataset for grain yield biomass and crop evapotranspiration were simulated with the normalized root mean square of error of 14 3 10 8 and 15 3 respectively araya et al 2017a there were strong linear relationships r2 0 81 between the simulated and measured datasets for most of the above mentioned parameters araya et al 2017a overall the statistical goodness of fit test shows the calibrated genetic coefficient satisfactorily represented the experimental maize this implies the model can be used to strategize various scenarios for maize in the study area the genetic coefficients for the calibrated maize cultivar were presented in araya et al 2017a 2 4 agronomic management and crop model setup long term 1981 2010 daily maximum and minimum temperature precipitation and solar radiation data were obtained from finney county meteorological station near garden city kansas and entered into the model the model was also set up with the prevailing crop management practices and soil conditions in finney county kansas initial nitrogen n was assumed to be 10 kg n ha the planting date for each year 1981 2010 was set to be 15th of may urea fertilizer was applied at the time of planting 10 kg n ha and a month after planting as side dress 255 kg n ha the plant density of maize was set as 7 6 plants m2 with a row spacing of 76 cm and planting depth of 5 cm depending on the temperature of the growing season the length of growing period of the maize hybrid at garden city finney county was on an average of approximately 145 days the use of standardized evapotranspiration method has been reported to have significant importance in agroecosystem modeling dejonge et al 2020 the model was set with the priestly taylor approach priestley and taylor 1972 evapotranspiration approach was used as in prior study araya et al 2017a the suleiman ritchie ritchie et al 2009 approach was used for estimating soil evaporation hoogenboom et al 2019 2 5 irrigation management scenarios and data analysis in dssat the maximum plant available soil water is equivalent to the upper field capacity 100 and the lowest plant available soil water 0 corresponds to the permanent wilting point the soil depth that was used to calculate the soil moisture status for irrigation scheduling was 1 2 m the root zone for maize was estimated to be 1 1 7 m allen et al 1998 raes 2002 usda nrcs 2016 the model was run with 30 years of meteorological data that the soil water content was re initialized at the beginning of every season as the simulation is set on seasonal mode the soil water was reinitiated at equal soil water status to reduce bias among the evaluated scenarios accordingly the model was set with an average initial soil water status of 60 as the model was also initially calibrated based on similar information in this study there were four irrigation frequency irf treatments 2 4 7 and 9 days four pasw threshold 5 25 50 and 75 treatments the pasw thresholds between 25 and 75 were the most likely scenarios in practice however the pasw 5 and irf 2 were included to demonstrate how irrigation water use and yield could decline and increase with extreme lower and higher scenarios respectively in western kansas 25 mm per irrigation event is the most common practice for center pivot sprinkler irrigation especially for irrigating maize grain sorghum and winter wheat sprinkler irrigation application losses may include wind drift and evaporation droplet evaporation canopy evaporation soil evaporation and plant interception during irrigation irmak et al 2011 accordingly the model was set to apply 25 mm at each irrigation event with an irrigation efficiency of 0 8 rogers et al 1997 irmak et al 2011 the model was set to irrigate maize based on each irrigation frequency irf 2 4 7 and 9 day treatment in combination with the different pasw of 5 25 50 and 75 irrigation triggers as an example initiating irrigation based on pasw 50 with irf 4 means start irrigating before the available soil water field capacity wilting point is depleted below 50 and the user selected irrigation depth 25 mm must be applied with irrigation frequency of 4 days so that to continuously maintain the plant available soil water above 50 if the plant available soil water threshold is still not maintained by the applied irrigation under irf 4 then the center pivot will continue applying irrigation until the pasw is kept above the 50 threshold limit center pivot speed and irrigation depth per revolution is adjustable leib and grant 2019 with the recent advancement of irrigation technology a programmable control panels are available for applying different irrigation treatments within the field if differential application is needed with regard to irf 2 the irrigation strategy is not commonly practiced under standard condition but there could be possibility of applying 25 mm or 1 in in 48 h in small area of a circle whereas irf 4 25 mm in 4 days irf 7 25 mm in 7 days irf 9 25 mm in 9 days are common scenarios in practice in maize growing areas of western kansas lower irrigation capacities correspond to those areas that have low flow rate such as longer irrigation interval irf 9 or applying 25 mm in 9 days however not all the irrigation frequency irf and pasw scenarios may necessarily fits in one farm each of the scenarios may have specific suitable condition to one or another farm depending on many factors such as flow rate crop type climate condition pivot length etc for example irf 9 may be chosen for growing grain sorghum however as mentioned above this simulation analysis is only to evaluate impacts of various combinations of pasw and irf scenarios on yield performance of maize and demonstrate how irrigation water use would vary by scenarios that could provide producers with options to meet their targeted need according to their irrigation systems requirement 2 6 data analysis the model was run on seasonal mode using 30 years of historical weather data 1981 2010 results tabulated average seasonal simulated amount of irrigations number of irrigation events runoff drainage and evapotranspiration based on different combinations of irf and pasw on ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand soils for finney county garden city kansas in addition end of season plant available soil water was plotted for irf 4 and irf 9 for the three soils the relationship between maize yield and applied irrigation water under various irrigation frequency scenarios triggered by different pasw for three different soils were developed furthermore the long term 1981 2010 average maize yield for different irf scenarios for three different soil types with four pasw irrigation triggers were simulated irrigation water productivity iwp was calculated as irrigated maize yield yi minus dryland maize yield yd divided by the amount of irrigation i applied in kg ha mm eq 1 1 i w p y i y d i water productivity wp was also calculated as maize yield divided by the et of maize in kg ha mm the relationships of wp and iwp against plant available soil water irrigation triggers under different irfs were presented the relationship between maize crop et and yield under the different irrigation frequency scenarios and soil types were developed in addition brief results on the impact of irrigation scenarios on economic performance of maize in western kansas was reviewed from similar studies that were conducted at the same site climate and soil conditions as in the current study are presented and discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation runoff drainage and evapotranspiration versus soils the average seasonal may to nov irrigation runoff drainage and evapotranspiration simulated based on combination of pasw and irf scenarios for dominant soils fine sand and slit loam in southwestern kansas is presented in table 2 the average number of irrigations for ulysses silt loam soils under pasw 75 50 and 25 ranged 16 22 12 17 and 9 13 respectively table 2 the highest and lowest value corresponded to irf 2 and irf 9 respectively under the same soil type kisekka et al 2016 conducted simulation studies for maize and estimated the number of irrigation under pasw of 80 70 60 50 40 and 30 to be 17 15 14 13 12 and 10 respectively which is in the range simulated in our study in this study the average et values for ulysses silt loam soils under pasw 75 50 and 25 ranged from 681 to 711 626 655 596 638 respectively table 2 however the simulated irrigation and et values for ulysses silt loam were higher than the respective values for valent fine sand soils on average by 42 and 57 mm respectively table 2 these simulated et ranges are within the values simulated for maize presented in araya et al 2017c the difference in et was partly due to difference in drainage characteristics of the soils table 2 this study showed the average seasonal drainage loss was relatively higher in fine sand soils than silt loam table 2 which could be due difference in infiltration rate raes 2002 in dssat drainage is calculated when soil water in the soil layers is above the drainage upper water limit jones et al 2003 end season plant available soil water for maize under three soil types and two irf irf 4 and irf 9 and four pasw irrigation triggers is presented in fig 1a and b the figure showed that ulysses silt loam top 1 2 m had higher end season pasw than the valent fine sand soils which could be due to its relatively higher water holding capacity 3 2 yield irrigation triggers for different soils the relationship between yield and irrigation under different irfs based on irrigation triggers of pasw for the three soils is presented in fig 2a c the use of pasw 5 as an irrigation trigger increased the irrigation interval and reduced the number of irrigations which ultimately reduced yield maize yield was substantially affected by pasw irf and soil type maize yield was at least 10680 kg ha when irrigation was triggered by pasw of 25 fig 2a c figs 3 4 yield substantially increased 12800 kg ha regardless of soil type at an irrigation triggers pasw of 50 and 75 this was due to the increase in irrigation amount during the growing season when the irrigation trigger pasw increased the irrigation cycle decreased and consequently the number of irrigations increased the highest maize yield was obtained for irf 4 triggered by pasw of 50 and 75 figs 3 5 in this study yield did not substantially increase at irf 2 when compared to irf 4 triggered by pasw of 50 and 75 this was because the optimal irrigation requirement for maize was met under this scenario beyond which yield did not substantially increase with further increase in irrigation figs 3 5 there were no substantial differences in maize yield among irf 2 irf 4 and irf 7 under pasw 75 irrespective of soil type in majority of the seasons figs 3 5 however average long term 1981 2010 yield decreased by approximately 1000 kg ha for irf 7 triggered by pasw 75 when compared to that for irf 2 and irf 4 under richfield silt loam and valent fine sand soils whereas yield substantially decreased when irrigation trigger pasw was at 5 compared to others figs 3 5 kisekka et al 2016 conducted maize irrigation scheduling simulations based on pasw 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 on ulysses silt loam they found almost similar yield under pasw in the range from 50 to 80 however they found some yield differences between 50 and 30 pasw although we found considerable yield difference on average at least by 1600 kg ha between 25 and 50 pasw any decrease in plant available soil water below 50 during the critical maize growing period should have substantially decreased maize yield beyond this level we did further investigation to understand what could have caused the unexpected yield level for pasw 25 and found that nitrogen has partly contributed in addition the model has applied 9 13 irrigations per season depending on soils and irfs which justifies the simulated yield level was reasonable although the impacts of water stress shocks on yield were not appreciably as expected kisekka et al 2016 also simulated average yield values at pasw 30 similar to that simulated in this study however caution may be needed with maize under pasw 25 irrigation trigger as simulated maize yields are not as low as expected on the other hand higher pasw above 75 may result in too many irrigations per season which is not practical under western kansas conditions for example irrigation strategy based on irf 2 and irf 4 triggered by pasw 75 resulted in an average of up to 22 irrigations per growing season application of too many irrigations increases the cost of production and might cause yield loss due to aeration stress and leaching of nitrogen depending on nature of the soil type among the irrigation frequency scenarios irf 9 showed substantially lower yield under most pasw tested in this study this could be because the increasing time between irrigation events especially around reproductive and grain filling stage can reduce yield significantly cakir 2004 farre and faci 2009 comas et al 2019 in this study irf 4 had the highest yield and wp if pasw 50 was used as the threshold figs 3 5 tables 3 and 4 irf 7 was better than irf 2 in terms of irrigation water saving for maize grown in ulysses silt loam 3 3 yield irrigation frequency there was a moderate to weak curvilinear relationship r2 0 2 0 8 between yield and irrigation under all soils when the regressions were made by irf regardless of pasw fig 6 a c due to year to year climate variability the amount of irrigation needed to achieve maximum yield at the study site varied substantially the simulated maximum yields corresponded to irrigation amounts of 300 700 mm 300 600 mm and 300 500 mm for richfield silt loam ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand soils respectively fig 6a c lamm et al 2007 reported a strong polynomial relationship between maize yield and irrigation capacity farre and faci 2009 also reported a non linear relationship between irrigation and maize yield unlike the long term 1981 2010 seasonal yield and irrigation by irf mentioned above the regression between long term average yield and irrigation by irf and pasw produced a strong quadratic polynomial relationship r2 0 99 for all soils fig 6d f which produced more consistent predictive trend compared to that presented by irf fig 6a c similarly klocke et al 2011 and trout and dejonge 2017 obtained curvilinear relationship between yield and irrigation yield increased with an increase in irrigation and maximized approximately at 400 and 450 mm in fine sand and silt loam soils respectively fig 6d f klocke et al 2011 reported that yield variabilities decreased with increase in irrigation which is consistent with our finding yield start to gradually decline with further increase in irrigation above 550 and 450 in silt loam richfield and ulysses silt loam and fine sand soils respectively fig 6d f tolk et al 2012 reported that about 750 mm or more water is required to achieve maximum maize yield in northwest texas which has a slightly different climate relative to west kansas araya et al 2017c reported that an average of 450 mm irrigation was optimal for maize in western kansas maize yield in the western corn belt ranged from 9500 to 17200 kg ha with an average of 13000 kg ha sadras et al 2015 these yield levels are within the range of our simulated values for western kansas in addition yield value obtained at the experiment station at the same site was similar to our simulated yield values oker 2018 under pasw 50 and 75 irrigation trigger scenario on average the model applied irrigation of 390 670 292 557 and 274 450 mm for maize grown in richfield and ulysses silt loam and valent sand soils respectively fig 7a c tables 3 and 4 this indicates maize grown on valent fine sand soils require relatively less irrigation compared to richfield and ulysses silt loam soils this study showed that the number of irrigations increased with decrease irrigation interval between applications accordingly the number of irrigation events under irf 2 reached on average up to 22 for irrigation trigger of pasw 75 whereas the number of irrigation events under irf 9 triggered by pasw 75 were on average between 13 and 15 as mentioned in sections above irrigation amount may vary from season to season due to climate variability but generally irrigation increase as time between irrigation interval decreases klocke et al 2011 araya et al 2017c reported a maximum of 18 19 irrigation events for irf 5 with a total amount of 450 475 mm to produce maximum maize yield at finney county in western kansas kisekka et al 2016 also verified that 14 17 irrigation events each 25 mm triggered at pasw 50 might suffice for optimizing maize yield in western kansas the number of irrigation events peaked at each irf when irrigation trigger based on pasw 75 which increased yield due to increase in irrigation water although yield values were not substantially higher compared to pasw 50 under irf 4 the lowest number of irrigation events 4 6 totals corresponded to irf 9 and irf 7 at pasw of 5 table 2 at times when irrigation water is limited growth stage based irrigation such as reducing irrigation to less critical growth stages late vegetative stage while applying optimal irrigation to critical stages as presented in comas et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 might be beneficial kisekka et al 2016 suggested terminating irrigation at 90 95 days after maize was planted in finney county in western kansas to increase the net return the number of irrigation events depends on the et demand of the crop and the irrigation capacity required in meeting a defined yield goal lamm et al 2007 reported that the minimum irrigation capacity for potential maximum maize yield in northwest kansas could reach about 6 4 mm day which is equivalent to irrigating every 4 days based on a 25 mm per irrigation event 3 4 yield et relations the relationship between yield and et regression of grain yield with et by irf regardless of pasw was quadratic polynomial r2 0 61 0 66 fig 8a for richfield silt loam while the relationship was linear for ulysses silt loam and fine sand r2 0 74 fig 8b and c in contrast the relationship between yield and et was curvilinear when the long term yield and irrigation were averaged by irf and pasw irrigation triggers fig 8d f yield increased with et up to 700 mm which then curved with further increase in et above this level fig 8a d f similarly trout and dejonge 2017 and comas et al 2019 reported a curvilinear relationship between yield and et in contrast many other studies in the past reported a linear relationship between yield and et payero et al 2006 klocke et al 2011 in this study averaging long term yield and et by irf and pasw normalized the difference and smoothened the trend to produce a strong curvilinear r2 0 90 relationship for all soils fig 8d f lower et and yield corresponded to irf 9 and irf 7 conditions triggered by pasw 5 fig 8d f the highest yield of maize corresponded to et levels of 694 738 mm 650 711 mm and 625 645 mm in richfield silt loam ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand soils respectively fig 8d f tables 3 and 4 araya et al 2017c reported et of 662 714 mm in silt loam soils in finney county kansas although the soils and climate of texas are slightly different from kansas the et of drought tolerant maize hybrids were grown under optimal water availability at etter texas were reported to use et of 675 mm to produce maximum yield hao et al 2015 recent studies in central high plain obtained water production functions of 2 kg m3 at full irrigation and rapidly declines when et is reduced by more than 25 and reaches 0 kg m3 when et is reduced by about 60 when it reaches at 40 of the maximum et trout and dejonge 2017 the finding is partially close to the experimental data 2008 2011 presented by varzi et al 2019 3 5 water productivities this study showed that wp expressed in kg ha mm of maize was highest when pasw 50 were used as a trigger of irrigation fig 9a c tables 3 and 4 the lowest wp of maize was simulated for pasw of 5 fig 9a c tables 3 and 4 the highest maize wp was simulated for irf 2 and irf 4 26 kg ha mm followed by irf 7 25 kg ha mm considering pasw of 50 there was no substantial difference in wp among the irfs for valent fine sand and ulysses silt loam soils the wp for irf 7 13 25 kg ha mm and irf 9 13 23 kg ha mm for each corresponding pasw were similar across soil type scenarios fig 9a c tables 3 and 4 these wp results are similar to those reported by dejonge et al 2012 dejonge et al 2012 conducted an experiment in colorado and obtained wp between 16 7 and 21 and 17 3 25 8 kg ha mm for maize grown under full and limited irrigation respectively the highest wp was simulated for ulysses silt loams and valent fine sand while the lowest was simulated for richfield silt loam soils tables 3 and 4 this was due to a substantial increase in et with richfield compared to ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand whereas yield for the ulysses silt loam was relatively higher than with richfield silt loam soils in contrast tolk et al 2012 reported that wp decreased from coarse to fine textured soils mainly due to differences in et rather than grain yield oker 2018 reported wp ranges of 22 27 kg ha mm for finney county maize kansas these values are in the range of wp values simulated in this study tables 3 and 4 kisekka et al 2016 obtained maximum maize yield per unit of et under 50 pasw maize iwp can be as high as 50 kg ha mm lamm et al 2007 the highest iwp was simulated for irfs triggered by pasw of 25 for ulysses silt soils 33 kg ha mm under irf 7 tables 3 and 4 relatively low iwp was simulated for pasw of 75 under ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand while the highest was simulated under pasw of 25 tables 3 and 4 the lowest iwp was simulated for pasw 5 under richfield silt loam 1 3 rogers and lamm 2012 reported a substantial maize yield increase over the 1974 2010 period partly due to improved irrigation practices by approximately 157 kg ha year or 2 5 bu acre year which resulted in a substantial increase in iwp for maize in western kansas sadras et al 2015 provided a review on the overall maize yield per amount of irrigation in midwestern us corn belt when corrected for impacts of rainfall with values ranged from 27 to 32 kg ha mm in agreement with the results obtained for ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand soils further detailed economic analysis of our research results is needed to evaluate the cost benefit value for the various irrigation triggers 3 6 the effect of irrigation scenarios on profitability studies showed that irrigation capacity and profitability are the most important decision making component for farming in western kansas kisekka et al 2016 araya et al 2019 2021 rouhi rad et al 2020 araya et al 2021 conducted economic analysis for multiple irrigation and pasw treatments some of them closely match to the current study e g irf 2 irf 4 irf 8 and irf 10 in combination with irrigation trigger 25 pasw 55 pasw and 75 pasw and reported relatively high average return after variable cost 700 ha for maize treated with high irrigation capacity 25 mm 4 day while low return after variable cost 400 ha values were reported to correspond to low irrigation capacity 25 mm 10 day regardless of the irrigation trigger rouhi rad et al 2020 analyzed crop yield and profits of maize wheat and grain sorghum under five different soil types at the same site western kansas under similar treatment setup and showed that lower irrigation capacities result in lower profit while higher irrigation capacities resulted in relatively higher profit for example a well capacity of 6540 m3 day and 1090 m3 day could generate an average maize wheat and grain sorghum profit of about 939 ha and 692 ha 791 ha and 669 ha and 383 ha and 259 ha respectively rouhi rad et al 2020 even though the return from maize slightly increases with irrigation at present many of the wells in western kansas are not able to meet the required irrigation water needs of the crop therefore crop producers need to look at other alternative crops and cropping systems in order to maintain the sustainability of water resources in the region 3 7 implementation assumptions and limitations in kansas irrigation scheduling strategy based on estimates of available soil water and or cumulative et to keep the soil water above the critical level has been practiced by many producers however since the irrigation capacity is limited in many areas of southwestern kansas evaluating irrigation scheduling strategies that considers percentages of plant available soil water as thresholds for initiating irrigation under a given irrigation frequency as presented in this study would help producers identify the most suitable irrigation option this kind of evaluation helps to explore suitable irrigation strategies that meet the targeted yield while optimizing resources and enhancing environmental sustainability the lower the irrigation capacity the longer the irrigation frequency unless the size of the irrigable area is decreased likewise longer irrigation frequency could decrease the pasw below the threshold level therefore the scheduling opens up for an opportunity to test and evaluate for broad ranges of irrigation water management options in order to maintain yield while enhancing water productivity which might eventually contribute to lengthen the life of the aquifer one of the limitations of this study is that the soil water is reinitiated at the beginning of every season with pasw of 60 despite the weather and soil variabilities however the accuracy of the simulation might not substantially affected because i some data not published indicated that the soil water at time of planting is in the range between 55 and 68 and the model was initially calibrated based on that information ii the simulation was set on seasonal mode the initial soil water was reinitiated at equal soil water status for all scenarios in order to evaluate the scenarios without bias to reduce the treatment bias iii even if weather is variable planting maize by may 15 is highly likely because planting window for maize at the study site was reported to be in the range between apr 15 and may 20 shroyer et al 1996 another limitation is that agronomic management e g fertilization planting density planting date was assumed similar throughout the long term seasons 1981 2010 which is very unlikely to follow the same management practice continuously for 30 years period in addition the irf 2 and pasw 5 are not common practices in western kansas for maize however the irf 2 and pasw 5 were included to demonstrate how irrigation water use and yield would change under extremely lower and higher irrigation assumptions respectively furthermore implementations of this irrigation scheduling strategy may require automatic plant available soil water sensors to communicate with the irrigation control system depending on irrigation technology which may be expensive furthermore soil type might also significantly affect the irrigation scheduling some of the scenarios may need continuous irrigation which might be unrealistic because center pivot may require maintenance during the growing season other limitations such as the cultivar must be calibrated based on site data which may be time taking apart from that as irrigation capacity is a major constraint this kind of simulation study could provide producers with broader options to deal with site specific water management related challenges in addition this approach could help producers and agronomists to gain important information relevant to water use and yield a head of time which may be also extended to various application such as in developing economic and marketing strategy 4 conclusions maintaining higher irrigation frequencies up to 25 mm 4 day under irrigation trigger of 50 psaw could optimize yield and water productivity we found that maize yield increases with an increase in irrigation and maximized approximately at 400 450 mm regardless of the soil type however producer decision on irrigation scheduling and cropping system might depend on well capacity pumping rate since maize is sensitive to water stress producers should know their well capacity before allocating area for maize under lower well capacity producers should reduce maize area while increasing area for crop that require lower irrigation frequency in places where well capacity is high center pivot should be set to apply irrigation in targeted area to meet the required irrigation frequency 25 mm 4 day to optimize yield and water use however since the groundwater in the southwest kansas part of the ogallala region is declining we suggest considering long term environmental sustainability yield stability and longer term profitability issues when selecting suitable crops and managing irrigation water the irrigation scheduling technique developed in this study might be more suitable when combined with the use of accurate in season weather forecast and precision soil water measuring devises which might reduce unnecessary irrigations application as irrigation scheduling based on long term weather data could substantially differ from the actual season we believe that these types of simulation study could provide producers with choices to evaluate and prioritize the most suitable crops and irrigation strategy under water limited conditions declaration of competing interest the

10221,a calibrated and validated decision support system for agro technology transfer cropping system model dssat csm ceres maize was used to 1 evaluate maize zea mays l yield and water productivities wp under various irrigation frequencies irf triggered by different plant available soil water pasw on three soil types and 2 assess the optimum irf and pasw triggers for maximum yield and water productivity on three different soils with a depth of 1 2 m in finney county western kansas the treatments were four irf 2 4 7 and 9 days four pasw 5 25 50 and 75 irrigation trigger and three soil types with a total of 48 combinations the model was set to automatically apply 25 mm irrigation at selected day intervals when certain irrigation triggering pasw conditions were met this study showed that maintaining higher pasw up to 75 or above might result in too many irrigations per season which could be costly irf 9 showed substantially lowest yield under most pasw tested in this study the highest yield was simulated at irrigation amount of 400 450 mm and et of 650 800 mm depending on soil types the highest irrigation water productivity iwp 30 33 kg ha mm was simulated when triggered by 25 and 50 pasw for ulysses silt loams overall irf 4 under 50 pasw threshold provided the maximum maize yield and wp for all soil types keywords soil water dssat irrigation capacity scheduling ogallala kansas 1 introduction irrigation water pumping that exceeded the recharge over the past decades has decreased water levels of ogallala aquifer mcguire 2012 in the central great plains and western kansas the decrease in groundwater levels have reduced well capacity buchanan et al 2009 where many producers are unable to meet the discharge rate needed to meet high water needs of crops during the sensitive growth stages kda 2009 rogers and lamm 2012 tolk et al 2012 numerous studies have shown that the groundwater that producers rely on for irrigated agriculture will be no longer available unless measures are in place for efficient management of the groundwater buchanan et al 2009 mcguire 2012 despite the declined pumping rate due to excessive withdrawals compared to the recharged amount for irrigated agriculture in western kansas maize zea mays l a high water consumptive crop is the preferred irrigated crop option due to relatively higher economic returns klocke et al 2014 araya et al 2019 therefore there has been greater interest for sustainable use of irrigation water for extending the life span of the ogallala aquifer while enhancing crop productivity and profitability in western kansas and the central great plains regions with growing water shortage and increasing food demand under uncertain and variable climate sustainable use of water resources has been one of the primary focus in the region there have been many experimental studies conducted related to water management strategies under water constrained regions such as limiting irrigation during the late vegetative period comas et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 applying crop water production function strategy for evaluating optimal water allocation and net return varzi et al 2019 applying deficit irrigation for enhancing water productivity klocke et al 2006 klocke et al 2012 klocke et al 2014 developing high yielding hybrids with higher water use efficiency tolk et al 2012 reducing total area of high water consumptive crops klocke et al 2014 use of irrigation technology that reduces evaporation howell 2001 decreasing irrigated land use of new technologies and cropping systems rogers and lamm 2012 schneekloth et al 2004 suggested several water management strategies under water limited conditions such as reducing irrigated land reduced amount of irrigation per given area rotating high with less water consumptive crops multiple cropping growth stage based irrigation strategy using residues to increase rain infiltration and reduce evaporation the preferred crop in the region maize is very sensitive to water stress doorenbos and pruitt 1977 doorenbos and kassam 1979 cakir 2004 farre and faci 2009 recent experimental findings showed that irrigation scheduling that target certain less sensitive crop growth stages could reduce water consumption and improve water productivities without significant yield reduction comas et al 2019 for example zhang et al 2019 conducted an experiment on growth stage based deficit irrigation and reported that water deficit during maturation had stronger impact than that water deficit that occurred during the late vegetative stage water deficit during late vegetative affects the number of seeds and leaf weight photosynthesis while water deficit during the maturity period affects grain filling rate zhang et al 2019 similarly comas et al 2019 reported that maize treated with deficit irrigation during the late vegetative stage with no or with slight water stress on other stages improved water productivity achieving high yield as those treated with full irrigation comas et al 2019 cakir 2004 also reported water deficit during vegetative stage reduce plant height while moisture stress during the ear formation and grain filling period milk stage reduce grain yield and dry biomass cakir 2004 these studies have documented important information that can have a potential impact on water use for agriculture however even though field experiments can provide reliable information for optimum irrigation management must consider the balance of workability easiness or simplicity to be implemented by farmers and investment for adoption in addition irrigation demand could vary by season location and soil type and experimental findings cannot be directly extrapolated due to climate and soil variabilities across years and locations saseendran et al 2008 such studies can timely and efficiently be performed using modeling studies this is because field experiments are costly time consuming and confounded by different environmental conditions to reduce cost and develop robust recommendations accounting for long term climate soils crops and management conditions cropping system models can be used as an option to develop robust management decisions araya et al 2017a 2017b 2018 boote et al 2010 dejonge et al 2011 jones et al 2003 kisekka et al 2016 evaluating irrigation scheduling using modeling technique for maize under a widely adopted irrigation technology center pivot irrigation system can contribute to optimize irrigation water management kisekka et al 2016 the ceres maize model in dssat csm hoogenboom et al 2019 have been successfully implemented for extrapolating experimental finding relevant to strategizing irrigation water management for maize across varying years and locations and cropping system by integrating relevant information saseendran et al 2008 dejonge et al 2011 kisekka et al 2016 once calibrated and validated based on experimental data the model have been proved to be a valuable tool for irrigation scheduling and crop management practices araya et al 2017 dejonge et al 2011 kisekka et al 2016 saseendran et al 2008 dejonge et al 2012 there have been many modeling studies conducted related to improved water management under water constrained regions such as improving irrigation management or irrigation scheduling technique lamm et al 2006 distributing optimum allocation of limited irrigation between vegetative and reproductive growth stage saseendran et al 2008 allocating limited irrigation to critical growth stages araya et al 2017b applying deficit irrigation for enhancing water productivity and economic return kisekka et al 2016 kisekka et al 2016 used thresholds of pasw as irrigation triggers for maize grown on ulysses silt loam soils in western kansas to understand the effect of irrigation trigger thresholds on yield and net return however there has been limited information on whether the impact of these irrigation triggers on yield and wp of maize could vary by soil type and irrigation frequency evaluating different combinations of irrigation frequency by different pasw under different soil types could provide decision guide to maize producers in optimizing yield irrigation water productivities and identify the irrigation strategies that works for center pivot irrigation system understanding the impacts of different combinations of irrigation scheduling techniques could also help to explore alternative irrigation strategies that meet the targeted yield while optimizing water use under different soil types contributing to lengthening of the aquifer life span and enhancing sustainability of the environment in the ogallala region the objectives of this study were to use a calibrated and validated dssat ceres maize crop model to i evaluate maize yield and water productivity wp under various irrigation frequencies triggered by different pasw levels and ii to assess the optimum irrigation frequency and pasw irrigation trigger for maximum yield and wp on three different soils in western kansas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site was geographically located between the latitudes of 37 44 and 38 0 and longitudes of 100 39 to 101 6 in finney county in western kansas the elevation of the study area is approximately 887 m above sea level with climate categorized as semiarid kisekka et al 2016 the long term 1950 2013 annual rainfall is approximately 455 mm araya et al 2017a 2017b the long term average growing season precipitation maximum and minimum daily temperatures may to october are approximately 349 mm 28 3 and 12 3 celsius respectively the study area has an average frost free period of about 170 days klocke et al 2011 the major soils in finney county are richfield silt loam ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand the soil physical and chemical characteristics of these soils are presented in table 1 2 2 model description decision support system for agro technology transfer cropping system model here after dssat computes daily change in soil water as a function of various factors including climate soil characteristics irrigation applied and more dssat model uses the tipping bucket soil water balance approach jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 the available soil water is determined by soil water characteristics of each layer that include drainage upper limit field capacity drainage lower limit permanent wilting point and saturation water content of the soils soil water module calculates drainage when soil water is above the field capacity and estimates infiltration by subtracting runoff from the rainfall or irrigation jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019 the runoff is estimated based on curve number method as described by soil conservation service 1972 and later modified by williams et al 1984 upward flow caused due to soil evaporation and transpiration is estimated by soil plant atmosphere sub module in dssat jones et al 2003 soldevilla martinez et al 2013 this simulation study was carried out using dssat model version 4 7 1 001 hoogenboom et al 2017 the model can simulate the expected yield as a function of various irrigation scheduling strategies the irrigation scheduling features in dssat 4 7 1 hoogenboom et al 2017 allows the impact of combinations of various irrigation treatments on crop yield water use or water productivity to be evaluated 2 3 dssat model calibration and validation the dssat model hoogenboom et al 2015 was calibrated and validated araya et al 2017a based on experimental data the percent of deviation between the simulated and observed days to flowering and days to maturity was low 0 similarly the low normalized root mean square of error and percent of deviation of 0 and 0 for days to flowering and 3 5 and 4 6 for days to maturity respectively which indicate the model accurately simulated the phenology of the experimental maize the model was calibrated considering priestly taylor approach priestley and taylor 1972 the dataset for grain yield biomass and crop evapotranspiration were simulated with index of agreement of 0 92 0 93 and 0 79 respectively whereas the validation dataset for grain yield biomass and crop evapotranspiration were simulated with the normalized root mean square of error of 14 3 10 8 and 15 3 respectively araya et al 2017a there were strong linear relationships r2 0 81 between the simulated and measured datasets for most of the above mentioned parameters araya et al 2017a overall the statistical goodness of fit test shows the calibrated genetic coefficient satisfactorily represented the experimental maize this implies the model can be used to strategize various scenarios for maize in the study area the genetic coefficients for the calibrated maize cultivar were presented in araya et al 2017a 2 4 agronomic management and crop model setup long term 1981 2010 daily maximum and minimum temperature precipitation and solar radiation data were obtained from finney county meteorological station near garden city kansas and entered into the model the model was also set up with the prevailing crop management practices and soil conditions in finney county kansas initial nitrogen n was assumed to be 10 kg n ha the planting date for each year 1981 2010 was set to be 15th of may urea fertilizer was applied at the time of planting 10 kg n ha and a month after planting as side dress 255 kg n ha the plant density of maize was set as 7 6 plants m2 with a row spacing of 76 cm and planting depth of 5 cm depending on the temperature of the growing season the length of growing period of the maize hybrid at garden city finney county was on an average of approximately 145 days the use of standardized evapotranspiration method has been reported to have significant importance in agroecosystem modeling dejonge et al 2020 the model was set with the priestly taylor approach priestley and taylor 1972 evapotranspiration approach was used as in prior study araya et al 2017a the suleiman ritchie ritchie et al 2009 approach was used for estimating soil evaporation hoogenboom et al 2019 2 5 irrigation management scenarios and data analysis in dssat the maximum plant available soil water is equivalent to the upper field capacity 100 and the lowest plant available soil water 0 corresponds to the permanent wilting point the soil depth that was used to calculate the soil moisture status for irrigation scheduling was 1 2 m the root zone for maize was estimated to be 1 1 7 m allen et al 1998 raes 2002 usda nrcs 2016 the model was run with 30 years of meteorological data that the soil water content was re initialized at the beginning of every season as the simulation is set on seasonal mode the soil water was reinitiated at equal soil water status to reduce bias among the evaluated scenarios accordingly the model was set with an average initial soil water status of 60 as the model was also initially calibrated based on similar information in this study there were four irrigation frequency irf treatments 2 4 7 and 9 days four pasw threshold 5 25 50 and 75 treatments the pasw thresholds between 25 and 75 were the most likely scenarios in practice however the pasw 5 and irf 2 were included to demonstrate how irrigation water use and yield could decline and increase with extreme lower and higher scenarios respectively in western kansas 25 mm per irrigation event is the most common practice for center pivot sprinkler irrigation especially for irrigating maize grain sorghum and winter wheat sprinkler irrigation application losses may include wind drift and evaporation droplet evaporation canopy evaporation soil evaporation and plant interception during irrigation irmak et al 2011 accordingly the model was set to apply 25 mm at each irrigation event with an irrigation efficiency of 0 8 rogers et al 1997 irmak et al 2011 the model was set to irrigate maize based on each irrigation frequency irf 2 4 7 and 9 day treatment in combination with the different pasw of 5 25 50 and 75 irrigation triggers as an example initiating irrigation based on pasw 50 with irf 4 means start irrigating before the available soil water field capacity wilting point is depleted below 50 and the user selected irrigation depth 25 mm must be applied with irrigation frequency of 4 days so that to continuously maintain the plant available soil water above 50 if the plant available soil water threshold is still not maintained by the applied irrigation under irf 4 then the center pivot will continue applying irrigation until the pasw is kept above the 50 threshold limit center pivot speed and irrigation depth per revolution is adjustable leib and grant 2019 with the recent advancement of irrigation technology a programmable control panels are available for applying different irrigation treatments within the field if differential application is needed with regard to irf 2 the irrigation strategy is not commonly practiced under standard condition but there could be possibility of applying 25 mm or 1 in in 48 h in small area of a circle whereas irf 4 25 mm in 4 days irf 7 25 mm in 7 days irf 9 25 mm in 9 days are common scenarios in practice in maize growing areas of western kansas lower irrigation capacities correspond to those areas that have low flow rate such as longer irrigation interval irf 9 or applying 25 mm in 9 days however not all the irrigation frequency irf and pasw scenarios may necessarily fits in one farm each of the scenarios may have specific suitable condition to one or another farm depending on many factors such as flow rate crop type climate condition pivot length etc for example irf 9 may be chosen for growing grain sorghum however as mentioned above this simulation analysis is only to evaluate impacts of various combinations of pasw and irf scenarios on yield performance of maize and demonstrate how irrigation water use would vary by scenarios that could provide producers with options to meet their targeted need according to their irrigation systems requirement 2 6 data analysis the model was run on seasonal mode using 30 years of historical weather data 1981 2010 results tabulated average seasonal simulated amount of irrigations number of irrigation events runoff drainage and evapotranspiration based on different combinations of irf and pasw on ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand soils for finney county garden city kansas in addition end of season plant available soil water was plotted for irf 4 and irf 9 for the three soils the relationship between maize yield and applied irrigation water under various irrigation frequency scenarios triggered by different pasw for three different soils were developed furthermore the long term 1981 2010 average maize yield for different irf scenarios for three different soil types with four pasw irrigation triggers were simulated irrigation water productivity iwp was calculated as irrigated maize yield yi minus dryland maize yield yd divided by the amount of irrigation i applied in kg ha mm eq 1 1 i w p y i y d i water productivity wp was also calculated as maize yield divided by the et of maize in kg ha mm the relationships of wp and iwp against plant available soil water irrigation triggers under different irfs were presented the relationship between maize crop et and yield under the different irrigation frequency scenarios and soil types were developed in addition brief results on the impact of irrigation scenarios on economic performance of maize in western kansas was reviewed from similar studies that were conducted at the same site climate and soil conditions as in the current study are presented and discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation runoff drainage and evapotranspiration versus soils the average seasonal may to nov irrigation runoff drainage and evapotranspiration simulated based on combination of pasw and irf scenarios for dominant soils fine sand and slit loam in southwestern kansas is presented in table 2 the average number of irrigations for ulysses silt loam soils under pasw 75 50 and 25 ranged 16 22 12 17 and 9 13 respectively table 2 the highest and lowest value corresponded to irf 2 and irf 9 respectively under the same soil type kisekka et al 2016 conducted simulation studies for maize and estimated the number of irrigation under pasw of 80 70 60 50 40 and 30 to be 17 15 14 13 12 and 10 respectively which is in the range simulated in our study in this study the average et values for ulysses silt loam soils under pasw 75 50 and 25 ranged from 681 to 711 626 655 596 638 respectively table 2 however the simulated irrigation and et values for ulysses silt loam were higher than the respective values for valent fine sand soils on average by 42 and 57 mm respectively table 2 these simulated et ranges are within the values simulated for maize presented in araya et al 2017c the difference in et was partly due to difference in drainage characteristics of the soils table 2 this study showed the average seasonal drainage loss was relatively higher in fine sand soils than silt loam table 2 which could be due difference in infiltration rate raes 2002 in dssat drainage is calculated when soil water in the soil layers is above the drainage upper water limit jones et al 2003 end season plant available soil water for maize under three soil types and two irf irf 4 and irf 9 and four pasw irrigation triggers is presented in fig 1a and b the figure showed that ulysses silt loam top 1 2 m had higher end season pasw than the valent fine sand soils which could be due to its relatively higher water holding capacity 3 2 yield irrigation triggers for different soils the relationship between yield and irrigation under different irfs based on irrigation triggers of pasw for the three soils is presented in fig 2a c the use of pasw 5 as an irrigation trigger increased the irrigation interval and reduced the number of irrigations which ultimately reduced yield maize yield was substantially affected by pasw irf and soil type maize yield was at least 10680 kg ha when irrigation was triggered by pasw of 25 fig 2a c figs 3 4 yield substantially increased 12800 kg ha regardless of soil type at an irrigation triggers pasw of 50 and 75 this was due to the increase in irrigation amount during the growing season when the irrigation trigger pasw increased the irrigation cycle decreased and consequently the number of irrigations increased the highest maize yield was obtained for irf 4 triggered by pasw of 50 and 75 figs 3 5 in this study yield did not substantially increase at irf 2 when compared to irf 4 triggered by pasw of 50 and 75 this was because the optimal irrigation requirement for maize was met under this scenario beyond which yield did not substantially increase with further increase in irrigation figs 3 5 there were no substantial differences in maize yield among irf 2 irf 4 and irf 7 under pasw 75 irrespective of soil type in majority of the seasons figs 3 5 however average long term 1981 2010 yield decreased by approximately 1000 kg ha for irf 7 triggered by pasw 75 when compared to that for irf 2 and irf 4 under richfield silt loam and valent fine sand soils whereas yield substantially decreased when irrigation trigger pasw was at 5 compared to others figs 3 5 kisekka et al 2016 conducted maize irrigation scheduling simulations based on pasw 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 on ulysses silt loam they found almost similar yield under pasw in the range from 50 to 80 however they found some yield differences between 50 and 30 pasw although we found considerable yield difference on average at least by 1600 kg ha between 25 and 50 pasw any decrease in plant available soil water below 50 during the critical maize growing period should have substantially decreased maize yield beyond this level we did further investigation to understand what could have caused the unexpected yield level for pasw 25 and found that nitrogen has partly contributed in addition the model has applied 9 13 irrigations per season depending on soils and irfs which justifies the simulated yield level was reasonable although the impacts of water stress shocks on yield were not appreciably as expected kisekka et al 2016 also simulated average yield values at pasw 30 similar to that simulated in this study however caution may be needed with maize under pasw 25 irrigation trigger as simulated maize yields are not as low as expected on the other hand higher pasw above 75 may result in too many irrigations per season which is not practical under western kansas conditions for example irrigation strategy based on irf 2 and irf 4 triggered by pasw 75 resulted in an average of up to 22 irrigations per growing season application of too many irrigations increases the cost of production and might cause yield loss due to aeration stress and leaching of nitrogen depending on nature of the soil type among the irrigation frequency scenarios irf 9 showed substantially lower yield under most pasw tested in this study this could be because the increasing time between irrigation events especially around reproductive and grain filling stage can reduce yield significantly cakir 2004 farre and faci 2009 comas et al 2019 in this study irf 4 had the highest yield and wp if pasw 50 was used as the threshold figs 3 5 tables 3 and 4 irf 7 was better than irf 2 in terms of irrigation water saving for maize grown in ulysses silt loam 3 3 yield irrigation frequency there was a moderate to weak curvilinear relationship r2 0 2 0 8 between yield and irrigation under all soils when the regressions were made by irf regardless of pasw fig 6 a c due to year to year climate variability the amount of irrigation needed to achieve maximum yield at the study site varied substantially the simulated maximum yields corresponded to irrigation amounts of 300 700 mm 300 600 mm and 300 500 mm for richfield silt loam ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand soils respectively fig 6a c lamm et al 2007 reported a strong polynomial relationship between maize yield and irrigation capacity farre and faci 2009 also reported a non linear relationship between irrigation and maize yield unlike the long term 1981 2010 seasonal yield and irrigation by irf mentioned above the regression between long term average yield and irrigation by irf and pasw produced a strong quadratic polynomial relationship r2 0 99 for all soils fig 6d f which produced more consistent predictive trend compared to that presented by irf fig 6a c similarly klocke et al 2011 and trout and dejonge 2017 obtained curvilinear relationship between yield and irrigation yield increased with an increase in irrigation and maximized approximately at 400 and 450 mm in fine sand and silt loam soils respectively fig 6d f klocke et al 2011 reported that yield variabilities decreased with increase in irrigation which is consistent with our finding yield start to gradually decline with further increase in irrigation above 550 and 450 in silt loam richfield and ulysses silt loam and fine sand soils respectively fig 6d f tolk et al 2012 reported that about 750 mm or more water is required to achieve maximum maize yield in northwest texas which has a slightly different climate relative to west kansas araya et al 2017c reported that an average of 450 mm irrigation was optimal for maize in western kansas maize yield in the western corn belt ranged from 9500 to 17200 kg ha with an average of 13000 kg ha sadras et al 2015 these yield levels are within the range of our simulated values for western kansas in addition yield value obtained at the experiment station at the same site was similar to our simulated yield values oker 2018 under pasw 50 and 75 irrigation trigger scenario on average the model applied irrigation of 390 670 292 557 and 274 450 mm for maize grown in richfield and ulysses silt loam and valent sand soils respectively fig 7a c tables 3 and 4 this indicates maize grown on valent fine sand soils require relatively less irrigation compared to richfield and ulysses silt loam soils this study showed that the number of irrigations increased with decrease irrigation interval between applications accordingly the number of irrigation events under irf 2 reached on average up to 22 for irrigation trigger of pasw 75 whereas the number of irrigation events under irf 9 triggered by pasw 75 were on average between 13 and 15 as mentioned in sections above irrigation amount may vary from season to season due to climate variability but generally irrigation increase as time between irrigation interval decreases klocke et al 2011 araya et al 2017c reported a maximum of 18 19 irrigation events for irf 5 with a total amount of 450 475 mm to produce maximum maize yield at finney county in western kansas kisekka et al 2016 also verified that 14 17 irrigation events each 25 mm triggered at pasw 50 might suffice for optimizing maize yield in western kansas the number of irrigation events peaked at each irf when irrigation trigger based on pasw 75 which increased yield due to increase in irrigation water although yield values were not substantially higher compared to pasw 50 under irf 4 the lowest number of irrigation events 4 6 totals corresponded to irf 9 and irf 7 at pasw of 5 table 2 at times when irrigation water is limited growth stage based irrigation such as reducing irrigation to less critical growth stages late vegetative stage while applying optimal irrigation to critical stages as presented in comas et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 might be beneficial kisekka et al 2016 suggested terminating irrigation at 90 95 days after maize was planted in finney county in western kansas to increase the net return the number of irrigation events depends on the et demand of the crop and the irrigation capacity required in meeting a defined yield goal lamm et al 2007 reported that the minimum irrigation capacity for potential maximum maize yield in northwest kansas could reach about 6 4 mm day which is equivalent to irrigating every 4 days based on a 25 mm per irrigation event 3 4 yield et relations the relationship between yield and et regression of grain yield with et by irf regardless of pasw was quadratic polynomial r2 0 61 0 66 fig 8a for richfield silt loam while the relationship was linear for ulysses silt loam and fine sand r2 0 74 fig 8b and c in contrast the relationship between yield and et was curvilinear when the long term yield and irrigation were averaged by irf and pasw irrigation triggers fig 8d f yield increased with et up to 700 mm which then curved with further increase in et above this level fig 8a d f similarly trout and dejonge 2017 and comas et al 2019 reported a curvilinear relationship between yield and et in contrast many other studies in the past reported a linear relationship between yield and et payero et al 2006 klocke et al 2011 in this study averaging long term yield and et by irf and pasw normalized the difference and smoothened the trend to produce a strong curvilinear r2 0 90 relationship for all soils fig 8d f lower et and yield corresponded to irf 9 and irf 7 conditions triggered by pasw 5 fig 8d f the highest yield of maize corresponded to et levels of 694 738 mm 650 711 mm and 625 645 mm in richfield silt loam ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand soils respectively fig 8d f tables 3 and 4 araya et al 2017c reported et of 662 714 mm in silt loam soils in finney county kansas although the soils and climate of texas are slightly different from kansas the et of drought tolerant maize hybrids were grown under optimal water availability at etter texas were reported to use et of 675 mm to produce maximum yield hao et al 2015 recent studies in central high plain obtained water production functions of 2 kg m3 at full irrigation and rapidly declines when et is reduced by more than 25 and reaches 0 kg m3 when et is reduced by about 60 when it reaches at 40 of the maximum et trout and dejonge 2017 the finding is partially close to the experimental data 2008 2011 presented by varzi et al 2019 3 5 water productivities this study showed that wp expressed in kg ha mm of maize was highest when pasw 50 were used as a trigger of irrigation fig 9a c tables 3 and 4 the lowest wp of maize was simulated for pasw of 5 fig 9a c tables 3 and 4 the highest maize wp was simulated for irf 2 and irf 4 26 kg ha mm followed by irf 7 25 kg ha mm considering pasw of 50 there was no substantial difference in wp among the irfs for valent fine sand and ulysses silt loam soils the wp for irf 7 13 25 kg ha mm and irf 9 13 23 kg ha mm for each corresponding pasw were similar across soil type scenarios fig 9a c tables 3 and 4 these wp results are similar to those reported by dejonge et al 2012 dejonge et al 2012 conducted an experiment in colorado and obtained wp between 16 7 and 21 and 17 3 25 8 kg ha mm for maize grown under full and limited irrigation respectively the highest wp was simulated for ulysses silt loams and valent fine sand while the lowest was simulated for richfield silt loam soils tables 3 and 4 this was due to a substantial increase in et with richfield compared to ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand whereas yield for the ulysses silt loam was relatively higher than with richfield silt loam soils in contrast tolk et al 2012 reported that wp decreased from coarse to fine textured soils mainly due to differences in et rather than grain yield oker 2018 reported wp ranges of 22 27 kg ha mm for finney county maize kansas these values are in the range of wp values simulated in this study tables 3 and 4 kisekka et al 2016 obtained maximum maize yield per unit of et under 50 pasw maize iwp can be as high as 50 kg ha mm lamm et al 2007 the highest iwp was simulated for irfs triggered by pasw of 25 for ulysses silt soils 33 kg ha mm under irf 7 tables 3 and 4 relatively low iwp was simulated for pasw of 75 under ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand while the highest was simulated under pasw of 25 tables 3 and 4 the lowest iwp was simulated for pasw 5 under richfield silt loam 1 3 rogers and lamm 2012 reported a substantial maize yield increase over the 1974 2010 period partly due to improved irrigation practices by approximately 157 kg ha year or 2 5 bu acre year which resulted in a substantial increase in iwp for maize in western kansas sadras et al 2015 provided a review on the overall maize yield per amount of irrigation in midwestern us corn belt when corrected for impacts of rainfall with values ranged from 27 to 32 kg ha mm in agreement with the results obtained for ulysses silt loam and valent fine sand soils further detailed economic analysis of our research results is needed to evaluate the cost benefit value for the various irrigation triggers 3 6 the effect of irrigation scenarios on profitability studies showed that irrigation capacity and profitability are the most important decision making component for farming in western kansas kisekka et al 2016 araya et al 2019 2021 rouhi rad et al 2020 araya et al 2021 conducted economic analysis for multiple irrigation and pasw treatments some of them closely match to the current study e g irf 2 irf 4 irf 8 and irf 10 in combination with irrigation trigger 25 pasw 55 pasw and 75 pasw and reported relatively high average return after variable cost 700 ha for maize treated with high irrigation capacity 25 mm 4 day while low return after variable cost 400 ha values were reported to correspond to low irrigation capacity 25 mm 10 day regardless of the irrigation trigger rouhi rad et al 2020 analyzed crop yield and profits of maize wheat and grain sorghum under five different soil types at the same site western kansas under similar treatment setup and showed that lower irrigation capacities result in lower profit while higher irrigation capacities resulted in relatively higher profit for example a well capacity of 6540 m3 day and 1090 m3 day could generate an average maize wheat and grain sorghum profit of about 939 ha and 692 ha 791 ha and 669 ha and 383 ha and 259 ha respectively rouhi rad et al 2020 even though the return from maize slightly increases with irrigation at present many of the wells in western kansas are not able to meet the required irrigation water needs of the crop therefore crop producers need to look at other alternative crops and cropping systems in order to maintain the sustainability of water resources in the region 3 7 implementation assumptions and limitations in kansas irrigation scheduling strategy based on estimates of available soil water and or cumulative et to keep the soil water above the critical level has been practiced by many producers however since the irrigation capacity is limited in many areas of southwestern kansas evaluating irrigation scheduling strategies that considers percentages of plant available soil water as thresholds for initiating irrigation under a given irrigation frequency as presented in this study would help producers identify the most suitable irrigation option this kind of evaluation helps to explore suitable irrigation strategies that meet the targeted yield while optimizing resources and enhancing environmental sustainability the lower the irrigation capacity the longer the irrigation frequency unless the size of the irrigable area is decreased likewise longer irrigation frequency could decrease the pasw below the threshold level therefore the scheduling opens up for an opportunity to test and evaluate for broad ranges of irrigation water management options in order to maintain yield while enhancing water productivity which might eventually contribute to lengthen the life of the aquifer one of the limitations of this study is that the soil water is reinitiated at the beginning of every season with pasw of 60 despite the weather and soil variabilities however the accuracy of the simulation might not substantially affected because i some data not published indicated that the soil water at time of planting is in the range between 55 and 68 and the model was initially calibrated based on that information ii the simulation was set on seasonal mode the initial soil water was reinitiated at equal soil water status for all scenarios in order to evaluate the scenarios without bias to reduce the treatment bias iii even if weather is variable planting maize by may 15 is highly likely because planting window for maize at the study site was reported to be in the range between apr 15 and may 20 shroyer et al 1996 another limitation is that agronomic management e g fertilization planting density planting date was assumed similar throughout the long term seasons 1981 2010 which is very unlikely to follow the same management practice continuously for 30 years period in addition the irf 2 and pasw 5 are not common practices in western kansas for maize however the irf 2 and pasw 5 were included to demonstrate how irrigation water use and yield would change under extremely lower and higher irrigation assumptions respectively furthermore implementations of this irrigation scheduling strategy may require automatic plant available soil water sensors to communicate with the irrigation control system depending on irrigation technology which may be expensive furthermore soil type might also significantly affect the irrigation scheduling some of the scenarios may need continuous irrigation which might be unrealistic because center pivot may require maintenance during the growing season other limitations such as the cultivar must be calibrated based on site data which may be time taking apart from that as irrigation capacity is a major constraint this kind of simulation study could provide producers with broader options to deal with site specific water management related challenges in addition this approach could help producers and agronomists to gain important information relevant to water use and yield a head of time which may be also extended to various application such as in developing economic and marketing strategy 4 conclusions maintaining higher irrigation frequencies up to 25 mm 4 day under irrigation trigger of 50 psaw could optimize yield and water productivity we found that maize yield increases with an increase in irrigation and maximized approximately at 400 450 mm regardless of the soil type however producer decision on irrigation scheduling and cropping system might depend on well capacity pumping rate since maize is sensitive to water stress producers should know their well capacity before allocating area for maize under lower well capacity producers should reduce maize area while increasing area for crop that require lower irrigation frequency in places where well capacity is high center pivot should be set to apply irrigation in targeted area to meet the required irrigation frequency 25 mm 4 day to optimize yield and water use however since the groundwater in the southwest kansas part of the ogallala region is declining we suggest considering long term environmental sustainability yield stability and longer term profitability issues when selecting suitable crops and managing irrigation water the irrigation scheduling technique developed in this study might be more suitable when combined with the use of accurate in season weather forecast and precision soil water measuring devises which might reduce unnecessary irrigations application as irrigation scheduling based on long term weather data could substantially differ from the actual season we believe that these types of simulation study could provide producers with choices to evaluate and prioritize the most suitable crops and irrigation strategy under water limited conditions declaration of competing interest the

10222,crop production in the north china plain ncp is heavily influenced by the unfolding climate change and water shortage groundwater overdraft for irrigation in this region has caused serious ecological and environmental problems cropping systems adjustment offers an effective approach for the sustainable use of groundwater however the assessment of the impacts of future climate change on crop production and water consumption under different cropping systems with without straw mulching has not been reported in the ncp in this study we applied the well validated apsim model to explore the implementation of five cropping systems i e two maturities per year 1y2ms0 three maturities per two year without with straw mulching during the fallow period 2y3ms0 2y3ms1 and one maturity per year without with straw mulching during the fallow period 1y1ms0 1y1ms1 statistical downscaled daily climate data based on 33 global climate models gcms were used to drive apsim to simulate crop phenology yield and water use under future climate change we found that cropping system adjustment significantly reduced the amount of water required for irrigation thereby decreasing groundwater overdraft to a certain extent straw mulching could have mitigating effect on groundwater overdraft multi gcms ensemble means show an increase in temperature precipitation and solar radiation in the future under future climate change scenarios the phenological date e g flower and maturity dates of maize and wheat were advanced due to climate warming our simulated results indicated that future climate change would have negative impact on maize yield across all cropping systems but have positive impact on wheat yield under most climate change scenarios both irrigation and groundwater overdraft reduced in the future due to decreased evapotranspiration and increased precipitation we concluded that 2y3ms1 would be the optimum cropping system to balance crop yield and groundwater overdraft this knowledge can inform the development of improved regional impact assessments of the sustainability of multi crop rotation systems keywords cropping system groundwater overdraft straw mulching apsim model future climate scenario 1 introduction rising concentrations of greenhouse gas mainly co2 are increasing global surface temperature and altering spatiotemporal pattern of precipitation piao et al 2010 this warming will have a severe impact on global crop yields due to the high dependence of agriculture on climate teixeira et al 2018 additionally many studies predict that unabated climate change will exacerbate global water scarcity piao et al 2010 which is another vital factor for crop productivity xiong et al 2010 in china global climate models gcms indicate that future climate warming will be accompanied by changes in precipitation amount and pattern tao and zhang 2010 however there remains considerable variation in the impacts on grain yields and water availability due to the uncertainty surrounding the impacts of climate change araya et al 2015 therefore further assessments and predictions of the response of crops and even cropping systems to future climate changes are required to support policy decisions and identify adaptation responses xiong et al 2010 the north china plain ncp is the main base of china s grain production with a winter wheat and summer maize rotation as the dominant cropping system gao et al 2015 producing about 33 of the maize and 50 of wheat in the country chinese agriculture press 2016 the average annual precipitation in the ncp is only around 500 600 mm annual crop evapotranspiration et could be as high as 800 900 mm chen et al 2007 and irrigation has become an inevitable way to ensure crop water supply particularly for winter wheat this is because the winter wheat growth period occurs in the lowest rainfall months of the year zhang et al 2016 groundwater is a significant source of irrigation water due to the lack of surface water resource xiao et al 2017 over recent decades intensive crop cultivation and increasing agricultural production have led to serious overexploitation of groundwater and the continuous decline in groundwater level across the ncp sun et al 2019 also the rapid decline in groundwater table has worsened the local environmental conditions in turn threatening sustainable agricultural irrigation in the plain zhang et al 2017 therefore the nexus between agricultural production and water use is threatening the long term availability of water resources and is now a key concern for sustainable crop production in this plain the situation in the ncp requires an analysis of the trade offs between crop production and groundwater sustainability liang et al 2019 the adoption of water saving measures that reduce irrigation in this region is critical to limit groundwater drawdown and to attain sustainable groundwater use zhao et al 2018 to address the irrigation water shortage studies based on field experiments have focused on the optimization of irrigation strategies such as critical period irrigation deficit irrigation and drip irrigation zhang et al 2016 fang et al 2018 reported that increased irrigation frequency could maintain higher water content in the topsoil layer improving crop yield and water use under limited water supply zhang et al 2006 found that water use efficiency wue increased by 10 20 under minimum irrigation irrigating applied at only upper root zone to field capacity just before sowing compared to conventional irrigation practice however this strategy also had yield decreases of 14 for both wheat and maize yan et al 2020 indicated that a minimum irrigation strategy had the potential to maintain the groundwater balance with higher grain production and wue under current and future climates however these studies did not consider that in some extremely dry years the lack of irrigation during wheat growth period could result in extremely low yields or even zero yields which was unacceptable to farmers although adjusting irrigation strategies could reduce et and improve wue sun et al 2019 total agricultural water consumption has remained high and the groundwater level has continued to drop due to the continuous increase in grain yield liang et al 2019 sun et al 2015 reduction of crop areas under high consumptive water is another strategy to decrease agricultural water use in water scarce environments luo et al 2018 several studies have evaluated the effects of cropping system shift on crop production and water consumption employing field experiments and or crop model simulations van oort et al 2016 for example xiao et al 2017 found that three crops per two year winter wheat and summer maize followed by fallow and early maize during two consecutive years was an effective cropping system to maintain a balance between crop yield and water use cui et al 2019 indicated mono cropped maize was an effective measure that can resolve the current environmental pressure caused by conventional wheat maize rotation system in the ncp however soil moisture during the period of abandonment of winter wheat i e fallow period was inefficient as it was lost through soil evaporation es xiao et al 2017 to some extent covering the soil with straw straw mulching during fallow period can effectively reduce soil evaporation and conserve soil moisture chen et al 2007 several studies have used straw from a previous crop as a mulch to examine the impacts on water use yield and greenhouse gas emissions in subsequent crops zhang et al 2005 hu et al 2016 the practice of straw mulching could reduce soil evaporation by about 40 for winter wheat and by about 56 for summer maize zhang et al 2016 alternatively straw on the soil surface during crop growth period regulates soil temperature which in turn influences crop phenology and yield chen et al 2007 currently there have been few studies on the effects of straw mulching during fallow period on the crop yield and water use in the ncp sustainable crop productivity and water use under climate change was a major research priority gao et al 2015 climate changes including increased temperatures changes in seasonal precipitation amount and patterns and elevated atmospheric co2 concentration co2 have important impacts on crop productivity and water use asseng et al 2019 generally elevated co2 is expected to enhance photosynthesis and reduce crop water use related studies indicated that rising co2 could significantly reduce the yield losses caused by climate change while reducing consumptive water use deryng et al 2016 however the effects of elevated co2 increased temperature and precipitation on crop yield has been less reported for different cropping systems in the ncp mo et al 2009 moreover the assessment of the impacts of future climate change on grain yield and water use under different cropping systems with without straw mulching has not been reported in the ncp climate change impact assessment can indicate effective responses and help plan adaptation response to inform policy decisions that will strengthen sustainable agricultural production to meet future food supply challenges in this study we aimed to quantify crop yield and water use change under future climate change scenarios and propose the optimum cropping system to reduce water use and maximize crop yield our main objectives were 1 to assess the characteristics of crop yield and water use under different cropping systems including the incorporation of straw mulch 2 to evaluate the impact of future climate change on crop yield and water use under different cropping systems 3 to quantify the relationship between crop yield et change and climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and field experiments the ncp study area lies between 31 24 42 42 n and 110 18 122 42 e the mean annual temperature in the region is 8 15 c with hot and wet summers and cold and dry winters mean annual precipitation across the plain is 500 600 mm of which more than 70 of the amount falls between july and september the main soil type in the ncp is of aeolian origin deposited by rivers over geological periods this plain has a reliance on irrigation to support an intensive double cropping rotation system of winter wheat and summer maize xiao and tao 2014 in this study we conducted two field experiments double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize and mono cropping system of early maize at luancheng agro ecological experimental station laes 37 53 n 114 41 e and altitude 50 1 m one of 34 agricultural ecosystem stations in the china ecological research network laes is a typically representative site of the agricultural production in ncp two field experiments were conducted at laes to represent the different cropping systems double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize and mono cropping system of early maize investigated in this study the experiment for the double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize were conducted in 2010 2013 the cultivars of summer maize and winter wheat were zd958 and kn199 respectively before sowing of summer maize the soil was manually treated with nitrogen n and phosphorus p fertilizers at 150 ha 1 n and 120 kg ha 1 p2o5 during the growth period of summer maize irrigation was done 1 2 times with average of 60 80 mm before sowing of winter wheat the soil was manually conducted with n and p fertilizers at 180 ha 1 n and 160 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 150 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer was added at jointing stage during the growth period of winter wheat irrigation was done 4 6 times with average of 60 80 mm the other field experiment was conducted in 2014 2016 to examine phenology yield et and soil water of early maize for the selected cultivar xianyu335 the sowing dates sd of early maize in 2014 2015 and 2016 were may 13 may 4 and may 9 respectively during the growth period of early maize irrigation was conducted 2 4 times before sowing of early maize the soil was conducted with n p and potassium k fertilizers at 180 kg ha 1 150 kg ha 1 k2o and 150 kg ha 1 p2o5 respectively another 180 kg ha 1 n was conducted at jointing in the both above experiments we monitored regularly the soil volumetric water content svwc every 7 days by using neutron probes 0 2 m intervals in 0 2 m below the soil surface we computed the crop et and groundwater drainage using the water balance method we used observed phenology yield and water use from these field experiments to calibrate and validate agricultural production systems simulator apsim model due to the availability of data on future climate scenario we used the past and future climate data from the shijiazhuang site sjz 38 03 n 114 42 e to drive the apsim model 2 2 climate projections observed climate data were collected for the period 1981 2010 for sjz site and obtained from china s meteorological administration cma the daily climate data included maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature t min sunshine hours sh and precipitation prec we calculated daily solar radiation rad for this study site from the daily sh using the angstom prescott equation prescott 1940 there are over 60 gcms that contributed to the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 from world climate research program wcrp the gcms projected data from an ensemble of multiple models were often used to deal with the uncertainties associated with single gcm liu et al 2017 we used 33 gcms table 1 with the simulated monthly data available for two representative concentration pathways rcps i e rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 which were required to be downscaled to the daily climate sequences for driving apsim model both of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were chosen because they more closely represent current socio economic conditions of radiative forcing and have completed data for monthly gcms projections xiao et al 2020a we used nwai wg statistical downscaling method which was developed by liu and zuo 2012 to downscale the monthly climate data from the 33 gcms to the daily data for driving apsim model this downscaling approach consisted of three steps spatial downscaling bias correction and temporal downscaling liu and zuo 2012 spatial downscaling involved downscaling monthly projections of rad t max t min and prec from gcm gridded values to target sites by an inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method the spatial downscaled monthly data for the site were followed by bias correction using a qq mapping technique to establish a function to enable the gcms projected monthly data in the historical period 1961 2010 to match the observed monthly values of the site and then applied the relationship to correct the biases in the gcm projected data the qq mapping technique is a probability plot for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other i e the baseline for gcms projections against the observed baseline climate the important feature of this method is the resultant bias corrected monthly sequences remained in the gcm simulated interannual variations for the period 1961 2100 the next step was the temporal downscaling for daily sequences using a modified weather generator wgen liu and zuo 2012 the generated daily sequences would not necessarily equate to the targeted value in a single run because of the random nature of the stochastic wgen this meant that the generated results could modify the change in the gcm projections hence introducing additional downscaling uncertainty to overcome the problem of modified change from gcm projections liu and zuo 2012 introduced an evaluation procedure to assess the generated values and outputted the run when the generated sum of the daily sequences matched the gcm projected monthly value difference being less than a given small value therefore downscaled daily rad t max t min and prec sequences would not only remain the gcm projected monthly values but also preserve the gcm projected interannual variations in the future climate 2 3 apsim model introduction and settings the apsim is a biophysical model developed to simulate cropping systems apsim accurately integrates predictions of crop phenology yield and water use in response to management measure and climate condition o leary et al 2016 holzworth et al 2014 this model can consider the response of cropping systems to soil conditions mainly soil water and nitrogen weather variables solar radiation temperature precipitation and co2 and management sd irrigation set fertilization option tillage operation residue management and cultivar selection brown et al 2014 we used apsim version 7 7 to assess the impact of future climate change on crop growth and water use under different cropping systems based on local irrigation management we set an automatic irrigation module in apsim model the irrigation is defined as 1 i r r 0 p a w c s w today 80 mm p a w c s w today p a w c s w today 80 mm where irr is irrigation amount sw today is soil water in each day and pawc is the plant available water holding capacity runoff following light precipitation events does not generally occur and excess water in soil surface will infiltrate into soil due to the relatively flat nature of the ncp xiao et al 2020b refer to the characteristics of the relationship between precipitation and runoff crop model simulated runoff was set as eq 2 2 i r r r u n o f f r u n o f f r u n o f f 50 0 mm 87 5 r u n o f f 37 5 r u n o f f r u n o f f 50 0 mm where irr runoff is the irrigation amount from runoff groundwater overdraft od was used to assess the impact of alternative cropping systems on groundwater od is calculated as 3 o d i r r d where d is the drainage amount of water to groundwater we used straw mulching during fallow period with the amount of straw related to the amount of harvested crop i e maize stubble prior to the fallow period when straw yield biomass minus grain yield was less than 9000 kg ha 1 straw mulching was deemed equal to harvested straw if straw yield was more than 9000 kg ha 1 the amount of straw mulching is capped 4 s t r a w i n p u t s t r a w h a r v e s t s t r a w h a r v e s t 9000 0 k g h a 1 9000 0 s t r a w h a r v e s t 9000 0 k g

in cmip5 we fitted annual average co2 values by empirical equations eqs 5 and 6 were used to compute annual co2 for rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively 5 co2 y 650 18 0 000075326 y 0 16276 0 00022299 727

to evaluate yield and water consumption characteristics for different cropping systems under historical climatic conditions and future climate scenarios the scenarios were 1 two maturity in one year consisting of summer maize and winter wheat in a double cropping system without straw mulching 1y2ms0 2 three maturity during two years consisting of winter wheat and summer maize followed by fallow and early maize without straw mulching 2y3ms0 3 three maturity during two years consisting of winter wheat and summer maize followed by fallow and early maize with straw mulching during fallow period 2y3ms1 4 one maturity per year consisting of early maize mono cropping system without straw mulching 1y1ms0 and 5 one maturity per year consisting of early maize mono cropping system with straw mulching during fallow period 1y1ms1 fig 1 we calibrated and validated the parameters in apsim model for summer maize zd958 early maize xy335 and winter wheat kn199 based on the observed data from the above cropping systems experiment the model performance was evaluated using coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse the validated apsim was run for baseline period 1981 2010 for both observed and downscaled climate and two future time periods of 2031 2060 2040s and 2071 2100 2080s under two rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios based on long term observed records for maize and wheat phenology in the ncp sd for summer maize and winter wheat in these simulations were set at jun 15 and oct 5 respectively sd for early maize was set at may 10 about 35 days earlier than that of summer maize xiao et al 2017 about 150 180 and 210 kg ha 1 n was applied at sowing and 90 120 and 120 kg ha 1 at jointing stage for summer maize early maize and winter wheat respectively the gcm projected crop outputs y gcm and the changes δy gcm were calculated as the following equations which involved in a secondary bias correction 7 y g c m s g c m s b l s o b 8 δ y g c m s g c m s b l s o

calibration and validation overall the field observed and model simulated dates of phenological dates e g anthesis date and maturity date yield et and drainage agreed well in the study site fig 2 the differences between the observed and simulated dates of phenology including flowering and maturity were on average less than 5 d r 2 values for simulated phenology dates exceeded 0 80 fig 2 the average difference between the observed and simulated crop yields was less than 10 of the observed values with r 2 for simulated yield exceeding 0 90 fig 2 the differences of et and drainage between the observed and simulated were small fig 2 the corresponding rmse was in 10 33 mm and r 2 values exceeded 0 87 therefore the overall results of the apsim model simulation of maize and wheat phenology yield and water use i e et and drainage were reliable and therefore can be used confidently in following climate change analysis the parameter values for apsim model in this study for maize i e summer maize and early maize and winter wheat are shown in tables s1 and s2 respectively 3 2 gcms projected future climate change future climate change was projected for two rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 using 33 gcms ensembles all the gcm simulated future temperatures tmax and tmin significantly increased fig 3a b the magnitude of increase in tmax and tmin under rcp8 5 was greater than that under rcp4 5 especially in the 2080 s multi gcms ensemble means indicated that tmax tmin increased by 1 37 1 44 2 02 2 14 1 79 1 91 and 3 87 4 12 c in the rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s and rcp8 5 2080s respectively for rad most of the gcms simulations showed increasing trends in the future with average rad increasing across the gcms of 1 3 and 3 4 in the 2040s and 0 7 and 1 9 in the 2080s under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 3c moreover most of the gcms simulations showed an increasing trend in future precipitation fig 3d across the gcms prec increased by 9 9 14 3 11 2 and 23 4 under rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s and rcp8 5 2080s respectively fig 3d 3 3 crop phenology change under future climate scenarios summer maize early maize flowering date fd advanced by 2 2 2 9 d 3 6 4 5 d in the 2040s and 3 2 4 9 d 5 1 7 6 d in the 2080s maturity date md of summer maize early maize shifted earlier by 7 1 8 9 d 9 3 11 5 d in the 2040s and 9 6 14 0 d 12 5 18 3 d in the 2080s fig 4 the number of days of advancement for wheat phenology i e fd and md was much greater than that of maize fd of wheat advanced by 13 5 18 2 d in the 2040s and 20 6 41 9 d in the 2080s wheat md shifted earlier by 12 0 15 5 d in the 2040s and 17 3 32 3 d in the 2080s fig 4 the advances in fd shortened the vegetative growth period vgp and earlier md shortened the whole growth period wgp for both maize and wheat because sd was unchanged in the two future periods however the length of reproductive growth period rgp is determined by the magnitude of advance in fd and md multi gcms ensemble means show that the rgp of summer maize early maize shortened by 4 8 5 7 days in 2040s and 6 3 7 4 d in 2080s under rcp4 5 and by 6 0 7 1 days in 2040s and 9 1 10 7 d in 2080s under rcp8 5 fig 4 rgp of winter wheat was expected to extend by 1 4 2 7 3 3 and 9 5 d under the 2040s rcp4 5 2040s rcp8 5 2080s rcp4 5 and 2080s rcp8 5 respectively because the days in advance for md were less than that for fd fig 4 3 4 grain yield change under future climate scenarios the simulated yields for maize and wheat were different under various cropping systems fig 5a b for 1y2ms0 the average yield of maize and wheat was 8 0 and 7 2 t ha 1 respectively if 1y2ms0 was replaced by 2y3ms0 the average yield of maize increased to 9 6 t ha 1 and wheat yield declined to 3 6 t ha 1 therefore replacement of 2y3ms0 with 1y2ms0 system increased maize yield by 20 at the expense of almost half of the wheat yield the yield of mono cropped maize with early sowing 1y1ms0 or 1y1ms1 reached to 11 5 t ha 1 when winter wheat was completely abandoned fig 5a this means that maize yield increased by around 60 without wheat yield moreover the simulated results indicated that using straw mulch during fallow period had no significant effect on maize and wheat yield fig 5a b the impacts of future climate change on wheat and maize yield were quite different fig 5c d future climate change predicted a negative impact on maize yield for most of gcms across the five cropping systems multi gcms ensemble means showed that maize yield would decrease by 4 1 9 1 2 3 15 6 2 4 15 5 1 5 15 5 and 1 6 16 3 in 1y2ms0 2y3ms0 2y3ms1 1y1ms0 and 1y1ms1 respectively moreover maize yield declined much more under rcp8 5 2080s than that under other climate scenarios regardless of cropping systems fig 5c multi gcms ensemble means showed that future climate change will exert positive effects by 2 8 5 6 on wheat yield for any cropping system in rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s and rcp8 5 2040s however wheat yield would decrease by around 5 3 under rcp8 5 2080s across three cropping systems fig 5d the relationship between crop yield change and climatic change is given in table 2 wheat yield was significantly positively correlated with temperature but maize yield was significantly negatively correlated with temperature table 2 moreover the yields of maize and wheat were significantly positively correlated with co2 radiation and precipitation 3 5 water use under future climate scenarios under different cropping systems there were some differences in soil evaporation es crop transpiration ep and total evapotranspiration et sum of es and ep fig 6 for the whole rotation year es was highest under 1y2ms0 reaching 285 mm es was slightly reduced by changing the cropping systems from 1y2ms0 to 2y3ms0 or 1y1ms0 fig 6a under 2y3ms0 es was 270 mm with 15 mm less than that under 1y2ms0 while es was 254 mm under 1y1ms0 showing a reduction of 31 mm compared to the 1y2ms0 fig 6a our simulated results show that straw mulching was important in reducing es under 2y3ms1 1y1ms1 es reduced by 8 21 mm compared to 2y3ms0 1y1ms0 fig 6a crop transpiration ep reduced by changing the cropping systems from 1y2ms0 to 2y3ms0 or to 1y1ms0 fig 6b ep was up to 490 mm for conventional 1y2ms0 ep dropped to 397 and 305 mm respectively when the cropping system was replaced by 2y3ms0 and 1y1ms0 fig 6b straw mulching during fallow period slightly increased crop ep for example ep under 1y1ms1 was 12 mm greater than that under 1y1ms0 fig 6b et was highest under 1y2ms0 with 775 mm followed by 667 mm for 2y3ms0 and 560 mm for 1y1ms0 fig 6c however straw mulching had less effect on et because reduced es and increased ep tend to cancel each other out changes in cropping system which reduced cultivated winter wheat area and advanced sd of maize i e early maize significantly increased the et during the maize growth period et maize et maize was 350 mm under 1y2ms0 and increased to 397 mm under 2y3ms0 and 434 mm under 1y1ms0 fig 7a however the exclusion of wheat in the cropping system reduced wheat growing season et et wheat because of fallow et wheat reached 425 mm under 1y2ms0 but reduced to 270 mm under 2y3ms0 and 126 mm under 1y1ms0 fig 8a straw mulching had marginal effect on et maize fig 7a but reduced et wheat by about 9 mm under 1y1ms1 because it reduced es fig 8a also changing cropping systems reduced the irrigation amount irr fig 6d among the different cropping systems irr was 392 mm under 1y2ms0 282 mm under 2y3ms0 and 173 mm under 1y1ms0 sowing early maize increased the irr during maize growth period irr maize under 1y2ms0 irr maize was 105 mm but increased to 148 mm under 2y3ms0 and to 173 mm under 1y1ms0 fig 7b however changing the cropping system significantly reduced irr during the winter wheat period irr wheat irr wheat was 288 mm under 1y2ms0 but only 134 mm under 2y3ms0 when wheat was completely abandoned 1y1ms0 no irrigation was required fig 8b straw mulching during fallow period had non significant impacts on irr fig 6d groundwater overdraft od was reduced due to the effects of changing cropping system on et and irr under 1y2ms0 od reached 270 mm whereas the od became only 163 mm under 2y3ms0 and 59 mm under 1y1ms0 fig 6e the main reason of this result was that reduction or cessation of winter wheat may greatly reduce od during wheat period od wheat od wheat under 1y2ms0 reached 275 mm but was only 123 mm under 2y3ms0 furthermore replacing 1y2ms0 with 1y1ms0 stopped od and also induced small groundwater recharge of about 14 mm fig 8c however od during maize growth period od maize under 1y2ms0 was minimal only about 5 mm when it changed into 2y3ms0 or 1y1ms0 od maize reached 40 mm or 74 mm respectively fig 7c straw mulching could have mitigative effects on od fig 6e under 1y1ms1 straw mulching appears to reduce od in excess of 10 mm for whole rotation year fig 6e compared to the baseline es increased under future climate scenarios regardless of cropping system the magnitude of es increase in the 2080s was greater than that in the 2040s irrespective of rcps fig 6f however multi gcms ensemble means show that ep decreased across all cropping systems the decline under 1y2ms0 was largest followed by 2y3ms0 2y3ms1 and 1y1ms0 1y1ms1 fig 6g the magnitude of decrease increased with rcps over time in the same cropping system for example ep decreased by 65 82 89 and 176 mm under rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s rcp8 5 2080s under 1y2ms0 respectively the change in et was inconsistent for the five cropping systems under future climate scenario multi gcm ensemble means showed that et decreased in 1y2ms0 2y3ms0 and 2y3ms1 whereas et change in 1y1ms0 and 1y1ms1 depended on future climate scenarios fig 6h specifically the reduction in et maize in the 2080s was greater than that in the 2040s regardless of rcps and the reduction under rcp8 5 was higher than that under rcp4 5 irrespective of periods fig 7d moreover et wheat decreased under 1y2ms0 2y3ms0 and 2y3ms1 with greater reduction under 1y2ms0 than that under 2y3ms0 and 2y3ms1 however et wheat under 1y1ms0 and 1y1ms0 increased in the future climate scenario fig 8d the irr for crops decreased in the future relative to baseline fig 6i the largest decrease in irr occurred in 1y2ms0 under rcp8 5 2080s similarly the od significantly decreased under future climate scenarios across all cropping systems fig 6j there would be no od under 2y3ms0 2y3ms1 1y1ms0 and 1y1ms1 due to increased precipitation and reduced irr in rcp8 5 2080s during the maize growth period irr maize decreased for the different cropping systems in future climate scenarios of these scenarios rcp8 5 2080s had the greatest reduction above 50 mm fig 7e for all the cropping systems od maize reduced significantly fig 7f in some of the scenarios this reduction was higher than the od in the baseline period this result indicated that no od existed under the scenario and that even some groundwater recharge occurred moreover irr wheat decreased under 1y2ms0 2y3ms0 and 2y3ms1 in the future climate scenarios with higher reduction under 1y2ms0 than that under 2y3ms0 and 2y3ms1 under rcp8 5 2080s scenario the reductions were much higher than those under other climate scenarios fig 8e also od wheat decreased in the future climate scenarios under the different cropping systems the greatest reduction was under 1y2ms0 followed by 2y3ms0 2y3ms1 and 1y1ms0 1y1ms0 fig 8f crop et was significantly negatively correlated with co2 but significantly positively correlated with solar radiation table 2 moreover et maize was strongly positively correlated with temperature and et wheat was significantly positively correlated with precipitation table 2 the change of climate variables could explain 76 maize et change and 91 wheat et change 3 6 the relationship between groundwater overdraft and precipitation we established a liner regression model for each cropping system to find out how much precipitation can make groundwater zero overdraft under different cropping systems fig 9 we found a balance between groundwater recharge and use i e zero net use of groundwater could occur under 1y2ms0 with an average annual precipitation of 686 mm fig 9a when this cropping system was replaced by 2y3ms0 the critical value for average precipitation fell to 637 mm 49 mm less than that under 1y2ms0 fig 9b with straw mulching under 2y3ms1 the annual precipitation became 631 mm fig 9c annual precipitation was 577 mm for zero groundwater overdraft if only early maize was cultivated 1y1ms0 fig 9d moreover the application of straw mulching in 1y1ms1 further reduced the need for precipitation 561 mm fig 9e 4 discussion 4 1 climate change and its impacts on crop phenology and yield all 33 gcms used in our study predicted an increased temperature i e tmax and tmin in the future precipitation and radiation are important climate factors to determine crop yield and water use and were also shown to increase in the future for the majority of gcms the above results for future climate changes are similar to the findings by tao and zhang 2010 they showed that both temperature and precipitation were projected to generally increase across the ncp during the period of 2041 2070 as precipitation was projected to increase water stress for crop production in the ncp would likely alleviate under future climate scenarios generally warming temperature resulted in faster plant development and earlier maturity dixit et al 2018 our results indicate a clear impact of climate change on crop phenology mainly driven by increasing temperature which was responsible for early crop maturity under future climatic scenarios there was an apparent advance in fd and md of maize and wheat as a result advance in fd and md in the future would shorten the lengths of vgp and wgp however while that of maize shortened the rgp of winter wheat extended the main reason is that wheat flowering date shifted more than maturity date xiao et al 2013 warming temperatures accelerate phenological development and leaf senescence as a result crops would have less time to intercept light for crop photosynthesis leading to less biomass accumulation and then decreased final yield asseng et al 2019 moreover adverse effects of temperature change on crop yield was determined by the temperature threshold value below or above the optimal temperature for crop growth xiao and tao 2014 our results showed maize yield was significantly negatively correlated with temperature while wheat yield was significantly positively correlated with temperature the main reason is due to the prolonged rgp for wheat a critical period for yield formation while the rgp was shortened for maize under future climate scenarios our simulated results are consistent with the positive effects of increased minimum temperature on the wheat yield based on observed data in tao et al 2017 moreover tao and zhang 2010 reported that maize yield will decrease by 13 2 19 1 in ncp as a result of climate change without adaptation which is similar to our results that maize yield will decrease by 9 1 16 3 under rcp8 5 2080s scenario generally crop productivity benefited from enhanced photosynthesis due to elevated co2 wang et al 2017 in our study the regression analyses suggested that increases in atmospheric co2 contributed notably to maize and wheat yield table 2 moreover as a c4 crop the response of maize photosynthesis to elevated co2 was much less than that of wheat c3 crop ainsworth and long 2005 although co2 had less effect on maize photosynthesis elevated co2 indirectly increased photosynthesis and grain yield by reducing water use and mitigating drought stress through reducing stomatal conductance and transpiration rate ghannoum et al 2000 4 2 crop water consumption in different cropping systems under future climate change scenarios generally the rise in temperature leads to a shortening of the crop growth period which tends to reduce the transpiration of the crop ep during the growing period xiao and tao 2014 our results showed that ep decreased across all the cropping systems under future climate scenarios however soil evaporation es is mainly determined by temperature and soil moisture zhang et al 2017 therefore warming temperature under the future climate scenarios will cause a significantly rise in es tao et al 2003 water consumption et is composed of es and ep and changes of et under future climate scenarios depend on the magnitude of ep and es changes tao and zhang 2010 our results showed et decreased across most cropping systems under future climate scenarios and indicated that crop water consumption or water requirement reduces in the future climate scenario which is consistent with the result of tao and zhang 2010 the reduction of et caused by the shortening of crop growth period may mitigate the looming water crisis in the future tao et al 2003 due to the decrease in crop ep water requirement for crop irrigation under the future climate scenarios significantly decreased for all the investigated cropping systems furthermore the groundwater overdraft significantly decreased across all five cropping systems as a result of increased precipitation in the future however the shortening of the growth period is often accompanied by a decrease in crop yield es increased due to warming climate under the future climate scenario and it would likely increase the inefficient loss of agricultural water resources conversely elevated co2 benefited crop yield and also potentially decreased crop water consumption ep by reducing leaf level transpiration and enhancing photosynthesis xiong et al 2010 we found that both maize and wheat et were significantly negatively correlated with co2 we propose that elevated co2 in future climate scenarios can effectively reduce the et of the whole cropping system 4 3 how to balance wheat yield and groundwater overdraft changing cropping system from 1y2ms0 to 2y3ms0 or 1y1ms0 could significantly reduce the amount of irrigation thereby reducing groundwater overdraft xiao et al 2017 in our study overdraft was 270 mm under conventional 1y2ms0 but would decrease to 163 and 59 mm under 2y3ms0 and 1y1ms0 respectively the groundwater overdraft could be effectively mitigated by a change in cropping system where winter wheat is foregone for one or two seasons however crop yield under various cropping systems was significantly different liang et al 2019 our results indicate that if the 1y2ms0 was replaced by 2y3ms0 or 1y1ms0 maize yield increased by 20 60 but wheat yield would be halved or lost completely therefore balancing crop yields and water use to ensure regional food security and sustainable groundwater use is particularly important for sustainable development of agriculture in the ncp zhao et al 2018 moreover we found that the balance between groundwater recharge and use i e overdraft equal to zero could exist with an annual precipitation of 686 mm under 1y2ms0 according the current annual precipitation of less than 500 mm in the study site this result indicates that even if precipitation increased by 9 9 23 4 under future climate scenarios the conventional 1y2ms0 is likely to continue to over exploit groundwater when the cropping system was replaced by 2y3ms0 and 1y1ms0 groundwater overdraft was zero if the average precipitation fell to 637 and 577 mm respectively fig 9b d therefore one maturity per year without wheat is the most water saving cropping system and also it is possible to realize future zero extraction of groundwater no wheat is harvested in this cropping system which likely poses a threat to food security xiao et al 2017 however future climate change would likely benefit wheat yield and increased precipitation may alleviate groundwater overdraft it may still be possible to plant wheat in the ncp additionally we found that straw mulching during fallow period is a useful approach to mitigate groundwater overdraft mainly by reducing es therefore we suggest the 2y3ms1 as the best choice to adapt future climate in the study area our results indicate that water restriction will inevitably lead to yield decrease and groundwater saving depending on the chosen alternative cropping systems these will help to provide the scientific basis for policy development and design of sustainable cropping systems under possible future climate scenarios when less or no groundwater is available for agricultural irrigation moreover the quantification of the values at which the groundwater used to produce grain yield is helpful for policy development to balance crop production and reserving water resources in the study region in addition the alternative cropping systems proposed in this study especially the straw mulch during the fallow period can also provide a reference for the balance of groundwater replenishment in similar water deficient agricultural areas around the world pei et al 2015 4 4 the uncertainty and limitation of this study crop modelling driven by projected future climate data is a useful tool to study the likely impacts of climate change on crop production xiao et al 2020a uncertainties in projections of climate change impacts on crop yield mainly originated from the choice of gcms rcps and crop models wang et al 2017 it is considered that actual climate change in the future will fall within the predicted range of climate change via multiple gcms asseng et al 2013 therefore impact assessment should be based on multi gcm climate projections which could provide more representative ranges of climate change impact than any single model does liu et al 2017 our study used 33 gcms to provide robust climate projections based on two rcps araya et al 2015 the apsim model selected in our study has been shown to accurately simulated maize and wheat yield under diverse environments however predicted future yields may be overestimated as this model cannot fully consider the yield reduction due to effects of the climate extreme events wang et al 2017 there is a predicted higher frequency of extreme climate in the future across the ncp especially the heat stress bai et al 2020 moreover to some extent apsim can simulate co2 fertilization by increasing in photosynthetic rate and decreasing in transpiration however the impact mechanism of co2 on crop growth and development is more complicated and the response of yield to co2 fertilization depends on different crop types such as c3 crop wheat and c4 crop maize in addition these impacts were not fully validated when the model was applied thus there could be some uncertainty in co2 fertilization effects on grain yield under future climate scenarios our study investigated the responses of crop phenology yield and water use to future climate change under different cropping systems at site scale although the climate hydrology and soil conditions vary in different parts of the ncp our study provides insights for the application of alternative cropping systems to balance yield and groundwater overdraft under future climate condition as ncp covers a large spatial area a more comprehensive spatial future analysis across the whole ncp is needed for future study to adopt optimum cropping system to balance wheat yield and water use xiao et al 2020a furthermore our simulation was performed at a multi decadal timescale with the assumption that alternative adaptation strategies are not feasible however the limited capacity of current agronomic practices will be challenged due to fast pace of climatic change in recent decades and projected trend for the future climate tao and zhang 2010 therefore we recommend further study should be conducted to explore whether some agronomic adaption options will be useful to maintain food security and reduce water use in ncp 5 conclusions our study used a well validated crop model to simulate the effects of climate change on crop yield also the study simulated water use in five different cropping systems based on 33 gcms projected future climates under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 overall our results showed that maize yield would decrease by 1 5 16 3 under future climate scenarios irrespective of cropping systems conversely wheat yield would increase by 2 8 5 6 under rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s and rcp8 5 2040s but decrease by about 5 3 under rcp8 5 2080s across cropping systems we found 2y3ms1 to be the optimum cropping system that balanced groundwater overdraft and crop yield the climate projections show increase precipitation in the future which benefits crops in the ncp from the prospective of future climate change especially elevated co2 and increased precipitation planting wheat would be a good choice because less irrigation needed in the future however intensive planting of winter wheat such as in the conventional cropping system of 1y2ms0 will continue to overuse groundwater into the future also we found straw mulching during the fallow period was an efficient measure to preserve soil moisture thus we conclude that the 2y3ms1 cropping system will maintain food security in some extent but also result in sustainable water use in the ncp our study will provide useful knowledge on the effects of climate change on crop production and water use and help developing adaptation strategies to balance trade offs between water resources and food security declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

10222,crop production in the north china plain ncp is heavily influenced by the unfolding climate change and water shortage groundwater overdraft for irrigation in this region has caused serious ecological and environmental problems cropping systems adjustment offers an effective approach for the sustainable use of groundwater however the assessment of the impacts of future climate change on crop production and water consumption under different cropping systems with without straw mulching has not been reported in the ncp in this study we applied the well validated apsim model to explore the implementation of five cropping systems i e two maturities per year 1y2ms0 three maturities per two year without with straw mulching during the fallow period 2y3ms0 2y3ms1 and one maturity per year without with straw mulching during the fallow period 1y1ms0 1y1ms1 statistical downscaled daily climate data based on 33 global climate models gcms were used to drive apsim to simulate crop phenology yield and water use under future climate change we found that cropping system adjustment significantly reduced the amount of water required for irrigation thereby decreasing groundwater overdraft to a certain extent straw mulching could have mitigating effect on groundwater overdraft multi gcms ensemble means show an increase in temperature precipitation and solar radiation in the future under future climate change scenarios the phenological date e g flower and maturity dates of maize and wheat were advanced due to climate warming our simulated results indicated that future climate change would have negative impact on maize yield across all cropping systems but have positive impact on wheat yield under most climate change scenarios both irrigation and groundwater overdraft reduced in the future due to decreased evapotranspiration and increased precipitation we concluded that 2y3ms1 would be the optimum cropping system to balance crop yield and groundwater overdraft this knowledge can inform the development of improved regional impact assessments of the sustainability of multi crop rotation systems keywords cropping system groundwater overdraft straw mulching apsim model future climate scenario 1 introduction rising concentrations of greenhouse gas mainly co2 are increasing global surface temperature and altering spatiotemporal pattern of precipitation piao et al 2010 this warming will have a severe impact on global crop yields due to the high dependence of agriculture on climate teixeira et al 2018 additionally many studies predict that unabated climate change will exacerbate global water scarcity piao et al 2010 which is another vital factor for crop productivity xiong et al 2010 in china global climate models gcms indicate that future climate warming will be accompanied by changes in precipitation amount and pattern tao and zhang 2010 however there remains considerable variation in the impacts on grain yields and water availability due to the uncertainty surrounding the impacts of climate change araya et al 2015 therefore further assessments and predictions of the response of crops and even cropping systems to future climate changes are required to support policy decisions and identify adaptation responses xiong et al 2010 the north china plain ncp is the main base of china s grain production with a winter wheat and summer maize rotation as the dominant cropping system gao et al 2015 producing about 33 of the maize and 50 of wheat in the country chinese agriculture press 2016 the average annual precipitation in the ncp is only around 500 600 mm annual crop evapotranspiration et could be as high as 800 900 mm chen et al 2007 and irrigation has become an inevitable way to ensure crop water supply particularly for winter wheat this is because the winter wheat growth period occurs in the lowest rainfall months of the year zhang et al 2016 groundwater is a significant source of irrigation water due to the lack of surface water resource xiao et al 2017 over recent decades intensive crop cultivation and increasing agricultural production have led to serious overexploitation of groundwater and the continuous decline in groundwater level across the ncp sun et al 2019 also the rapid decline in groundwater table has worsened the local environmental conditions in turn threatening sustainable agricultural irrigation in the plain zhang et al 2017 therefore the nexus between agricultural production and water use is threatening the long term availability of water resources and is now a key concern for sustainable crop production in this plain the situation in the ncp requires an analysis of the trade offs between crop production and groundwater sustainability liang et al 2019 the adoption of water saving measures that reduce irrigation in this region is critical to limit groundwater drawdown and to attain sustainable groundwater use zhao et al 2018 to address the irrigation water shortage studies based on field experiments have focused on the optimization of irrigation strategies such as critical period irrigation deficit irrigation and drip irrigation zhang et al 2016 fang et al 2018 reported that increased irrigation frequency could maintain higher water content in the topsoil layer improving crop yield and water use under limited water supply zhang et al 2006 found that water use efficiency wue increased by 10 20 under minimum irrigation irrigating applied at only upper root zone to field capacity just before sowing compared to conventional irrigation practice however this strategy also had yield decreases of 14 for both wheat and maize yan et al 2020 indicated that a minimum irrigation strategy had the potential to maintain the groundwater balance with higher grain production and wue under current and future climates however these studies did not consider that in some extremely dry years the lack of irrigation during wheat growth period could result in extremely low yields or even zero yields which was unacceptable to farmers although adjusting irrigation strategies could reduce et and improve wue sun et al 2019 total agricultural water consumption has remained high and the groundwater level has continued to drop due to the continuous increase in grain yield liang et al 2019 sun et al 2015 reduction of crop areas under high consumptive water is another strategy to decrease agricultural water use in water scarce environments luo et al 2018 several studies have evaluated the effects of cropping system shift on crop production and water consumption employing field experiments and or crop model simulations van oort et al 2016 for example xiao et al 2017 found that three crops per two year winter wheat and summer maize followed by fallow and early maize during two consecutive years was an effective cropping system to maintain a balance between crop yield and water use cui et al 2019 indicated mono cropped maize was an effective measure that can resolve the current environmental pressure caused by conventional wheat maize rotation system in the ncp however soil moisture during the period of abandonment of winter wheat i e fallow period was inefficient as it was lost through soil evaporation es xiao et al 2017 to some extent covering the soil with straw straw mulching during fallow period can effectively reduce soil evaporation and conserve soil moisture chen et al 2007 several studies have used straw from a previous crop as a mulch to examine the impacts on water use yield and greenhouse gas emissions in subsequent crops zhang et al 2005 hu et al 2016 the practice of straw mulching could reduce soil evaporation by about 40 for winter wheat and by about 56 for summer maize zhang et al 2016 alternatively straw on the soil surface during crop growth period regulates soil temperature which in turn influences crop phenology and yield chen et al 2007 currently there have been few studies on the effects of straw mulching during fallow period on the crop yield and water use in the ncp sustainable crop productivity and water use under climate change was a major research priority gao et al 2015 climate changes including increased temperatures changes in seasonal precipitation amount and patterns and elevated atmospheric co2 concentration co2 have important impacts on crop productivity and water use asseng et al 2019 generally elevated co2 is expected to enhance photosynthesis and reduce crop water use related studies indicated that rising co2 could significantly reduce the yield losses caused by climate change while reducing consumptive water use deryng et al 2016 however the effects of elevated co2 increased temperature and precipitation on crop yield has been less reported for different cropping systems in the ncp mo et al 2009 moreover the assessment of the impacts of future climate change on grain yield and water use under different cropping systems with without straw mulching has not been reported in the ncp climate change impact assessment can indicate effective responses and help plan adaptation response to inform policy decisions that will strengthen sustainable agricultural production to meet future food supply challenges in this study we aimed to quantify crop yield and water use change under future climate change scenarios and propose the optimum cropping system to reduce water use and maximize crop yield our main objectives were 1 to assess the characteristics of crop yield and water use under different cropping systems including the incorporation of straw mulch 2 to evaluate the impact of future climate change on crop yield and water use under different cropping systems 3 to quantify the relationship between crop yield et change and climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and field experiments the ncp study area lies between 31 24 42 42 n and 110 18 122 42 e the mean annual temperature in the region is 8 15 c with hot and wet summers and cold and dry winters mean annual precipitation across the plain is 500 600 mm of which more than 70 of the amount falls between july and september the main soil type in the ncp is of aeolian origin deposited by rivers over geological periods this plain has a reliance on irrigation to support an intensive double cropping rotation system of winter wheat and summer maize xiao and tao 2014 in this study we conducted two field experiments double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize and mono cropping system of early maize at luancheng agro ecological experimental station laes 37 53 n 114 41 e and altitude 50 1 m one of 34 agricultural ecosystem stations in the china ecological research network laes is a typically representative site of the agricultural production in ncp two field experiments were conducted at laes to represent the different cropping systems double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize and mono cropping system of early maize investigated in this study the experiment for the double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize were conducted in 2010 2013 the cultivars of summer maize and winter wheat were zd958 and kn199 respectively before sowing of summer maize the soil was manually treated with nitrogen n and phosphorus p fertilizers at 150 ha 1 n and 120 kg ha 1 p2o5 during the growth period of summer maize irrigation was done 1 2 times with average of 60 80 mm before sowing of winter wheat the soil was manually conducted with n and p fertilizers at 180 ha 1 n and 160 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 150 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer was added at jointing stage during the growth period of winter wheat irrigation was done 4 6 times with average of 60 80 mm the other field experiment was conducted in 2014 2016 to examine phenology yield et and soil water of early maize for the selected cultivar xianyu335 the sowing dates sd of early maize in 2014 2015 and 2016 were may 13 may 4 and may 9 respectively during the growth period of early maize irrigation was conducted 2 4 times before sowing of early maize the soil was conducted with n p and potassium k fertilizers at 180 kg ha 1 150 kg ha 1 k2o and 150 kg ha 1 p2o5 respectively another 180 kg ha 1 n was conducted at jointing in the both above experiments we monitored regularly the soil volumetric water content svwc every 7 days by using neutron probes 0 2 m intervals in 0 2 m below the soil surface we computed the crop et and groundwater drainage using the water balance method we used observed phenology yield and water use from these field experiments to calibrate and validate agricultural production systems simulator apsim model due to the availability of data on future climate scenario we used the past and future climate data from the shijiazhuang site sjz 38 03 n 114 42 e to drive the apsim model 2 2 climate projections observed climate data were collected for the period 1981 2010 for sjz site and obtained from china s meteorological administration cma the daily climate data included maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature t min sunshine hours sh and precipitation prec we calculated daily solar radiation rad for this study site from the daily sh using the angstom prescott equation prescott 1940 there are over 60 gcms that contributed to the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 from world climate research program wcrp the gcms projected data from an ensemble of multiple models were often used to deal with the uncertainties associated with single gcm liu et al 2017 we used 33 gcms table 1 with the simulated monthly data available for two representative concentration pathways rcps i e rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 which were required to be downscaled to the daily climate sequences for driving apsim model both of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were chosen because they more closely represent current socio economic conditions of radiative forcing and have completed data for monthly gcms projections xiao et al 2020a we used nwai wg statistical downscaling method which was developed by liu and zuo 2012 to downscale the monthly climate data from the 33 gcms to the daily data for driving apsim model this downscaling approach consisted of three steps spatial downscaling bias correction and temporal downscaling liu and zuo 2012 spatial downscaling involved downscaling monthly projections of rad t max t min and prec from gcm gridded values to target sites by an inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method the spatial downscaled monthly data for the site were followed by bias correction using a qq mapping technique to establish a function to enable the gcms projected monthly data in the historical period 1961 2010 to match the observed monthly values of the site and then applied the relationship to correct the biases in the gcm projected data the qq mapping technique is a probability plot for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other i e the baseline for gcms projections against the observed baseline climate the important feature of this method is the resultant bias corrected monthly sequences remained in the gcm simulated interannual variations for the period 1961 2100 the next step was the temporal downscaling for daily sequences using a modified weather generator wgen liu and zuo 2012 the generated daily sequences would not necessarily equate to the targeted value in a single run because of the random nature of the stochastic wgen this meant that the generated results could modify the change in the gcm projections hence introducing additional downscaling uncertainty to overcome the problem of modified change from gcm projections liu and zuo 2012 introduced an evaluation procedure to assess the generated values and outputted the run when the generated sum of the daily sequences matched the gcm projected monthly value difference being less than a given small value therefore downscaled daily rad t max t min and prec sequences would not only remain the gcm projected monthly values but also preserve the gcm projected interannual variations in the future climate 2 3 apsim model introduction and settings the apsim is a biophysical model developed to simulate cropping systems apsim accurately integrates predictions of crop phenology yield and water use in response to management measure and climate condition o leary et al 2016 holzworth et al 2014 this model can consider the response of cropping systems to soil conditions mainly soil water and nitrogen weather variables solar radiation temperature precipitation and co2 and management sd irrigation set fertilization option tillage operation residue management and cultivar selection brown et al 2014 we used apsim version 7 7 to assess the impact of future climate change on crop growth and water use under different cropping systems based on local irrigation management we set an automatic irrigation module in apsim model the irrigation is defined as 1 i r r 0 p a w c s w today 80 mm p a w c s w today p a w c s w today 80 mm where irr is irrigation amount sw today is soil water in each day and pawc is the plant available water holding capacity runoff following light precipitation events does not generally occur and excess water in soil surface will infiltrate into soil due to the relatively flat nature of the ncp xiao et al 2020b refer to the characteristics of the relationship between precipitation and runoff crop model simulated runoff was set as eq 2 2 i r r r u n o f f r u n o f f r u n o f f 50 0 mm 87 5 r u n o f f 37 5 r u n o f f r u n o f f 50 0 mm where irr runoff is the irrigation amount from runoff groundwater overdraft od was used to assess the impact of alternative cropping systems on groundwater od is calculated as 3 o d i r r d where d is the drainage amount of water to groundwater we used straw mulching during fallow period with the amount of straw related to the amount of harvested crop i e maize stubble prior to the fallow period when straw yield biomass minus grain yield was less than 9000 kg ha 1 straw mulching was deemed equal to harvested straw if straw yield was more than 9000 kg ha 1 the amount of straw mulching is capped 4 s t r a w i n p u t s t r a w h a r v e s t s t r a w h a r v e s t 9000 0 k g h a 1 9000 0 s t r a w h a r v e s t 9000 0 k g

in cmip5 we fitted annual average co2 values by empirical equations eqs 5 and 6 were used to compute annual co2 for rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively 5 co2 y 650 18 0 000075326 y 0 16276 0 00022299 727

to evaluate yield and water consumption characteristics for different cropping systems under historical climatic conditions and future climate scenarios the scenarios were 1 two maturity in one year consisting of summer maize and winter wheat in a double cropping system without straw mulching 1y2ms0 2 three maturity during two years consisting of winter wheat and summer maize followed by fallow and early maize without straw mulching 2y3ms0 3 three maturity during two years consisting of winter wheat and summer maize followed by fallow and early maize with straw mulching during fallow period 2y3ms1 4 one maturity per year consisting of early maize mono cropping system without straw mulching 1y1ms0 and 5 one maturity per year consisting of early maize mono cropping system with straw mulching during fallow period 1y1ms1 fig 1 we calibrated and validated the parameters in apsim model for summer maize zd958 early maize xy335 and winter wheat kn199 based on the observed data from the above cropping systems experiment the model performance was evaluated using coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse the validated apsim was run for baseline period 1981 2010 for both observed and downscaled climate and two future time periods of 2031 2060 2040s and 2071 2100 2080s under two rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios based on long term observed records for maize and wheat phenology in the ncp sd for summer maize and winter wheat in these simulations were set at jun 15 and oct 5 respectively sd for early maize was set at may 10 about 35 days earlier than that of summer maize xiao et al 2017 about 150 180 and 210 kg ha 1 n was applied at sowing and 90 120 and 120 kg ha 1 at jointing stage for summer maize early maize and winter wheat respectively the gcm projected crop outputs y gcm and the changes δy gcm were calculated as the following equations which involved in a secondary bias correction 7 y g c m s g c m s b l s o b 8 δ y g c m s g c m s b l s o

calibration and validation overall the field observed and model simulated dates of phenological dates e g anthesis date and maturity date yield et and drainage agreed well in the study site fig 2 the differences between the observed and simulated dates of phenology including flowering and maturity were on average less than 5 d r 2 values for simulated phenology dates exceeded 0 80 fig 2 the average difference between the observed and simulated crop yields was less than 10 of the observed values with r 2 for simulated yield exceeding 0 90 fig 2 the differences of et and drainage between the observed and simulated were small fig 2 the corresponding rmse was in 10 33 mm and r 2 values exceeded 0 87 therefore the overall results of the apsim model simulation of maize and wheat phenology yield and water use i e et and drainage were reliable and therefore can be used confidently in following climate change analysis the parameter values for apsim model in this study for maize i e summer maize and early maize and winter wheat are shown in tables s1 and s2 respectively 3 2 gcms projected future climate change future climate change was projected for two rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 using 33 gcms ensembles all the gcm simulated future temperatures tmax and tmin significantly increased fig 3a b the magnitude of increase in tmax and tmin under rcp8 5 was greater than that under rcp4 5 especially in the 2080 s multi gcms ensemble means indicated that tmax tmin increased by 1 37 1 44 2 02 2 14 1 79 1 91 and 3 87 4 12 c in the rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s and rcp8 5 2080s respectively for rad most of the gcms simulations showed increasing trends in the future with average rad increasing across the gcms of 1 3 and 3 4 in the 2040s and 0 7 and 1 9 in the 2080s under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 3c moreover most of the gcms simulations showed an increasing trend in future precipitation fig 3d across the gcms prec increased by 9 9 14 3 11 2 and 23 4 under rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s and rcp8 5 2080s respectively fig 3d 3 3 crop phenology change under future climate scenarios summer maize early maize flowering date fd advanced by 2 2 2 9 d 3 6 4 5 d in the 2040s and 3 2 4 9 d 5 1 7 6 d in the 2080s maturity date md of summer maize early maize shifted earlier by 7 1 8 9 d 9 3 11 5 d in the 2040s and 9 6 14 0 d 12 5 18 3 d in the 2080s fig 4 the number of days of advancement for wheat phenology i e fd and md was much greater than that of maize fd of wheat advanced by 13 5 18 2 d in the 2040s and 20 6 41 9 d in the 2080s wheat md shifted earlier by 12 0 15 5 d in the 2040s and 17 3 32 3 d in the 2080s fig 4 the advances in fd shortened the vegetative growth period vgp and earlier md shortened the whole growth period wgp for both maize and wheat because sd was unchanged in the two future periods however the length of reproductive growth period rgp is determined by the magnitude of advance in fd and md multi gcms ensemble means show that the rgp of summer maize early maize shortened by 4 8 5 7 days in 2040s and 6 3 7 4 d in 2080s under rcp4 5 and by 6 0 7 1 days in 2040s and 9 1 10 7 d in 2080s under rcp8 5 fig 4 rgp of winter wheat was expected to extend by 1 4 2 7 3 3 and 9 5 d under the 2040s rcp4 5 2040s rcp8 5 2080s rcp4 5 and 2080s rcp8 5 respectively because the days in advance for md were less than that for fd fig 4 3 4 grain yield change under future climate scenarios the simulated yields for maize and wheat were different under various cropping systems fig 5a b for 1y2ms0 the average yield of maize and wheat was 8 0 and 7 2 t ha 1 respectively if 1y2ms0 was replaced by 2y3ms0 the average yield of maize increased to 9 6 t ha 1 and wheat yield declined to 3 6 t ha 1 therefore replacement of 2y3ms0 with 1y2ms0 system increased maize yield by 20 at the expense of almost half of the wheat yield the yield of mono cropped maize with early sowing 1y1ms0 or 1y1ms1 reached to 11 5 t ha 1 when winter wheat was completely abandoned fig 5a this means that maize yield increased by around 60 without wheat yield moreover the simulated results indicated that using straw mulch during fallow period had no significant effect on maize and wheat yield fig 5a b the impacts of future climate change on wheat and maize yield were quite different fig 5c d future climate change predicted a negative impact on maize yield for most of gcms across the five cropping systems multi gcms ensemble means showed that maize yield would decrease by 4 1 9 1 2 3 15 6 2 4 15 5 1 5 15 5 and 1 6 16 3 in 1y2ms0 2y3ms0 2y3ms1 1y1ms0 and 1y1ms1 respectively moreover maize yield declined much more under rcp8 5 2080s than that under other climate scenarios regardless of cropping systems fig 5c multi gcms ensemble means showed that future climate change will exert positive effects by 2 8 5 6 on wheat yield for any cropping system in rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s and rcp8 5 2040s however wheat yield would decrease by around 5 3 under rcp8 5 2080s across three cropping systems fig 5d the relationship between crop yield change and climatic change is given in table 2 wheat yield was significantly positively correlated with temperature but maize yield was significantly negatively correlated with temperature table 2 moreover the yields of maize and wheat were significantly positively correlated with co2 radiation and precipitation 3 5 water use under future climate scenarios under different cropping systems there were some differences in soil evaporation es crop transpiration ep and total evapotranspiration et sum of es and ep fig 6 for the whole rotation year es was highest under 1y2ms0 reaching 285 mm es was slightly reduced by changing the cropping systems from 1y2ms0 to 2y3ms0 or 1y1ms0 fig 6a under 2y3ms0 es was 270 mm with 15 mm less than that under 1y2ms0 while es was 254 mm under 1y1ms0 showing a reduction of 31 mm compared to the 1y2ms0 fig 6a our simulated results show that straw mulching was important in reducing es under 2y3ms1 1y1ms1 es reduced by 8 21 mm compared to 2y3ms0 1y1ms0 fig 6a crop transpiration ep reduced by changing the cropping systems from 1y2ms0 to 2y3ms0 or to 1y1ms0 fig 6b ep was up to 490 mm for conventional 1y2ms0 ep dropped to 397 and 305 mm respectively when the cropping system was replaced by 2y3ms0 and 1y1ms0 fig 6b straw mulching during fallow period slightly increased crop ep for example ep under 1y1ms1 was 12 mm greater than that under 1y1ms0 fig 6b et was highest under 1y2ms0 with 775 mm followed by 667 mm for 2y3ms0 and 560 mm for 1y1ms0 fig 6c however straw mulching had less effect on et because reduced es and increased ep tend to cancel each other out changes in cropping system which reduced cultivated winter wheat area and advanced sd of maize i e early maize significantly increased the et during the maize growth period et maize et maize was 350 mm under 1y2ms0 and increased to 397 mm under 2y3ms0 and 434 mm under 1y1ms0 fig 7a however the exclusion of wheat in the cropping system reduced wheat growing season et et wheat because of fallow et wheat reached 425 mm under 1y2ms0 but reduced to 270 mm under 2y3ms0 and 126 mm under 1y1ms0 fig 8a straw mulching had marginal effect on et maize fig 7a but reduced et wheat by about 9 mm under 1y1ms1 because it reduced es fig 8a also changing cropping systems reduced the irrigation amount irr fig 6d among the different cropping systems irr was 392 mm under 1y2ms0 282 mm under 2y3ms0 and 173 mm under 1y1ms0 sowing early maize increased the irr during maize growth period irr maize under 1y2ms0 irr maize was 105 mm but increased to 148 mm under 2y3ms0 and to 173 mm under 1y1ms0 fig 7b however changing the cropping system significantly reduced irr during the winter wheat period irr wheat irr wheat was 288 mm under 1y2ms0 but only 134 mm under 2y3ms0 when wheat was completely abandoned 1y1ms0 no irrigation was required fig 8b straw mulching during fallow period had non significant impacts on irr fig 6d groundwater overdraft od was reduced due to the effects of changing cropping system on et and irr under 1y2ms0 od reached 270 mm whereas the od became only 163 mm under 2y3ms0 and 59 mm under 1y1ms0 fig 6e the main reason of this result was that reduction or cessation of winter wheat may greatly reduce od during wheat period od wheat od wheat under 1y2ms0 reached 275 mm but was only 123 mm under 2y3ms0 furthermore replacing 1y2ms0 with 1y1ms0 stopped od and also induced small groundwater recharge of about 14 mm fig 8c however od during maize growth period od maize under 1y2ms0 was minimal only about 5 mm when it changed into 2y3ms0 or 1y1ms0 od maize reached 40 mm or 74 mm respectively fig 7c straw mulching could have mitigative effects on od fig 6e under 1y1ms1 straw mulching appears to reduce od in excess of 10 mm for whole rotation year fig 6e compared to the baseline es increased under future climate scenarios regardless of cropping system the magnitude of es increase in the 2080s was greater than that in the 2040s irrespective of rcps fig 6f however multi gcms ensemble means show that ep decreased across all cropping systems the decline under 1y2ms0 was largest followed by 2y3ms0 2y3ms1 and 1y1ms0 1y1ms1 fig 6g the magnitude of decrease increased with rcps over time in the same cropping system for example ep decreased by 65 82 89 and 176 mm under rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s rcp8 5 2080s under 1y2ms0 respectively the change in et was inconsistent for the five cropping systems under future climate scenario multi gcm ensemble means showed that et decreased in 1y2ms0 2y3ms0 and 2y3ms1 whereas et change in 1y1ms0 and 1y1ms1 depended on future climate scenarios fig 6h specifically the reduction in et maize in the 2080s was greater than that in the 2040s regardless of rcps and the reduction under rcp8 5 was higher than that under rcp4 5 irrespective of periods fig 7d moreover et wheat decreased under 1y2ms0 2y3ms0 and 2y3ms1 with greater reduction under 1y2ms0 than that under 2y3ms0 and 2y3ms1 however et wheat under 1y1ms0 and 1y1ms0 increased in the future climate scenario fig 8d the irr for crops decreased in the future relative to baseline fig 6i the largest decrease in irr occurred in 1y2ms0 under rcp8 5 2080s similarly the od significantly decreased under future climate scenarios across all cropping systems fig 6j there would be no od under 2y3ms0 2y3ms1 1y1ms0 and 1y1ms1 due to increased precipitation and reduced irr in rcp8 5 2080s during the maize growth period irr maize decreased for the different cropping systems in future climate scenarios of these scenarios rcp8 5 2080s had the greatest reduction above 50 mm fig 7e for all the cropping systems od maize reduced significantly fig 7f in some of the scenarios this reduction was higher than the od in the baseline period this result indicated that no od existed under the scenario and that even some groundwater recharge occurred moreover irr wheat decreased under 1y2ms0 2y3ms0 and 2y3ms1 in the future climate scenarios with higher reduction under 1y2ms0 than that under 2y3ms0 and 2y3ms1 under rcp8 5 2080s scenario the reductions were much higher than those under other climate scenarios fig 8e also od wheat decreased in the future climate scenarios under the different cropping systems the greatest reduction was under 1y2ms0 followed by 2y3ms0 2y3ms1 and 1y1ms0 1y1ms0 fig 8f crop et was significantly negatively correlated with co2 but significantly positively correlated with solar radiation table 2 moreover et maize was strongly positively correlated with temperature and et wheat was significantly positively correlated with precipitation table 2 the change of climate variables could explain 76 maize et change and 91 wheat et change 3 6 the relationship between groundwater overdraft and precipitation we established a liner regression model for each cropping system to find out how much precipitation can make groundwater zero overdraft under different cropping systems fig 9 we found a balance between groundwater recharge and use i e zero net use of groundwater could occur under 1y2ms0 with an average annual precipitation of 686 mm fig 9a when this cropping system was replaced by 2y3ms0 the critical value for average precipitation fell to 637 mm 49 mm less than that under 1y2ms0 fig 9b with straw mulching under 2y3ms1 the annual precipitation became 631 mm fig 9c annual precipitation was 577 mm for zero groundwater overdraft if only early maize was cultivated 1y1ms0 fig 9d moreover the application of straw mulching in 1y1ms1 further reduced the need for precipitation 561 mm fig 9e 4 discussion 4 1 climate change and its impacts on crop phenology and yield all 33 gcms used in our study predicted an increased temperature i e tmax and tmin in the future precipitation and radiation are important climate factors to determine crop yield and water use and were also shown to increase in the future for the majority of gcms the above results for future climate changes are similar to the findings by tao and zhang 2010 they showed that both temperature and precipitation were projected to generally increase across the ncp during the period of 2041 2070 as precipitation was projected to increase water stress for crop production in the ncp would likely alleviate under future climate scenarios generally warming temperature resulted in faster plant development and earlier maturity dixit et al 2018 our results indicate a clear impact of climate change on crop phenology mainly driven by increasing temperature which was responsible for early crop maturity under future climatic scenarios there was an apparent advance in fd and md of maize and wheat as a result advance in fd and md in the future would shorten the lengths of vgp and wgp however while that of maize shortened the rgp of winter wheat extended the main reason is that wheat flowering date shifted more than maturity date xiao et al 2013 warming temperatures accelerate phenological development and leaf senescence as a result crops would have less time to intercept light for crop photosynthesis leading to less biomass accumulation and then decreased final yield asseng et al 2019 moreover adverse effects of temperature change on crop yield was determined by the temperature threshold value below or above the optimal temperature for crop growth xiao and tao 2014 our results showed maize yield was significantly negatively correlated with temperature while wheat yield was significantly positively correlated with temperature the main reason is due to the prolonged rgp for wheat a critical period for yield formation while the rgp was shortened for maize under future climate scenarios our simulated results are consistent with the positive effects of increased minimum temperature on the wheat yield based on observed data in tao et al 2017 moreover tao and zhang 2010 reported that maize yield will decrease by 13 2 19 1 in ncp as a result of climate change without adaptation which is similar to our results that maize yield will decrease by 9 1 16 3 under rcp8 5 2080s scenario generally crop productivity benefited from enhanced photosynthesis due to elevated co2 wang et al 2017 in our study the regression analyses suggested that increases in atmospheric co2 contributed notably to maize and wheat yield table 2 moreover as a c4 crop the response of maize photosynthesis to elevated co2 was much less than that of wheat c3 crop ainsworth and long 2005 although co2 had less effect on maize photosynthesis elevated co2 indirectly increased photosynthesis and grain yield by reducing water use and mitigating drought stress through reducing stomatal conductance and transpiration rate ghannoum et al 2000 4 2 crop water consumption in different cropping systems under future climate change scenarios generally the rise in temperature leads to a shortening of the crop growth period which tends to reduce the transpiration of the crop ep during the growing period xiao and tao 2014 our results showed that ep decreased across all the cropping systems under future climate scenarios however soil evaporation es is mainly determined by temperature and soil moisture zhang et al 2017 therefore warming temperature under the future climate scenarios will cause a significantly rise in es tao et al 2003 water consumption et is composed of es and ep and changes of et under future climate scenarios depend on the magnitude of ep and es changes tao and zhang 2010 our results showed et decreased across most cropping systems under future climate scenarios and indicated that crop water consumption or water requirement reduces in the future climate scenario which is consistent with the result of tao and zhang 2010 the reduction of et caused by the shortening of crop growth period may mitigate the looming water crisis in the future tao et al 2003 due to the decrease in crop ep water requirement for crop irrigation under the future climate scenarios significantly decreased for all the investigated cropping systems furthermore the groundwater overdraft significantly decreased across all five cropping systems as a result of increased precipitation in the future however the shortening of the growth period is often accompanied by a decrease in crop yield es increased due to warming climate under the future climate scenario and it would likely increase the inefficient loss of agricultural water resources conversely elevated co2 benefited crop yield and also potentially decreased crop water consumption ep by reducing leaf level transpiration and enhancing photosynthesis xiong et al 2010 we found that both maize and wheat et were significantly negatively correlated with co2 we propose that elevated co2 in future climate scenarios can effectively reduce the et of the whole cropping system 4 3 how to balance wheat yield and groundwater overdraft changing cropping system from 1y2ms0 to 2y3ms0 or 1y1ms0 could significantly reduce the amount of irrigation thereby reducing groundwater overdraft xiao et al 2017 in our study overdraft was 270 mm under conventional 1y2ms0 but would decrease to 163 and 59 mm under 2y3ms0 and 1y1ms0 respectively the groundwater overdraft could be effectively mitigated by a change in cropping system where winter wheat is foregone for one or two seasons however crop yield under various cropping systems was significantly different liang et al 2019 our results indicate that if the 1y2ms0 was replaced by 2y3ms0 or 1y1ms0 maize yield increased by 20 60 but wheat yield would be halved or lost completely therefore balancing crop yields and water use to ensure regional food security and sustainable groundwater use is particularly important for sustainable development of agriculture in the ncp zhao et al 2018 moreover we found that the balance between groundwater recharge and use i e overdraft equal to zero could exist with an annual precipitation of 686 mm under 1y2ms0 according the current annual precipitation of less than 500 mm in the study site this result indicates that even if precipitation increased by 9 9 23 4 under future climate scenarios the conventional 1y2ms0 is likely to continue to over exploit groundwater when the cropping system was replaced by 2y3ms0 and 1y1ms0 groundwater overdraft was zero if the average precipitation fell to 637 and 577 mm respectively fig 9b d therefore one maturity per year without wheat is the most water saving cropping system and also it is possible to realize future zero extraction of groundwater no wheat is harvested in this cropping system which likely poses a threat to food security xiao et al 2017 however future climate change would likely benefit wheat yield and increased precipitation may alleviate groundwater overdraft it may still be possible to plant wheat in the ncp additionally we found that straw mulching during fallow period is a useful approach to mitigate groundwater overdraft mainly by reducing es therefore we suggest the 2y3ms1 as the best choice to adapt future climate in the study area our results indicate that water restriction will inevitably lead to yield decrease and groundwater saving depending on the chosen alternative cropping systems these will help to provide the scientific basis for policy development and design of sustainable cropping systems under possible future climate scenarios when less or no groundwater is available for agricultural irrigation moreover the quantification of the values at which the groundwater used to produce grain yield is helpful for policy development to balance crop production and reserving water resources in the study region in addition the alternative cropping systems proposed in this study especially the straw mulch during the fallow period can also provide a reference for the balance of groundwater replenishment in similar water deficient agricultural areas around the world pei et al 2015 4 4 the uncertainty and limitation of this study crop modelling driven by projected future climate data is a useful tool to study the likely impacts of climate change on crop production xiao et al 2020a uncertainties in projections of climate change impacts on crop yield mainly originated from the choice of gcms rcps and crop models wang et al 2017 it is considered that actual climate change in the future will fall within the predicted range of climate change via multiple gcms asseng et al 2013 therefore impact assessment should be based on multi gcm climate projections which could provide more representative ranges of climate change impact than any single model does liu et al 2017 our study used 33 gcms to provide robust climate projections based on two rcps araya et al 2015 the apsim model selected in our study has been shown to accurately simulated maize and wheat yield under diverse environments however predicted future yields may be overestimated as this model cannot fully consider the yield reduction due to effects of the climate extreme events wang et al 2017 there is a predicted higher frequency of extreme climate in the future across the ncp especially the heat stress bai et al 2020 moreover to some extent apsim can simulate co2 fertilization by increasing in photosynthetic rate and decreasing in transpiration however the impact mechanism of co2 on crop growth and development is more complicated and the response of yield to co2 fertilization depends on different crop types such as c3 crop wheat and c4 crop maize in addition these impacts were not fully validated when the model was applied thus there could be some uncertainty in co2 fertilization effects on grain yield under future climate scenarios our study investigated the responses of crop phenology yield and water use to future climate change under different cropping systems at site scale although the climate hydrology and soil conditions vary in different parts of the ncp our study provides insights for the application of alternative cropping systems to balance yield and groundwater overdraft under future climate condition as ncp covers a large spatial area a more comprehensive spatial future analysis across the whole ncp is needed for future study to adopt optimum cropping system to balance wheat yield and water use xiao et al 2020a furthermore our simulation was performed at a multi decadal timescale with the assumption that alternative adaptation strategies are not feasible however the limited capacity of current agronomic practices will be challenged due to fast pace of climatic change in recent decades and projected trend for the future climate tao and zhang 2010 therefore we recommend further study should be conducted to explore whether some agronomic adaption options will be useful to maintain food security and reduce water use in ncp 5 conclusions our study used a well validated crop model to simulate the effects of climate change on crop yield also the study simulated water use in five different cropping systems based on 33 gcms projected future climates under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 overall our results showed that maize yield would decrease by 1 5 16 3 under future climate scenarios irrespective of cropping systems conversely wheat yield would increase by 2 8 5 6 under rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s and rcp8 5 2040s but decrease by about 5 3 under rcp8 5 2080s across cropping systems we found 2y3ms1 to be the optimum cropping system that balanced groundwater overdraft and crop yield the climate projections show increase precipitation in the future which benefits crops in the ncp from the prospective of future climate change especially elevated co2 and increased precipitation planting wheat would be a good choice because less irrigation needed in the future however intensive planting of winter wheat such as in the conventional cropping system of 1y2ms0 will continue to overuse groundwater into the future also we found straw mulching during the fallow period was an efficient measure to preserve soil moisture thus we conclude that the 2y3ms1 cropping system will maintain food security in some extent but also result in sustainable water use in the ncp our study will provide useful knowledge on the effects of climate change on crop production and water use and help developing adaptation strategies to balance trade offs between water resources and food security declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

stress water productivity yield response factor 1 introduction lentil lens culinaris medik is a self pollinating cool season pulse crop in india occupying 1 55 million hectares ha with an annual productivity of 1032 kg ha 1 and a production of 1 56 million tonnes sharing 28 6 of the world s annual production goi government of india 2019 it is generally cultivated in marginal soils of post rice residual soil water under rainfed conditions as rice lentil cropping system rawal and navarro 2019 the lower gangetic plain lgp of india contributes 10 3 0 16 million ha of the total lentil growing area of india with an annual productivity of 980 kg ha 1 and a production of 0 15 million tonnes sharing 9 6 of india s annual production goi government of india 2019 in this area farmers usually grow lentil during pre winter from late november to early december after harvesting of long duration 150 160 days puddled transplanted rice ptr varieties most of the farmers use their own preserved seeds of long duration local varieties according to reddy and reddy 2010 lentil yield in the farmers field is 46 62 lower than what we obtained in research stations in india rapid soil water depletion after rice harvest followed by a fast decline in the water table coupled with the rise in temperature results in mid and terminal drought at flowering and pod filling stages adversely affecting the productivity of lentil reddy 2009 ali et al 2014 bandyopadhyay et al 2016 2018 the introduction of early maturing rice varieties 110 120 days may help to escape such abiotic stresses and could increase the system productivity in these rainfed areas puddled operation wet tillage of transplanted rice soils makes the hardpan and massive structure with a higher penetration resistance that adversely affects the productivity of subsequent winter crops presumably by limiting root growth and distribution kar and kumar 2009 ghosh et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 reports also revealed that if ploughing is done after the harvest of rice to remove or bury the stubbles the sowing of lentil is delayed this in turn affects germination due to the formation of large size clods with high breaking strength thereby rendering the soil water deficit kar and kumar 2009 bandyopadhyay et al 2016 2018 hence a shift of rice establishment method rem from ptr to direct seeded rice dsr cultivation may facilitate timely sowing of the next crop after rice and ensure successful double cropping of rice lentil system farooq et al 2011 kumar et al 2019 moreover puddling and transplanting require a large amount of water and labor both of which are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive making rice production less profitable and these factors also demand a major shift from ptr production to dsr pandey and velasco 2002 kumar and ladha 2011 presently dsr is also becoming popular as an alternative to ptr particularly in the indo gangetic plain igp as a means of conservation agriculture ca to avert the declining trends of soil quality crop productivity and resource use efficiency gathala et al 2011 kumar et al 2019 different soil pore geometry among ptr and dsr alters water retention and release patterns and may restrict or enhance the proliferation of the lentil root system systematic comparative study on water use pattern the productivity level of lentil and yield water relationship under dsr and ptr have not been explored especially with different tillage and nutrient management hence a tillage system needs to be evaluated that gives a smooth transition between wetland rice soil ptr and dry land arable soil conditions dsr with maximum utilization of residual soil water through regulating hydrothermal regimes in rainfed agriculture water availability is the primary factor controlling crop productivity and reduced tillage is considered as one of the major applications for water conservation passioura 2006 singh et al 2015 research evidence in soils of ptr showed that zero tillage zt or no tillage nt with retention of rice stubble mulching significantly enhanced productivity of lentil in rice lentil cropping system kar and kumar 2009 ghosh et al 2016 bandyopadhyay et al 2016 2018 kumar et al 2020 residue retention plays an important role in the reduction of evaporation by creating a more complex micro climate which could directly affect the distribution of surface soil water morris et al 2010 gathala et al 2011 das et al 2014 bandyopadhyay et al 2016 2018 kumar et al 2019 such information on the relative contributions of tillage with or without residue retention on yield water relationship for lentil in dsr soils is rather scanty a general tendency of the marginal farmers in this region is to grow lentil without any input because they considered it as a bonus crop the reluctance of the farmers to apply any basal dose of fertilizer at the time of sowing severely affects the productivity of the crop ali et al 2014 a starter dose is required until the legume crop begins to fix atmospheric n or a balanced dose of nutrients particularly at the pre flowering stage was found to have a beneficial effect on increasing seed yield bala et al 2011 das and jana 2015 maji et al 2019 research evidence also showed that foliar nutrition with zn and b improves crop growth and physiology by alleviating the harmful effects of drought yadavi et al 2014 yamagishi and yamamoto 1994 however nutrient uptake assimilation is directly dependent on the amount of soil water in the root zone that maintains the turgidity of plants and restricts the dissolution and transfer of nutrients tiemann and billings 2011 soil water availability altered by different tillage practices on different rice establishment methods have a bearing on the accessibility of applied nutrients in soils and plants thus may have an impact on root growth leaf area relative leaf water content rlwc and leaf chlorophyll concentration lcc of lentil temporal changes in soil water stress ks and the seasonal yield water stress ksy factors are the functions of soil water availability and crop water productivity kirda 2002 steduto et al 2012 water deficits and the resulting water stress on the plant affect crop evapotranspiration et and crop yield and thus water productivity wp the wp has a high degree of uncertainty and varies greatly with several factors including weather soil characteristics that affect infiltration and redistribution of water antecedent soil water uniformity of water application crop response to fertilizers chemicals etc mbava et al 2020 hence the relationship between the level of water deficiency experienced by crops and their yield reduction is evident among the existing methods to study this relationship the yield response factor ky stands out as described by doorenbos and kassam 1979 moreover factors other than water such as nutrients different cultivars soil season growth stage etc also affect ky kirda 2002 ali 2009 the information on ky of lentil is scanty especially cultivated with balanced fertilization on post rice residual soil water of different rice establishment methods the existence of such a yield function can constitute an important planning and management tool predicting water productivity wp modeling of the crop coefficient suitability of the crop under stress or necessary supplemental irrigation in the future keeping this in view in the present study it has been hypothesized that short duration rice varieties under different rice establishment method supports early sowing of lentil by restraining diverse amounts of residual soil water and curbing soil water stress tillage options on ptr or dsr soils may have much robust impact on water availability for lentil by altering soil water storage capacity reducing soil evaporation and allowing a better development of root systems proper technology relating to nutrient inputs and soil water availability may influence the plant physiology and productivity of lentil and lastly soil management by rice establishment method tillage and nutrient may influence the suitability of lentil in post rice residual soil water therefore an attempt has been made to grow lentil in soils of different rice establishments ptr and dsr following tillage zt and ct and balanced nutrient management with nutrient and without nutrient during post rainy seasons through utilizing the carry over soil water in lgp of india with the aim to assess the effects of rice establishment method dsr versus ptr tillage and nutrient management on soil water retention and field water balance of post rice lentil and to monitor and quantify the level of crop water stress and its effect on the seed yield and the water productivity of lentil through the interactive effects of nutrient tillage and rice establishment method and to determine the yield response factor for lentil grown in post rice residual soil water 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and soil information

the onset of flowering for zt a narrow furrow was opened in between two rice lines using a manually drawn zt seed drill i e 25 cm spacing 4 5 days after rice harvest fertilizer was applied seeds were placed and covered with soil on the same day for ct 7 10 days after rice harvest at the time of land preparation table 3 fertilizers were broadcasted at the time of sowing of lentil seeds upon two rice establishments the water content of the surface soil 0 30 mm was moist and above field capacity 40 46 in each year and hence more than 85 of seeds were well germinated keeping plant populations 1

following the method of blake and hartge 1986 at 15 days interval a constant head permeameter was used to measure saturated hydraulic conductivity klute and dirksen 1986 penetration resistance was determined from the soil surface down to 400 mm depth at 30 mm depth increments with a handheld penetrometer eijkelkamp penetrologger with a 1 cm cone diameter and a 60 degree angle the total

distribution varied during the growth of lentil for 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons fig 1a and b under zt and ct systems upon two different rice establishment methods viz direct seeded rice dsr and puddled transplanted rice ptr the range of temperatures at the time of sowing to vegetative periods of lentil during 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons were 10 0 35 0 and 15 5 34 5 c for zt 0 50 das 9 0 35 0 and 11 6 34 5 c for ct 0 45 das respectively again the temperature range during flowering to the pod formation period of lentil was 7 9 30 0 and 10 4 30 0 c for zt 65 85 das 7 9 30 8 and 9 2 30 0 c for ct 60 80 das respectively during 2014 15 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons fig 1 shows that the crop received 2 4 and 8 0 mm rainfall during flowering to the pod formation period in 2014 15 season and 6 6 and 6 5 mm rainfall at vegetative to the flowering period and during the pod formation stage in 2015 16 cropping season from sowing to the vegetative period the eto rate was 1 35 and 1 90 mm day 1 for 2014 15 and 2015 16 cropping seasons respectively and decreased in both the years 1 1 mm day 1 while maintaining an average eto rate of 1 0 mm day 1 up to end of flowering 60 75 das the average eto rate at the pod formation stage was 1 65 and 1 55 mm day 1 during 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons respectively 3 2 root zone soil water storage and distribution distribution of soil water up to root zone 0 400 mm at sowing vegetative flowering and pod formation periods under different rice establishment methods rem during 2015 16 cropping season showed a decreasing trend from sowing to harvesting fig 2a and b at each depth lentil grown in soils under direct seeded rice dsr drained more water than soils under puddled transplanted rice ptr from sowing to flowering periods conventional tillage ct depleted much water as compared to zero tillage zt in both rems the surface 0 30 mm soil water depleted from 35 and 40 under ct and zt during sowing to 12 and 14 at pod formation period under dsr and ptr respectively higher soil water was observed below the surface layer throughout the growth period in both dsr and ptr soils making a hydraulic gradient upward in the root zone during the pod formation period remarkable soil water depletion was observed under ptr as compared to dsr fig 2a and b the root zone soil water storage from 0 to 400 mm soil layer at different phenophases of lentil during two consecutive years table 4 showed that it was lower in 2015 2016 cropping season as compared to 2014 2015 however the total water storage was decreasing with crop age from 150 41 mm at sowing time to 101 06 mm at pod formation period in both the cropping seasons on average ptr stored significantly 4 4 and 3 more soil water than dsr at sowing vegetative and flowering periods respectively however no significant effect was observed at the pod formation period among the tillage zt had a significant effect on soil water storage and added significantly 21 14 16 and 19 more water in the root zone as compared with ct during sowing vegetative flowering and pod formation periods respectively root zone soil water storage was also significantly influenced by nutrient management practices ip during flowering and pod formation periods in both years with 8 and 11 more water retention than farmers practice fp the combined analysis of variance for different growth periods indicated that interaction among the primary factors rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management was non significant on soil water storage the interaction among rice establishment method and tillage practices indicated that ptr zt stored significantly higher soil water i e 158 84 141 74 129 28 and 104 84 mm at sowing vegetative flowering and pod formation periods respectively 3 3 soil drying out pattern bulk density and stress from 2 years of extensive soil water data the surface 0 100 mm soil drying out pattern during critical lentil crop growth periods under different rem and tillage fig 3a indicated that ct faced soil drying earlier than zt especially from the initiation of the flowering period 60 das onwards and soil drying out pattern of zt was slower throughout the growth period during the initiation of flowering dsr ct dct achieved 0 8 mpa tension as compared to 0 3 0 2 and 0 1 mpa for ptr ct tct dsr zt dzt and ptr zt tzt respectively during pod filling period 90 das onwards except for tzt all treatments showed values above 1 5 mpa significant logarithmic relationships were obtained between bulk density and time fig 3b of the treatments used rem and tillage after 30 das dct showed a significant increase in bulk density from vegetative 1 46 mg m 3 to harvesting 1 58 mg m 3 period with 91 variability however treatment tzt maintains a constant bulk density of 1 43 mg m 3during this period with 78 variability the bulk density of dzt and tct were intermediate between dct and tzt and increased from 1 43 to 1 52 mg m 3 at the said periods the surface drying as well as the variations in bulk density reflected the root penetration fig 4 in such a way that with the increase in 0 1 mpa penetration resistance there was 0 8 mm cm 3 reduction in rld at the pod formation period the intensity of stress designated as soil water stress coefficient ks faced by lentil at critical growth periods under rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management practices for 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons are depicted in fig 5 from sowing to the peak of the vegetative period 30 das in both years ks value was 1 after which it was decreased in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons no significant effect of stress was observed with rem as both ptr and dsr faced 10 and 32 stress and 20 and 40 stress respectively at flowering and pod formation periods during 2014 2015 season ct faced 19 and 50 stress at flowering and pod formation periods as compared to 1 and 15 for zt whereas in 2015 2016 season zt faced significantly 8 and 32 stress as compared to 31 and 47 for ct during these periods in 2014 2015 season a significant difference between ip and fp was observed at flowering and pod formation periods however it was non significant during 2015 2016 cropping season interactions among rice establishment method and tillage and among tillage and nutrient management practices significantly influenced the ks at flowering and pod formation periods in 2014 2015 crop season however interaction of rice establishment method tillage and rice establishment method nutrient management practices were found significant during 2015 2016 cropping season 3 4 plant physiology and soil water from the pooled data of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons it was observed that relative water content of leaves rlwc and leaf chlorophyll content lcc are functions of soil water storage fig 6a and b data revealed that 5 of rlwc could be increased with 10 mm of soil water storage fig 6a and additional 10 mm of water could increase 0 18 mg lcc g 1 fresh weight fig 6b the rlwc and lcc of lentil at flowering were higher as compared to the pod formation period in both 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons table 5 no significant change of rlwc and lcc was also observed between dsr and ptr in both years tillage had no significant effect on rlwc and lcc at the flowering period however zt showed significantly 6 4 higher rlwc and 17 8 higher lcc than ct at pod formation period during flowering and pod formation periods the treatment ip improved 5 7 and 5 3 more rlwc and 6 2 and 10 3 more lcc as compared with fp the combined analysis of variance indicated that the factors rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management had a very significant effect on rlwc during 2015 2016 cropping seasons however no interactions among the variables on leaf chlorophyll content were observed in both cropping seasons 3 5 soil water balance and actual evapotranspiration the root zone profile water change in 2014 2015 cropping season was 34 53 higher than 2015 2016 table 6 and it was reflected in the actual evapotranspiration eta in both seasons the profile water change was significantly 7 higher in ptr than dsr 24 higher in zt than ct and 11 higher in ip as compared to fp respectively during 2014 15 and 2015 16 cropping seasons the lentil crop received 10 4 and 16 1 mm effective rainfall respectively the eta of 2014 2015 cropping season was 16 8 higher than 2015 2016 on average ptr zt and ip possessed 5 21 and 10 more eta than dsr ct and fp respectively table 6 results showed that treatment combinations of ptr zt zt ip and ptr zt ip produced significantly more eta i e 80 1 80 0 and 79 8 mm respectively individual effects of primary variables rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management had a significant effect on profile water change and actual evapotranspiration table 6 no significant interactions among variables on profile water change were observed except rice establishment method tillage the combined analysis of variance indicated that the rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management had a very significant effect on evapotranspiration interactions among variables were also significant except for the rice establishment method nutrient management for actual evapotranspiration 3 6 lentil seed yield and water productivity the seed yield of lentil ranged from 1001 96 to 1331 49 kg ha 1 and 1020 27 1347 57 kg ha 1 for 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons respectively with a mean value of 1175 32 kg ha 1 table 7 no significant yield variation of lentil of the two consecutive years 1166 72 kg ha 1 for 2014 2015 and 1183 92 kg ha 1 for 2015 2016 was observed table 7 the water productivity wp ranged from 1 35 to 1 52 kg m 3 and 1 57 1 83 kg m 3 for 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons respectively with a mean value of 1 56 kg m 3 table 7 results further revealed that 2015 16 cropped year improved 18 5 more water productivity wp as compared to 2014 15 ptr zt and ip produced significantly p 0 05 8 7 24 5 and 26 8 more yield and 5 5 and 14 4 improved wp as compared to dsr ct and fp respectively a relationship was drawn fig 7 between lentil seed yield and eta and it was found to be significant p 0 001 with r2 value of 0 61 the combined analysis of variance indicated that the rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management had a significant effect on seed yield of lentil and water productivity table 7 in 2014 2015 the rice establishment method had no significant effect on seed yield however differences in seed yield due to tillage and nutrient management were found significant water productivity was not significantly influenced by the rice establishment method and tillage in 2014 2015 cropping season however due to nutrient management it was found significant in 2015 2016 the rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management individually or in combination had significant effects on seed yield of lentil and water productivity table 7 treatment combinations of ptr zt ip produced the highest seed yield of 1281 kg ha 1and obtained maximum water productivity of 1 62 kg m 3 3 7 yield response factor the yield response factor ky varied between 0 81 and 1 38 with an average of 1 10 for 2014 2015 and between 0 70 and 1 16 with an average of 0 93 for 2015 2016 cropping seasons respectively under different treatments table 8 the ky values were found lower than 1 00 for ptr zt and ip respectively the treatment combination of ptr zt ip exhibited the lowest ky of 0 87 in 2014 2015 cropping season tillage had no significant effect on ky however interactions for the rice establishment method tillage and tillage nutrient management were found significant in 2015 2016 the effect of individual or combined variables were found significant a relationship between relative eta deficit 1 eta etm and relative yield decrease 1 ya ym indicated fig 8 an average slope of 1 yield loss per 1 decline in seasonal eta from the maximum evapotranspiration etm level ky 1 06 the seasonal yield water stress factor ksy values for different treatments varied between 0 67 and 0 91 with an average value of 0 78 for 2014 2015 and between 0 75 and 0 88 with an average of 0 81 for 2015 2016 cropping seasons respectively table 8 the values of ksy for ptr zt and ip were comparatively higher than dsr ct and fp respectively on average treatment combinations ptr zt ip system produced the highest ksy value of 0 85 differences in ksy due to the rice establishment method tillage and management practices individually or in combinations were found significant in each experimental year a significant relationship between seed yield and ksy was obtained with r2 value of 0 62 fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 root zone soil water storage and distribution dynamic changes in water contents of the soil profile fig 2a b under different rems depend on differences in soil hydraulic properties e g hydraulic conductivity between different soil layers and cause characteristic water content profiles a sharp reduction in soil moisture at 200 400 mm layer for ptr signifies a mechanical impediment that might restrict the upward contribution of soil water previously bandyopadhyay et al 2016 also corroborated similar observations with lentil in rice lentil relay cropping in puddled transplanted rice soil during the vegetative to flowering period larger exposure of the soil surface 0 100 mm under ct may accelerate the rate of soil water evaporation by decreasing soil water content as compared to zt the rise in ambient temperature during the vegetative to pod formation period may also be the reason for more water depletion table 4 during 2015 2016 cropping season as compared to 2014 2015 the low hydraulic conductivity of the plough sole layer under ptr table 2 restricted the vertical water movement and retained much water in the root zone as compared to soils of dsr in most of the growth periods table 4 similar findings were recorded by arora 2006 and yadav et al 2011 higher soil water storage under zt with retention of rice stubbles might be due to the reduction of evaporation the slower rate of water movement in the ptr soils table 2 with reduced non capillary porosity mohanty et al 2004 again modification of soil pore geometry by ct helps to increase water movement and enhance the root system might cause a significantly p 0 05 larger depletion of soil water table 4 several researchers gupta and bhowmick 2005 kar and kumar 2009 bandyopadhyay et al 2016 2018 kumar et al 2019 found the soil and water conservation benefits for pulse crops using zt improved management practices produced high plant biomass data not shown with higher leaf growth and leaf chlorophyll content leading to good canopy cover and more rlwc table 5 that prevent rapid evaporation from the soil surface and reduce rapid drying passioura 2006 hence the greater the surface area covered by plant canopy and crop residues in zt along with minimum water depletion in ptr the greater is its effectiveness in conserving soil water in the ptr zt ip system 4 2 soil drying out pattern bulk density and stress higher hydraulic conductivity in soils of dsr than ptr table 2 and more soil disturbance under ct than zt cause early surface soil drying fig 3a soils of ptr turned over by ct tct fabricated more stress than dzt hence soil moisture storage may be improved through the adoption of zt rather than ct the water stresses in the shrunken and dried soils made significant variations in bulk density with time fig 3b the effect of drying and wetting conditions on changes in bulk density of rice soils has also been reported in other studies zhang et al 2013 peng et al 2016 much soil water storage under zt table 4 and that too in micropores of ptr soils maintained the lowest bulk density throughout the growth period fig 3b the soil water suction as well as bulk density usually modify penetration resistance pr and affect root length density as evidenced from a linear negative significant p 0 001 r2 0 84 correlation fig 4 between root length density and pr during pod formation stage a similar relationship was also observed by vocanson et al 2006 using pea roots when the soil water deficit was lower than the readily available water the ks value raised at 1 and in this study it was only during sowing to vegetative periods fig 5 the diminution of ks values may be attributed to the increase in water depletion at the root zone through the removal of water by evapotranspiration that induced stress conditions tillage practices rice establishment methods plant type and the duration of dry periods may influence the ks non significant variation in ks in soils of dsr or ptr throughout the growth period in two cropping seasons in the present study revealed the non existence of much difference in stored water table 4 a gradual decrease in ks values at pod formation period under ct indicates a greater water stress condition than under zt and the period of such water stress coinciding with the critical developmental stages that would reduce the lentil seed yield bandyopadhyay et al 2016 also observed lower stress coefficient values during the pod formation period of lentil in soils of short duration puddled rice the formation of a hard layer of puddled rice soil with time and the development of cracks may help to lower down the ks values results showed that interaction among rice establishment method and tillage is evident for water retention and stress periods again an understanding of interaction effects of soil water and nutrients is crucial for developing management strategies for achieving high yields and use efficiency of both water and nutrients in rainfed water stressed conditions nutrient management practices influenced ks may be due to cover up the soil with better foliage to check evaporation loss more soil water storage in ip table 4 in this study higher soil water retention under ptr zt ip can provide a buffer for the drought episodes during the growing season of lentil 4 3 plant physiology and soil water in the present study the relative leaf water content rlwc and the leaf chlorophyll content lcc of lentil are proved to be the key plant parameters for the evaluation of tolerance to water stress as they are highly correlated with soil water status fig 6a and b the water stress resulted in significant decreases in the rlwc and the lcc and could be related to low water uptake and higher transpiration rate under stress conditions the reduction in rlwc in lentils under ct and fp table 5 indicated a loss of turgor that resulted in limited water availability as evidenced by the steep decrease of ks fig 5a and b indicating a more stressed condition than zt and ip during flowering to pod formation period zhang et al 2008 and talukdar 2013 obtained similar relationships between soil water deficit and rlwc with peas and lentils again the decline in soil water storage and rlwc under ct and fp limits water and nutrient supply to lentil leaves that influenced the sensitivity of pigments like chlorophyll as chlorophyll synthesis requires nitrogen n and phosphorous p from soils wu et al 2006 mafakheri et al 2010 standing stubbles reduced the evaporation from the soil surface through modifying the micro climate and helps to translocate nutrients at the desired level turning into good canopy cover as evidenced by higher values of lcc and rlwc under zt and ip in this study table 5 the lower root zone soil water storage at pod formation period of 2015 2016 table 4 reduced the rlwc and lcc below 60 and 2 0 mg g 1 fw this is probably because of the result of the decrease in the size of the leaf cells and the subsequent decrease in leaf area data not shown and a decrease in the density of chlorophyll earlier studies kaiser 1987 reported that photosynthesis was rather insensitive to dehydration down to 50 70 rlwc and different plant species have a very similar response our observation was consistent with the reported values of lentil under stress conditions azizi e chakherchaman et al 2009 ahmadpour and hosseinzadeh 2017 4 4 soil water balance and actual evapotranspiration lower initial soil water at the time of sowing explained lower profile water change in soils of dsr and ct as compared to ptr and zt table 6 however deep cracks created at the mid season were subjected to accelerate residual soil moisture evaporation from soils of ptr and zt causing higher root zone profile water change bandyopadhyay et al 2018 and kumar et al 2020 also reported that soils of ptr increased the soil cracking that possibly a factor of increased loss of soil moisture the wetter moisture regime ptr zt resulted in a greater depletion as depletion efficiency appeared to be dependent on the depth and availability of soil water at that depth and the overlying depths the finding is in line with a recent study under similar conditions bandyopadhyay et al 2016 favorable hydrothermal regime due to the presence of stubbles in zt bandyopadhyay et al 2016 along with nutrient management ip maintained higher rlwc and lcc table 5 encouraged root growth of lentil and thus enhanced utilization of conserved soil moisture zero tillage with standing stubbles may also help in ensuring slow and steady entry of rainwater and thus increase water availability in the root zone on average the actual root zone profile water change of 62 mm of water table 6 was found within the taw range of the profile table 2 indicating that lentil is a low water requirement crop and could be a suitable crop grown using the residual soil water under the rainfed condition the actual evapotranspiration eta is assured mainly from the change in soil water storage and the effective precipitation received during the growth period hillel 1980 the variations of eta from 68 45 to 82 76 mm were attributed to the interaction effects of rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management practices zhou et al 2019 reported that the variations in eta may be attributed to the meteorological factors length of the growth period crop morpho physiological factors soil factors associated with nutrient availability and water availability during growing seasons different workers saxena 2009 bandyopadhyay et al 2018 maji et al 2019 reported eta in the range of 110 483 mm for lentil in india under both rainfed and irrigated conditions after harvesting of long duration puddled transplanted rice under contrasting tillage practices in the present study maximum eta has been observed under ptr zt ip treatment combinations as the stubble height and crop vegetative mulching was effective in reducing the loss of evaporation from the soil surface by forming a barrier between the soil surface and the atmosphere during the crop growth period bandyopadhyay et al 2016 showed that crop canopy and stubble contributed equally to the reduction of evaporation in lentil under limited water conditions on the other hand li et al 2014 opined that higher water loss occurred from dsr soils as compared to the soils of ptr 4 5 lentil seed yield and water productivity dsr systems comparatively more vulnerable to water loss and nutrient deficiencies are prominent resulting in lesser yield than ptr higher moisture status under zt increased root proliferation and thus enhanced the availability of nutrients to crop roots thereby reflecting higher plant water status chlorophyll content and grain yield which is in agreement with previous findings bandyopadhyay et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 residue retention may also enhance rainwater conservation by carrying over extra soil water during the growth and development of winter crops shaxon and barber 2003 decreasing rlwc and ground green cover due to water stress led to significant reductions in seed yield under ct in the present study nutrient management ip produced 27 more yield than fp and these findings were consistent with das and jana 2015 application of b and zn influence floral biology relating to flower drop pod setting yamagishi and yamamoto 1994 srivastava et al 2000 and pollen viability pandey et al 2009 singh and bhatt 2013 and also physiological changes alleviating water stress thus improved seed yield kundu et al 2017 found that npk 2 of urea foliar treatment attained a maximum yield of 1603 8 kg ha 1 seed yield of 1530 kg ha 1 in zt compared with 1220 kg ha 1 under ct was observed in indo gangetic plain majumder 2011 kumar et al 2018 observed 1515 kg ha 1 seed yield in dsr zt in north india the relationship between actual evapotranspiration and lentil seed yield fig 7 showed that a yield gain of 14 3 kg was obtained for every 1 mm increase in eta several researchers supported this yield eta relationship elsewhere huang et al 2004 sarkar et al 2010 the variability of water productivity wp indicates deviation due to seed yield per unit water used and the wp decreased as the amount of available residual water increased or seed yield decreased table 7 in the present study higher water use as well as higher yield in ptr led to greater wp 1 6 kg m 3 than dsr 1 5 kg m 3 the standing rice residue stubbles in zt might have helped to reduce evaporation loss conserve more soil water by reducing loss from rainfall and thus contributed to higher wp 1 6 kg m 3 than ct 1 5 kg m 3 the rapid growth of plant canopy due to fertilizer application ip provided shade to reduce evaporation of water from the soil surface and had higher wp 1 7 kg m 3 as compared to fp 1 5 kg m 3 the positive impact of nutrient management on wp has been demonstrated elsewhere iaea international atomic energy agency 2005 singh et al 2015 higher wp from second crops in rice fallows was found with reduced tillage than that under ct kar and kumar 2009 bandyopadhyay et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 however silim et al 1993 found wp of lentil ranged from 0 3 to 0 86 kg m 3 in northern syria cutforth and mcconkey 1997 and cayci et al 2009 obtained wp values of 0 62 and 0 69 kg m 3 in semi arid regions of canada and turkey in the water scarce countries of the wana region oweis et al 2004 found wp values of 0 45 and 0 59 kg m 3 under rainfed and supplemental irrigated conditions in the present study treatment combinations of ptr zt ip produced significantly higher wp 1 62 kg m 3 than reported elsewhere this could be due to lower eta under rainfed conditions line sowing of lentil and the use of post rice residual soil water 4 6 yield response factor the values of yield response factor ky decreased with the decrease in soil wetness that indicates the crop s tolerance to soil water stress lovelly et al 2007 according to kirda 2002 and steduto et al 2012 a ky smaller than 1 indicates the tolerance of water stress to a greater extent and could be exposed to water deficit in the present study lentil with ptr zt and ip with a value lower than 1 of ky shows tolerance to water stress with higher productions and maintained stability in water productivity table 8 the reverse is true in the case of dsr ct and fp with a greater than 1 ky hence the shortage of water and environmental stresses caused a profound impact on yield according to doorenbos and kassam 1979 ky values lower than 0 85 indicate a kind of low sensitivity to water deficit between 0 85 and 1 0 low to medium sensitivity between 1 0 and 1 15 medium to high sensitivity and above 1 15 high sensitivity considering this criterion the present study demonstrated that lentil in this sub tropical climate under rainfed condition is a crop with low to medium sensitivity to water deficiency with the ky of 1 06 fig 8 the seasonal yield water stress factor ksy increased with increasing soil wetness table 8 similar to ks values for ptr zt and ip treatments fig 5a and b however is responsible for predicting seasonal actual evapotranspiration or approximate estimation of historical water use allen et al 1998 kirda 2002 the linear relationship fig 9 depicted that 63 variation in seed yield could be attributed due to changes in the magnitude of seasonal yield water stress the treatment combination of ptr zt ip exhibited the lowest yield response factor ky 0 87 the highest seasonal yield water stress factor ksy 0 85 with higher yield and eta as compared to other treatment combinations indicated the suitability of lentil with post rice residual water 5 conclusion our study suggests that puddled transplanted rice ptr along with zero tillage zt and nutrient management ip improved leaf water content rlwc and chlorophyll concentration lcc reduced soil water depletion and caused a minimum water stress coefficient ks that could help to escape terminal drought therefore provided the highest seed yield 1281 kg ha 1 water productivity 1 62 kg m 3 and exhibited the lowest yield response factor ky 0 87 zt in lentil under ptr increased soil water retention periods and regulated nutrients availability higher root zone soil water storage with ptr zt and ip generated a concomitant increase in the actual evapotranspiration eta lentil grown under post rice residual water showed low to medium sensitivity to water deficit and is well suited to deficit water regimes with ky value 1 06 hence to promote lentil cultivation in the lgp with early to medium duration rice a ptr zt ip system needs to be adopted for enhancing the cropping

stress water productivity yield response factor 1 introduction lentil lens culinaris medik is a self pollinating cool season pulse crop in india occupying 1 55 million hectares ha with an annual productivity of 1032 kg ha 1 and a production of 1 56 million tonnes sharing 28 6 of the world s annual production goi government of india 2019 it is generally cultivated in marginal soils of post rice residual soil water under rainfed conditions as rice lentil cropping system rawal and navarro 2019 the lower gangetic plain lgp of india contributes 10 3 0 16 million ha of the total lentil growing area of india with an annual productivity of 980 kg ha 1 and a production of 0 15 million tonnes sharing 9 6 of india s annual production goi government of india 2019 in this area farmers usually grow lentil during pre winter from late november to early december after harvesting of long duration 150 160 days puddled transplanted rice ptr varieties most of the farmers use their own preserved seeds of long duration local varieties according to reddy and reddy 2010 lentil yield in the farmers field is 46 62 lower than what we obtained in research stations in india rapid soil water depletion after rice harvest followed by a fast decline in the water table coupled with the rise in temperature results in mid and terminal drought at flowering and pod filling stages adversely affecting the productivity of lentil reddy 2009 ali et al 2014 bandyopadhyay et al 2016 2018 the introduction of early maturing rice varieties 110 120 days may help to escape such abiotic stresses and could increase the system productivity in these rainfed areas puddled operation wet tillage of transplanted rice soils makes the hardpan and massive structure with a higher penetration resistance that adversely affects the productivity of subsequent winter crops presumably by limiting root growth and distribution kar and kumar 2009 ghosh et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 reports also revealed that if ploughing is done after the harvest of rice to remove or bury the stubbles the sowing of lentil is delayed this in turn affects germination due to the formation of large size clods with high breaking strength thereby rendering the soil water deficit kar and kumar 2009 bandyopadhyay et al 2016 2018 hence a shift of rice establishment method rem from ptr to direct seeded rice dsr cultivation may facilitate timely sowing of the next crop after rice and ensure successful double cropping of rice lentil system farooq et al 2011 kumar et al 2019 moreover puddling and transplanting require a large amount of water and labor both of which are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive making rice production less profitable and these factors also demand a major shift from ptr production to dsr pandey and velasco 2002 kumar and ladha 2011 presently dsr is also becoming popular as an alternative to ptr particularly in the indo gangetic plain igp as a means of conservation agriculture ca to avert the declining trends of soil quality crop productivity and resource use efficiency gathala et al 2011 kumar et al 2019 different soil pore geometry among ptr and dsr alters water retention and release patterns and may restrict or enhance the proliferation of the lentil root system systematic comparative study on water use pattern the productivity level of lentil and yield water relationship under dsr and ptr have not been explored especially with different tillage and nutrient management hence a tillage system needs to be evaluated that gives a smooth transition between wetland rice soil ptr and dry land arable soil conditions dsr with maximum utilization of residual soil water through regulating hydrothermal regimes in rainfed agriculture water availability is the primary factor controlling crop productivity and reduced tillage is considered as one of the major applications for water conservation passioura 2006 singh et al 2015 research evidence in soils of ptr showed that zero tillage zt or no tillage nt with retention of rice stubble mulching significantly enhanced productivity of lentil in rice lentil cropping system kar and kumar 2009 ghosh et al 2016 bandyopadhyay et al 2016 2018 kumar et al 2020 residue retention plays an important role in the reduction of evaporation by creating a more complex micro climate which could directly affect the distribution of surface soil water morris et al 2010 gathala et al 2011 das et al 2014 bandyopadhyay et al 2016 2018 kumar et al 2019 such information on the relative contributions of tillage with or without residue retention on yield water relationship for lentil in dsr soils is rather scanty a general tendency of the marginal farmers in this region is to grow lentil without any input because they considered it as a bonus crop the reluctance of the farmers to apply any basal dose of fertilizer at the time of sowing severely affects the productivity of the crop ali et al 2014 a starter dose is required until the legume crop begins to fix atmospheric n or a balanced dose of nutrients particularly at the pre flowering stage was found to have a beneficial effect on increasing seed yield bala et al 2011 das and jana 2015 maji et al 2019 research evidence also showed that foliar nutrition with zn and b improves crop growth and physiology by alleviating the harmful effects of drought yadavi et al 2014 yamagishi and yamamoto 1994 however nutrient uptake assimilation is directly dependent on the amount of soil water in the root zone that maintains the turgidity of plants and restricts the dissolution and transfer of nutrients tiemann and billings 2011 soil water availability altered by different tillage practices on different rice establishment methods have a bearing on the accessibility of applied nutrients in soils and plants thus may have an impact on root growth leaf area relative leaf water content rlwc and leaf chlorophyll concentration lcc of lentil temporal changes in soil water stress ks and the seasonal yield water stress ksy factors are the functions of soil water availability and crop water productivity kirda 2002 steduto et al 2012 water deficits and the resulting water stress on the plant affect crop evapotranspiration et and crop yield and thus water productivity wp the wp has a high degree of uncertainty and varies greatly with several factors including weather soil characteristics that affect infiltration and redistribution of water antecedent soil water uniformity of water application crop response to fertilizers chemicals etc mbava et al 2020 hence the relationship between the level of water deficiency experienced by crops and their yield reduction is evident among the existing methods to study this relationship the yield response factor ky stands out as described by doorenbos and kassam 1979 moreover factors other than water such as nutrients different cultivars soil season growth stage etc also affect ky kirda 2002 ali 2009 the information on ky of lentil is scanty especially cultivated with balanced fertilization on post rice residual soil water of different rice establishment methods the existence of such a yield function can constitute an important planning and management tool predicting water productivity wp modeling of the crop coefficient suitability of the crop under stress or necessary supplemental irrigation in the future keeping this in view in the present study it has been hypothesized that short duration rice varieties under different rice establishment method supports early sowing of lentil by restraining diverse amounts of residual soil water and curbing soil water stress tillage options on ptr or dsr soils may have much robust impact on water availability for lentil by altering soil water storage capacity reducing soil evaporation and allowing a better development of root systems proper technology relating to nutrient inputs and soil water availability may influence the plant physiology and productivity of lentil and lastly soil management by rice establishment method tillage and nutrient may influence the suitability of lentil in post rice residual soil water therefore an attempt has been made to grow lentil in soils of different rice establishments ptr and dsr following tillage zt and ct and balanced nutrient management with nutrient and without nutrient during post rainy seasons through utilizing the carry over soil water in lgp of india with the aim to assess the effects of rice establishment method dsr versus ptr tillage and nutrient management on soil water retention and field water balance of post rice lentil and to monitor and quantify the level of crop water stress and its effect on the seed yield and the water productivity of lentil through the interactive effects of nutrient tillage and rice establishment method and to determine the yield response factor for lentil grown in post rice residual soil water 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and soil information

20th july 2015 at the age of 21 days in rows during transplanting of ptr half of n and full of p2o5 and k2o were also applied as basal 1 4th of n was top dressed twice at tillering and at panicle initiation stages in both dsr and ptr the dsr were harvested on 21st october 2014 and 16th october 2015 respectively and the ptr were harvested on 23rd october 2014 and 24th october 2015 respectively the yield of rice in dsr and ptr ranged from 4360 to 4790 kg ha 1 for the two consecutive years just after harvesting of rice the land was used for lentil cultivation the experiment with lentil was set up in a split split plot design with three replications rice establishment methods dsr and ptr were the main plot treatments and the sub plots treatments were tillage practices conventional tillage ct with no residues and zero tillage zt with 20 cm standing rice stubbles the sub sub plots were nutrient management improved management ip and farmers practice fp the sub sub plots were 5 4 m2 in size strips of land 1 m wide acted as buffer areas between the main plots and 0 75 m buffer areas between replications at the time of the sowing of lentil seeds the water content of the surface soil 0 30 mm was 40 and 35 for zt and ct respectively seed rate method of sowing total growth period of lentil during the experimental years along with the depth of residual soil water content at the time of sowing are given in table 3 in zt and ct systems seeds were sown ensuring an adequate seed soil contact the matured rice crop was harvested leaving the stubble height at 20 cm which left 0 35

farmers practice fp was no fertilizer application for lentil crop however in improved management ip seeds were coated with rhizobium culture and shade dried before sowing with necessary fertilizers a recommended dose of 20 kg n 40 kg p2o5 and 20 kg k2o ha 1 was applied the n was applied in the form of urea 46 n while p and k were applied in the form of single super phosphate ssp 16 p2o5 and muriate of potash mop 60 k2o respectively in ip plots 2 urea was sprayed at 45 days after sowing i e just after first weeding and 0 5 zinc as znso40 7 h2o and 0 25 boron as h3bo3 were sprayed before the onset of flowering for zt a narrow furrow was opened in between two rice lines using a manually drawn zt seed drill i e 25 cm spacing 4 5 days after rice harvest fertilizer was applied seeds were placed and covered with soil on the same day for ct 7 10 days after rice harvest at the time of land preparation table 3 fertilizers were broadcasted at the time of sowing of lentil seeds upon two rice establishments the water content of the surface soil 0 30 mm was moist and above field capacity 40 46 in each year and hence more than 85 of seeds were well germinated keeping plant populations 1 050 000 and 1 250 000 plants ha 1 at full establishment 50 days after sowing das lentil was harvested around the middle of february of the following year with an age of 106 113 days 2 3 observations soil water measurement was done gravimetrically from lentil plots using a core sampler of 50 mm diameter and a length of 50 mm for the surface soil 0 30 mm at 10 days interval a pr2 6profile probe soil water meter delta t devices ltd cambridge uk was used for 50 100 100 200 200 300 and 300 400 mm depths the reading of the probe was calibrated using gravimetric soil samples and the bulk density values for the four depths 100 200 300 and 400 mm and was found comparable a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 925 p 0 01 was obtained with a calibration equation of y 1 033x where y and x are soil water content measured by soil auger and pr2 6 profile probe water meter the experimental field was sampled 10 12 times before harvest in the two years of experimentation besides profile water content

following the method of blake and hartge 1986 at 15 days interval a constant head permeameter was used to measure saturated hydraulic conductivity klute and dirksen 1986 penetration resistance was determined from the soil surface down to 400 mm depth at 30 mm depth increments with a handheld penetrometer eijkelkamp penetrologger with a 1 cm cone diameter and a 60 degree angle the total available water taw content mm at a depth of 0 30 30 100 100 200 200 300 and 300 400 mm was calculated as the difference between the water content at field capacity 0 033 mpa and permanent wilting

relative humidity as medium 40 70 wind speed as light 2 m s 1 and windward side distance of short green grass as 1000 m from the pan allen et al 1998 during the lentil growing seasons five plant samples from each plot in each replication were selected randomly at flowering and pod formation stages for relative leaf water content rlwc and leaf chlorophyll concentration lcc and the mean of three replications was computed the rlwc was estimated by the method of barrs and weatherly 1962 by using the following equation 6 rwc fw dw tw dw 100 where tw turgid weight dw dry weight and fw fresh weight of leaves total chlorophyll concentration was determined from 10 to 15 fully expanded lentil leaves from plants of each plot by 95 v v ethanol extraction method followed by spectroscopic absorbance measurement at 645 and 663 nm arnon 1949 during the flowering and pod formation stages the total chlorophyll content mg g 1 fresh weight fw was computed by using the following equation 7

root samples were collected by using a root auger at flowering and pod formation stages up to 400 mm depth as no roots were found beyond 400 mm depth after washing with tap water root samples were scanned with a winrhizo scanner and the images were analyzed for root length density using winrhizo software regent instruments inc 2001 chemin sainte foy quebec canada after lentil matured physiologically grain yield was determined by hand harvesting from each plot and the yield data was normalized to 14 seed moisture content the water productivity wp kg m 3 was calculated as the ratio of lentil grain yield y kg ha 1 to seasonal actual evapotranspiration eta mm as 8 wp y eta the response of yield to the water supply is quantified through the yield response factor ky and was

distribution varied during the growth of lentil for 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons fig 1a and b under zt and ct systems upon two different rice establishment methods viz direct seeded rice dsr and puddled transplanted rice ptr the range of temperatures at the time of sowing to vegetative periods of lentil during 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons were 10 0 35 0 and 15 5 34 5 c for zt 0 50 das 9 0 35 0 and 11 6 34 5 c for ct 0 45 das respectively again the temperature range during flowering to the pod formation period of lentil was 7 9 30 0 and 10 4 30 0 c for zt 65 85 das 7 9 30 8 and 9 2 30 0 c for ct 60 80 das respectively during 2014 15 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons fig 1 shows that the crop received 2 4 and 8 0 mm rainfall during flowering to the pod formation period in 2014 15 season and 6 6 and 6 5 mm rainfall at vegetative to the flowering period and during the pod formation stage in 2015 16 cropping season from sowing to the vegetative period the eto rate was 1 35 and 1 90 mm day 1 for 2014 15 and 2015 16 cropping seasons respectively and decreased in both the years 1 1 mm day 1 while maintaining an average eto rate of 1 0 mm day 1 up to end of flowering 60 75 das the average eto rate at the pod formation stage was 1 65 and 1 55 mm day 1 during 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons respectively 3 2 root zone soil water storage and distribution distribution of soil water up to root zone 0 400 mm at sowing vegetative flowering and pod formation periods under different rice establishment methods rem during 2015 16 cropping season showed a decreasing trend from sowing to harvesting fig 2a and b at each depth lentil grown in soils under direct seeded rice dsr drained more water than soils under puddled transplanted rice ptr from sowing to flowering periods conventional tillage ct depleted much water as compared to zero tillage zt in both rems the surface 0 30 mm soil water depleted from 35 and 40 under ct and zt during sowing to 12 and 14 at pod formation period under dsr and ptr respectively higher soil water was observed below the surface layer throughout the growth period in both dsr and ptr soils making a hydraulic gradient upward in the root zone during the pod formation period remarkable soil water depletion was observed under ptr as compared to dsr fig 2a and b the root zone soil water storage from 0 to 400 mm soil layer at different phenophases of lentil during two consecutive years table 4 showed that it was lower in 2015 2016 cropping season as compared to 2014 2015 however the total water storage was decreasing with crop age from 150 41 mm at sowing time to 101 06 mm at pod formation period in both the cropping seasons on average ptr stored significantly 4 4 and 3 more soil water than dsr at sowing vegetative and flowering periods respectively however no significant effect was observed at the pod formation period among the tillage zt had a significant effect on soil water storage and added significantly 21 14 16 and 19 more water in the root zone as compared with ct during sowing vegetative flowering and pod formation periods respectively root zone soil water storage was also significantly influenced by nutrient management practices ip during flowering and pod formation periods in both years with 8 and 11 more water retention than farmers practice fp the combined analysis of variance for different growth periods indicated that interaction among the primary factors rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management was non significant on soil water storage the interaction among rice establishment method and tillage practices indicated that ptr zt stored significantly higher soil water i e 158 84 141 74 129 28 and 104 84 mm at sowing vegetative flowering and pod formation periods respectively 3 3 soil drying out pattern bulk density and stress from 2 years of extensive soil water data the surface 0 100 mm soil drying out pattern during critical lentil crop growth periods under different rem and tillage fig 3a indicated that ct faced soil drying earlier than zt especially from the initiation of the flowering period 60 das onwards and soil drying out pattern of zt was slower throughout the growth period during the initiation of flowering dsr ct dct achieved 0 8 mpa tension as compared to 0 3 0 2 and 0 1 mpa for ptr ct tct dsr zt dzt and ptr zt tzt respectively during pod filling period 90 das onwards except for tzt all treatments showed values above 1 5 mpa significant logarithmic relationships were obtained between bulk density and time fig 3b of the treatments used rem and tillage after 30 das dct showed a significant increase in bulk density from vegetative 1 46 mg m 3 to harvesting 1 58 mg m 3 period with 91 variability however treatment tzt maintains a constant bulk density of 1 43 mg m 3during this period with 78 variability the bulk density of dzt and tct were intermediate between dct and tzt and increased from 1 43 to 1 52 mg m 3 at the said periods the surface drying as well as the variations in bulk density reflected the root penetration fig 4 in such a way that with the increase in 0 1 mpa penetration resistance there was 0 8 mm cm 3 reduction in rld at the pod formation period the intensity of stress designated as soil water stress coefficient ks faced by lentil at critical growth periods under rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management practices for 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons are depicted in fig 5 from sowing to the peak of the vegetative period 30 das in both years ks value was 1 after which it was decreased in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons no significant effect of stress was observed with rem as both ptr and dsr faced 10 and 32 stress and 20 and 40 stress respectively at flowering and pod formation periods during 2014 2015 season ct faced 19 and 50 stress at flowering and pod formation periods as compared to 1 and 15 for zt whereas in 2015 2016 season zt faced significantly 8 and 32 stress as compared to 31 and 47 for ct during these periods in 2014 2015 season a significant difference between ip and fp was observed at flowering and pod formation periods however it was non significant during 2015 2016 cropping season interactions among rice establishment method and tillage and among tillage and nutrient management practices significantly influenced the ks at flowering and pod formation periods in 2014 2015 crop season however interaction of rice establishment method tillage and rice establishment method nutrient management practices were found significant during 2015 2016 cropping season 3 4 plant physiology and soil water from the pooled data of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons it was observed that relative water content of leaves rlwc and leaf chlorophyll content lcc are functions of soil water storage fig 6a and b data revealed that 5 of rlwc could be increased with 10 mm of soil water storage fig 6a and additional 10 mm of water could increase 0 18 mg lcc g 1 fresh weight fig 6b the rlwc and lcc of lentil at flowering were higher as compared to the pod formation period in both 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons table 5 no significant change of rlwc and lcc was also observed between dsr and ptr in both years tillage had no significant effect on rlwc and lcc at the flowering period however zt showed significantly 6 4 higher rlwc and 17 8 higher lcc than ct at pod formation period during flowering and pod formation periods the treatment ip improved 5 7 and 5 3 more rlwc and 6 2 and 10 3 more lcc as compared with fp the combined analysis of variance indicated that the factors rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management had a very significant effect on rlwc during 2015 2016 cropping seasons however no interactions among the variables on leaf chlorophyll content were observed in both cropping seasons 3 5 soil water balance and actual evapotranspiration the root zone profile water change in 2014 2015 cropping season was 34 53 higher than 2015 2016 table 6 and it was reflected in the actual evapotranspiration eta in both seasons the profile water change was significantly 7 higher in ptr than dsr 24 higher in zt than ct and 11 higher in ip as compared to fp respectively during 2014 15 and 2015 16 cropping seasons the lentil crop received 10 4 and 16 1 mm effective rainfall respectively the eta of 2014 2015 cropping season was 16 8 higher than 2015 2016 on average ptr zt and ip possessed 5 21 and 10 more eta than dsr ct and fp respectively table 6 results showed that treatment combinations of ptr zt zt ip and ptr zt ip produced significantly more eta i e 80 1 80 0 and 79 8 mm respectively individual effects of primary variables rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management had a significant effect on profile water change and actual evapotranspiration table 6 no significant interactions among variables on profile water change were observed except rice establishment method tillage the combined analysis of variance indicated that the rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management had a very significant effect on evapotranspiration interactions among variables were also significant except for the rice establishment method nutrient management for actual evapotranspiration 3 6 lentil seed yield and water productivity the seed yield of lentil ranged from 1001 96 to 1331 49 kg ha 1 and 1020 27 1347 57 kg ha 1 for 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons respectively with a mean value of 1175 32 kg ha 1 table 7 no significant yield variation of lentil of the two consecutive years 1166 72 kg ha 1 for 2014 2015 and 1183 92 kg ha 1 for 2015 2016 was observed table 7 the water productivity wp ranged from 1 35 to 1 52 kg m 3 and 1 57 1 83 kg m 3 for 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 cropping seasons respectively with a mean value of 1 56 kg m 3 table 7 results further revealed that 2015 16 cropped year improved 18 5 more water productivity wp as compared to 2014 15 ptr zt and ip produced significantly p 0 05 8 7 24 5 and 26 8 more yield and 5 5 and 14 4 improved wp as compared to dsr ct and fp respectively a relationship was drawn fig 7 between lentil seed yield and eta and it was found to be significant p 0 001 with r2 value of 0 61 the combined analysis of variance indicated that the rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management had a significant effect on seed yield of lentil and water productivity table 7 in 2014 2015 the rice establishment method had no significant effect on seed yield however differences in seed yield due to tillage and nutrient management were found significant water productivity was not significantly influenced by the rice establishment method and tillage in 2014 2015 cropping season however due to nutrient management it was found significant in 2015 2016 the rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management individually or in combination had significant effects on seed yield of lentil and water productivity table 7 treatment combinations of ptr zt ip produced the highest seed yield of 1281 kg ha 1and obtained maximum water productivity of 1 62 kg m 3 3 7 yield response factor the yield response factor ky varied between 0 81 and 1 38 with an average of 1 10 for 2014 2015 and between 0 70 and 1 16 with an average of 0 93 for 2015 2016 cropping seasons respectively under different treatments table 8 the ky values were found lower than 1 00 for ptr zt and ip respectively the treatment combination of ptr zt ip exhibited the lowest ky of 0 87 in 2014 2015 cropping season tillage had no significant effect on ky however interactions for the rice establishment method tillage and tillage nutrient management were found significant in 2015 2016 the effect of individual or combined variables were found significant a relationship between relative eta deficit 1 eta etm and relative yield decrease 1 ya ym indicated fig 8 an average slope of 1 yield loss per 1 decline in seasonal eta from the maximum evapotranspiration etm level ky 1 06 the seasonal yield water stress factor ksy values for different treatments varied between 0 67 and 0 91 with an average value of 0 78 for 2014 2015 and between 0 75 and 0 88 with an average of 0 81 for 2015 2016 cropping seasons respectively table 8 the values of ksy for ptr zt and ip were comparatively higher than dsr ct and fp respectively on average treatment combinations ptr zt ip system produced the highest ksy value of 0 85 differences in ksy due to the rice establishment method tillage and management practices individually or in combinations were found significant in each experimental year a significant relationship between seed yield and ksy was obtained with r2 value of 0 62 fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 root zone soil water storage and distribution dynamic changes in water contents of the soil profile fig 2a b under different rems depend on differences in soil hydraulic properties e g hydraulic conductivity between different soil layers and cause characteristic water content profiles a sharp reduction in soil moisture at 200 400 mm layer for ptr signifies a mechanical impediment that might restrict the upward contribution of soil water previously bandyopadhyay et al 2016 also corroborated similar observations with lentil in rice lentil relay cropping in puddled transplanted rice soil during the vegetative to flowering period larger exposure of the soil surface 0 100 mm under ct may accelerate the rate of soil water evaporation by decreasing soil water content as compared to zt the rise in ambient temperature during the vegetative to pod formation period may also be the reason for more water depletion table 4 during 2015 2016 cropping season as compared to 2014 2015 the low hydraulic conductivity of the plough sole layer under ptr table 2 restricted the vertical water movement and retained much water in the root zone as compared to soils of dsr in most of the growth periods table 4 similar findings were recorded by arora 2006 and yadav et al 2011 higher soil water storage under zt with retention of rice stubbles might be due to the reduction of evaporation the slower rate of water movement in the ptr soils table 2 with reduced non capillary porosity mohanty et al 2004 again modification of soil pore geometry by ct helps to increase water movement and enhance the root system might cause a significantly p 0 05 larger depletion of soil water table 4 several researchers gupta and bhowmick 2005 kar and kumar 2009 bandyopadhyay et al 2016 2018 kumar et al 2019 found the soil and water conservation benefits for pulse crops using zt improved management practices produced high plant biomass data not shown with higher leaf growth and leaf chlorophyll content leading to good canopy cover and more rlwc table 5 that prevent rapid evaporation from the soil surface and reduce rapid drying passioura 2006 hence the greater the surface area covered by plant canopy and crop residues in zt along with minimum water depletion in ptr the greater is its effectiveness in conserving soil water in the ptr zt ip system 4 2 soil drying out pattern bulk density and stress higher hydraulic conductivity in soils of dsr than ptr table 2 and more soil disturbance under ct than zt cause early surface soil drying fig 3a soils of ptr turned over by ct tct fabricated more stress than dzt hence soil moisture storage may be improved through the adoption of zt rather than ct the water stresses in the shrunken and dried soils made significant variations in bulk density with time fig 3b the effect of drying and wetting conditions on changes in bulk density of rice soils has also been reported in other studies zhang et al 2013 peng et al 2016 much soil water storage under zt table 4 and that too in micropores of ptr soils maintained the lowest bulk density throughout the growth period fig 3b the soil water suction as well as bulk density usually modify penetration resistance pr and affect root length density as evidenced from a linear negative significant p 0 001 r2 0 84 correlation fig 4 between root length density and pr during pod formation stage a similar relationship was also observed by vocanson et al 2006 using pea roots when the soil water deficit was lower than the readily available water the ks value raised at 1 and in this study it was only during sowing to vegetative periods fig 5 the diminution of ks values may be attributed to the increase in water depletion at the root zone through the removal of water by evapotranspiration that induced stress conditions tillage practices rice establishment methods plant type and the duration of dry periods may influence the ks non significant variation in ks in soils of dsr or ptr throughout the growth period in two cropping seasons in the present study revealed the non existence of much difference in stored water table 4 a gradual decrease in ks values at pod formation period under ct indicates a greater water stress condition than under zt and the period of such water stress coinciding with the critical developmental stages that would reduce the lentil seed yield bandyopadhyay et al 2016 also observed lower stress coefficient values during the pod formation period of lentil in soils of short duration puddled rice the formation of a hard layer of puddled rice soil with time and the development of cracks may help to lower down the ks values results showed that interaction among rice establishment method and tillage is evident for water retention and stress periods again an understanding of interaction effects of soil water and nutrients is crucial for developing management strategies for achieving high yields and use efficiency of both water and nutrients in rainfed water stressed conditions nutrient management practices influenced ks may be due to cover up the soil with better foliage to check evaporation loss more soil water storage in ip table 4 in this study higher soil water retention under ptr zt ip can provide a buffer for the drought episodes during the growing season of lentil 4 3 plant physiology and soil water in the present study the relative leaf water content rlwc and the leaf chlorophyll content lcc of lentil are proved to be the key plant parameters for the evaluation of tolerance to water stress as they are highly correlated with soil water status fig 6a and b the water stress resulted in significant decreases in the rlwc and the lcc and could be related to low water uptake and higher transpiration rate under stress conditions the reduction in rlwc in lentils under ct and fp table 5 indicated a loss of turgor that resulted in limited water availability as evidenced by the steep decrease of ks fig 5a and b indicating a more stressed condition than zt and ip during flowering to pod formation period zhang et al 2008 and talukdar 2013 obtained similar relationships between soil water deficit and rlwc with peas and lentils again the decline in soil water storage and rlwc under ct and fp limits water and nutrient supply to lentil leaves that influenced the sensitivity of pigments like chlorophyll as chlorophyll synthesis requires nitrogen n and phosphorous p from soils wu et al 2006 mafakheri et al 2010 standing stubbles reduced the evaporation from the soil surface through modifying the micro climate and helps to translocate nutrients at the desired level turning into good canopy cover as evidenced by higher values of lcc and rlwc under zt and ip in this study table 5 the lower root zone soil water storage at pod formation period of 2015 2016 table 4 reduced the rlwc and lcc below 60 and 2 0 mg g 1 fw this is probably because of the result of the decrease in the size of the leaf cells and the subsequent decrease in leaf area data not shown and a decrease in the density of chlorophyll earlier studies kaiser 1987 reported that photosynthesis was rather insensitive to dehydration down to 50 70 rlwc and different plant species have a very similar response our observation was consistent with the reported values of lentil under stress conditions azizi e chakherchaman et al 2009 ahmadpour and hosseinzadeh 2017 4 4 soil water balance and actual evapotranspiration lower initial soil water at the time of sowing explained lower profile water change in soils of dsr and ct as compared to ptr and zt table 6 however deep cracks created at the mid season were subjected to accelerate residual soil moisture evaporation from soils of ptr and zt causing higher root zone profile water change bandyopadhyay et al 2018 and kumar et al 2020 also reported that soils of ptr increased the soil cracking that possibly a factor of increased loss of soil moisture the wetter moisture regime ptr zt resulted in a greater depletion as depletion efficiency appeared to be dependent on the depth and availability of soil water at that depth and the overlying depths the finding is in line with a recent study under similar conditions bandyopadhyay et al 2016 favorable hydrothermal regime due to the presence of stubbles in zt bandyopadhyay et al 2016 along with nutrient management ip maintained higher rlwc and lcc table 5 encouraged root growth of lentil and thus enhanced utilization of conserved soil moisture zero tillage with standing stubbles may also help in ensuring slow and steady entry of rainwater and thus increase water availability in the root zone on average the actual root zone profile water change of 62 mm of water table 6 was found within the taw range of the profile table 2 indicating that lentil is a low water requirement crop and could be a suitable crop grown using the residual soil water under the rainfed condition the actual evapotranspiration eta is assured mainly from the change in soil water storage and the effective precipitation received during the growth period hillel 1980 the variations of eta from 68 45 to 82 76 mm were attributed to the interaction effects of rice establishment method tillage and nutrient management practices zhou et al 2019 reported that the variations in eta may be attributed to the meteorological factors length of the growth period crop morpho physiological factors soil factors associated with nutrient availability and water availability during growing seasons different workers saxena 2009 bandyopadhyay et al 2018 maji et al 2019 reported eta in the range of 110 483 mm for lentil in india under both rainfed and irrigated conditions after harvesting of long duration puddled transplanted rice under contrasting tillage practices in the present study maximum eta has been observed under ptr zt ip treatment combinations as the stubble height and crop vegetative mulching was effective in reducing the loss of evaporation from the soil surface by forming a barrier between the soil surface and the atmosphere during the crop growth period bandyopadhyay et al 2016 showed that crop canopy and stubble contributed equally to the reduction of evaporation in lentil under limited water conditions on the other hand li et al 2014 opined that higher water loss occurred from dsr soils as compared to the soils of ptr 4 5 lentil seed yield and water productivity dsr systems comparatively more vulnerable to water loss and nutrient deficiencies are prominent resulting in lesser yield than ptr higher moisture status under zt increased root proliferation and thus enhanced the availability of nutrients to crop roots thereby reflecting higher plant water status chlorophyll content and grain yield which is in agreement with previous findings bandyopadhyay et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 residue retention may also enhance rainwater conservation by carrying over extra soil water during the growth and development of winter crops shaxon and barber 2003 decreasing rlwc and ground green cover due to water stress led to significant reductions in seed yield under ct in the present study nutrient management ip produced 27 more yield than fp and these findings were consistent with das and jana 2015 application of b and zn influence floral biology relating to flower drop pod setting yamagishi and yamamoto 1994 srivastava et al 2000 and pollen viability pandey et al 2009 singh and bhatt 2013 and also physiological changes alleviating water stress thus improved seed yield kundu et al 2017 found that npk 2 of urea foliar treatment attained a maximum yield of 1603 8 kg ha 1 seed yield of 1530 kg ha 1 in zt compared with 1220 kg ha 1 under ct was observed in indo gangetic plain majumder 2011 kumar et al 2018 observed 1515 kg ha 1 seed yield in dsr zt in north india the relationship between actual evapotranspiration and lentil seed yield fig 7 showed that a yield gain of 14 3 kg was obtained for every 1 mm increase in eta several researchers supported this yield eta relationship elsewhere huang et al 2004 sarkar et al 2010 the variability of water productivity wp indicates deviation due to seed yield per unit water used and the wp decreased as the amount of available residual water increased or seed yield decreased table 7 in the present study higher water use as well as higher yield in ptr led to greater wp 1 6 kg m 3 than dsr 1 5 kg m 3 the standing rice residue stubbles in zt might have helped to reduce evaporation loss conserve more soil water by reducing loss from rainfall and thus contributed to higher wp 1 6 kg m 3 than ct 1 5 kg m 3 the rapid growth of plant canopy due to fertilizer application ip provided shade to reduce evaporation of water from the soil surface and had higher wp 1 7 kg m 3 as compared to fp 1 5 kg m 3 the positive impact of nutrient management on wp has been demonstrated elsewhere iaea international atomic energy agency 2005 singh et al 2015 higher wp from second crops in rice fallows was found with reduced tillage than that under ct kar and kumar 2009 bandyopadhyay et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 however silim et al 1993 found wp of lentil ranged from 0 3 to 0 86 kg m 3 in northern syria cutforth and mcconkey 1997 and cayci et al 2009 obtained wp values of 0 62 and 0 69 kg m 3 in semi arid regions of canada and turkey in the water scarce countries of the wana region oweis et al 2004 found wp values of 0 45 and 0 59 kg m 3 under rainfed and supplemental irrigated conditions in the present study treatment combinations of ptr zt ip produced significantly higher wp 1 62 kg m 3 than reported elsewhere this could be due to lower eta under rainfed conditions line sowing of lentil and the use of post rice residual soil water 4 6 yield response factor the values of yield response factor ky decreased with the decrease in soil wetness that indicates the crop s tolerance to soil water stress lovelly et al 2007 according to kirda 2002 and steduto et al 2012 a ky smaller than 1 indicates the tolerance of water stress to a greater extent and could be exposed to water deficit in the present study lentil with ptr zt and ip with a value lower than 1 of ky shows tolerance to water stress with higher productions and maintained stability in water productivity table 8 the reverse is true in the case of dsr ct and fp with a greater than 1 ky hence the shortage of water and environmental stresses caused a profound impact on yield according to doorenbos and kassam 1979 ky values lower than 0 85 indicate a kind of low sensitivity to water deficit between 0 85 and 1 0 low to medium sensitivity between 1 0 and 1 15 medium to high sensitivity and above 1 15 high sensitivity considering this criterion the present study demonstrated that lentil in this sub tropical climate under rainfed condition is a crop with low to medium sensitivity to water deficiency with the ky of 1 06 fig 8 the seasonal yield water stress factor ksy increased with increasing soil wetness table 8 similar to ks values for ptr zt and ip treatments fig 5a and b however is responsible for predicting seasonal actual evapotranspiration or approximate estimation of historical water use allen et al 1998 kirda 2002 the linear relationship fig 9 depicted that 63 variation in seed yield could be attributed due to changes in the magnitude of seasonal yield water stress the treatment combination of ptr zt ip exhibited the lowest yield response factor ky 0 87 the highest seasonal yield water stress factor ksy 0 85 with higher yield and eta as compared to other treatment combinations indicated the suitability of lentil with post rice residual water 5 conclusion our study suggests that puddled transplanted rice ptr along with zero tillage zt and nutrient management ip improved leaf water content rlwc and chlorophyll concentration lcc reduced soil water depletion and caused a minimum water stress coefficient ks that could help to escape terminal drought therefore provided the highest seed yield 1281 kg ha 1 water productivity 1 62 kg m 3 and exhibited the lowest yield response factor ky 0 87 zt in lentil under ptr increased soil water retention periods and regulated nutrients availability higher root zone soil water storage with ptr zt and ip generated a concomitant increase in the actual evapotranspiration eta lentil grown under post rice residual water showed low to medium sensitivity to water deficit and is well suited to deficit water regimes with ky value 1 06 hence to promote lentil cultivation in the lgp with early to medium duration rice a ptr zt ip system needs to be adopted for enhancing the cropping

10224,grapevines in karst between italy and slovenia are grown on a shallow terrarossa red karst loam laying on carbonate rocks in karst water stress conditions occur during the summer season both because of the rain scarcity and the poor available water content of the soils moreover irrigation can be used to only partially supply grapevine requirements where possible an irrigation trial was carried out in a vineyard of refošk during the seasons 2018 2019 to understand the effects of two deficit irrigation regimes 20 and 50 etc on yield parameters and basic maturation but mainly on polyphenol content composition and extractability during the summer season ψstem was regularly checked in order to follow the plant water status and at harvest time berry samples were collected to determine the total concentration of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins and their extractability in a wine like solution moreover the structural characteristics of seed and skin proanthocyanidins were analyzed in both seasons differences in plant water status were ascertained but values of ψstem never highlighted situations of severe water stress for both deficit irrigation regimes 20 etc resulted in a significant increase in the concentration of both total and extractable anthocyanins on the other hand proanthocyanidin concentration was not significantly affected by the irrigation regime as regards the structure of proanthocyanidins 20 etc accounted for a higher degree of galloylation in both total and extractable seed and skin proanthocyanidins a more limited irrigation regime resulted in both higher anthocyanin concentration and degree of galloylation of seed and skin proanthocyanidins attributes that might account for a better wine quality potential keywords vitis vinifera water deficit anthocyanins proanthocyanidins galloylation 1 introduction climate change is challenging crop productivity in many regions of the world and most of the important areas of grapevine cultivation will be endangered specifically it is attended by an increase in temperature and a discontinuous availability of water with prolonged periods of drought ippc 2014 vitis vinifera l has a great capacity for adaption and can also resist to severe drought stresses but with significant losses in plant yield and in extreme cases consequences for plant survival palliotti et al 2014 moreover different behaviors of grapevines under drought have been observed hochberg et al 2018 schultz 2003 tombesi et al 2015 it is well known that several mechanisms are adopted by grapevines facing different conditions of water shortage from a limitation of vegetation growth to stomatal closure and finally leaf shedding degu et al 2019 falchi et al 2020 gerzon et al 2015 lovisolo and schubert 1998 and moderate water stress conditions were shown to promote the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites without challenging plant survival castellarin et al 2007 peterlunger et al 2005 in red grape varieties anthocyanins flavan 3 ols and proanthocyanidins represent the main flavonoids that accumulate in berries from berry set to harvest among them anthocyanins start to be synthesized from veraison with a rapid increase in concentration until full maturation followed by a drop in the last period before harvest different experiments were carried out during the last decades highlighting the effect of water stress on the concentration the profile shift and the transcriptional reprogramming of anthocyanin biosynthesis castellarin et al 2007 savoi et al 2017 on the other hand there is still more mystery surrounding the biosynthesis of proanthocyanidins pas as the enzymes involved in the polymerization of flavan 3 ols and the relative transcripts are not fully known moreover the modifications in pa composition during maturation involve several reactions including covalent and hydrogen bonds with tonoplast and cell wall and in case of seeds also oxidation bindon and kennedy 2011 hanlin et al 2010 pas can bind with vacuole membranes and cell walls thus becoming less extractable bindon and kennedy 2011 the extractability of pas changes during maturation because of the modifications of cell walls thus the timing of harvest could also significantly affect the pas composition bindon et al 2014 the mean degree of polymerization mdp of pas is much higher in skins than in seeds with a lower degree of galloylation g in skins moreover in the skin pas a certain percentage of prodelphinidines p can be measured which are not found in seeds prieur et al 1994 bucchetti et al 2011 casassa et al 2015 herrera et al 2015 and zarrouk et al 2012 showed that a moderate to severe water stress could increase the concentration of pas in skins while previously peterlunger et al 2005 demonstrated that in moderate conditions the extractable fraction of pas was increased without any modification in the total concentration in seeds and skins moreover kyraleou et al 2017 reported that the skin total tannin concentration and content per berry increased under water deficit whereas seed total tannins were higher in the fully irrigated vines the experimental vineyard is located in the karst plateau extending between italy and slovenia and the soil is dominated by carbonate rocks mainly cretaceous limestone covered by a few centimeters of red karst loam terrarossa red soil limestone product mrak and repe 2004 in karst water stress conditions occur during the summer season because of both rain scarcity and the poor available water content of the shallow soils therefore irrigation can be used to only partially supply grapevines requirements to understand the proper water management in the karst area the study focused on the role of water deficit in the production of quality refošk grapes in two consecutive vintages two deficit irrigation treatments were compared and vine water status during grape ripening was evaluated throughout the season at the time of harvest yield basic grape parameters and the content of both total and extractable anthocyanins and pas from skins and seeds were analyzed the impact of both water regimes on the structural characteristics mdp g and p of seed and skin pas was evaluated as well 2 materials and methods 2 1 location plant material and experimental design the experiment was carried out during the growing seasons 2018 and 2019 in a commercial vineyard of v vinifera l cv refošk located in sagrado northeastern italy 45 52 18 n 13 30 09 e 150 m a s l in the friuli venezia giulia region within the carso d o c district the vineyard was planted in 2007 with refošk clone isv f2 grafted on 110 richter rootstock with an east west row orientation and a plant spacing of 2 6 m and 0 90 m between rows and vines respectively 4273 plants ha the vines are pruned on a single guyot 7 8 buds vine trained to vertical shoot positioning allowing for a vertical canopy development of 1 3 m during the growing seasons shoot trimming and chemical sprayings were performed as in the other vineyards the vineyard soil is a luvi endoleptic phaeozems characterized by a loam silt claily texture with frequent coarse and a limited rooting depth 0 5 1 0 m six rows were considered to set the experiment two treatments were compared each one set on 3 vineyard rows 50 etc supplying 50 of crop evapotranspiration etc and 20 etc supplying 20 etc etc was computed using penman monteith and applying a kc as proposed by lopez urrea et al 2012 the meteorological data were collected from the weather station of gradisca d isonzo arpa fvg osmer http www meteo fvg it 2 km from the vineyard the water was supplied by the farm drip irrigation system 1 2 times per week based on requirements except when rain exceeded the target restitutions 2 2 physiological parameters plant water status was monitored during the season every ca 15 days using the stem water potential method ψstem four fully expanded mature leaves were selected between 12 00 and 14 00 solar time from different vines on each plot bagged and covered with aluminum foil 1 h before the measurement 12 leaves per treatment after that time leaves were excised with a razor blade and immediately wrapped in cling film then put in plastic bags with a piece of wet paper inside thereafter the leaves were placed in a scholander pressure bomb soil moisture corp santa barbara usa with the petiole protruding from the chamber pressurized using a nitrogen tank ψstem was recorded in a few seconds when the initial xylem sap was observed emerging from the cut end of the petiole 2 3 berry sampling and basic analysis of grape juice in two consecutive vintages at the time of harvest 17 september 2018 and 2019 yield and cluster number per vine were recorded and the average cluster weight was estimated eighty berry samples were collected in each plot with pedicels and stored in a cold bag until reaching the laboratory subsamples of 40 berries for each plot were sorted weighed and manually pressed at room temperature total soluble solids brix and ph were measured using a manual refractometer atc 1 atago tokyo japan and a ph meter hi2211 hanna instruments woonsocket ri respectively titratable acidity as g l tartaric acid equivalents was determined by titration of the juice with 0 1 m naoh until ph 7 the second set of 40 berries was weighed and immediately stored at 80 c for determination of seed color and preparation of wine like extracts a sample of 10 clusters was collected from each plot clusters were randomly sampled on labeled vines at different positions on the fruiting cane and kept at 4 c until the extraction which was performed on fresh samples within 24 h 2 4 determination of seed color one hundred berries were randomly sampled from clusters seeds were manually separated dried in towel paper and immediately put into 5 solution of k2s2o5 to stop enzymatic browning of juice remaining on the seeds after 10 min 20 seeds were randomly selected dried in paper towel and visualized for color characteristics the colors of both dorsal and ventral surfaces were determined and compared with the color wheel for the seed coat fredes et al 2010 the seed color was calculated as the average of 10 dorsal and 10 ventral surface evaluations 2 5 seed and skin extraction in organic solvents total polyphenols for elucidation of the content and structural characteristics of the whole class of pas extracted from ground skins and seeds by means of strong solvents a slightly modified extraction method as described by chira et al 2009 was used skins and seeds of frozen berries were separated using a scalpel and immediately dropped into liquid nitrogen weighed to evaluate the proportion of skins and seeds to berry weight and milled under liquid nitrogen to a fine powder using the mortar the powder was immediately without thawing stored at 80 c frozen seed and skin powder was lyophilized for five days the difference between the fresh and dry weight determined the of water in the samples in total 1 g of lyophilized skin or seed powder was extracted by mechanical shaking at room temperature in 1 9 w v acetone water 80 20 v v for 4 h and centrifuged at 3500 g for 15 min sediment was then extracted in the same volume of methanol water 60 40 v v for 3 h and centrifuged again supernatants were pooled and evaporated under reduced pressure at 38 c on a buchi rotavapor to remove organic solvents residue was re dissolved in ca 10 ml of water and freeze dried to obtain a crude extract 2 6 seed and skin extraction in wine like solution extractable polyphenols extraction in wine like solution was used for elucidation of the content and structural characteristics of extractable pas which pass into wine for that purpose selective extraction of phenols from the skins and seeds of grape berries simulating the red wine maceration process was used mattivi et al 2002 in total 200 g of berries were randomly sampled counted and weighed skins and seeds were manually separated and directly placed into 200 ml of wine like solution consisting of ethanol water 12 88 v v 100 mg l so2 and 5 g l tartaric acid with a ph value adjusted to 3 2 with naoh the weight of skins and seeds was determined by weighting of erlenmeyer with 200 ml of hydroalcoholic solution before and after skins or seeds were added to minimize phenol oxidation the solutions were flushed with nitrogen and extraction was carried out in the dark for 5 days at 30 c by shaking samples manually once per day after 5 days the seeds and skins were removed from the hydroalcoholic solution skin extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 3500 g filtered through a plastic strainer and manually pressed and the final volume was adjusted both seed and skin extracts were transferred into dark glass bottles flushed with nitrogen and stored at 4 c until spectrophotometric and uhplc dad ms ms analyses were carried out 2 7 spectrophotometric analyses analyses were performed with an agilent 8453 spectrophotometer agilent technologies inc palo alto usa wine like seed and skin extracts were analyzed as in details described by rigo et al 2000 for total tannin extracts the method of rigo et al 2000 was used without the solid phase extraction step as described by sivilotti et al 2020 2 7 1 anthocyanins total anthocyanins ta were determined based on the maximal absorbance in the visible range 536 542 nm by assuming an average absorbance of the mixture of anthocyanins extracted from cabernet sauvignon grapes average mw 500 da ε 18800 m 1 cm 1 in 70 30 1 ethanol water hcl solution the results were expressed against the corresponding blank in mg g berry or skins fresh weight fw and in mg g of skins dry weight dw 2 7 2 low molecular weight proanthocyanidins lmwp index of vanillin the vanillin index methods provide an estimation of free c6 and c8 for catechins and for proanthocyanidins this index decreases with an increase in polymerization because c6 and c8 are mainly involved in polymerization bonds the method therefore provides a good estimation of monomers and a low degree of polymerized flavanols corresponding to two to four units lmwps were evaluated as catechin in mg g of fw and dw 2 7 3 high molecular weight proanthocyanidins hmwp hmwps were evaluated by transformation into cyanidin and expressed in mg g of cyanidin chloride of fw and dw the method is a highly specific assay which provides a good evaluation of the total amount of pas and is linked mainly to variations in the hmwp corresponding to at least 5 units vrhovsek et al 2001 2 8 uhplc dad ms ms analysis of proanthocyanidin structural characteristics in wine like and organic solvent extracts the structural characteristics of pas comprising mdp g and p were determined after acid catalyzed degradation with phloroglucinol as nucleophilic reagent drinkine et al 2007 kennedy and jones 2001 cleaning of wine like extracts was carried out as described in lisjak et al 2020 briefly 2 5 ml of wine like extracts was evaporated under reduced pressure to remove the ethanol fraction the evaporated sample was quantitatively transferred into a 10 ml volumetric flask and the volume was adjusted with milli q the sample was loaded onto an lc18 cartridge supelco st quentin fallavier france previously conditioned with methanol and milli q the column was washed with milli q and dried with nitrogen and the sample was eluted with methanol methanol was evaporated under reduced pressure at 40 c until dryness and the sample was dissolved in 1 ml of methanol total freeze dried seed or skin extracts were diluted in methanol 5 mg ml and further proceed without solid phase extraction a 200 μl aliquot of methanol fraction of wine like extracts or total tannin extracts was mixed with 200 μl of phloroglucinol reagent 0 05 m of hcl in methanol 50 g l of phloroglucinol sigma aldrich steinheim germany and 10 g l of ascorbic acid merck darmstadt germany the mixture was held at 50 c for 20 min for fractionation after 20 min 1 ml of 40 mm aqueous sodium acetate was added to stop the reaction samples were filtered through a 0 22 µm pvdf filter from millipore billerica ma usa and analyzed by uhplc dad ms ms agilent technologies santa clara usa as described lisjak et al 2020 sivilotti et al 2020 mdp p and g were estimated using the response factors of pa cleavage products at 280 nm and calculated as described by kennedy and jones 2001 the mdp value represented the molar ratio between the sum of all flavan 3 ol units produced by phloroglucinolysis and the sum of terminal units 2 9 statistical analysis ψstem differences within each date were analysed using a t test p indicated instead yield and grape composition data were analyzed using two way anova p indicated with treatments and year as fixed factors since in tabel there are reported just comparisons between two averages separation test is not needed principal component analysis pca was performed combining berry characteristics berry skin and seeds weight basic maturation data tss titratable acidity and ph and polyphenolic parameters anthocyanins seeds and skins proanthocyanidins concentration and structure extracted in organic solvents or in wine like solution prior to analysis data were normalized by seasons with the aim to show only the influence of water regime significance of loadings was ascertained to reduce the number of variables used in pca the pca analysis was performed with r software r core team 2013 using the ggbigplot package http github com vqv ggbigplot 3 results 3 1 weather conditions and plant water status the meteorological conditions of the two examined seasons had several differences in terms of both temperatures and rain distribution the winkler index from 1 april till harvest was 1771 and 1561 c in 2018 and 2019 respectively and the most important difference between seasons was revealed for the period veraison harvest 808 and 617 c in 2018 and 2019 respectively this difference is mostly related to the number of days between veraison and harvest 12 days shorter in 2019 table 1 the number of days with temperatures exceeding 30 c was higher in 2019 due mainly to the heat waves that characterized june and july to date 25 days registered max temperatures higher than 30 c in the period flowering veraison 2019 while only 2 were registered in the previous season moreover the distribution of rain was much different between seasons in 2018 from budburst to harvest rain events were constantly distributed with a period of water shortage from the end of july to the first half of august on the other hand in 2019 high rains occurred in may followed by stress periods in june at the end of july and in the second half of august the rain events that characterized september 2019 obliged the harvest of grapes despite the fact that full maturation was not reached this fact accounts for the lower winkler index between veraison and harvest 2019 in general the seasons investigated were characterized by not very challenging periods of water stress as revealed by the measured values of ψstem fig 1 in 2018 due to the rains that occurred in june and july the values of a such parameter revealed a condition of weak to moderate water stress in both irrigation levels while in the following period the lack of rain resulted in a drop of ψstem at values below 1 2 mpa in the case of 20 etc though later the rains recovered the plant water status the trend of ψstem was different in 2019 because the rain was lacking from june the values of ψstem were already lower than the first measurements even if the lowest values were measured in 2018 the period of water stress was much longer and effective for showing differences between irrigation regimes 3 2 yield and basic maturation parameters the irrigation water regime significantly affected the yield per vine with an 18 1 reduction in the case of 20 etc table 2 while average cluster weight and the number of clusters were only slightly modified among yield components the skin seed and flesh weight were lower in the case of 20 etc summing to a significant reduction also of berry weight 17 8 when the data were computed on a percentage basis the relative contribution of skin flesh and seeds was similar between irrigation levels because of the different meteorological courses of the two seasons there was also a significant impact on yield components plant production was lower in 2019 40 5 as compared to 2018 mostly because of a reduced cluster weight 36 8 regarding berry tissues skin and flesh weight were lower and seed weight was higher in 2019 and the relative proportion of berry tissues were found to have the same differences except for skin percentage which was found not significantly impacted the interaction observed in the case of berry seed and flesh weight revealed that the differences between irrigation regimes were significantly wider in 2019 at the time of harvest the basic maturation parameters had been modified by the irrigation treatments in detail 20 etc accounted for a 5 6 reduction in the accumulation of soluble solids brix as compared to 50 etc ph values were also lower in the case of 20 etc while titratable acidity was only slightly modified the season factor also impacted the basic maturation parameters of the grapes the concentration of soluble solids was significantly lower in 2018 6 8 as compared to 2019 and ph and titratable acidity were both significantly affected by season the color of seeds was significantly browner in 20 etc than in 50 etc which could be related to better seed maturity in the case of the lower water regime more in detail the differences between irrigation regimes were negligible in 2018 while in 2019 although the values were much lower the seeds were significantly browner in the case of more limited irrigation treatment there were also significant differences between 2018 and 2019 revealing browner seeds in 2018 where maturation advanced at the time of harvest this is in accordance with kennedy et al 2000 who reported that visually the seeds changed color during fruit ripening from an initial green to a light buff and finally to a dark brown at harvest 3 3 total anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins skins and seeds were separated from frozen berries lyophilized cryo milled and extracted by aqueous organic methanol and acetone such a process is used to extract the whole class of phenols the exception might be highly polymerized tannins that are not easily extracted even with acetone downey et al 2003 or some of those that interact with vacuole membrane and cell wall structures the irrigation regime significantly modified the concentration of anthocyanins in grape berries with higher values in case of 20 etc table 3 the observed increase was simply the result of the enhanced biosynthesis as the skin to berry ratio was not modified between 50 etc and 20 etc as regards the concentration of skin pas both hmwp and lmwp not significant modifications were reported due to the irrigation regime 20 etc reported slightly lower and higher concentrations of hmwp and lmwp respectively and the same difference was observed in the concentration of pas in skins mg g skin dw on the other hand among the structural characteristics of skin pas the g was significantly higher in the case of 20 etc also the mdp significantly increased by 20 etc only in 2018 while in the following season the difference in g between irrigation regimes was negligible see interaction effect table 3 the p was affected by neither the irrigation regime nor the season in terms of seed pas no differences were found between 50 etc and 20 etc for both pa concentrations and structural characteristics however there was a trend in higher mdp and g in the lower water regime which became significant in the case of extractable pas table 4 galloylation of total seed tannins was over 3 times higher than that of skin and significantly higher in the case of 20 etc regarding the vintage the concentration of anthocyanins was significantly lower in 2019 it can be postulated that the combination between the slightly lower skin to berry ratio and the reduction of anthocyanin biosynthesis in 2019 could explain such a difference the concentration of skin pas was also not different between seasons in 2019 the concentration of hmwp and lmwp in mg g berry fw was reduced by 11 and 15 respectively the mdp and g were significantly lower in 2019 as regards seasonal effect hmwp seed content mg g seeds dw was not significantly different between seasons however hmwp seed concentration in mg g berry fw was significant higher in 2019 49 3 than in 2018 this might be related to the higher seed to berry ratio 31 8 and also to the difference in seed water content 29 9 vs 37 3 in 2018 and 2019 respectively data not shown as opposite as for skins the seed lmwp content mg g seed dw was significantly higher in 2019 table 3 the combination of this result with the higher seed to berry ratio explains the significant difference in lmwp concentration in seeds while there were no differences in mdp between seasons the g was significantly lower in 2019 3 4 extractable anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins anthocyanins and pas that pass into the wine were determined by the separated extraction of seeds and skins in wine like solution for 5 days at 30 c table 4 the concentration of extractable anthocyanins was significantly higher in the case of 20 etc 26 8 as compared to 50 etc irrigation regime did not significantly affect the concentration of extractable hmwp in skins even if lower values were ascertained in the case of 20 etc differently the concentration of extractable lmwp was significantly lower in the case of 20 etc as regards the structural characteristics of skin pas significantly higher g was observed in 20 etc while the mdp and the p were unaffected by the irrigation regime as regards seeds there were no significant differences in extractable hmwp and lmwp content between 50 etc and 20 etc on the other hand both the mdp and g significantly increased in the case of the lower irrigation regime table 4 the mdp of extractable pas was ca 7 and 4 5 for skins and seeds respectively whereas the mdp of total pas was ca 19 and 8 5 for skins and seeds respectively the g of seed tannins in wine like extracts was 37 6 versus 45 2 while for skin tannins it was 7 8 and 11 2 in 50 etc and 20 etc respectively thus galloylation of extractable seed tannins was over 4 times higher than in skins the p in extractable skin pas was unaffected by irrigation level table 4 which is consistent with total extraction table 3 a comparison of the seasons reveals that the concentration of extractable anthocyanins was much higher in 2019 than in 2018 even if the percentage of skins was lower and the biosynthesis did not significantly increase in 2019 compare skin anthocyanin content in mg g skin dw between vintages also the concentration of extractable pas was impacted more by the season than by the irrigation level thus both skin and seed hmwp and lmwp were significantly higher in 2019 as regards the structural characteristics of pas the g of extractable pas significantly increased in both skins and seeds in 2019 as compared to 2018 looking at the significance of the interaction between water regime and vintage the tannin structural characteristics were shown to respond differently to irrigation regimes in 2018 and 2019 data not shown in 2019 both mdp and g were significantly higher in the case of 20 etc as compared to 50 etc meanwhile irrigation regimes did not significantly affect structural characteristics of both skin and seed pas to understand the relative importance of the dataset examined data of polyphenol parameters berry characteristics and basic maturation were processed through pca analysis fig 2 the first two factors analyzed accounted for a 83 1 of explained variance as regard the first factor significant loadings were ascertained for ph berry and seed weight skin anthocyanins skin and seeds g and seeds mdp higher values of the just mentioned skin and seeds polyphenolic parameters were ascertained for 20 etc while as opposite berry characteristics and basic maturation parameters were more correlated with 50 etc the results presented here provide evidence that proanthocyanidins structure of seeds and skins together with anthocyanin concentration are the most important polyphenolic modifications occurring when deficit irrigation is reduced from 50 to 20 etc 4 discussion 4 1 plant water status and yield parameters stem water potential ψstem is a reliable measure of plant water status deloire et al 2004 explained that for such a parameter values lower than 1 4 mpa are critical in the case of v vinifera as they could cause physiological damages and atypical maturation of the grapes in the experiment carried out on refošk ψstem was always above this critical value thus excessive water stress conditions were avoided moreover due to the meteorological conditions there was a different trend of plant water status during the two seasons while in 2018 the lowest ψstem ca 1 2 mpa was registered the year 2019 on average settled on lower values also the difference between 20 etc and 50 etc was wider fig 1 4 2 yield and basic maturation parameters plant production fell by 18 when the vines were irrigated with 20 etc this result was basically due to the smaller berry size the same results have also been ascertained by several trials carried out on different grapevine varieties around the world castellarin et al 2007 intrigliolo et al 2012 mccarthy 1997 yu et al 2016 a comparison of the season effect revealed that the yield was 40 lower in 2019 mainly in the 20 etc treatment data not shown and the berry weight contraction is far to explain the difference between seasons we could speculate that the berry set was worse in 2019 due to the adverse weather conditions during the flowering time low temperature and excessive rain resulting in a reduced number of berries at the time of harvest in terms of skin weight a significant reduction was ascertained in the case of 20 etc as shown by ojeda et al 2002 it is normal that skin fresh weight is linearly related to berry weight and only in the case of severe water stress thicker skins are produced bucchetti et al 2011 herrera et al 2015 roby and matthews 2004 looking at the basic maturation parameters a lower accumulation of tss was ascertained in the case of 20 etc in other trials higher soluble solids were found in the case of water stress treatments in comparison to well water conditions bucchetti et al 2011 savoi et al 2017 zarrouk et al 2012 in the present trial two water deficit conditions were compared and we could speculate that the 20 etc irrigation regime accounted for a reduction in the assimilation rate due to partial stomatal closure because of the limited soil depth a similar reduction in tss was reported by sivilotti et al 2005 when moderate and severe water stress were compared 4 3 skin anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins anthocyanin concentration significantly increased in the more limiting irrigation regime 20 etc as also reported by other researchers casassa et al 2015 castellarin et al 2007 sivilotti et al 2005 theodorou et al 2019 the concentration of anthocyanins after extraction in organic solvents was also much lower in 2019 in this year the overall solar radiation of the veraison harvest interval was much lower as was the thermal range 12 8 and 11 9 c in 2018 and 2019 respectively several authors showed that higher values of both parameters positively affect the biosynthesis of anthocyanins cohen et al 2008 gaiotti et al 2018 kliewer and torres 1972 the concentration of total pas in refošk skins mg g berry fw was not significantly affected by irrigation regime while when looking at the extractable fraction in wine like solution a significant reduction in lmwp and a parallel increase in mdp were found in the case of lower irrigation conflicting results were reported regarding the effects of water stress on the concentration of skin pas at harvest kyraleou et al 2017 and allegro et al 2016 showed that water stress negatively affects the concentration of skin pas while an opposite effect was reported by bucchetti et al 2011 casassa et al 2015 herrera et al 2015 and peterlunger et al 2005 one could argue that differences between grapevine varieties and environmental and water stress conditions could significantly modify the biosynthesis and or degradation of pas thus explaining the above mentioned results peterlunger et al 2005 evaluated the extractable concentration of high and low molecular weight pas in merlot skins showing a slightly higher concentration in the case of the water stress treatment regarding skin pas structural characteristics on average higher mdp and g were found in the case of 20 etc changes in the mdp of skin pas during berry development are inconsistent in the literature with increases or decreases reported with the progression of ripening or in response to environmental constraints downey et al 2003 kennedy et al 2002 as reported by kyraleou et al 2017 the mdp of skin polymeric pas increases during maturation while no differences were ascertained as regards oligomers the same authors reported a significantly higher mdp of the polymeric skin pa fraction in the case of a non irrigated treatment and similar outcomes were also shown by ollé et al 2011 on shiraz and by kennedy et al 2001 on cabernet sauvignon in the 2019 season the mdp of refošk skins was lower than it was in 2018 probably due to the incomplete maturation of the grapes in that season on the other hand a significantly higher g in both total and extractable skin pas was found in 20 etc grapes as compared to 50 etc kyraleou et al 2017 reported significantly lower g in shiraz skin subjected to water stress whereas no differences were reported by càceres mella et al 2017 in cabernet sauvignon the stabilization of flavan 3 ols during maturation involves the addition of galloyl groups the polymerization and the interaction with cell walls and tonoplast through both covalent and hydrogen bonds bontpart et al 2015 reported that galloylation reactions occur before polymerization it could be speculated that in response to stress vines might synthetize more galloylated flavan 3 ols and pas the biological activities of galloylated flavan 3 ols and pas were reported to be higher than their non galloylated parent molecules karas et al 2017 an examination of the g in 2019 revealed a wide difference between irrigation regimes probably related to the earlier and longer period of water deficit experienced by the vines data not shown the differences in skin pas structure between seasons could be related to both the meteorological conditions during the growing season and the different degree of maturation of the grapes at harvest we already pointed out that in 2019 maturation was not completed which could partially account for the higher mdp in fact gagné et al 2006 and bindon et al 2010 explained that the mdp of tannins associated with the cell wall tended to increase at the end of maturation intermediate molecular mass rather than highly polymerized pas has a higher affinity for skin cell walls bindon and kennedy 2011 but during ripening modifications in skin cell wall composition facilitate enhanced adsorption also of highly polymerized pas bindon et al 2012 in the last stages of ripening cell wall porosity increased supporting the hypothesis that a greater sequestration of highly polymerized pas could occur bindon et al 2012 4 4 seed proanthocyanidins the biosynthesis of seed pas begins at berry set and stops at around veraison more precisely cadot et al 2006 downey et al 2003 and genebra et al 2014 reported the highest concentration of pas in shiraz seeds one week after veraison declining thereafter until maturity the experiments dealing with water stress and seed pas reported contrasting effects on contents and structural characteristics kennedy et al 2000 showed no significant effects of water deficits on proanthocyanidins or their polymerization however water deficit decreased the amounts of flavan 3 ol monomers and greatly increased their rate of loss during fruit ripening yu et al 2016 highlighted that seed pa concentration was rarely affected by irrigation treatments as also has been found in our study an interesting conclusion was underlined by chacon et al 2009 who ascertained an increase in seed pa concentration as related to the magnitude of water deficit looking at results obtained in this study small differences between both irrigation regimes might impact the lack of significant differences in seed pa concentration more significant differences were ascertained between seasons maturation was delayed and uncompleted in 2019 mostly in the case of seeds as confirmed by the lower values of seed color table 2 in 2019 total and extractable low and high molecular weight pa content was significantly higher than in 2018 whereas the seed color was less brown this is consistent with kennedy et al 2000 who concluded that both darker seed color and decline in seed flavan 3 ols and pas are consistent with an oxidative process the products of oxidation would likely be polyphenols cross linked to other polyphenols carbohydrates or proteins and it would be expected that the phenolic functional groups would become modified moreover in unripe seeds lignification is low and a solvent can access easily the inner integument explaining why a larger quantity of tannins is extracted peyrot des gachons and kennedy 2003 higher values of seed pas in 2019 can also be attributed to the higher seed weight table 1 significantly higher mdp and g were found in seed extractable pas in the case of a lower water regime the trend was the same in total pas though not significant in agreement with our results kyraleou et al 2017 reported higher mdp and g values in seeds from the water deficit treatment both galloylation and mdp correlate positively with astringency chira et al 2011 lisjak et al 2020 vidal et al 2003 cheynier et al 2006 concluded that hard tannin perception in wines is associated with high tannin concentrations especially of large polymers and galloylated tannins from seeds that aggregate easily but it is uncertain whether soft tannin perception is due to low concentrations of such tannins to the presence of anthocyanin tannin adducts or to the incorporation of tannins into protein or polysaccharide complexes the question of whether the effect of higher mdp and galloylation on the sensorial properties of wines is positive or negative remains unclear due to astringency sensation complexity the seed mdp was nearly half in the extractable fraction as compared to total extraction while comparable values were ascertained for g apparently there are conflicting results between acetone methanol and wine like extractions as reported by mattivi et al 2009 among pas only the less polymerized were extracted in wine like solution the mdp and the g in the wine like extracts were significantly higher in the case of 20 etc while no differences were found regarding total extraction as shown by cadot et al 2006 phenolic compounds in seeds were observed in three seed tissues the epidermis a wide part of the outer integument and the inner layer of the inner integument from an extractability perspective this observation could explain partial extraction in wine like solution the solidification of the cells rich in tannins before harvest could affect the aptitude for the extraction of these compounds cadot et al 2006 geny et al 2003 hanlin et al 2010 pointing out that as pas increase in polymerization they can react with cell walls reducing their extractability 5 conclusions in this study two irrigation regimes 50 and 20 etc were investigated in two vintages in terms of yield and quality of refošk grapes both irrigation regimes resulted in a moderate water stress but this was more intense in less irrigated plants 20 etc grapes of less irrigated vines have significantly lower brix higher ph and surprisingly darker seed color there were no significant differences in total proanthocyanidin concentration in skins and seeds between 20 and 50 etc water supply on the other hand significantly higher total and extractable anthocyanins were found in the case of less irrigated plants as regards proanthocyanidin structural characteristics there was a significant shift in terms of galloylation of both extractable and total skin and seed tannins with higher values in the case of lower water availability 20 etc furthermore the mdp of extractable seed tannins was higher in case of 20 etc in summary proanthocyanidin structure together with anthocyanin concentration were the most important composition modifications occurring when deficit irrigation was reduced from 50 to 20 etc considering the results obtained in this study 20 etc water supply would be more recommended for the refošk variety in karst area because less water was used while severe stress conditions were avoided obtaining an overall better grape quality in terms of color and phenols at the same time this saves water in a region with scarce water availability nonetheless a cost benefit analysis should be considered to calculate the increase in price needed to counterbalance the reduction of the yield obtained in the case of 20 etc

10224,grapevines in karst between italy and slovenia are grown on a shallow terrarossa red karst loam laying on carbonate rocks in karst water stress conditions occur during the summer season both because of the rain scarcity and the poor available water content of the soils moreover irrigation can be used to only partially supply grapevine requirements where possible an irrigation trial was carried out in a vineyard of refošk during the seasons 2018 2019 to understand the effects of two deficit irrigation regimes 20 and 50 etc on yield parameters and basic maturation but mainly on polyphenol content composition and extractability during the summer season ψstem was regularly checked in order to follow the plant water status and at harvest time berry samples were collected to determine the total concentration of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins and their extractability in a wine like solution moreover the structural characteristics of seed and skin proanthocyanidins were analyzed in both seasons differences in plant water status were ascertained but values of ψstem never highlighted situations of severe water stress for both deficit irrigation regimes 20 etc resulted in a significant increase in the concentration of both total and extractable anthocyanins on the other hand proanthocyanidin concentration was not significantly affected by the irrigation regime as regards the structure of proanthocyanidins 20 etc accounted for a higher degree of galloylation in both total and extractable seed and skin proanthocyanidins a more limited irrigation regime resulted in both higher anthocyanin concentration and degree of galloylation of seed and skin proanthocyanidins attributes that might account for a better wine quality potential keywords vitis vinifera water deficit anthocyanins proanthocyanidins galloylation 1 introduction climate change is challenging crop productivity in many regions of the world and most of the important areas of grapevine cultivation will be endangered specifically it is attended by an increase in temperature and a discontinuous availability of water with prolonged periods of drought ippc 2014 vitis vinifera l has a great capacity for adaption and can also resist to severe drought stresses but with significant losses in plant yield and in extreme cases consequences for plant survival palliotti et al 2014 moreover different behaviors of grapevines under drought have been observed hochberg et al 2018 schultz 2003 tombesi et al 2015 it is well known that several mechanisms are adopted by grapevines facing different conditions of water shortage from a limitation of vegetation growth to stomatal closure and finally leaf shedding degu et al 2019 falchi et al 2020 gerzon et al 2015 lovisolo and schubert 1998 and moderate water stress conditions were shown to promote the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites without challenging plant survival castellarin et al 2007 peterlunger et al 2005 in red grape varieties anthocyanins flavan 3 ols and proanthocyanidins represent the main flavonoids that accumulate in berries from berry set to harvest among them anthocyanins start to be synthesized from veraison with a rapid increase in concentration until full maturation followed by a drop in the last period before harvest different experiments were carried out during the last decades highlighting the effect of water stress on the concentration the profile shift and the transcriptional reprogramming of anthocyanin biosynthesis castellarin et al 2007 savoi et al 2017 on the other hand there is still more mystery surrounding the biosynthesis of proanthocyanidins pas as the enzymes involved in the polymerization of flavan 3 ols and the relative transcripts are not fully known moreover the modifications in pa composition during maturation involve several reactions including covalent and hydrogen bonds with tonoplast and cell wall and in case of seeds also oxidation bindon and kennedy 2011 hanlin et al 2010 pas can bind with vacuole membranes and cell walls thus becoming less extractable bindon and kennedy 2011 the extractability of pas changes during maturation because of the modifications of cell walls thus the timing of harvest could also significantly affect the pas composition bindon et al 2014 the mean degree of polymerization mdp of pas is much higher in skins than in seeds with a lower degree of galloylation g in skins moreover in the skin pas a certain percentage of prodelphinidines p can be measured which are not found in seeds prieur et al 1994 bucchetti et al 2011 casassa et al 2015 herrera et al 2015 and zarrouk et al 2012 showed that a moderate to severe water stress could increase the concentration of pas in skins while previously peterlunger et al 2005 demonstrated that in moderate conditions the extractable fraction of pas was increased without any modification in the total concentration in seeds and skins moreover kyraleou et al 2017 reported that the skin total tannin concentration and content per berry increased under water deficit whereas seed total tannins were higher in the fully irrigated vines the experimental vineyard is located in the karst plateau extending between italy and slovenia and the soil is dominated by carbonate rocks mainly cretaceous limestone covered by a few centimeters of red karst loam terrarossa red soil limestone product mrak and repe 2004 in karst water stress conditions occur during the summer season because of both rain scarcity and the poor available water content of the shallow soils therefore irrigation can be used to only partially supply grapevines requirements to understand the proper water management in the karst area the study focused on the role of water deficit in the production of quality refošk grapes in two consecutive vintages two deficit irrigation treatments were compared and vine water status during grape ripening was evaluated throughout the season at the time of harvest yield basic grape parameters and the content of both total and extractable anthocyanins and pas from skins and seeds were analyzed the impact of both water regimes on the structural characteristics mdp g and p of seed and skin pas was evaluated as well 2 materials and methods 2 1 location plant material and experimental design the experiment was carried out during the growing seasons 2018 and 2019 in a commercial vineyard of v vinifera l cv refošk located in sagrado northeastern italy 45 52 18 n 13 30 09 e 150 m a s l in the friuli venezia giulia region within the carso d o c district the vineyard was planted in 2007 with refošk clone isv f2 grafted on 110 richter rootstock with an east west row orientation and a plant spacing of 2 6 m and 0 90 m between rows and vines respectively 4273 plants ha the vines are pruned on a single guyot 7 8 buds vine trained to vertical shoot positioning allowing for a vertical canopy development of 1 3 m during the growing seasons shoot trimming and chemical sprayings were performed as in the other vineyards the vineyard soil is a luvi endoleptic phaeozems characterized by a loam silt claily texture with frequent coarse and a limited rooting depth 0 5 1 0 m six rows were considered to set the experiment two treatments were compared each one set on 3 vineyard rows 50 etc supplying 50 of crop evapotranspiration etc and 20 etc supplying 20 etc etc was computed using penman monteith and applying a kc as proposed by lopez urrea et al 2012 the meteorological data were collected from the weather station of gradisca d isonzo arpa fvg osmer http www meteo fvg it 2 km from the vineyard the water was supplied by the farm drip irrigation system 1 2 times per week based on requirements except when rain exceeded the target restitutions 2 2 physiological parameters plant water status was monitored during the season every ca 15 days using the stem water potential method ψstem four fully expanded mature leaves were selected between 12 00 and 14 00 solar time from different vines on each plot bagged and covered with aluminum foil 1 h before the measurement 12 leaves per treatment after that time leaves were excised with a razor blade and immediately wrapped in cling film then put in plastic bags with a piece of wet paper inside thereafter the leaves were placed in a scholander pressure bomb soil moisture corp santa barbara usa with the petiole protruding from the chamber pressurized using a nitrogen tank ψstem was recorded in a few seconds when the initial xylem sap was observed emerging from the cut end of the petiole 2 3 berry sampling and basic analysis of grape juice in two consecutive vintages at the time of harvest 17 september 2018 and 2019 yield and cluster number per vine were recorded and the average cluster weight was estimated eighty berry samples were collected in each plot with pedicels and stored in a cold bag until reaching the laboratory subsamples of 40 berries for each plot were sorted weighed and manually pressed at room temperature total soluble solids brix and ph were measured using a manual refractometer atc 1 atago tokyo japan and a ph meter hi2211 hanna instruments woonsocket ri respectively titratable acidity as g l tartaric acid equivalents was determined by titration of the juice with 0 1 m naoh until ph 7 the second set of 40 berries was weighed and immediately stored at 80 c for determination of seed color and preparation of wine like extracts a sample of 10 clusters was collected from each plot clusters were randomly sampled on labeled vines at different positions on the fruiting cane and kept at 4 c until the extraction which was performed on fresh samples within 24 h 2 4 determination of seed color one hundred berries were randomly sampled from clusters seeds were manually separated dried in towel paper and immediately put into 5 solution of k2s2o5 to stop enzymatic browning of juice remaining on the seeds after 10 min 20 seeds were randomly selected dried in paper towel and visualized for color characteristics the colors of both dorsal and ventral surfaces were determined and compared with the color wheel for the seed coat fredes et al 2010 the seed color was calculated as the average of 10 dorsal and 10 ventral surface evaluations 2 5 seed and skin extraction in organic solvents total polyphenols for elucidation of the content and structural characteristics of the whole class of pas extracted from ground skins and seeds by means of strong solvents a slightly modified extraction method as described by chira et al 2009 was used skins and seeds of frozen berries were separated using a scalpel and immediately dropped into liquid nitrogen weighed to evaluate the proportion of skins and seeds to berry weight and milled under liquid nitrogen to a fine powder using the mortar the powder was immediately without thawing stored at 80 c frozen seed and skin powder was lyophilized for five days the difference between the fresh and dry weight determined the of water in the samples in total 1 g of lyophilized skin or seed powder was extracted by mechanical shaking at room temperature in 1 9 w v acetone water 80 20 v v for 4 h and centrifuged at 3500 g for 15 min sediment was then extracted in the same volume of methanol water 60 40 v v for 3 h and centrifuged again supernatants were pooled and evaporated under reduced pressure at 38 c on a buchi rotavapor to remove organic solvents residue was re dissolved in ca 10 ml of water and freeze dried to obtain a crude extract 2 6 seed and skin extraction in wine like solution extractable polyphenols extraction in wine like solution was used for elucidation of the content and structural characteristics of extractable pas which pass into wine for that purpose selective extraction of phenols from the skins and seeds of grape berries simulating the red wine maceration process was used mattivi et al 2002 in total 200 g of berries were randomly sampled counted and weighed skins and seeds were manually separated and directly placed into 200 ml of wine like solution consisting of ethanol water 12 88 v v 100 mg l so2 and 5 g l tartaric acid with a ph value adjusted to 3 2 with naoh the weight of skins and seeds was determined by weighting of erlenmeyer with 200 ml of hydroalcoholic solution before and after skins or seeds were added to minimize phenol oxidation the solutions were flushed with nitrogen and extraction was carried out in the dark for 5 days at 30 c by shaking samples manually once per day after 5 days the seeds and skins were removed from the hydroalcoholic solution skin extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 3500 g filtered through a plastic strainer and manually pressed and the final volume was adjusted both seed and skin extracts were transferred into dark glass bottles flushed with nitrogen and stored at 4 c until spectrophotometric and uhplc dad ms ms analyses were carried out 2 7 spectrophotometric analyses analyses were performed with an agilent 8453 spectrophotometer agilent technologies inc palo alto usa wine like seed and skin extracts were analyzed as in details described by rigo et al 2000 for total tannin extracts the method of rigo et al 2000 was used without the solid phase extraction step as described by sivilotti et al 2020 2 7 1 anthocyanins total anthocyanins ta were determined based on the maximal absorbance in the visible range 536 542 nm by assuming an average absorbance of the mixture of anthocyanins extracted from cabernet sauvignon grapes average mw 500 da ε 18800 m 1 cm 1 in 70 30 1 ethanol water hcl solution the results were expressed against the corresponding blank in mg g berry or skins fresh weight fw and in mg g of skins dry weight dw 2 7 2 low molecular weight proanthocyanidins lmwp index of vanillin the vanillin index methods provide an estimation of free c6 and c8 for catechins and for proanthocyanidins this index decreases with an increase in polymerization because c6 and c8 are mainly involved in polymerization bonds the method therefore provides a good estimation of monomers and a low degree of polymerized flavanols corresponding to two to four units lmwps were evaluated as catechin in mg g of fw and dw 2 7 3 high molecular weight proanthocyanidins hmwp hmwps were evaluated by transformation into cyanidin and expressed in mg g of cyanidin chloride of fw and dw the method is a highly specific assay which provides a good evaluation of the total amount of pas and is linked mainly to variations in the hmwp corresponding to at least 5 units vrhovsek et al 2001 2 8 uhplc dad ms ms analysis of proanthocyanidin structural characteristics in wine like and organic solvent extracts the structural characteristics of pas comprising mdp g and p were determined after acid catalyzed degradation with phloroglucinol as nucleophilic reagent drinkine et al 2007 kennedy and jones 2001 cleaning of wine like extracts was carried out as described in lisjak et al 2020 briefly 2 5 ml of wine like extracts was evaporated under reduced pressure to remove the ethanol fraction the evaporated sample was quantitatively transferred into a 10 ml volumetric flask and the volume was adjusted with milli q the sample was loaded onto an lc18 cartridge supelco st quentin fallavier france previously conditioned with methanol and milli q the column was washed with milli q and dried with nitrogen and the sample was eluted with methanol methanol was evaporated under reduced pressure at 40 c until dryness and the sample was dissolved in 1 ml of methanol total freeze dried seed or skin extracts were diluted in methanol 5 mg ml and further proceed without solid phase extraction a 200 μl aliquot of methanol fraction of wine like extracts or total tannin extracts was mixed with 200 μl of phloroglucinol reagent 0 05 m of hcl in methanol 50 g l of phloroglucinol sigma aldrich steinheim germany and 10 g l of ascorbic acid merck darmstadt germany the mixture was held at 50 c for 20 min for fractionation after 20 min 1 ml of 40 mm aqueous sodium acetate was added to stop the reaction samples were filtered through a 0 22 µm pvdf filter from millipore billerica ma usa and analyzed by uhplc dad ms ms agilent technologies santa clara usa as described lisjak et al 2020 sivilotti et al 2020 mdp p and g were estimated using the response factors of pa cleavage products at 280 nm and calculated as described by kennedy and jones 2001 the mdp value represented the molar ratio between the sum of all flavan 3 ol units produced by phloroglucinolysis and the sum of terminal units 2 9 statistical analysis ψstem differences within each date were analysed using a t test p indicated instead yield and grape composition data were analyzed using two way anova p indicated with treatments and year as fixed factors since in tabel there are reported just comparisons between two averages separation test is not needed principal component analysis pca was performed combining berry characteristics berry skin and seeds weight basic maturation data tss titratable acidity and ph and polyphenolic parameters anthocyanins seeds and skins proanthocyanidins concentration and structure extracted in organic solvents or in wine like solution prior to analysis data were normalized by seasons with the aim to show only the influence of water regime significance of loadings was ascertained to reduce the number of variables used in pca the pca analysis was performed with r software r core team 2013 using the ggbigplot package http github com vqv ggbigplot 3 results 3 1 weather conditions and plant water status the meteorological conditions of the two examined seasons had several differences in terms of both temperatures and rain distribution the winkler index from 1 april till harvest was 1771 and 1561 c in 2018 and 2019 respectively and the most important difference between seasons was revealed for the period veraison harvest 808 and 617 c in 2018 and 2019 respectively this difference is mostly related to the number of days between veraison and harvest 12 days shorter in 2019 table 1 the number of days with temperatures exceeding 30 c was higher in 2019 due mainly to the heat waves that characterized june and july to date 25 days registered max temperatures higher than 30 c in the period flowering veraison 2019 while only 2 were registered in the previous season moreover the distribution of rain was much different between seasons in 2018 from budburst to harvest rain events were constantly distributed with a period of water shortage from the end of july to the first half of august on the other hand in 2019 high rains occurred in may followed by stress periods in june at the end of july and in the second half of august the rain events that characterized september 2019 obliged the harvest of grapes despite the fact that full maturation was not reached this fact accounts for the lower winkler index between veraison and harvest 2019 in general the seasons investigated were characterized by not very challenging periods of water stress as revealed by the measured values of ψstem fig 1 in 2018 due to the rains that occurred in june and july the values of a such parameter revealed a condition of weak to moderate water stress in both irrigation levels while in the following period the lack of rain resulted in a drop of ψstem at values below 1 2 mpa in the case of 20 etc though later the rains recovered the plant water status the trend of ψstem was different in 2019 because the rain was lacking from june the values of ψstem were already lower than the first measurements even if the lowest values were measured in 2018 the period of water stress was much longer and effective for showing differences between irrigation regimes 3 2 yield and basic maturation parameters the irrigation water regime significantly affected the yield per vine with an 18 1 reduction in the case of 20 etc table 2 while average cluster weight and the number of clusters were only slightly modified among yield components the skin seed and flesh weight were lower in the case of 20 etc summing to a significant reduction also of berry weight 17 8 when the data were computed on a percentage basis the relative contribution of skin flesh and seeds was similar between irrigation levels because of the different meteorological courses of the two seasons there was also a significant impact on yield components plant production was lower in 2019 40 5 as compared to 2018 mostly because of a reduced cluster weight 36 8 regarding berry tissues skin and flesh weight were lower and seed weight was higher in 2019 and the relative proportion of berry tissues were found to have the same differences except for skin percentage which was found not significantly impacted the interaction observed in the case of berry seed and flesh weight revealed that the differences between irrigation regimes were significantly wider in 2019 at the time of harvest the basic maturation parameters had been modified by the irrigation treatments in detail 20 etc accounted for a 5 6 reduction in the accumulation of soluble solids brix as compared to 50 etc ph values were also lower in the case of 20 etc while titratable acidity was only slightly modified the season factor also impacted the basic maturation parameters of the grapes the concentration of soluble solids was significantly lower in 2018 6 8 as compared to 2019 and ph and titratable acidity were both significantly affected by season the color of seeds was significantly browner in 20 etc than in 50 etc which could be related to better seed maturity in the case of the lower water regime more in detail the differences between irrigation regimes were negligible in 2018 while in 2019 although the values were much lower the seeds were significantly browner in the case of more limited irrigation treatment there were also significant differences between 2018 and 2019 revealing browner seeds in 2018 where maturation advanced at the time of harvest this is in accordance with kennedy et al 2000 who reported that visually the seeds changed color during fruit ripening from an initial green to a light buff and finally to a dark brown at harvest 3 3 total anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins skins and seeds were separated from frozen berries lyophilized cryo milled and extracted by aqueous organic methanol and acetone such a process is used to extract the whole class of phenols the exception might be highly polymerized tannins that are not easily extracted even with acetone downey et al 2003 or some of those that interact with vacuole membrane and cell wall structures the irrigation regime significantly modified the concentration of anthocyanins in grape berries with higher values in case of 20 etc table 3 the observed increase was simply the result of the enhanced biosynthesis as the skin to berry ratio was not modified between 50 etc and 20 etc as regards the concentration of skin pas both hmwp and lmwp not significant modifications were reported due to the irrigation regime 20 etc reported slightly lower and higher concentrations of hmwp and lmwp respectively and the same difference was observed in the concentration of pas in skins mg g skin dw on the other hand among the structural characteristics of skin pas the g was significantly higher in the case of 20 etc also the mdp significantly increased by 20 etc only in 2018 while in the following season the difference in g between irrigation regimes was negligible see interaction effect table 3 the p was affected by neither the irrigation regime nor the season in terms of seed pas no differences were found between 50 etc and 20 etc for both pa concentrations and structural characteristics however there was a trend in higher mdp and g in the lower water regime which became significant in the case of extractable pas table 4 galloylation of total seed tannins was over 3 times higher than that of skin and significantly higher in the case of 20 etc regarding the vintage the concentration of anthocyanins was significantly lower in 2019 it can be postulated that the combination between the slightly lower skin to berry ratio and the reduction of anthocyanin biosynthesis in 2019 could explain such a difference the concentration of skin pas was also not different between seasons in 2019 the concentration of hmwp and lmwp in mg g berry fw was reduced by 11 and 15 respectively the mdp and g were significantly lower in 2019 as regards seasonal effect hmwp seed content mg g seeds dw was not significantly different between seasons however hmwp seed concentration in mg g berry fw was significant higher in 2019 49 3 than in 2018 this might be related to the higher seed to berry ratio 31 8 and also to the difference in seed water content 29 9 vs 37 3 in 2018 and 2019 respectively data not shown as opposite as for skins the seed lmwp content mg g seed dw was significantly higher in 2019 table 3 the combination of this result with the higher seed to berry ratio explains the significant difference in lmwp concentration in seeds while there were no differences in mdp between seasons the g was significantly lower in 2019 3 4 extractable anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins anthocyanins and pas that pass into the wine were determined by the separated extraction of seeds and skins in wine like solution for 5 days at 30 c table 4 the concentration of extractable anthocyanins was significantly higher in the case of 20 etc 26 8 as compared to 50 etc irrigation regime did not significantly affect the concentration of extractable hmwp in skins even if lower values were ascertained in the case of 20 etc differently the concentration of extractable lmwp was significantly lower in the case of 20 etc as regards the structural characteristics of skin pas significantly higher g was observed in 20 etc while the mdp and the p were unaffected by the irrigation regime as regards seeds there were no significant differences in extractable hmwp and lmwp content between 50 etc and 20 etc on the other hand both the mdp and g significantly increased in the case of the lower irrigation regime table 4 the mdp of extractable pas was ca 7 and 4 5 for skins and seeds respectively whereas the mdp of total pas was ca 19 and 8 5 for skins and seeds respectively the g of seed tannins in wine like extracts was 37 6 versus 45 2 while for skin tannins it was 7 8 and 11 2 in 50 etc and 20 etc respectively thus galloylation of extractable seed tannins was over 4 times higher than in skins the p in extractable skin pas was unaffected by irrigation level table 4 which is consistent with total extraction table 3 a comparison of the seasons reveals that the concentration of extractable anthocyanins was much higher in 2019 than in 2018 even if the percentage of skins was lower and the biosynthesis did not significantly increase in 2019 compare skin anthocyanin content in mg g skin dw between vintages also the concentration of extractable pas was impacted more by the season than by the irrigation level thus both skin and seed hmwp and lmwp were significantly higher in 2019 as regards the structural characteristics of pas the g of extractable pas significantly increased in both skins and seeds in 2019 as compared to 2018 looking at the significance of the interaction between water regime and vintage the tannin structural characteristics were shown to respond differently to irrigation regimes in 2018 and 2019 data not shown in 2019 both mdp and g were significantly higher in the case of 20 etc as compared to 50 etc meanwhile irrigation regimes did not significantly affect structural characteristics of both skin and seed pas to understand the relative importance of the dataset examined data of polyphenol parameters berry characteristics and basic maturation were processed through pca analysis fig 2 the first two factors analyzed accounted for a 83 1 of explained variance as regard the first factor significant loadings were ascertained for ph berry and seed weight skin anthocyanins skin and seeds g and seeds mdp higher values of the just mentioned skin and seeds polyphenolic parameters were ascertained for 20 etc while as opposite berry characteristics and basic maturation parameters were more correlated with 50 etc the results presented here provide evidence that proanthocyanidins structure of seeds and skins together with anthocyanin concentration are the most important polyphenolic modifications occurring when deficit irrigation is reduced from 50 to 20 etc 4 discussion 4 1 plant water status and yield parameters stem water potential ψstem is a reliable measure of plant water status deloire et al 2004 explained that for such a parameter values lower than 1 4 mpa are critical in the case of v vinifera as they could cause physiological damages and atypical maturation of the grapes in the experiment carried out on refošk ψstem was always above this critical value thus excessive water stress conditions were avoided moreover due to the meteorological conditions there was a different trend of plant water status during the two seasons while in 2018 the lowest ψstem ca 1 2 mpa was registered the year 2019 on average settled on lower values also the difference between 20 etc and 50 etc was wider fig 1 4 2 yield and basic maturation parameters plant production fell by 18 when the vines were irrigated with 20 etc this result was basically due to the smaller berry size the same results have also been ascertained by several trials carried out on different grapevine varieties around the world castellarin et al 2007 intrigliolo et al 2012 mccarthy 1997 yu et al 2016 a comparison of the season effect revealed that the yield was 40 lower in 2019 mainly in the 20 etc treatment data not shown and the berry weight contraction is far to explain the difference between seasons we could speculate that the berry set was worse in 2019 due to the adverse weather conditions during the flowering time low temperature and excessive rain resulting in a reduced number of berries at the time of harvest in terms of skin weight a significant reduction was ascertained in the case of 20 etc as shown by ojeda et al 2002 it is normal that skin fresh weight is linearly related to berry weight and only in the case of severe water stress thicker skins are produced bucchetti et al 2011 herrera et al 2015 roby and matthews 2004 looking at the basic maturation parameters a lower accumulation of tss was ascertained in the case of 20 etc in other trials higher soluble solids were found in the case of water stress treatments in comparison to well water conditions bucchetti et al 2011 savoi et al 2017 zarrouk et al 2012 in the present trial two water deficit conditions were compared and we could speculate that the 20 etc irrigation regime accounted for a reduction in the assimilation rate due to partial stomatal closure because of the limited soil depth a similar reduction in tss was reported by sivilotti et al 2005 when moderate and severe water stress were compared 4 3 skin anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins anthocyanin concentration significantly increased in the more limiting irrigation regime 20 etc as also reported by other researchers casassa et al 2015 castellarin et al 2007 sivilotti et al 2005 theodorou et al 2019 the concentration of anthocyanins after extraction in organic solvents was also much lower in 2019 in this year the overall solar radiation of the veraison harvest interval was much lower as was the thermal range 12 8 and 11 9 c in 2018 and 2019 respectively several authors showed that higher values of both parameters positively affect the biosynthesis of anthocyanins cohen et al 2008 gaiotti et al 2018 kliewer and torres 1972 the concentration of total pas in refošk skins mg g berry fw was not significantly affected by irrigation regime while when looking at the extractable fraction in wine like solution a significant reduction in lmwp and a parallel increase in mdp were found in the case of lower irrigation conflicting results were reported regarding the effects of water stress on the concentration of skin pas at harvest kyraleou et al 2017 and allegro et al 2016 showed that water stress negatively affects the concentration of skin pas while an opposite effect was reported by bucchetti et al 2011 casassa et al 2015 herrera et al 2015 and peterlunger et al 2005 one could argue that differences between grapevine varieties and environmental and water stress conditions could significantly modify the biosynthesis and or degradation of pas thus explaining the above mentioned results peterlunger et al 2005 evaluated the extractable concentration of high and low molecular weight pas in merlot skins showing a slightly higher concentration in the case of the water stress treatment regarding skin pas structural characteristics on average higher mdp and g were found in the case of 20 etc changes in the mdp of skin pas during berry development are inconsistent in the literature with increases or decreases reported with the progression of ripening or in response to environmental constraints downey et al 2003 kennedy et al 2002 as reported by kyraleou et al 2017 the mdp of skin polymeric pas increases during maturation while no differences were ascertained as regards oligomers the same authors reported a significantly higher mdp of the polymeric skin pa fraction in the case of a non irrigated treatment and similar outcomes were also shown by ollé et al 2011 on shiraz and by kennedy et al 2001 on cabernet sauvignon in the 2019 season the mdp of refošk skins was lower than it was in 2018 probably due to the incomplete maturation of the grapes in that season on the other hand a significantly higher g in both total and extractable skin pas was found in 20 etc grapes as compared to 50 etc kyraleou et al 2017 reported significantly lower g in shiraz skin subjected to water stress whereas no differences were reported by càceres mella et al 2017 in cabernet sauvignon the stabilization of flavan 3 ols during maturation involves the addition of galloyl groups the polymerization and the interaction with cell walls and tonoplast through both covalent and hydrogen bonds bontpart et al 2015 reported that galloylation reactions occur before polymerization it could be speculated that in response to stress vines might synthetize more galloylated flavan 3 ols and pas the biological activities of galloylated flavan 3 ols and pas were reported to be higher than their non galloylated parent molecules karas et al 2017 an examination of the g in 2019 revealed a wide difference between irrigation regimes probably related to the earlier and longer period of water deficit experienced by the vines data not shown the differences in skin pas structure between seasons could be related to both the meteorological conditions during the growing season and the different degree of maturation of the grapes at harvest we already pointed out that in 2019 maturation was not completed which could partially account for the higher mdp in fact gagné et al 2006 and bindon et al 2010 explained that the mdp of tannins associated with the cell wall tended to increase at the end of maturation intermediate molecular mass rather than highly polymerized pas has a higher affinity for skin cell walls bindon and kennedy 2011 but during ripening modifications in skin cell wall composition facilitate enhanced adsorption also of highly polymerized pas bindon et al 2012 in the last stages of ripening cell wall porosity increased supporting the hypothesis that a greater sequestration of highly polymerized pas could occur bindon et al 2012 4 4 seed proanthocyanidins the biosynthesis of seed pas begins at berry set and stops at around veraison more precisely cadot et al 2006 downey et al 2003 and genebra et al 2014 reported the highest concentration of pas in shiraz seeds one week after veraison declining thereafter until maturity the experiments dealing with water stress and seed pas reported contrasting effects on contents and structural characteristics kennedy et al 2000 showed no significant effects of water deficits on proanthocyanidins or their polymerization however water deficit decreased the amounts of flavan 3 ol monomers and greatly increased their rate of loss during fruit ripening yu et al 2016 highlighted that seed pa concentration was rarely affected by irrigation treatments as also has been found in our study an interesting conclusion was underlined by chacon et al 2009 who ascertained an increase in seed pa concentration as related to the magnitude of water deficit looking at results obtained in this study small differences between both irrigation regimes might impact the lack of significant differences in seed pa concentration more significant differences were ascertained between seasons maturation was delayed and uncompleted in 2019 mostly in the case of seeds as confirmed by the lower values of seed color table 2 in 2019 total and extractable low and high molecular weight pa content was significantly higher than in 2018 whereas the seed color was less brown this is consistent with kennedy et al 2000 who concluded that both darker seed color and decline in seed flavan 3 ols and pas are consistent with an oxidative process the products of oxidation would likely be polyphenols cross linked to other polyphenols carbohydrates or proteins and it would be expected that the phenolic functional groups would become modified moreover in unripe seeds lignification is low and a solvent can access easily the inner integument explaining why a larger quantity of tannins is extracted peyrot des gachons and kennedy 2003 higher values of seed pas in 2019 can also be attributed to the higher seed weight table 1 significantly higher mdp and g were found in seed extractable pas in the case of a lower water regime the trend was the same in total pas though not significant in agreement with our results kyraleou et al 2017 reported higher mdp and g values in seeds from the water deficit treatment both galloylation and mdp correlate positively with astringency chira et al 2011 lisjak et al 2020 vidal et al 2003 cheynier et al 2006 concluded that hard tannin perception in wines is associated with high tannin concentrations especially of large polymers and galloylated tannins from seeds that aggregate easily but it is uncertain whether soft tannin perception is due to low concentrations of such tannins to the presence of anthocyanin tannin adducts or to the incorporation of tannins into protein or polysaccharide complexes the question of whether the effect of higher mdp and galloylation on the sensorial properties of wines is positive or negative remains unclear due to astringency sensation complexity the seed mdp was nearly half in the extractable fraction as compared to total extraction while comparable values were ascertained for g apparently there are conflicting results between acetone methanol and wine like extractions as reported by mattivi et al 2009 among pas only the less polymerized were extracted in wine like solution the mdp and the g in the wine like extracts were significantly higher in the case of 20 etc while no differences were found regarding total extraction as shown by cadot et al 2006 phenolic compounds in seeds were observed in three seed tissues the epidermis a wide part of the outer integument and the inner layer of the inner integument from an extractability perspective this observation could explain partial extraction in wine like solution the solidification of the cells rich in tannins before harvest could affect the aptitude for the extraction of these compounds cadot et al 2006 geny et al 2003 hanlin et al 2010 pointing out that as pas increase in polymerization they can react with cell walls reducing their extractability 5 conclusions in this study two irrigation regimes 50 and 20 etc were investigated in two vintages in terms of yield and quality of refošk grapes both irrigation regimes resulted in a moderate water stress but this was more intense in less irrigated plants 20 etc grapes of less irrigated vines have significantly lower brix higher ph and surprisingly darker seed color there were no significant differences in total proanthocyanidin concentration in skins and seeds between 20 and 50 etc water supply on the other hand significantly higher total and extractable anthocyanins were found in the case of less irrigated plants as regards proanthocyanidin structural characteristics there was a significant shift in terms of galloylation of both extractable and total skin and seed tannins with higher values in the case of lower water availability 20 etc furthermore the mdp of extractable seed tannins was higher in case of 20 etc in summary proanthocyanidin structure together with anthocyanin concentration were the most important composition modifications occurring when deficit irrigation was reduced from 50 to 20 etc considering the results obtained in this study 20 etc water supply would be more recommended for the refošk variety in karst area because less water was used while severe stress conditions were avoided obtaining an overall better grape quality in terms of color and phenols at the same time this saves water in a region with scarce water availability nonetheless a cost benefit analysis should be considered to calculate the increase in price needed to counterbalance the reduction of the yield obtained in the case of 20 etc
