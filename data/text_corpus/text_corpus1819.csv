9095,cover crops cc have the potential to increase water storage by reducing runoff increasing infiltration and decreasing evaporation interseeding cc into a summer cash crop can increase cc biomass production essential for maximizing beneficial services effects of interseeded cc on soil water content during the following cash crop has not been fully evaluated in the mid atlantic usa soil water content was measured during the corn zea mays l phase of four no till rotations at the usda beltsville agricultural research center beltsville md from 2017 through 2020 all systems included corn soybean glycine max l wheat triticum aestivum l rotations and systems 3 4 and 5 added double crop soybean dcs after wheat in system 5 a mix of rye secale cereale l hairy vetch vicia villosa roth crimson clover trifolium incarnatum l was interseeded into dcs in system 6 red clover rc trifolium pratense l was interseeded into wheat and rye was planted into rc after wheat harvest in 2017 and 2018 season average soil water storage was 20 mm greater in systems with cc before corn compared to no cc before corn nc a similar but non significant trend was present in 2019 and 2020 11 mm estimated evapotranspiration was lower for cc compared to nc systems in 2018 while greater estimated infiltration was observed for cc compared to nc systems in 2019 four year average corn yields were greater for cc compared to nc systems 12 1 vs 10 6 mg ha 1 similarly average corn water use efficiency wue was greater in cc compared to nc systems 5 55 vs 4 70 kg m 3 the returns from increased yield more than offset the cost of cc establishment the combination of greater yields and wue demonstrate the benefits of interseeded cc in humid regions of the us keywords cover crops evapotranspiration infiltration soil water storage water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction crop productivity in northeastern and mid atlantic agriculture is expected to be negatively impacted by future patterns of increased evapotranspiration et driven by higher summer temperatures boesch et al 2008 dupigny giroux et al 2018 precipitation intensity in the northeastern united states has increased in recent decades guilbert et al 2015 hoerling et al 2016 resulting in increased risk of runoff and reducing potential contributions to soil water storage sws predicted regional temperature increases lynch et al 2016 will place greater demand on available soil moisture potentially negatively impacting crops during critical periods of anthesis and grain filling to adapt producers need improved management practices that increase rainfall infiltration and reduce surface evaporation to maintain soil water availability for crop growth long term use of winter cover crops cc affects soil physical properties and has been demonstrated to increase soil porosity water infiltration and sws basche et al 2016 blanco canqui and ruis 2020 daigh et al 2014 leuthold et al 2021 qi et al 2011a in a meta analysis blanco canqui and ruis 2020 report an 1 5 increase in macroporosity and a 62 increase in water infiltration due to cc however the authors note the magnitude of the effect on infiltration was highly variable among the studies indicating that effects are site and management specific for example in maryland a rye secale cereale l cc in no till continuous corn zea mays l generally decreased bulk density at coastal plain sites but not at a piedmont site and had no effect on growing season infiltration after 12 13 years steele et al 2012 although cc may reduce soil water at planting alonso ayuso et al 2014 unger and vigil 1998 in humid regions spring rainfall is usually sufficient to overcome any deficit basche et al 2016 clark et al 2007 1997 given predicted regional increases in late winter and early spring precipitation thibeault and seth 2014 cc water use may even improve conditions for planting in wet years li et al 2021 in years with insufficient summer rainfall increased infiltration and reduced soil evaporation can increase soil water availability to crops particularly during critical reproductive phases clark et al 2007 leuthold et al 2021 during the cropping season water moves from the soil to the atmosphere through both crop transpiration and evaporation from the soil surface thus reducing water stored in the soil profile dingman 1994 cover crop residues lower soil temperatures dabney 1998 and slow surface evaporation during drying cycles alonso ayuso et al 2014 clark et al 2007 particularly during the early growing season prior to canopy closure balwinder singh et al 2011 however the mulching effect of surface cc residues on soil water is variable unger and vigil 1998 for example qi et al 2011a report greater average weekly sws in the top 60 cm of soil in an iowa no till corn crop which they attribute to reduced soil surface evaporation and increased infiltration due to surface rye cc residues in contrast in a minnesota study where there was limited rye biomass production and below average rainfall the rye cc resulted in no effect on sws relative to no cc in a continuous corn silage system krueger et al 2011 when drought occurs during the cash crop production period the favorable effects of rye residues on sws depends on capturing early season rainfall and having sufficient rye biomass to reduce evaporation daigh et al 2014 clark et al 2007 reported greater soil moisture for late killed rye and rye vetch cc compared to late killed vetch early killed rye or mixtures and no cover controls which the authors attribute to greater residue cover with the late killed rye and rye vetch cover crop growth and biomass production can be limited following double crop soybean glycine max l dcs harvest in the mid atlantic region due to the limited window for cc establishment prior to cold weather curran et al 2018 by seeding cc into a growing main crop relay intercropping can increase successful establishment and growth leading to greater spring biomass production as well as increasing the diversity of potential cc species caswell et al 2019 intercropping cc can also potentially reduce weed pressure and nutrient losses bybee finley and ryan 2018 teasdale 1996 thapa et al 2018 the effects on soil water balances and water use efficiency of corn following interseeded cc mixtures have not been fully investigated in the mid atlantic region to evaluate the potential management implications of interseeded legume rye cc mixtures on soil temperature sws evapotranspiration infiltration corn yield and water use efficiency we compared systems where cc were planted into wheat triticum aestivum l or dcs to systems where no cc was grown prior to the following corn crop 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and management this investigation was conducted in the long term cover crop systems project ccsp 39 00 51 3 n 76 56 29 0 w at the beltsville agricultural research center in beltsville md usa from 2017 through 2020 soils at the study site are mapped as codorus fine loamy mixed active mesic fluvaquentic dystrudept and hatboro fine loamy mixed active nonacid mesic fluvaquentic endoaquept silt loams nrcs web soil survey accessed 11 2 2021 with slopes less than one percent the codorus and hatboro series consist of very deep moderately well drained to somewhat poorly drained soils formed in recently deposited alluvium on floodplains saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high the site is underlain by drain tiles located 0 8 1 25 m below the soil surface and spaced approximately 15 m apart those under replications 1 2 and 3 run northwest to southeast while those under replication 4 run northeast to southwest the drain tiles were installed in the early 1950 s and remain functional although the output from the research field is not monitored the locations of the drain lines were confirmed using ground penetrating radar in the fall of 2017 allred et al 2018 the prior study on this site 2011 2013 evaluated cc termination management in organic corn soybean wheat production systems keene et al 2017 wallace et al 2018 the site was transitioned to the current study in the spring of 2014 when the entire area was planted to corn in the fall of 2014 and spring of 2015 cover crop treatments were initiated as in table 1 the first cash crops of the ccsp study were harvested in 2015 the ccsp experiment is laid out as a randomized split plot experiment with four replications blocks whole plots are crop phase corn soybean or wheat each crop is grown every year and split plots are cc systems 3 through 6 described below table 1 soybean in interseeded systems and corn in all systems were planted in 76 cm rows with a four row planter soybean in non interseeded treatments was planted in 38 cm rows with an eight row planter wheat was planted in 19 cm rows with a grain drill interseeded cover crops were planted in three 19 cm rows between two cash crop 76 cm rows with the penn state university interseeder curran et al 2018 other cover crops were planted in 19 cm rows with a grain drill all cash crops were planted at university of maryland extension recommended rates cropping systems 3 4 and 5 consist of no till corn soybean wheat dcs rotations while system 6 is a no till corn soybean wheat rotation table 1 in systems 3 and 4 there is no cover crop nc prior to corn however system 4 includes a cereal rye cc between corn and the following full season soybean the other two systems cc systems 5 and 6 focus on interseeding legumes and rye into the cash crop preceding corn in system 5 a rye legume mix hairy vetch vicia villosa roth crimson clover trifolium incarnatum l is interseeded into dcs prior to canopy closure in mid august the system 5 rye hairy vetch crimson clover was interseeded at 36 12 6 kg ha 1 2017 48 36 6 kg ha 1 2018 36 24 6 kg ha 1 2019 and 2020 in 2017 this cc mixture also included 6 kg ha 1 red clover trifolium pratense l in system 6 red clover was interseeded into wheat in march at 30 16 18 or 19 kg ha 1 and rye was interseeded into the red clover in the fall at 145 145 135 or 36 kg ha 1 2017 through 2020 respectively the rye seeding rate was reduced in 2020 to allow more vigorous growth of the red clover in the fall and following spring the rye cc prior to full season soybean was terminated at boot stage with a mixture of 1 26 kg ha 1 glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine 0 35 kg ha 1 metribuzin 4 amino 6 tert butyl 3 methylthio 1 2 4 triazin 5 4 h one and 1 49 kg ha 1 s metolachlor s 2 chloro n 2 ethyl 6 methyl phenyl n 1 methoxypropan 2 yl acetamide the rye legume mixtures prior to corn were terminated with 0 84 kg ha 1 glyphosate 0 42 kg ha 1 dicamba 3 6 dichloro 2 methoxybenzoic acid and 0 28 kg ha 1 2 4 d 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid once terminated cc residues remained standing until the corn planting operation flattened the majority of the residues creating a mulch layer on the soil surface cover crop aboveground biomass samples were harvested just prior to termination table 2 samples were collected from two representative 0 5 m2 sub areas in each plot biomass was clipped at the soil surface and dried for 10 14 days at 60 c and weighed harvested biomass samples included cc species plus any weeds present usually none an experimental objective at ccsp is to manage each system based on farmer practices in the mid atlantic states many producers in the region do not use cc or kill their cc early to be able to plant near the end of april or beginning of may growers who maximize cc biomass production usually plant 10 15 days later than producers who do not use cc corn in the nc systems 3 and 4 was planted in early may usually 10 20 days prior to the cc systems 5 and 6 except in 2020 when all systems were planted on the same day table 2 the corn variety from 2017 through 2020 was pioneer p0506am documentation indicates it has a comparative relative maturity rating of 105 and requires 3150 heat units to reach maturity corn in all systems received 28 kg n ha 1 as starter fertilizer at planting corn in systems 3 and 4 was sidedressed with 134 157 134 and 134 kg n ha 1 in 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively corn in systems 5 and 6 was sidedressed with 86 134 134 and 134 kg n ha 1 in 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively soil water measurements in the corn phase of the rotation began in the spring of 2017 because we only focus on the corn phase our experimental design reduces to a completely randomized block with 2 2017 or 3 2018 2020 replications because all rotation phases are present every year each crop is grown in different plots over three consecutive years in the fourth year cash crops return to the same plots they were grown on in year one 2 2 weather data corn growth stages and potential evapotranspiration weather data were collected at a weather station located less than 80 m from ccsp air temperature rainfall relative humidity solar radiation at the surface of the ground and windspeed data from the weather station were used to calculate daily values air temperature data were used to calculate growing degree days gdd c as described in abendroth et al 2011 corn development stages were estimated based on the accumulation of gdd using 10 c and 30 c as minimum and maximum optimum temperatures for corn growth and development abendroth et al 2011 developmental stages were adjusted to include emergence occurring at 105 gdd from planting daily gdd values were summed to give cumulative gdd cumgdd c daily growing degree days were calculated as follows gdd tmin tmax 2 10 tmin minimum daily air temperature if temperature is less than 10 c use 10 as tmin and tmax maximum daily air temperature if temperature is greater than 30 c use 30 as tmax weather data were also used as inputs to calculate daily potential evapotranspiration pet based on the penman montieth method using etcalc an online evapotranspiration calculator danielescu 2021 and 2022 2 3 soil water and temperature measurements soil volumetric water content m3 m 3 and temperature c were measured at four depths in two 2017 or three 2018 2020 of the four field replications using time domain reflectometry tdr sensors table 3 data were collected at 5 minute intervals and stored as hourly 2017 or 15 min 2018 2020 averages using campbell scientific cr206x and cr1000 dataloggers campbell scientific inc logan ut sensors were installed in non traffic rows halfway between corn rows they were installed in a vertical orientation and spaced 80 120 cm apart the locations for sensor placement were established using gps so that they were approximately halfway between mapped drain tiles allred et al 2018 to minimize effects of drainage on soil water measurements as much as possible installation of soil water sensors occurred as soon as possible after corn planting 2 4 data qaqc raw volumetric water content data were evaluated for quality using routines from the international soil moisture network qaqc approach dorigo et al 2021 2013 the procedure applied simple threshold checks and evaluated trends in the time series data and their first and second derivatives spurious data were flagged and compared to nearby data in addition all data were graphed and evaluated visually short periods of missing data that occurred when no rainfall fell were replaced using the expand procedure in sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc sas inst inc 2019 to interpolate missing values with a linear function where missing data occurred in association with rainfall events data from the other treatments in the same replication were used to estimate the missing data based on regressions estimated from the entire cropping season this approach was used for missing surface sensor data in systems 5 and 6 in 2017 for the period from 23 july to 10 august that occurred due to the failure of a data logger in replication 3 all other times when sensors or a data logger failed were of sufficiently short duration that interpolation was used to fill in the missing data interpolations were carried out for individual sensors prior to averaging data for the day 2 5 estimation of soil water storage estimated evapotranspiration and estimated infiltration daily averages of volumetric water content and soil temperature were calculated from hourly 2017 or 15 minute data 2018 through 2020 data from multiple sensors within a depth were averaged after data cleaning soil water storage was estimated by multiplying daily volumetric water content times the horizon depth to get millimeters of water calculation of sws assumed that measurements within a depth interval were representative of that horizon depth interval millimeters of water for each depth were summed to obtain whole profile 0 862 mm sws the daily change in sws was used to estimate evapotranspiration ete and infiltration infe as described by sadeghi et al 2007 this simple approach is based on the change in sws for the soil profile between the current and previous day each day is considered to start at 5 am daily negative change in sws was designated as ete daily losses which are an indication of actual et positive changes were considered infiltration gains in sws which because they are based on daily values may slightly underestimate actual infiltration runoff and deep percolation losses were considered negligible for the rainfall conditions in 2017 2019 and 2020 in 2018 losses to drainage most likely occurred in the later part of the growing season when rainfall exceeded the monthly average for september by 142 mm fig 1 at this point in the growing season cc residues probably had limited influence on evaporation and we assumed losses to drainage would be similar among all the systems therefore drainage losses this late in the growing season were considered to have little impact on our analysis in 2018 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted within the sas enterprise guide platform version 8 3 sas institute inc 2020 cover crop biomass corn yield and water use efficiency were analyzed using a mixed models approach with proc mixed in sas stat 15 1 sas institute inc 2019 year system and their interaction were considered fixed effects and replication and the replication by year interaction were considered random effects the analysis of cc biomass included only systems 5 and 6 differences among systems were evaluated within a year using the slice option of the lsmeans statement differences were considered significant at α 0 05 p 0 05 statistical analysis of system effects on soil temperature sws ete and infe were conducted using a generalized linear mixed models approach with proc glimmix in sas stat 15 1 sas institute inc 2019 analyses were carried out separately for each year system was considered a fixed effect and replication and the replication by system interaction were included as random effects replication variance was allowed to be zero when computed to be so date was treated as a repeated measures effect in the analysis of soil temperature sws and infe thermal units cumgdd were used as the repeated effect in the analysis of ete the residual option was included in the random statement to model the r side covariance where appropriate compound symmetry autoregressive and spatial power covariance structures were compared to determine the best covariance structure based on the one with lowest corrected akaike s information criterion and where proc glimmix computed variance for all covariance parameters except the replication and replication by system terms stroup et al 2018 lsmeans statements were used to estimate corn growing season average soil temperature and sws and determine their differences among cc systems in each growing season differences in ete and infe among systems at specific stages of corn development were evaluated using lsmestimate statements for ete differences were evaluated at approximately v6 v10 vt and r1 based on cumulative gdd values of approximately 575 840 1235 and 1400 respectively these development stages represent early mid and late vegetative and silking periods for infe differences among systems were evaluated on july 1 august 1 and september 1 in addition to the direct comparisons among systems a test was constructed to compare nc versus cc e g system 3 system 4 2 vs system 5 system 6 2 differences were considered significant at α 0 10 p 0 10 for soil sensor related measurements due to the inherent spatial variability of soils 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather monthly average temperature and rainfall data are provided in table 4 in general monthly average air temperatures for june through september during the four years were similar to the 10 year average average air temperatures in may were slightly below normal for 2017 and 2020 and slightly above average for 2018 and 2019 rainfall amounts varied considerably from the 10 year average depending on the month and year rainfall was below the 10 year average in june and september 2017 june august and september 2019 and may 2020 in 2018 monthly rainfall was above 10 year averages in all four months however the monthly rainfall totals do not adequately identify the long periods of limited rainfall in each year in particular in 2018 limited rainfall is apparent in fig 1 from june 1 to july 21 from may 10 the date of corn planting in the nc systems through may 31 the day after planting in the cc systems there was 174 mm rainfall in contrast from june 1 through july 20 108 mm rain fell with a majority of that 76 mm occurring on june 3 because of this critical early stages of corn growth and development occurred during a period of limited infrequent rainfall and higher temperatures similar early growing season periods of limited rainfall were observed in 2017 and 2019 the impact on crop yields were greater in 2018 than in the other years see below cumulative gdd and cumulative rainfall from corn planting to harvest for the four years are shown in fig 1 patterns for cumgdd illustrate the effects of delaying corn planting in systems 5 and 6 compared to systems 3 and 4 cumulative gdd for silking 1400 occurred in mid august to early september accumulation of heat units during the two weeks following corn planting was slower for systems 3 and 4 compared to systems 5 and 6 due to the earlier planting date accumulation of gdd for cc and nc systems was the same in 2020 when all systems were planted on the same date differences in rainfall amounts and distribution during the corn growing seasons depended on planting date differences rainfall during the corn growing season ranged from 236 mm 2019 to 805 mm 2018 table 2 and fig 1 rainfall in 2018 was more than two times greater than the 10 yr average of 347 mm with much of that rain occurring after late july rainfall in 2019 was 86 of the 10 yr average for nc systems and 68 of the 10 yr average for cc systems estimated from the date of planting 3 2 cover crop biomass at corn planting cover crop biomass in systems 5 and 6 ranged from less than 500 kg ha 1 to over 6000 kg ha 1 during the four years in system 5 rye vetch crimson clover cc biomass prior to corn planting was 3248 sd 323 3697 sd 838 463 sd 362 and 1611 sd 416 kg ha 1 in 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively for the same years cc biomass prior to corn planting in system 6 red clover rye was 3939 sd 533 4279 sd 344 4478 sd 847 and 6011 sd 64 kg ha 1 cover crop establishment in systems 5 and 6 in 2017 and 2018 was good and they produced similar amounts of biomass in contrast there were differences in biomass production in 2019 and 2020 that were due to the composition of the species mixtures and weather related challenges planting the interseeded cc planting the rye legume mixture into dcs in system 5 was difficult in 2018 due to wet conditions and in 2019 due to dry conditions both negatively impacting stand establishment and subsequent biomass production spring interseeding march of red clover in system 6 helped facilitate better stand establishment and growth in all four years wheat and soybean crop residue biomass on the soil surface at the time of corn planting in systems 3 and 4 was not determined however visual observations found these to be limited wheat straw is baled after summer harvest and soybean residues tend to decompose rapidly under the mild humid winters of the mid atlantic region residues from these crops provided less than 30 soil cover at the time of corn planting 3 3 soil temperature surface soil temperatures in the four systems are shown in fig 2 for each of the four years reponses across the growing season were similar for the four systems with variations in the data related primarily to sunny and cloudy days table 5 significant system and system by date interactions were present in 2018 and 2019 table 6 soils were noticeably warmer in cc systems compared to nc systems early in the corn growing season in 2018 this was due to less corn canopy in the cc systems a result of the later planting date during the extended dry period discussed above in contrast soil temperatures in 2019 the driest year of the study tended to be lower in cc systems compared to nc systems later in the growing season this may have been a result of greater corn canopy in the cc system the vertical orientation of our sensors reduced our ability to detect influences of the cover crop residues on temperatures near the soil surface 0 5 cm our sensors integrated temperature measurements for the 0 12 cm or 0 15 cm soil depth others have shown that cc residues have a small but variable effect on seasonal average summer soil temperatures blanco canqui and ruis 2020 vann et al 2018 with effects occurring early in the growing season daigh et al 2014 horton et al 1996 z wang et al 2021 used a process based model to simulate rye residue mulch effects on diurnal soil surface water and thermal dynamics soil surface temperatures 0 5 cm with a mulch layer were reduced by 1 5 c compared to the air temperature and 10 c compared to the bare soil surface the model indicated that the residue mulch attenuated shortwave radiation and maintained a relatively higher water content which increased soil heat capacity and limited increases in surface soil temperature compared to the bare soil however nighttime surface soil temperatures were similar for bare soil and soil under the residue mulch although corn canopy closure would be expected to overshadow cc effects on soil temperature cc residues could help reduce warming of the soil surface during periods of water stress later in the growing season corn leaves roll or curl in response to water stress to reduce light interception transpiration and leaf dehydration kadioglu and terzi 2007 thereby allowing more solar radiation to reach the soil surface as soil water continues to be depleted leaf roll begins earlier each day extending the duration of soil surface exposure to direct solar radiation shading of the soil surface and low thermal conductivity of cc residues inhibit heat transfer between the soil and the atmosphere and act as a physical barrier to vapor transfer from the soil to the overlying air layer sauer et al 1998 the combined effects would keep soils cooler compared to soils without cc residues 3 4 soil water storage soil water storage the total amount of water in the soil profile was used to compare responses among systems crop available water is the amount of soil water between the lower limit of crop soil water extraction and the drained upper limit using measurements of volumetric water content during extended dry periods we estimated the lower limit of extractable water to be about 59 mm for the soil profile 0 862 mm similarly using extended wet periods we determined the drained upper limit to be about 342 mm of water thus the amount of plant available water at the drained upper limit is about 283 mm soil water storage occasionally exceeded the drained upper limit fig 3 those occasions were mostly during rainfall events late in the corn growing season periods where the whole profile was approaching the lower limit of crop extractable water occurred near the end of 2019 profile sws remained above the lower limit during the growing season in all years within this context the remaining discussion on sws provides an indication of system effects on plant available water profile sws was variable across the corn growing season each year fig 3 the system level means for sws are presented for each year in table 6 differences due to time were significant table 5 with weather variability and crop development through time contributing factors to this effect average sws was not different among systems in 2017 2018 and 2020 the interaction between system and date in 2019 were due to system differences at variable times in this drought year in 2017 and 2018 cc systems had 20 mm greater sws compared to nc systems in 2019 and 2020 similar trends were observed but were not significant table 6 the average 10 20 mm greater water storage for cc systems would be expected to help delay crop water stress by 2 5 5 days during prolonged periods without rainfall anapalli et al 2019 variable effects of cc on sws in no till corn have been reported by others for example rye cc before corn have generally been found to increase sws but effects vary over the growing season basche et al 2016 among years qi et al 2011a and between study sites daigh et al 2014 in maryland cc treatments rye vetch rye vetch or no cc control with comparable termination and corn planting dates to our study generally maintained greater surface sws in coastal plain silt loams beginning in early summer relative to nc controls clark et al 2007 1997 they found 20 80 mm greater sws with cc when corn reached the v5 growth stage clark et al 2007 1997 however differences in seasonal average sws were small ranging from 26 37 mm over two years clark et al 1997 profile sws changes over time for each of the cc systems are shown in fig 3 the data reveal early season drying of the soil profile in june and july of each year as the combination of limited rainfall and corn water use depleted a large portion of the stored soil water during the period of soil water depletion sws in systems 3 and 4 nc reached a lower level compared to systems 5 and 6 cc in 2017 and 2018 prior to rain recharging the soil profile figs 1 and 3 soil profile recharge occurred in late july in 2017 2018 and 2020 the more even distribution of rainfall for 2020 fig 1 buffered the depletion of soil profile water compared to the other years fig 3 similar trends in sws were observed in corn soybean rotations in iowa following extended periods of below average rainfall followed by soil water recharge with increased precipitation qi et al 2011a they reported greater average sws when a rye cc was grown prior to corn or soybean as observed in our study the buffering effect of cc residues on the seasonal minimum sws was variable however presence of the rye cc resulted in greater values of minimum sws in 2 of 3 years of their study in contrast cc residues had no effect on sws in minnesota during two years of corn silage production which the authors attributed to early growing season rainfall replenishing cc water use in one year and insufficient cc biomass production or too little growing season rainfall in the other krueger et al 2011 the severity of drought conditions in 2019 are apparent from the continuous decline in sws fig 3 in 2019 a trend for more rapid drying of the soil profile earlier in the growing season was observed for systems 3 and 4 nc compared to systems 5 and 6 cc which may reflect both the later planting date in the cc systems and cc residues decreasing evaporation from the soil surface the slight increase in sws in mid july 2019 appears to be greater in the cc systems which may reflect more favorable infiltration a similar pattern of sws depletion was observed in minnesota during a season with below average growing season precipitation krueger et al 2011 in contrast during the midwest drought in 2012 rye cc residues maintained greater sws during the early growing season daigh et al 2014 qi et al 2011a attributed increased sws with a rye cc to root growth possibly increasing soil porosity and infiltration and to soil surface cover by rye residue reducing evaporation between corn or soybean rows 3 5 estimated evapotranspiration patterns of cumulative ete were similar across systems within a corn growing season and ranged from 200 to 250 mm depending on the year fig 4 these values are within the range reported for no till corn et in mid atlantic coastal plain soils roygard et al 2002 differences in cumulative ete among the systems were limited table 7 significant interactions between cumgdd and system were present for 2017 2018 and 2019 indicating intermittent differences in cumulative ete among the systems table 7 that can be seen in fig 4 as divergence of the plotted values the trends suggest periodically lower cumulative ete during the growing season for cc systems systems 5 and 6 compared to nc systems systems 3 and 4 this difference was most apparent in 2018 and 2019 differences based on contrast statements among the systems at specific corn development stages were significant only in 2018 table 8 when directly comparing nc and cc systems significant differences were only found in 2018 table 9 when lower ete in cc systems was primarily a result of the lower ete in system 5 table 8 surprisingly we found no differences among systems at v6 for any year even though we expected evaporation to be reduced in cc compared to nc systems due to soil surface cover as has been previously reported balwinder singh et al 2011 bond and willis 1969 unger and parker 1976 yang et al 2020 while the trends in the data in other years indicate lower cumulative ete for the cc systems table 9 the differences were not large enough to reach the level of significance choosing to investigate differences at specific corn development stages limited our ability to identify other times in the growing season where differences between nc and cc systems might have been significant similar to our results few differences in estimated et are reported in field studies assessing the effects of cc residues and surface mulches across a range of soils climates and cropping systems alfonso et al 2020 balwinder singh et al 2011 gabriel et al 2012 li et al 2021 tolk et al 1999 yang et al 2020 cover crop residues reduced corn crop et by an average of 6 in 50 and 80 year simulations of a corn soybean rotation in mississippi li et al 2021 yang et al 2020 and crop et by 3 in a 40 year simulation of a corn soybean rotation in iowa qi et al 2011b these results are consistent with the small effect of cover cropping on et in humid regions revealed in a meta analysis of 117 studies across a range of climates and geographic locations j wang et al 2021 3 6 estimated infiltration similar to the results with cumulative ete differences in cumulative infe were primarily related to changes over time with limited differences among systems table 7 and fig 5 system by date interactions were present in 2019 and 2020 cumulative infe was lowest in 2019 the driest year table 2 and fig 1 and greatest in 2020 fig 5 the greater infe in 2020 is surprising since total rainfall was greater in 2018 rainfall in 2020 was more evenly distributed compared to 2018 fig 1 the intense rainfall events late in 2018 maintained high water contents and probably resulted in drainage below the soil profile which we could not quantify also the greater infe in 2020 may relate to sufficient soil drying between rainfall events that allowed changes in soil water content to be detected and credited to infiltration estimated differences in infe between nc and cc systems were inconsistent and predominantly nonsignificant table 11 significant differences between nc and cc systems were only observed in 2019 on 1 september where cumulative infiltration was 23 mm greater for cc systems compared to nc systems the presence of cc residues has been shown to enhance infiltration in most soils unger and vigil 1998 rankoth et al 2021 found that soil water recharge for missouri claypan soils was greater in cc compared to nc systems cover crop soils maintained 1 7 and 2 8 more water compared with nc soils during corn years at 10 and 20 cm depth respectively and 4 2 and 3 1 more water during soybean years respectively similarly chalise et al 2018 reported 80 greater soil water infiltration following a cc compared with nc in a silt loam soil in brookings sd mitchell et al 2015 2017 found 2 8 times greater soil water infiltration in a clay soil following a cc compared with nc in san joaquin valley california variability in infiltration response could be related to off season changes in porosity and soil structure due to the weak structural stability of coarser textured soils steele et al 2012 observed a pattern of decreased bulk density and increased air penetration water infiltration and hydraulic conductivity during the season following a rye cc compared to a control soil for two maryland coastal plain soils similar to the soils in our study they concluded from the temporal variability of soil physical properties that timing of single point in time measurements was critical to the conclusions reached alvarez et al 2017 found in a meta analysis of cc effects on soils and subsequent crops in the pampas region of argentina that infiltration was enhanced around 36 by use of cc in 82 of 22 treatment comparisons in half of the comparisons the increase in infiltration exceeded 25 mm h 1 and were greatest for soils with low infiltration rates carreker et al 1968 reported average infiltration rates for years eight through ten of a continuous corn study on a typical piedmont soil in georgia three year average infiltration rates were 3 8 and 2 8 cm hr 1 in the spring and 8 5 and 5 8 cm hr 1 in the fall with and without a rye cc respectively the more favorable responses for infiltration cited above occurred in heavier textured soils where organic matter inputs have been reported to have a greater effect on soil aggregation and soil structure bronick and lal 2005 chalise et al 2018 indicated that the reason for higher infiltration rates with cc in their study was probably due to improved soil structure with more and continuous macro and micro pores root channels and less compaction they cited previous work by osborne et al 2014 from the same experimental plots that showed greater stability of soil aggregates and smaller erodible fraction for cc treatments compared with nc treatments using the information on cumulative infe for september 1 from table 10 and cumulative rainfall since planting the fraction of rainfall estimated as inf was 0 36 0 30 0 33 and 0 60 for nc systems and 0 42 0 39 0 53 and 0 61 for cc systems for 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the four year average fraction of rainfall as infe was 0 40 for nc systems and 0 49 for cc systems the loam soils at the research site are conducive to rapid infiltration while the minimal slope limits substantial runoff our deepest soil water measurements were slightly above the depth of the drain tiles leaving a portion of the soil profile unaccounted for in our sws estimates we also had no way to determine losses to drainage consequently unmeasured drainage losses when the soil profile was close to saturation are a likely source of error in our estimates of infe this in turn contributed to our low estimates of rainfall capture using a daily time step for sws values may have also contributed to not fully capturing infe particularly for small rainfall events although a more finite estimation of infiltration may have been obtained from shorter time steps determination of infe on a daily basis was useful for illustrating differences among nc and cc systems 3 7 corn yields and water use efficiency yields averaged 9 48 mg ha 1 across systems in 2018 and were lower p 0 0069 than in the other three years 2017 12 0 2019 11 8 and 2020 12 1 mg ha 1 in 2018 early season drought coupled with late season cloudy conditions resulting from high rainfall likely contributed to lower yields though both 2017 and 2018 suffered periods of extended dry conditions early in the growing season greater cumulative rainfall during the latter part of the growing season in 2018 may have also led to greater n leaching reduced n availability and concomitant yield losses relative to 2017 corn yields averaged across the four years were 10 7 10 7 11 8 and 12 3 mg ha 1 for systems 3 4 5 and 6 respectively yields were not different between systems 3 and 4 or between systems 5 and 6 corn yields averaged across the four years were lower in nc systems 10 7 mg ha 1 compared to cc systems 12 1 mg ha 1 p 0 001 comparisons between nc systems 3 and 4 and cc systems 5 and 6 systems were significant for 2017 2018 and 2019 both increased water availability and greater synchrony between n availability and crop uptake probably contributed to the greater yields in the cc systems though fertilizer application rates were adjusted for legume n contributions n mineralization from legume and grass cover crop residues would likely have occurred later in the growing season when corn n demand was greater in contrast the nc systems had fewer biomass n inputs to soil organic matter and had a greater potential for leaching losses of fertilizer n and consequent reduced n availability various researchers have shown increases and decreases in corn yields following cc in north carolina crimson clover depleted soil water in the surface 15 cm of a norfolk sandy loam soil by 28 and 55 in two years and reduced corn yields 0 5 mg ha 1 and 0 9 mg ha 1 ewing et al 1991 in contrast clark et al 2007 found that spring soil moisture 0 20 cm following several cc was greater than or equal to the no cover controls throughout the spring and summer for corn grown on a mattapex silt loam coastal plain soil in maryland they observed that corn grain yield was greater following a hairy vetch compared to a vetch rye mixture or pure rye the three cc treatments provided n fertilizer equivalence of about 80 15 and 50 kg n ha 1 poffenbarger et al 2015 observed that a rye hairy vetch mixture provided 136 and 68 kg n ha 1 in two years on fields near the site of our study with similar soils this was 30 40 kg n ha 1 more than with a rye cc alone and 60 kg n ha 1 less than following pure hairy vetch most studies only account for n contributions from cc above ground biomass in addition to those contributions root biomass can contribute additional n of 25 for rye and 10 for vetch shipley et al 1992 these results point to the potential dual benefit of the cc used in our study corn yields and cumulative ete at the end of each year were used to estimate water use efficiency wue at the field production scale unlike wue measured at the leaf level that are snapshots in time seconds to minutes field production based wue integrates plant responses over a growing season dietzel et al 2016 hoover et al 2022 because soil water measurements did not begin immediately at corn planting due to the time required for sensor installation these values do not include a portion of the early growing season but do provide a basis for comparison among systems we acknowledge that the differences in planting dates between nc and cc may have confounded differences in soil water availability at planting with differences in wue for example prior to cc termination both evaporation and transpiration would lead to greater soil water losses in the cc systems relative to the evaporative losses alone in the nc systems however the magnitude of these differences was likely moderated by corn water use in the nc systems following emergence during the same period cc systems were only subject to evaporative losses following cc termination evaporative losses in the cc systems would be lowered by interception of solar radiation and reduction of windspeed by the cc residues relative to the predominately bare soil in the nc systems earlier planting and corn development in the nc systems would be expected to result in greater corn biomass and transpiration relative to the cc systems on a given date however this effect did not persist through the entire growing season as evidenced by greater black layer corn biomass in the cc systems data not shown differences in wue were present due to cc p 0 0059 but not for years p 0 1461 or the interaction between year and system p 0 6027 this is in contrast to long term modelling results which found that system level water use efficiency varies across years due to differences in rainfall dietzel et al 2016 yang et al 2020 however the range of annual cumulative rainfall during this study fell within the range classified as normal years by yang et al 2020 with the exception of systems 3 and 4 in 2018 in addition dietzel et al 2016 found that wue was similar among years with comparable amounts of rainfall to our study site optimal corn wue in iowa was found to occur at 430 mm of precipitation dietzel et al 2016 water use efficiency ranged from 4 8 to 6 0 kg m 3 across the four years of our study and averaged 4 8 4 6 5 6 and 5 5 kg m 3 for systems 3 4 5 and 6 respectively system 5 had greater wue than systems 3 and 4 while system 6 was only different from system 4 cover crop systems averaged 0 86 kg m 3 greater wue compared to the nc systems across the four years when evaluated for each year differences between nc and cc systems were significant in each year except 2020 differences were 1 3 0 9 1 1 and 0 13 kg m 3 for 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively cover crop residues can increase wue of succeeding crops approximately 5 j wang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 but the effect of surface mulching on wue and yield is variable due to differences in mulch thickness soil moisture and et among years balwinder singh et al 2011 tolk et al 1999 greater yields and wue for systems with cc prior to corn could be the result of a combination of cc effects on soil n and water availability researchers have shown that when sufficient fertilizer n is present yield increases associated with cc are more likely the result of favorable soil moisture temperature physical conditions or other rotation effects clark et al 1995 smith et al 1987 decker et al 1994 reported that corn grain yields increased 2 mg ha 1 on a coastal plain silt loam and 0 5 mg ha 1 on a piedmont silt loam soil following legume cc when n was not limiting similarly clark et al 1995 hypothesize that this yield advantage was largely due to more favorable water availability because of heavier mulch with mid or late kill treatments for example soil moisture was 14 greater in well fertilized 180 kg ha 1 corn with rye and rye vetch cc residues relative to nc plots following two weeks with less than 10 mm of rainfall clark et al 2007 the authors note that corn in the nc plots were visibly water stressed during dry periods relative to the cover cropped plots following 122 mm of rain soil moisture increased by 64 in the cc soil compared to only 38 in nc plots in addition differences in corn planting dates can result in water stress impacts occurring at different corn growth stages depending on early season rainfall clark et al 1997 for example over two years with below average early season rainfall early planted corn suffered drought stress during silking while timely rainfall increased soil water availability during silking of later planted corn clark et al 1997 in cc systems there is potential for greater synchrony of n availability because grass cover crops scavenge n from the soil profile and immobilize n released from legumes and soil organic matter mineralization of this n from grasses occurs later in the corn growing season when n demand is high poffenbarger et al 2015 the nc systems have less crop biomass inputs less residues for immobilization of soil mineral n or fertilizer n and may have greater potential for leaching losses of fertilizer n those avenues of n cycling were not measured in this study but could be consider contributing factors to the greater yields in the cc systems 4 summary and conclusions beyond biomass production the effects of cc on soil moisture depend on a number of interacting factors including soil physical properties soil texture infiltration rate susceptibility to surface crusting antecedent soil moisture rainfall amount and intensity and topographical factors like slope and aspect these interacting factors result in variable effects of cc on soil water status from day to day year to year and site to site our research was conducted on coastal plain soils with good infiltration a factor which most likely influenced the magnitude of our results the cumulative effects of no till management with or without a cc prior to the corn phase of the rotation resulted in only modest differences in sws infiltration and evapotranspiration that varied each year we observed small and variable effects of cc on seasonal average summer soil temperatures much more definitive differences in sws were observed with an average 10 20 mm greater season average sws for cc systems compared to nc systems this difference could help delay corn water stress by 2 5 5 days during prolonged periods without rainfall the trends in the data indicated lower cumulative ete for cc systems although the differences were often not large enough to reach the level of significance similar to the results with cumulative ete differences in cumulative infe were limited among systems the four year average fraction of rainfall captured as infe was 0 40 for nc and 0 49 for cc systems indicating greater rainfall capture for systems with cc prior to corn adding cc prior to corn also increased water use efficiency by nearly 1 kg m 3 more importantly the yield benefit of interseeding cc prior to corn was an increase in yields 10 6 mg ha 1 vs 12 1 mg ha 1 return from this increased yield would more than offset the cost of cc establishment of 100 ha 1 myers et al 2019 given that 1 5

report greater average weekly sws in the top 60 cm of soil in an iowa no till corn crop which they attribute to reduced soil surface evaporation and increased infiltration due to surface rye cc residues in contrast in a minnesota study where there was limited rye biomass production and below average rainfall the rye cc resulted in no effect on sws relative to no cc in a continuous corn silage system krueger et al 2011 when drought occurs during the cash crop production period the favorable effects of rye residues on sws depends on capturing early season rainfall and having sufficient rye biomass to reduce evaporation daigh et al 2014 clark et al 2007 reported greater soil moisture for late killed rye and rye vetch cc compared to late killed vetch early killed rye or

two representative 0 5 m2 sub areas in each plot biomass was clipped at the soil surface and dried for 10 14 days at 60 c and weighed harvested biomass samples included cc species plus any weeds present usually none an experimental objective at ccsp is to manage each system based on farmer practices in the mid atlantic states many producers in the region do not use cc or kill their cc early to be able to plant near the end of april or beginning of may growers who maximize cc biomass production usually plant 10 15 days later than producers who do not use cc corn in the nc systems 3 and 4

2017 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively soil water measurements in the corn phase of the rotation began in the spring of 2017 because we only focus on the corn phase our experimental design reduces to a completely randomized block with 2 2017 or 3 2018 2020 replications because all rotation phases are present every year each crop is grown in different plots over three consecutive years in the fourth year cash crops return to the same plots they were grown on in year one 2 2 weather data corn growth stages and potential evapotranspiration weather data were collected at a weather station located less than 80 m from ccsp air temperature rainfall relative humidity solar radiation at the surface of the ground and windspeed data from the weather station were used to calculate daily values air temperature data were used to calculate growing degree days gdd c as described in abendroth et al 2011 corn development stages were estimated based on the accumulation of gdd using 10 c and 30 c as minimum and maximum optimum temperatures for corn growth and development abendroth et al 2011 developmental stages were adjusted to include emergence occurring at 105 gdd from planting daily gdd values were summed to give cumulative gdd cumgdd c daily growing degree days were calculated as follows gdd tmin tmax 2 10 tmin minimum daily air temperature if temperature is less than 10 c use 10 as

hourly 2017 or 15 min 2018 2020 averages using campbell scientific cr206x and cr1000 dataloggers campbell scientific inc logan ut sensors were installed in non traffic rows halfway between corn rows they were installed in a vertical orientation and spaced 80 120 cm apart the locations for sensor placement were established using gps so that they were approximately halfway between mapped drain tiles allred et al 2018 to minimize effects of drainage on soil water measurements as much as possible installation of soil water sensors occurred as soon as possible after corn planting 2 4 data qaqc raw volumetric water content data were evaluated for quality using routines from the international soil moisture network qaqc approach dorigo et al 2021 2013 the procedure applied simple threshold checks and evaluated trends in the time series data and their first and second derivatives spurious data were flagged and compared to nearby data in addition all data were graphed and evaluated visually short periods of missing data that occurred when no rainfall fell were replaced using the expand procedure in sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc sas inst inc 2019 to interpolate missing values with a linear function where missing data occurred in association with rainfall events data from the other treatments in the same replication were used to estimate the missing data based on regressions estimated from the entire cropping season this approach was used for missing surface sensor data in systems 5 and 6 in 2017 for the period from 23 july to 10 august that occurred due to the failure of a data logger in replication 3 all other times when sensors or a data logger failed were of sufficiently short duration that interpolation was used to fill in the missing data interpolations were carried out for individual sensors prior to averaging data for the day 2 5 estimation of soil water storage estimated evapotranspiration and estimated infiltration daily averages of volumetric water content and soil temperature were calculated from hourly 2017 or 15 minute data 2018 through 2020 data from multiple sensors within a depth were averaged after data cleaning soil water storage was estimated by multiplying daily volumetric water content times the horizon depth to get millimeters of water calculation of sws assumed that measurements within a depth interval were representative of that horizon depth interval millimeters of water for each depth were summed to obtain whole profile 0 862 mm sws the daily change in sws was used to estimate evapotranspiration ete and infiltration infe as described by sadeghi et al 2007 this simple approach is based on the change in sws for the soil profile between the current and previous day each day is considered to start at 5 am daily negative change in sws was designated as ete daily losses which are an indication of actual et positive changes were considered infiltration gains in sws which because they are based on daily values may slightly underestimate actual infiltration runoff and deep percolation losses were considered negligible for the rainfall conditions in 2017 2019 and 2020 in 2018 losses to drainage most likely occurred in the later part of the growing season when rainfall exceeded the monthly average for september by 142 mm fig 1 at this point in the growing season cc residues probably had limited influence on evaporation and we assumed losses to drainage would be similar among all the systems therefore drainage losses this late in the growing season were considered to have little impact on our analysis in 2018 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted within the sas enterprise guide platform version 8 3 sas institute inc 2020 cover crop biomass corn yield and

linear mixed models approach with proc glimmix in sas stat 15 1 sas institute inc 2019 analyses were carried out separately for each year system was considered a fixed effect and replication and the replication by system interaction were included as random effects replication variance was allowed to be zero when computed to be so date was treated as a repeated measures effect in the analysis of soil temperature sws and infe thermal units cumgdd were used as the repeated effect in the analysis of ete the residual option was included in the random statement to model the r side covariance where appropriate compound symmetry autoregressive and spatial power covariance structures were compared to determine the best covariance structure based on the one with lowest corrected akaike s information criterion and where proc glimmix computed variance for all covariance parameters except the replication and replication by system terms stroup et al 2018 lsmeans statements were used to estimate corn growing season average soil temperature and sws and determine their differences among cc systems in each growing season differences in ete and infe among systems at specific stages of corn development were evaluated using lsmestimate statements for ete differences were evaluated at approximately v6 v10 vt and r1 based on cumulative gdd values of approximately 575 840 1235 and 1400 respectively these development stages represent early mid and late vegetative and silking periods for infe differences among systems were evaluated on july 1 august 1 and september 1 in addition to the direct comparisons among systems a test was constructed to compare nc versus cc e g system 3 system 4 2 vs system 5 system 6 2 differences were considered significant at α 0 10 p 0 10 for soil sensor related measurements due to the inherent spatial variability of soils 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather monthly average temperature and rainfall data are provided in table 4 in general monthly average air temperatures for june through september during the four years were similar to the 10 year average average air temperatures in may were slightly below normal for 2017 and 2020 and slightly above average for 2018 and 2019 rainfall amounts varied considerably from the 10 year average depending on the month and year rainfall was below the 10 year average in june and september 2017 june august and september 2019 and may 2020 in 2018 monthly rainfall was above 10 year averages in all four months however the monthly rainfall totals do not adequately identify the long periods of limited rainfall in each year in particular in 2018 limited rainfall is apparent in fig 1 from june 1 to july 21 from may 10 the date of corn planting in the nc systems through may 31 the day after planting in the cc systems there was 174 mm rainfall in contrast from june 1 through july 20 108 mm rain fell with a majority of that 76 mm occurring on june 3 because of this critical early stages of corn growth and development occurred during a period of limited infrequent rainfall and higher temperatures similar early growing season periods of limited rainfall were observed in 2017 and 2019 the impact on crop yields were greater in 2018 than in the other years see below cumulative gdd and cumulative rainfall from corn planting to harvest for the four years are shown in fig 1 patterns for cumgdd illustrate the effects of delaying corn planting in systems 5 and 6 compared to systems 3 and 4 cumulative gdd for silking 1400 occurred in mid august to early september accumulation of heat units during the two weeks following corn planting was slower for systems 3 and 4 compared to systems 5 and 6 due to the earlier planting date accumulation of gdd for cc and nc systems was the same in 2020 when all systems were planted on the same date differences in rainfall amounts and distribution during the corn growing seasons depended on planting date differences rainfall during the corn growing season ranged from 236 mm 2019 to 805 mm 2018 table 2 and fig 1 rainfall in 2018 was more than two times greater than the 10 yr average of 347 mm with much of that rain occurring after late july rainfall in 2019 was 86 of the 10 yr average for nc systems and 68 of the 10 yr average for cc systems estimated from the date of planting 3 2 cover crop biomass at corn planting cover crop biomass in systems 5 and 6 ranged from less than 500 kg ha 1 to over 6000 kg ha 1 during the four years in system 5 rye vetch crimson clover cc biomass prior to corn planting was 3248 sd 323 3697 sd 838 463 sd 362 and 1611 sd 416 kg ha 1 in 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively for the same years cc biomass prior to corn planting in system 6 red clover rye was 3939 sd 533 4279 sd 344 4478 sd 847 and 6011 sd 64 kg ha 1 cover crop establishment in systems 5 and 6 in 2017 and 2018 was good and they produced similar amounts of biomass in contrast there were differences in biomass production in 2019 and 2020 that were due to the composition of the species mixtures and weather related challenges planting the interseeded cc planting the rye legume mixture into dcs in system 5 was difficult in 2018 due to wet conditions and in 2019 due to dry conditions both negatively impacting stand establishment and subsequent biomass production spring interseeding march of red clover in system 6 helped facilitate better stand establishment and growth in all four years wheat and soybean crop residue biomass on the soil surface at the time of corn planting in systems 3 and 4 was not determined however visual observations found these to be limited wheat straw is baled after summer harvest and soybean residues tend to decompose rapidly under the mild humid winters of the mid atlantic region residues from these crops provided less than 30 soil cover at the time of corn planting 3 3 soil temperature surface soil temperatures in the four systems are shown in fig 2 for each of the four years reponses across the growing season were similar for the four systems with variations in the data related primarily to sunny and cloudy days table 5 significant system and system by date interactions were present in 2018 and 2019 table 6 soils were noticeably warmer in cc systems compared to nc systems early in the corn growing season in 2018 this was due to less corn canopy in the cc systems a result of the later planting date during the extended dry period discussed above in contrast soil temperatures in 2019 the driest year of the study tended to be lower in cc systems compared to nc systems later in the growing season this may have been a result of greater corn canopy in the cc system the vertical orientation of our sensors reduced our ability to detect influences of the cover crop residues on temperatures near the soil surface 0 5 cm our sensors integrated temperature measurements for the 0 12 cm or 0 15 cm soil depth others have shown that cc residues have a small but variable effect on seasonal average summer soil temperatures blanco canqui and ruis 2020 vann et al 2018 with effects occurring early in the growing season daigh et al 2014 horton et al 1996 z wang et al 2021 used a process based model to simulate rye residue mulch effects on diurnal soil surface water and thermal dynamics soil surface temperatures 0 5 cm with a mulch layer were reduced by 1 5 c compared to the air temperature and 10 c compared to the bare soil surface the model indicated that the residue mulch attenuated shortwave radiation and maintained a relatively higher water content which increased soil heat capacity and limited increases in surface soil temperature compared to the bare soil however nighttime surface soil temperatures were similar for bare soil and soil under the residue mulch although corn canopy closure would be expected to overshadow cc effects on soil temperature cc residues could help reduce warming of the soil surface during periods of water stress later in the growing season corn leaves roll or curl in response to water stress to reduce light interception transpiration and leaf dehydration kadioglu and terzi 2007 thereby allowing more solar radiation to reach the soil surface as soil water continues to be depleted leaf roll begins earlier each day extending the duration of soil surface exposure to direct solar radiation shading of the soil surface and low thermal conductivity of cc residues inhibit heat transfer between the soil and the atmosphere and act as a physical barrier to vapor transfer from the soil to the overlying air layer sauer et al 1998 the combined effects would keep soils cooler compared to soils without cc residues 3 4 soil water storage soil water storage the total amount of water in the soil profile was used to compare responses among systems crop available water is the amount of soil water between the lower limit of crop soil water extraction and the drained upper limit using measurements of volumetric water content during extended dry periods we estimated the lower limit of extractable water to be about 59 mm for the soil profile 0 862 mm similarly using extended wet periods we determined the drained upper limit to be about 342 mm of water thus the amount of plant available water at the drained upper limit is about 283 mm soil water storage occasionally exceeded the drained upper limit fig 3 those occasions were mostly during rainfall events late in the corn growing season periods where the whole profile was approaching the lower limit of crop extractable water occurred near the end of 2019 profile sws remained above the lower limit during the growing season in all years within this context the remaining discussion on sws provides an indication of system effects on plant available water profile sws was variable across the corn growing season each year fig 3 the system level means for sws are presented for each year in table 6 differences due to time were significant table 5 with weather variability and crop development through time contributing factors to this effect average sws was not different among systems in 2017 2018 and 2020 the interaction between system and date in 2019 were due to system differences at variable times in this drought year in 2017 and 2018 cc systems had 20 mm greater sws compared to nc systems in 2019 and 2020 similar trends were observed but were not significant table 6 the average 10 20 mm greater water storage for cc systems would be expected to help delay crop water stress by 2 5 5 days during prolonged periods without rainfall anapalli et al 2019 variable effects of cc on sws in no till corn have been reported by others for example rye cc before corn have generally been found to increase sws but effects vary over the growing season basche et al 2016 among years qi et al 2011a and between study sites daigh et al 2014 in maryland cc treatments rye vetch rye vetch or no cc control with comparable termination and corn planting dates to our study generally maintained greater surface sws in coastal plain silt loams beginning in early summer relative to nc controls clark et al 2007 1997 they found 20 80 mm greater sws with cc when corn reached the v5 growth stage clark et al 2007 1997 however differences in seasonal average sws were small ranging from 26 37 mm over two years clark et al 1997 profile sws changes over time for each of the cc systems are shown in fig 3 the data reveal early season drying of the soil profile in june and july of each year as the combination of limited rainfall and corn water use depleted a large portion of the stored soil water during the period of soil water depletion sws in systems 3 and 4 nc reached a lower level compared to systems 5 and 6 cc in 2017 and 2018 prior to rain recharging the soil profile figs 1 and 3 soil profile recharge occurred in late july in 2017 2018 and 2020 the more even distribution of rainfall for 2020 fig 1 buffered the depletion of soil profile water compared to the other years fig 3 similar trends in sws were observed in corn soybean rotations in iowa following extended periods of below average rainfall followed by soil water recharge with increased precipitation qi et al 2011a they reported greater average sws when a rye cc was grown prior to corn or soybean as observed in our study the buffering effect of cc residues on the seasonal minimum sws was variable however presence of the rye cc resulted in greater values of minimum sws in 2 of 3 years of their study in contrast cc residues had no effect on sws in minnesota during two years of corn silage production which the authors attributed to early growing season rainfall replenishing cc water use in one year and insufficient cc biomass production or too little growing season rainfall in the other krueger et al 2011 the severity of drought conditions in 2019 are apparent from the continuous decline in sws fig 3 in 2019 a trend for more rapid drying of the soil profile earlier in the growing season was observed for systems 3 and 4 nc compared to systems 5 and 6 cc which may reflect both the later planting date in the cc systems and cc residues decreasing evaporation from the soil surface the slight increase in sws in mid july 2019 appears to be greater in the cc systems which may reflect more favorable infiltration a similar pattern of sws depletion was observed in minnesota during a season with below average growing season precipitation krueger et al 2011 in contrast during the midwest drought in 2012 rye cc residues maintained greater sws during the early growing season daigh et al 2014 qi et al 2011a attributed increased sws with a rye cc to root growth possibly increasing soil porosity and infiltration and to soil surface cover by rye residue reducing evaporation between corn or soybean rows 3 5 estimated evapotranspiration patterns of cumulative ete were similar across systems within a corn growing season and ranged from 200 to 250 mm depending on the year fig 4 these values are within the range reported for no till corn et in mid atlantic coastal plain soils roygard et al 2002 differences in cumulative ete among the systems were limited table 7 significant interactions between cumgdd and system were present for 2017 2018 and 2019 indicating intermittent differences in cumulative ete among the systems table 7 that can be seen in fig 4 as divergence of the plotted values the trends suggest periodically lower cumulative ete during the growing season for cc systems systems 5 and 6 compared to nc systems systems 3 and 4 this difference was most apparent in 2018 and 2019 differences based on contrast statements among the systems at specific corn development stages were significant only in 2018 table 8 when directly comparing nc and cc systems significant differences were only found in 2018 table 9 when lower ete in cc systems was primarily a result of the lower ete in system 5 table 8 surprisingly we found no differences among systems at v6 for any year even though we expected evaporation to be reduced in cc compared to nc systems due to soil surface cover as has been previously reported balwinder singh et al 2011 bond and willis 1969 unger and parker 1976 yang et al 2020 while the trends in the data in other years indicate lower cumulative ete for the cc systems table 9 the differences were not large enough to reach the level of significance choosing to investigate differences at specific corn development stages limited our ability to identify other times in the growing season where differences between nc and cc systems might have been significant similar to our results few differences in estimated et are reported in field studies assessing the effects of cc residues and surface mulches across a range of soils climates and cropping systems alfonso et al 2020 balwinder singh et al 2011 gabriel et al 2012 li et al 2021 tolk et al 1999 yang et al 2020 cover crop residues reduced corn crop et by an average of 6 in 50 and 80 year simulations of a corn soybean rotation in mississippi li et al 2021 yang et al 2020 and crop et by 3 in a 40 year simulation of a corn soybean rotation in iowa qi et al 2011b these results are consistent with the small effect of cover cropping on et in humid regions revealed in a meta analysis of 117 studies across a range of climates and geographic locations j wang et al 2021 3 6 estimated infiltration similar to the results with cumulative ete differences in cumulative infe were primarily related to changes over time with limited differences among systems table 7 and fig 5 system by date interactions were present in 2019 and 2020 cumulative infe was lowest in 2019 the driest year table 2 and fig 1 and greatest in 2020 fig 5 the greater infe in 2020 is surprising since total rainfall was greater in 2018 rainfall in 2020 was more evenly distributed compared to 2018 fig 1 the intense rainfall events late in 2018 maintained high water contents and probably resulted in drainage below the soil profile which we could not quantify also the greater infe in 2020 may relate to sufficient soil drying between rainfall events that allowed changes in soil water content to be detected and credited to infiltration estimated differences in infe between nc and cc systems were inconsistent and predominantly nonsignificant table 11 significant differences between nc and cc systems were only observed in 2019 on 1 september where cumulative infiltration was 23 mm greater for cc systems compared to nc systems the presence of cc residues has been shown to enhance infiltration in most soils unger and vigil 1998 rankoth et al 2021 found that soil water recharge for missouri claypan soils was greater in cc compared to nc systems cover crop soils maintained 1 7 and 2 8 more water compared with nc soils during corn years at 10 and 20 cm depth respectively and 4 2 and 3 1 more water during soybean years respectively similarly chalise et al 2018 reported 80 greater soil water infiltration following a cc compared with nc in a silt loam soil in brookings sd mitchell et al 2015 2017 found 2 8 times greater soil water infiltration in a clay soil following a cc compared with nc in san joaquin valley california variability in infiltration response could be related to off season changes in porosity and soil structure due to the weak structural stability of coarser textured soils steele et al 2012 observed a pattern of decreased bulk density and increased air penetration water infiltration and hydraulic conductivity during the season following a rye cc compared to a control soil for two maryland coastal plain soils similar to the soils in our study they concluded from the temporal variability of soil physical properties that timing of single point in time measurements was critical to the conclusions reached alvarez et al 2017 found in a meta analysis of cc effects on soils and subsequent crops in the pampas region of argentina that infiltration was enhanced around 36 by use of cc in 82 of 22 treatment comparisons in half of the comparisons the increase in infiltration exceeded 25 mm h 1 and were greatest for soils with low infiltration rates carreker et al 1968 reported average infiltration rates for years eight through ten of a continuous corn study on a typical piedmont soil in georgia three year average infiltration rates were 3 8 and 2 8 cm hr 1 in the spring and 8 5 and 5 8 cm hr 1 in the fall with and without a rye cc respectively the more favorable responses for infiltration cited above occurred in heavier textured soils where organic matter inputs have been reported to have a greater effect on soil aggregation and soil structure bronick and lal 2005 chalise et al 2018 indicated that the reason for higher infiltration rates with cc in their study was probably due to improved soil structure with more and continuous macro and micro pores root channels and less compaction they cited previous work by osborne et al 2014 from the same experimental plots that showed greater stability of soil aggregates and smaller erodible fraction for cc treatments compared with nc treatments using the information on cumulative infe for september 1 from table 10 and cumulative rainfall since planting the fraction of rainfall estimated as inf was 0 36 0 30 0 33 and 0 60 for nc systems and 0 42 0 39 0 53 and 0 61 for cc systems for 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the four year average fraction of rainfall as infe was 0 40 for nc systems and 0 49 for cc systems the loam soils at the research site are conducive to rapid infiltration while the minimal slope limits substantial runoff our deepest soil water measurements were slightly above the depth of the drain tiles leaving a portion of the soil profile unaccounted for in our sws estimates we also had no way to determine losses to drainage consequently unmeasured drainage losses when the soil profile was close to saturation are a likely source of error in our estimates of infe this in turn contributed to our low estimates of rainfall capture using a daily time step for sws values may have also contributed to not fully capturing infe particularly for small rainfall events although a more finite estimation of infiltration may have been obtained from shorter time steps determination of infe on a daily basis was useful for illustrating differences among nc and cc systems 3 7 corn yields and water use efficiency yields averaged 9 48 mg ha 1 across systems in 2018 and were lower p 0 0069 than in the other three years 2017 12 0 2019 11 8 and 2020 12 1 mg ha 1 in 2018 early season drought coupled with late season cloudy conditions resulting from high rainfall likely contributed to lower yields though both 2017 and 2018 suffered periods of extended dry conditions early in the growing season greater cumulative rainfall during the latter part of the growing season in 2018 may have also led to greater n leaching reduced n availability and concomitant yield losses relative to 2017 corn yields averaged across the four years were 10 7 10 7 11 8 and 12 3 mg ha 1 for systems 3 4 5 and 6 respectively yields were not different between systems 3 and 4 or between systems 5 and 6 corn yields averaged across the four years were lower in nc systems 10 7 mg ha 1 compared to cc systems 12 1 mg ha 1 p 0 001 comparisons between nc systems 3 and 4 and cc systems 5 and 6 systems were significant for 2017 2018 and 2019 both increased water availability and greater synchrony between n availability and crop uptake probably contributed to the greater yields in the cc systems though fertilizer application rates were adjusted for legume n contributions n mineralization from legume and grass cover crop residues would likely have occurred later in the growing season when corn n demand was greater in contrast the nc systems had fewer biomass n inputs to soil organic matter and had a greater potential for leaching losses of fertilizer n and consequent reduced n availability various researchers have shown increases and decreases in corn yields following cc in north carolina crimson clover depleted soil water in the surface 15 cm of a norfolk sandy loam soil by 28 and 55 in two years and reduced corn yields 0 5 mg ha 1 and 0 9 mg ha 1 ewing et al 1991 in contrast clark et al 2007 found that spring soil moisture 0 20 cm following several cc was greater than or equal to the no cover controls throughout the spring and summer for corn grown on a mattapex silt loam coastal plain soil in maryland they observed that corn grain yield was greater following a hairy vetch compared to a vetch rye mixture or pure rye the three cc treatments provided n fertilizer equivalence of about 80 15 and 50 kg n ha 1 poffenbarger et al 2015 observed that a rye hairy vetch mixture provided 136 and 68 kg n ha 1 in two years on fields near the site of our study with similar soils this was 30 40 kg n ha 1 more than with a rye cc alone and 60 kg n ha 1 less than following pure hairy vetch most studies only account for n contributions from cc above ground biomass in addition to those contributions root biomass can contribute additional n of 25 for rye and 10 for vetch shipley et al 1992 these results point to the potential dual benefit of the cc used in our study corn yields and cumulative ete at the end of each year were used to estimate water use efficiency wue at the field production scale unlike wue measured at the leaf level that are snapshots in time seconds to minutes field production based wue integrates plant responses over a growing season dietzel et al 2016 hoover et al 2022 because soil water measurements did not begin immediately at corn planting due to the time required for sensor installation these values do not include a portion of the early growing season but do provide a basis for comparison among systems we acknowledge that the differences in planting dates between nc and cc may have confounded differences in soil water availability at planting with differences in wue for example prior to cc termination both evaporation and transpiration would lead to greater soil water losses in the cc systems relative to the evaporative losses alone in the nc systems however the magnitude of these differences was likely moderated by corn water use in the nc systems following emergence during the same period cc systems were only subject to evaporative losses following cc termination evaporative losses in the cc systems would be lowered by interception of solar radiation and reduction of windspeed by the cc residues relative to the predominately bare soil in the nc systems earlier planting and corn development in the nc systems would be expected to result in greater corn biomass and transpiration relative to the cc systems on a given date however this effect did not persist through the entire growing season as evidenced by greater black layer corn biomass in the cc systems data not shown differences in wue were present due to cc p 0 0059 but not for years p 0 1461 or the interaction between year and system p 0 6027 this is in contrast to long term modelling results which found that system level water use efficiency varies across years due to differences in rainfall dietzel et al 2016 yang et al 2020 however the range of annual cumulative rainfall during this study fell within the range classified as normal years by yang et al 2020 with the exception of systems 3 and 4 in 2018 in addition dietzel et al 2016 found that wue was similar among years with comparable amounts of rainfall to our study site optimal corn wue in iowa was found to occur at 430 mm of precipitation dietzel et al 2016 water use efficiency ranged from 4 8 to 6 0 kg m 3 across the four years of our study and averaged 4 8 4 6 5 6 and 5 5 kg m 3 for systems 3 4 5 and 6 respectively system 5 had greater wue than systems 3 and 4 while system 6 was only different from system 4 cover crop systems averaged 0 86 kg m 3 greater wue compared to the nc systems across the four years when evaluated for each year differences between nc and cc systems were significant in each year except 2020 differences were 1 3 0 9 1 1 and 0 13 kg m 3 for 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively cover crop residues can increase wue of succeeding crops approximately 5 j wang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 but the effect of surface mulching on wue and yield is variable due to differences in mulch thickness soil moisture and et among years balwinder singh et al 2011 tolk et al 1999 greater yields and wue for systems with cc prior to corn could be the result of a combination of cc effects on soil n and water availability researchers have shown that when sufficient fertilizer n is present yield increases associated with cc are more likely the result of favorable soil moisture temperature physical conditions or other rotation effects clark et al 1995 smith et al 1987 decker et al 1994 reported that corn grain yields increased 2 mg ha 1 on a coastal plain silt loam and 0 5 mg ha 1 on a piedmont silt loam soil following legume cc when n was not limiting similarly clark et al 1995 hypothesize that this yield advantage was largely due to more favorable water availability because of heavier mulch with mid or late kill treatments for example soil moisture was 14 greater in well fertilized 180 kg ha 1 corn with rye and rye vetch cc residues relative to nc plots following two weeks with less than 10 mm of rainfall clark et al 2007 the authors note that corn in the nc plots were visibly water stressed during dry periods relative to the cover cropped plots following 122 mm of rain soil moisture increased by 64 in the cc soil compared to only 38 in nc plots in addition differences in corn planting dates can result in water stress impacts occurring at different corn growth stages depending on early season rainfall clark et al 1997 for example over two years with below average early season rainfall early planted corn suffered drought stress during silking while timely rainfall increased soil water availability during silking of later planted corn clark et al 1997 in cc systems there is potential for greater synchrony of n availability because grass cover crops scavenge n from the soil profile and immobilize n released from legumes and soil organic matter mineralization of this n from grasses occurs later in the corn growing season when n demand is high poffenbarger et al 2015 the nc systems have less crop biomass inputs less residues for immobilization of soil mineral n or fertilizer n and may have greater potential for leaching losses of fertilizer n those avenues of n cycling were not measured in this study but could be consider contributing factors to the greater yields in the cc systems 4 summary and conclusions beyond biomass production the effects of cc on soil moisture depend on a number of interacting factors including soil physical properties soil texture infiltration rate susceptibility to surface crusting antecedent soil moisture rainfall amount and intensity and topographical factors like slope and aspect these interacting factors result in variable effects of cc on soil water status from day to day year to year and site to site our research was conducted on coastal plain soils with good infiltration a factor which most likely influenced the magnitude of our results the cumulative effects of no till management with or without a cc prior to the corn phase of the rotation resulted in only modest differences in sws infiltration and evapotranspiration that varied each year we observed small and variable effects of cc on seasonal average summer soil temperatures much more definitive differences in sws were observed with an average 10 20 mm greater season average sws for cc systems compared to nc systems this difference could help delay corn water stress by 2 5 5 days during prolonged periods without rainfall the trends in the data indicated lower cumulative ete for cc systems although the differences were often not large enough to reach the level of significance similar to the results with cumulative ete differences in cumulative infe were limited among systems the four year average fraction of rainfall captured as infe was 0 40 for nc and 0 49 for cc systems indicating greater rainfall capture for systems with cc prior to corn adding cc prior to corn also increased water use efficiency by nearly 1 kg m 3 more importantly the yield benefit of interseeding cc prior to corn was an increase in yields 10 6 mg ha 1 vs 12 1 mg ha 1 return from this increased yield would more than offset the cost of cc establishment of 100 ha 1 myers et al 2019 given that 1 5

9096,soil water sensors sws have been widely researched and practiced for irrigation scheduling due to popularity of this approach there is a need for frequent reviews of the sws literature to keep the researchers extension professionals and end users updated and to help with defining and modifying future directions in addition existing literature reviews do not systematically report and summarize the results of previous studies to address this gap a systematic review was carried out to identify and analyze related literature published in the united states in the past two decades two focus areas were sws accuracy assessment and sws application in irrigation scheduling the results showed that sws accuracy was most susceptible to sensor calibration the reported root mean square errors had similar ranges and means among different technologies installation orientations and study environments compared to other scheduling methods sws based scheduling resulted in water saving with average amounts ranging from 1 when compared to canopy temperature methods to 38 in case of traditional approaches in addition sws based scheduling led to larger or similar yields compared to other scheduling methods texas and nebraska were the top two states in terms of the number of studies on sws accuracy and irrigation scheduling keywords accuracy literature review irrigation

water sensors sws have been recognized as one of the most commonly used approaches in implementing scientific irrigation scheduling taghvaeian et al 2020 a vast majority of these sensors in the last twenty years have been designed based on technologies relying on electrical resistivity and electromagnetic principles sensors based on electrical resistance indirectly measure soil water tension these sensors measure changes in electrical resistance in soil media which is calibrated against soil water tension from pressure plates or some other methods on the other hand sensors based on electromagnetic principles rely on dielectric properties of soil to estimate soil water content and employ a broad spectrum of methods operating at different frequencies such as time domain reflectometry capacitance and frequency domain reflectometry to name a few evett et al 2012 the effectiveness and applicability of sws largely depend on their accuracies aguilar et al 2015 many previous studies have assessed the performance of a wide variety of sws under variable agro climatological conditions evett and parkin 2005 ochsner et al 2013 some of the major factors affecting sws accuracy are sensor technologies calibrations used to convert raw data to soil water content soil texture soil salinity and installation specifications minimizing the impact of these factors on sws accuracy requires more studies to be conducted under variable soil and weather conditions besides the factors affecting accuracy new sws are continuously introduced and made commercially available by private companies and research organizations these newer sws replace older sensors and models creating the need to conduct more experiments to assess their performance similarly there is a continuous need to review the sws accuracy studies to keep researchers producers and other stakeholders updated with the developments and assist them with the selection of the new sensors that would best suit their needs several review papers related to sws in the context of united states us have been published in the past two decades most of these reviews have been focused on one of three areas 1 soil water measurement technologies and underlying principles 2 the advantages and disadvantages of different sws technologies and 3 how sws accuracies change on a paper to paper basis these review papers include noborio 2001 and robinson et al 2003 which focused on time domain reflectometry an emerging technology at that time that was receiving considerable attention from researchers later reviews by evett and parkin 2005 robinson et al 2008 evett et al 2012 ochsner et al 2013 and cahn and johnson 2017 provided discussions on more than one technology through evaluating previous review papers listed above three key limitations have been identified firstly they did not summarize the findings of research studies in a way that could shed light on factors that influence sws accuracy secondly the majority of them did not go beyond the accuracy assessment and did not explore sws utilization in practical irrigation scheduling finally they did not review and compare scheduling based on sws with other approaches addressing these three limitations in one paper requires an approach beyond traditional literature reviews this is where systematic reviews have been proven successful by providing a more comprehensive and structured summary of the previous research studies aromataris and pearson 2014 the goal of this systematic review was to identify and analyze related literature published in the past two decades on sws and their applications in agricultural irrigation management and to provide future guidelines and directions for research and extension professionals producers government agencies and other stakeholders the specific objectives were 1 to extract and summarize information on sws accuracy and factors that influence accuracy and 2 to review and synthesize

and conference papers related to sws accuracy assessment and application in managing agricultural irrigation following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma guidelines page et al 2021 the following keywords were used in the search process soil sensor irrigation soil sensor irrigation management and soil sensor irrigation scheduling the asterisk truncation enabled the search engines to find both single and plural forms of a word in scopus the resulting papers were screened based on the following criteria for inclusion 1 papers published between january 2000 and july 2021 2 studies conducted in the conterminous us and 3 studies that either assessed the accuracy of one or more commercially available sws for applications in agricultural irrigation scheduling or compared sws based irrigation scheduling with other scheduling methods or both exclusion criteria were 1 review studies theses and dissertations and 2 sws studies targeting greenhouse or landscape applications a total of 165 papers were identified from the databases after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria 80 papers were selected for the systematic review seventeen additional papers were identified from these 80 papers by forward and backward citation chasing cooper et al 2018 finally 97 papers were identified from the prisma guided literature search fig 1 49 papers on sws accuracy assessment and 48 papers on sws based irrigation scheduling only one paper had both components 2 2 information extraction the identified sws papers were reviewed in detail and their findings were synthesized organized and presented under two focus areas of i accuracy assessment and ii application in irrigation scheduling for the first focus area a dataset was created consisting of twelve variables extracted from each of the 49 identified papers if available these variables were 1 sws technologies tested 2 replications per sensor 3 installation orientation horizontal or vertical 4 number of soil types considered 5 study environment field or laboratory 6 sws calibration used factory or site specific 7 statistical error indicators reported root mean square error mean bias error etc 8 number of locations where the statistical indicators were obtained 9 reference method used to obtain the statistical indicators 10 study duration 11 soil salinity and 12 soil texture percentages of sand silt and clay we conducted a basic analysis on each of these twelve variables to obtain the proportions of the papers that reported each of these variables the elements of each variable and the range and mean of the variables or their elements for example horizontal and vertical elements in case of installation orientation variable in addition to the basic analysis a detailed analysis was carried out on the error indicators evaluating the effects of four variables out of twelve that have been shown to have more influence on sws accuracy sws technologies kukal et al 2020 installation orientation chen et al 2019 study environment feng and sui 2020 and calibrations chen et al 2019 singh et al 2019 we extracted all error indicators for each of the four variables then the error indicators were visualized through boxplots for each element of each variable since soil texture especially clay content also impacts the performance of many sws datta et al 2018 singh et al 2019 the results were presented separately for different ranges of clay content to allow for easier evaluation of the effects of studied variables under different levels of clay content this way the effects of differences in the four mentioned variables were compared when soil textures were somewhat similar based on the reported percentages in identified papers four classes of clay content were considered for the detailed analysis 0 22 23 45 46 69 and unreported the ending number in each class included its fractions besides clay content salinity is another variable that impacts sws accuracy but we did not include this variable in the detailed analysis as most of the identified papers did not report soil salinity when discussing the results based on the root mean square error rmse which was the most reported error indicator classifications of two previous studies were used hignett and evett 2008 suggested that sws can be effective in irrigation scheduling if their rmse is less than or equal to 0 02 m3 m 3 fares et al 2011 suggested the accuracy of sws can be classified as good fair poor and very poor for rmse 0 01 0 01 rmse 0 05 0 05 rmse 0 10 and rmse 0 10 m3 m 3 respectively for the second focus area applications in irrigation scheduling another dataset was created consisting of six variables extracted from the 48 identified papers 1 sws technologies used 2 cropping systems 3 study duration 4 study location 5 farm ownership commercial farm or research station 6 other scheduling methods studied and 7 impacts of the studied scheduling methods on water use yield energy consumption and net income like the accuracy assessment dataset we presented descriptive statistics for each of these seven variables and their elements since different studies reported changes in water use yield energy consumption and net income in different units combining and comparing them required normalizing their results to do so the differences were first estimated by subtracting the value of the reported parameter based on other scheduling methods from its value for sws based method and then dividing the difference by the value based on the other scheduling method to obtain the percent increase or decrease in the parameter when sws based scheduling was used 3 results and discussions 3 1 accuracy assessment 3 1 1 basic analysis the identified papers varied widely with respect to the twelve variables and their elements the number of tested sws technologies ranged from 1 to 10 with a mean of 3 tested technologies in each paper the number of replications had a range of 1 18 with a mean of 3 installation orientation was reported in 71 of the papers similar number of papers reported horizontal 26 and vertical 25 installations with 20 of the papers using both orientations the average number of soil types in each study was 3 range of 1 9 forty seven percent of the papers determined sws accuracy under field conditions 43 in laboratory and the rest 10 in both field and laboratory about half 51 of the papers used factory calibration in determining sws accuracy 14 used site specific calibration and 35 used both eighty percent of experiments were completed in one year with maximum duration being 3 years 14 of papers a variety of error indicators were used to represent sws accuracy the two most common indicators were rmse and mean bias error mbe reported in 76 and 35 of reviewed papers respectively twenty nine percent of papers reported both rmse and mbe except for one paper that reported rmse in units of soil matric potential and was excluded from the analyses the units of rmse and mbe were volumetric water content less common error indicators reported were relative rmse coefficient of determination and absolute average difference based on frequency of use in identified papers rmse and mbe were selected for detailed analysis soil salinity was reported in only 18 of the papers with a range of 0 8 4 ds m 1 1 1 soil water ratio and a mean of 1 8 ds m 1 clay content was reported in 72 of the papers range of 0 69 when considering all types of error indicators in the database a total of 1510 error observations were reported to represent sws accuracy the number of error observations for each county in the conterminous us is shown in fig 2 at the state level texas and nebraska were the leading states with 32 and 26 of the total observations respectively it is worth pointing out that many major irrigated areas in the south and west have no reported error indicator so information is not available on how different sws technologies perform there this may have some negative impact on sws adoption as an initial step in technology transfer is the trust of potential end users in performance of that technology among the methods used as reference to estimate the error indicators gravimetric sampling was the most common method accounting for 51 of the total observations followed by neutron scattering 47 other methods included tensiometry and time domain reflectometry 3 1 2 detailed analysis 3 1 2 1 technology eight different sws technologies were used in accuracy assessment studies amplitude domain reflectometry time domain reflectometry tdr frequency domain reflectometry fdr time domain transmissometry electrical resistivity er suction in soil matrix heat pulse and neutron scattering the terms fdr and capacitance have been used interchangeably by many researchers as they are based on similar technologies hignett and evett 2008 therefore these two technologies are referred to as fdr in this paper three of the eight mentioned technologies dominated the reported error indicators tdr 45 and 41 of all reported rmse and mbe respectively fdr 43 and 39 respectively and er 8 and 16 respectively therefore the emphasis of this detailed analysis is on these three technologies moreover the analysis looked at rmse and mbe resulting from factory calibrated sws readings to keep the comparison among these technologies fair this would also make the findings more useful to practical end users who may not have resources to conduct site specific calibration e g producers and farm managers the mean rmse among the three technologies were similar at 0 07 0 08 m3 m 3 the ranges of rmse for tdr fdr and er were somewhat different at 0 0 40 0 01 0 52 and 0 02 0 21 m3 m 3 respectively the maximum rmse of 0 52 m3 m 3 for fdr was due to the combined effects of high clay content and salinity the smaller range of er compared to the other two technologies may be due to the smaller size of rmse observations and thus less exposure to variable environmental conditions zero 6 and 16 of the rmses reported for er fdr and tdr technologies were smaller than the threshold set by hignett and evett 2008 respectively this means that based on their standard only a small portion of cases none for er met the irrigation scheduling requirements according to less strict thresholds of fares et al 2011 the percentages of errors falling under good or fair classes were larger at 50 for tdr 46 for fdr and 44 for er the mean mbe for tdr fdr and er were 0 02 0 03 and 0 04 m3 m 3 respectively in general the errors did not seem to increase with clay content fig 3 the largest mean and median rmse and mbe were typically found in the medium clay content level 23 45 3 1 2 2 installation orientation some previous researchers have found different accuracies in response to installation orientation for instance zhu et al 2019 reported smaller errors for horizontally installed sws in nebraska compared to vertical orientation chen et al 2019 found similar results in texas both studies speculated the reason could be due to a vertical soil temperature gradient that was not accurately captured in vertical installation since the temperature was measured at one point in the head of the sensor this systematic review however did not support those findings the mean rmse was the same 0 06 m3 m 3 for both orientations the ranges of rmse were also close at 0 0 40 and 0 0 35 m3 m 3 for horizontal and vertical orientations respectively twenty seven and 21 of rmse obtained under horizontal and vertical orientations were smaller than the thresholds of hignett and evett 2008 according to fares et al 2011 56 of rmse fell under good or fair classes for both orientations like rmse the mean mbe were the same 0 01 m3 m 3 however the range of mbe for horizontal orientation was larger 0 54 to 0 56 m3 m 3 than that of vertical orientation 0 16 to 0 24 m3 m 3 this may be because 99 of the horizontal observations were obtained under field conditions compared to 57 of the vertical orientation and thus were more exposed to variable conditions of outdoor environment no obvious relationship between error indicators and levels of clay content was observed fig 4 there were no mbe reported for clay content level of 46 69 3 1 2 3 environment the mean rmse was the same 0 06 m3 m 3 for both field and laboratory environments but the range was smaller for field 0 0 40 m3 m 3 than laboratory 0 0 52 m3 m 3 the maximum rmse of 0 52 m3 m 3 under laboratory was reported by vaz et al 2013 and was due to combined effects of high clay content and salinity ignoring this value the range was 0 0 35 m3 m 3 closer to and smaller than that of field rmse according to thresholds by hignett and evett 2008 only 18 and 28 of the reported rmse from field and laboratory were considered appropriate for irrigation scheduling based on thresholds set by fares et al 2011 56 and 68 of rmse obtained from field and laboratory were considered as good or fair respectively like rmse the mean mbe for field and laboratory were similar 0 01 m3 m 3 with a range of 0 54 to 0 56 m3 m 3 for field and a smaller range of 0 06 to 0 24 m3 m 3 for laboratory analyzing the results for different levels of clay content showed that the median field rmse was smaller than median laboratory rmse only for the lowest clay content level fig 5 3 1 2 4 calibration factory calibration was used more commonly than site specific calibration accounting for 69 and 64 of all rmse and mbe estimates respectively the mean rmse of factory calibration was 0 07 m3 m 3 about three times larger than site specific calibration 0 02 m3 m 3 the range of rmse for factory calibration was also about four times larger 0 0 52 m3 m 3 than site specific calibration 0 0 13 m3 m 3 this was expected as the estimates based on site specific calibration are tuned for unique conditions of the installation site generated with the goal of producing smaller errors only 11 of the rmse obtained using factory calibration was suitable for irrigation scheduling according to threshold of hignett and evett 2008 compared to 48 in case of site specific calibration a similar trend was observed based on classification of fares et al 2011 with 49 and 91 of factory and site specific rmse falling under good or fair classes respectively the mean mbe obtained from factory calibration was also larger 0 02 m3 m 3 than site specific 0 01 m3 m 3 the range of mbe using factory calibration was larger 0 54 to 0 56 m3 m 3 than that of site specific calibration 0 39 to 0 08 m3 m 3 the superiority of site specific calibration was evident when analyzing error indicators for different levels of clay content fig 6 in case of rmse the mean median and range were notably larger for factory calibration at all clay levels the average improvement in rmse going from factory to site specific calibration was 216 like rmse the mean median and range of mbe were considerably larger based on factory calibration the accuracy improvement using site specific calibration has been well documented in previous studies e g dong et al 2020 kukal et al 2020 they recommended using sws with site specific calibration to obtain more accurate estimates of soil water content however end users seldom have technical and financial resources to do site specific calibration 3 2 applications in irrigation scheduling six different sws technologies were implemented in irrigation scheduling studies er fdr tdr neutron probe tensiometer and time domain transmissometry er accounted for 33 of the cases followed by fdr 21 neutron probe 16 and tdr 13 the other two technologies comprised of 17 of the cases combined the main reasons behind dominant use of er in irrigation scheduling could be its lower cost ease of use and ease of data interpretation in addition many extension factsheets and user manuals have been developed since the earlier versions of the er technology gypsum blocks were developed several decades ago among cropping systems where irrigation scheduling methods were tested corn and cotton were the most dominant other notable crops were tomato soybean watermelon sugar beet sorghum and potato the length of the study period in identified papers ranged from 1 to 6 years with a mean of 2 years a total of 64 locations where irrigation scheduling by sws was investigated were identified fig 7 presents the county wise number of locations in the conterminous us at the state level nebraska was the lead with 22 of the locations followed by texas 17 mississippi 13 and florida 13 about 13 of irrigation scheduling studies were conducted at commercial fields of producers and the rest 87 at research farms owned by universities or research institutions like the spatial pattern of sws accuracy assessment studies many major irrigated areas especially in western us had no reported study on sws utilization for irrigation scheduling among the identified papers 40 relied only on the sws method and the rest compared it with other scheduling methods including traditional computer models evapotranspiration replacement and canopy temperature the traditional scheduling included producers practices and approaches to deciding when and how much to irrigate as well as rotational delivery by water provider computer models included simple soil water balance models executed through spreadsheets and checkbooks advanced simulation models e g ceres maize and mobile and web based applications such as arkansas irrigation scheduler smartirrigation cotton app and irrigator pro the evapotranspiration replacement approach relied on reports of crop water use obtained from local weather stations with the amount of irrigation water being equal to the cumulative evapotranspiration since the last irrigation event the canopy temperature method was based on the thermal remote sensing of crop canopy the sws based irrigation scheduling was compared with the traditional method more commonly than any other method followed by computer models and evapotranspiration replacement fig 8 when comparing sws based and other irrigation scheduling methods 97 and 90 of the identified papers reported changes in water use and yield respectively while 2 documented changes in energy consumption and 6 reported changes in net income only one paper irmak et al 2012 reported all four parameters figs 9 and 10 demonstrate the differences in water use and yield respectively in percentages when the sws based method is compared with other scheduling methods positive values indicate that sws based scheduling had larger water use and yield compared to other scheduling methods and negative values mean smaller water use and yield when irrigation events are managed based on sws on average sws based scheduling used 38 less water than traditional 16 less water than computer models 20 less water than evapotranspiration replacement and 1 less water than canopy temperature methods several reasons could explain the smaller water use of the sws based method steele et al 2000 mentioned that sws based irrigation scheduling used less water because of its real time monitoring of crop water use compared to the methods that lack continuous monitoring muñoz carpena et al 2008 attributed smaller water use in sws based compared to traditional scheduling to smaller irrigation amounts early in the growing season ganjegunte and clark 2017 observed both smaller amounts and fewer irrigation events in sws based scheduling compared to traditional scheduling overall sws based scheduling resulted in larger yield 9 on average when considering all of the methods it was compared against the largest increase in yield 24 was observed when sws based scheduling was compared against traditional scheduling sws based scheduling had 7 larger yield on average compared to evapotranspiration replacement computer models and canopy temperature methods had somewhat similar yield to the sws based scheduling method within 2 3 in the reviewed papers the overall goal of using various irrigation scheduling methods has been to minimize irrigation amounts and optimize irrigation frequency to meet a target crop yield that is generally obtained from traditional scheduling method thus increasing yield through other scheduling methods is often viewed as a secondary objective in these studies especially those conducted in the drought stricken or water limited areas this may explain the smaller magnitude of differences in yield compared to differences in water use when comparing sws based scheduling with other scheduling methods 4 conclusions a systematic review was carried out to identify and analyze relevant literature on the use of sws for irrigation scheduling in the us between 2000 and 2021 the analysis was concentrated on two focus areas sws accuracy assessment and sws application in irrigation scheduling with respect to accuracy assessment most of the studies were conducted in texas and nebraska while many other states with vast irrigated areas had no published study gravimetric sampling and neutron scattering were two most common methods of reference to estimate sws errors the three dominant technologies tdr fdr and er had similar average rmse and did not show any trend in errors with increasing clay content similarly installing sensors horizontally or vertically and under field or laboratory conditions did not impact the average rmse and no trend with increasing clay content was found not surprisingly the average rmse for factory manufacturer calibration was three times larger than the average rmse based on site specific calibration and this was the case for each class of clay content like accuracy assessment tdr fdr and er were the dominant technologies used in irrigation scheduling texas and nebraska were the leading states in this focus area as well many states in western us did not have a single paper in the past two decades on practical application of sws for irrigation scheduling nearly all papers that compared sws based scheduling with other methods reported changes in water use and yield two of the most important metrics in evaluating the effectiveness of irrigation scheduling methods making irrigation decisions based on sws resulted in average reductions in water use of 38 compared to traditional scheduling methods 16 compared to computer models 20 compared to evapotranspiration replacement and 1 compared to canopy temperature methods the savings in water use were achieved while the yields improved 24 compared to traditional methods or remained about the same this systematic review presented the state of the art of the accuracy and application of sws in irrigation scheduling in the us in the last 20 years with regular releases of new sensors and modifications of older ones our recommendations for future sws studies are to 1 continue testing new sensors and models soon after they become available to provide accuracy assessments in a timely manner 2 conduct more accuracy assessment studies under field conditions and in major irrigated areas and states that did not have a single experiment in the past 20 years 3 report soil texture soil salinity and rmse whenever possible to make the results more comparable and transferrable 4 develop more site specific calibrations for commercially available sws we also strongly encourage sws manufacturers to provide a library of calibrations or allow users to enter their own calibration and 5 to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing sws for scientific irrigation scheduling by documenting the improvements in water use yield energy consumption and net income which are necessary for decision makers and producers to support and adopt sws technologies the results of such studies may be more acceptable to end users if the experiments are

9096,soil water sensors sws have been widely researched and practiced for irrigation scheduling due to popularity of this approach there is a need for frequent reviews of the sws literature to keep the researchers extension professionals and end users updated and to help with defining and modifying future directions in addition existing literature reviews do not systematically report and summarize the results of previous studies to address this gap a systematic review was carried out to identify and analyze related literature published in the united states in the past two decades two focus areas were sws accuracy assessment and sws application in irrigation scheduling the results showed that sws accuracy was most susceptible to sensor calibration the reported root mean square errors had similar ranges and means among different technologies installation orientations and study environments compared to other scheduling methods sws based scheduling resulted in water saving with average amounts ranging from 1 when compared to canopy temperature methods to 38 in case of traditional approaches in addition sws based scheduling led to larger or similar yields compared to other scheduling methods texas and nebraska were the top two states in terms of the number of studies on sws accuracy and irrigation scheduling keywords accuracy literature review irrigation

water sensors sws have been recognized as one of the most commonly used approaches in implementing scientific irrigation scheduling taghvaeian et al 2020 a vast majority of these sensors in the last twenty years have been designed based on technologies relying on electrical resistivity and electromagnetic principles sensors based on electrical resistance indirectly measure soil water tension these sensors measure changes in electrical resistance in soil media which is calibrated against soil water tension from pressure plates or some other methods on the other hand sensors based on electromagnetic principles rely on dielectric properties of soil to estimate soil water content and employ a broad spectrum of methods operating at different frequencies such as time domain reflectometry capacitance and frequency domain reflectometry to name a few evett et al 2012 the effectiveness and applicability of sws largely depend on their accuracies aguilar et al 2015 many previous studies have assessed the performance of a wide variety of sws under variable agro climatological conditions evett and parkin 2005 ochsner et al 2013 some of the major factors affecting sws accuracy are sensor technologies calibrations used to convert raw data to soil water content soil texture soil salinity and installation specifications minimizing the impact of these factors on sws accuracy requires more studies to be conducted under variable soil and weather conditions besides the factors affecting accuracy new sws are continuously introduced and made commercially available by private companies and research organizations these newer sws replace older sensors and models creating the need to conduct more experiments to assess their performance similarly there is a continuous need to review the sws accuracy studies to keep researchers producers and other stakeholders updated with the developments and assist them with the selection of the new sensors that would best suit their needs several review papers related to sws in the context of united states us have been published in the past two decades most of these reviews have been focused on one of three areas 1 soil water measurement technologies and underlying principles 2 the advantages and disadvantages of different sws technologies and 3 how sws accuracies change on a paper to paper basis these review papers include noborio 2001 and robinson et al 2003 which focused on time domain reflectometry an emerging technology at that time that was receiving considerable attention from researchers later reviews by

listed above three key limitations have been identified firstly they did not summarize the findings of research studies in a way that could shed light on factors that influence sws accuracy secondly

laboratory and the rest 10 in both field and laboratory about half 51 of the papers used factory calibration in determining sws accuracy 14 used site specific calibration and 35 used both eighty percent of experiments were completed in one year with maximum duration being 3 years 14 of papers a variety of error indicators were used to represent sws accuracy the two most common indicators were rmse and mean bias error mbe reported in 76 and 35 of reviewed papers respectively twenty nine percent of papers reported both rmse and mbe except for one paper that reported rmse in units of soil matric potential and was excluded from the analyses the units of rmse and mbe were volumetric water content less common error indicators reported were relative rmse coefficient of determination and absolute average difference based on frequency of use in identified papers rmse and mbe were selected for detailed analysis soil salinity was reported in only 18 of the papers with a range of 0 8 4 ds m 1 1 1 soil water ratio and a mean of 1 8 ds m 1 clay content was reported in 72 of the papers range of 0 69 when considering all types of error indicators in the database a total of 1510 error observations were reported to represent sws accuracy the number of error observations for each county in the conterminous us is shown in fig 2 at the state level texas and nebraska were the leading states with 32 and 26 of the total observations respectively it is worth pointing out that many major irrigated areas in the south and west have no reported error indicator so information is not available on how different sws technologies perform there this may have some negative impact on sws adoption as an initial step in technology transfer is the trust of potential end users in performance of that technology among the methods used as reference to estimate the error indicators gravimetric sampling was the most common method accounting for 51 of the total observations followed by neutron scattering 47 other methods included tensiometry and time domain reflectometry 3 1 2 detailed analysis 3 1 2 1 technology eight different sws technologies were used in accuracy assessment studies amplitude domain reflectometry time domain reflectometry tdr frequency domain reflectometry fdr time domain transmissometry electrical resistivity er suction in soil matrix heat pulse and neutron scattering the terms fdr and capacitance have been used interchangeably by many researchers as they are based on similar technologies hignett and evett 2008 therefore these two technologies are referred to as fdr in this paper three of the eight mentioned technologies dominated the reported error indicators tdr 45 and 41 of all reported rmse and mbe respectively fdr 43 and 39 respectively and er 8 and 16 respectively therefore the emphasis of this detailed analysis is on these three technologies moreover the analysis looked at rmse and mbe resulting from factory calibrated sws readings to keep the comparison among these technologies fair this would also make the findings more useful to practical end users who may not have resources to conduct site specific calibration e g producers and farm managers the mean rmse among the three technologies were similar at 0 07 0 08 m3 m 3 the ranges of rmse for tdr fdr and er were somewhat different at 0 0 40 0 01 0 52 and 0 02 0 21 m3 m 3 respectively the maximum rmse of 0 52 m3 m 3 for fdr was due to the combined effects of high clay content and salinity the smaller range of er compared to the other two technologies may be due to the smaller size of rmse observations and thus less exposure to variable environmental conditions zero 6 and 16 of the rmses reported for er fdr and tdr technologies were smaller than the threshold set by hignett and evett 2008 respectively this means that based on their standard only a small portion of cases none for er met the irrigation scheduling requirements according to less strict thresholds of fares et al 2011 the percentages of errors falling under good or fair classes were larger at 50 for tdr 46 for fdr and 44 for er the mean mbe for tdr fdr and er were 0 02 0 03 and 0 04 m3 m 3 respectively in general the errors did not seem to increase with clay content fig 3 the largest mean and median rmse and mbe were typically found in the medium clay content level 23 45 3 1 2 2 installation orientation some previous researchers have found different accuracies in response to installation orientation for instance zhu et al 2019 reported smaller errors for horizontally installed sws in nebraska compared to vertical orientation chen et al 2019 found similar results in texas both studies speculated the reason could be due to a vertical soil temperature gradient that was not accurately captured in vertical installation since the temperature was measured at one point in the head of the sensor this systematic review however did not support those findings the mean rmse was the same 0 06 m3 m 3 for both orientations the ranges of rmse were also close at 0 0 40 and 0 0 35 m3 m 3 for horizontal and vertical orientations respectively twenty seven and 21 of rmse obtained under horizontal and vertical orientations were smaller than the thresholds of hignett and evett 2008 according to fares et al 2011 56 of rmse fell under good or fair classes for both orientations like rmse the mean mbe were the same 0 01 m3 m 3 however the range of mbe for horizontal orientation was larger 0 54 to 0 56 m3 m 3 than that of vertical orientation 0 16 to 0 24 m3 m 3 this may be because 99 of the horizontal observations were obtained under field conditions compared to 57 of the vertical orientation and thus were more exposed to variable conditions of outdoor environment no obvious relationship between error indicators and levels of clay content was observed fig 4 there were no mbe reported for clay content level of 46 69 3 1 2 3 environment the mean rmse was the same 0 06 m3 m 3 for both field and laboratory environments but the range was smaller for field 0 0 40 m3 m 3 than laboratory 0 0 52 m3 m 3 the maximum rmse of 0 52 m3 m 3 under laboratory was reported by vaz et al 2013 and was due to combined effects of high clay content and salinity ignoring this value the range was 0 0 35 m3 m 3 closer to and smaller than that of field rmse according to thresholds by hignett and evett 2008 only 18 and 28 of the reported rmse from field and laboratory were considered appropriate for irrigation scheduling based on thresholds set by fares et al 2011 56 and 68 of rmse obtained from field and laboratory were considered as good or fair respectively like rmse the mean mbe for field and laboratory were similar 0 01 m3 m 3 with a range of 0 54 to 0 56 m3 m 3 for field and a smaller range of 0 06 to 0 24 m3 m 3 for laboratory analyzing the results for different levels of clay content showed that the median field rmse was smaller than median laboratory rmse only for the lowest clay content level fig 5 3 1 2 4 calibration factory calibration was used more commonly than site specific calibration accounting for 69 and 64 of all rmse and mbe estimates respectively the mean rmse of factory calibration was 0 07 m3 m 3 about three times larger than site specific calibration 0 02 m3 m 3 the range of rmse for factory calibration was also about four times larger 0 0 52 m3 m 3 than site specific calibration 0 0 13 m3 m 3 this was expected as the estimates based on site specific calibration are tuned for unique conditions of the installation site generated with the goal of producing smaller errors only 11 of the rmse obtained using factory calibration was suitable for irrigation scheduling according to threshold of hignett and evett 2008 compared to 48 in case of site specific calibration a similar trend was observed based on classification of fares et al 2011 with 49 and 91 of factory and site specific rmse falling under good or fair classes respectively the mean mbe obtained from factory calibration was also larger 0 02 m3 m 3 than site specific 0 01 m3 m 3 the range of mbe using factory calibration was larger 0 54 to 0 56 m3 m 3 than that of site specific calibration 0 39 to 0 08 m3 m 3 the superiority of site specific calibration was evident when analyzing error indicators for different levels of clay content fig 6 in case of rmse the mean median and range were notably larger for factory calibration at all clay levels the average improvement in rmse going from factory to site specific calibration was 216 like rmse the mean median and range of mbe were considerably larger based on factory calibration the accuracy improvement using site specific calibration has been well documented in previous studies e g dong et al 2020 kukal et al 2020 they recommended using sws with site specific calibration to obtain more accurate estimates of soil water content however end users seldom have technical and financial resources to do site specific calibration 3 2 applications in irrigation scheduling six different sws technologies were implemented in irrigation scheduling studies er fdr tdr neutron probe tensiometer and time domain transmissometry er accounted for 33 of the cases followed by fdr 21 neutron probe 16 and tdr 13 the other two technologies comprised of 17 of the cases combined the main reasons behind dominant use of er in irrigation scheduling could be its lower cost ease of use and ease of data interpretation in addition many extension factsheets and user manuals have been developed since the earlier versions of the er technology gypsum blocks were developed several decades ago among cropping systems where irrigation scheduling methods were tested corn and cotton were the most dominant other notable crops were tomato soybean watermelon sugar beet sorghum and potato the length of the study period in identified papers ranged from 1 to 6 years with a mean of 2 years a total of 64 locations where irrigation scheduling by sws was investigated were identified fig 7 presents the county wise number of locations in the conterminous us at the state level nebraska was the lead with 22 of the locations followed by texas 17 mississippi 13 and florida 13 about 13 of irrigation scheduling studies were conducted at commercial fields of producers and the rest 87 at research farms owned by universities or research institutions like the spatial pattern of sws accuracy assessment studies many major irrigated areas especially in western us had no reported study on sws utilization for irrigation scheduling among the identified papers 40 relied only on the sws method and the rest compared it with other scheduling methods including traditional computer models evapotranspiration replacement and canopy temperature the traditional scheduling included producers practices and approaches to deciding when and how much to irrigate as well as rotational delivery by water provider computer models included simple soil water balance models executed through spreadsheets and checkbooks advanced simulation models e g ceres maize and mobile and web based applications such as arkansas irrigation scheduler smartirrigation cotton app and irrigator pro the evapotranspiration replacement approach relied on reports of crop water use obtained from local weather stations with the amount of irrigation water being equal to the cumulative evapotranspiration since the last irrigation event the canopy temperature method was based on the thermal remote sensing of crop canopy the sws based irrigation scheduling was compared with the traditional method more commonly than any other method followed by computer models and evapotranspiration replacement fig 8 when comparing sws based and other irrigation scheduling methods 97 and 90 of the identified papers reported changes in water use and yield respectively while 2 documented changes in energy consumption and 6 reported changes in net income only one paper irmak et al 2012 reported all four parameters figs 9 and 10 demonstrate the differences in water use and yield respectively in percentages when the sws based method is compared with other scheduling methods positive values indicate that sws based scheduling had larger water use and yield compared to other scheduling methods and negative values mean smaller water use and yield when irrigation events are managed based on sws on average sws based scheduling used 38 less water than traditional 16 less water than computer models 20 less water than evapotranspiration replacement and 1 less water than canopy temperature methods several reasons could explain the smaller water use of the sws based method steele et al 2000 mentioned that sws based irrigation scheduling used less water because of its real time monitoring of crop water use compared to the methods that lack continuous monitoring muñoz carpena et al 2008 attributed smaller water use in sws based compared to traditional scheduling to smaller irrigation amounts early in the growing season ganjegunte and clark 2017 observed both smaller amounts and fewer irrigation events in sws based scheduling compared to traditional scheduling overall sws based scheduling resulted in larger yield 9 on average when considering all of the methods it was compared against the largest increase in yield 24 was observed when sws based scheduling was compared against traditional scheduling sws based scheduling had 7 larger yield on average compared to evapotranspiration replacement computer models and canopy temperature methods had somewhat similar yield to the sws based scheduling method within 2 3 in the reviewed papers the overall goal of using various irrigation scheduling methods has been to minimize irrigation amounts and optimize irrigation frequency to meet a target crop yield that is generally obtained from traditional scheduling method thus increasing yield through other scheduling methods is often viewed as a secondary objective in these studies especially those conducted in the drought stricken or water limited areas this may explain the smaller magnitude of differences in yield compared to differences in water use when comparing sws based scheduling with other scheduling methods 4 conclusions a systematic review was carried out to identify and analyze relevant literature on the use of sws for irrigation scheduling in the us between 2000 and 2021 the analysis was concentrated on two focus areas sws accuracy assessment and sws application in irrigation scheduling with respect to accuracy assessment most of the studies were conducted in texas and nebraska while many other states with vast irrigated areas had no published study gravimetric sampling and neutron scattering were two most common methods of reference to estimate sws errors the three dominant technologies tdr fdr and er had similar average rmse and did not show any trend in errors with increasing clay content similarly installing sensors horizontally or vertically and under field or laboratory conditions did not impact the average rmse and no trend with increasing clay content was found not surprisingly the average rmse for factory manufacturer calibration was three times larger than the average rmse based on site specific calibration and this was the case for each class of clay content like accuracy assessment tdr fdr and er were the dominant technologies used in irrigation scheduling texas and nebraska were the leading states in this focus area as well many states in western us did not have a single paper in the past two decades on practical application of sws for irrigation scheduling nearly all papers that compared sws based scheduling with other methods reported changes in water use and yield two of the most important metrics in evaluating the effectiveness of irrigation scheduling methods making irrigation decisions based on sws resulted in average reductions in water use of 38 compared to traditional scheduling methods 16 compared to computer models 20 compared to evapotranspiration replacement and 1 compared to canopy temperature methods the savings in water use were achieved while the yields improved 24 compared to traditional methods or remained about the same this systematic review presented the state of the art of the accuracy and application of sws in irrigation scheduling in the us in the last 20 years with regular releases of new sensors and modifications of older ones our recommendations for future sws studies are to 1 continue testing new sensors and models soon after they become available to provide accuracy assessments in a timely manner 2 conduct more accuracy assessment studies under field conditions and in major irrigated areas and states that did not have a single experiment in the past 20 years 3 report soil texture soil salinity and rmse whenever possible to make the results more comparable and transferrable 4 develop more site specific calibrations for commercially available sws we also strongly encourage sws manufacturers to provide a library of calibrations or allow users to enter their own calibration and 5 to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing sws for scientific irrigation scheduling by documenting the improvements in water use yield energy consumption and net income which are necessary for decision makers and producers to support and adopt sws technologies the results of such studies may be more acceptable to end users if the experiments are

9097,vegsyst model v3 was calibrated and validated to simulate daily and seasonal p k ca and mg uptake of soil grown sweet pepper and muskmelon crops in greenhouses in se spain the model adequately simulated p k and mg uptake in three validation crops of sweet pepper and ca uptake in one crop p k ca and mg uptake were accurately simulated in one validation muskmelon crop the decision support system vegsyst dss v2 was developed by adding a component for recommendations of p k ca and mg for pepper and muskmelon to vegsyst dss v1 the new dss component which combines with vegsyst model v3 calculates i daily p k ca and mg requirement in kg ha 1 and ii nutrient concentration recommendations for fertigation nutrient solution considering soil available exchangeable content and simulated crop uptake recommended concentrations of p k ca and mg in mmol l 1 are calculated from simulated uptake of each nutrient and crop evapotranspiration etc scenario analyses were conducted for nutrient recommendations of representative cropping cycles of pepper and melon with hypothetical soils of relatively low medium and high p k ca and mg availability obtained from a local soil database the scenario analyses showed most soils had ample available soil p and required minimal applications of p for soils with relatively high levels of available nutrients dss recommendations were much lower 20 60 than farming practice for soils with a medium supply of available nutrients the dss recommendations were generally approximately 60 of farmer practice except for k in pepper and ca in muskmelon for soils that were relatively low in available nutrients the recommendations were generally similar to or slightly less than farming practice the crop and greenhouse specific recommendations of vegsyst dss v2 can appreciably reduce the application of p k ca and mg while meeting crop requirements keywords decision support system model phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium soil nutrient solution data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the greenhouse vegetable production system located in southeastern se spain is one of the most important economic sectors in this region this system is mostly concentrated in the province of almeria where there are currently 32 550 ha of greenhouses cajamar 2021 two of the most important crops are sweet pepper and melon within this system sweet pepper and melon are grown respectively on 12 300 and 3200 ha annually cajamar 2021 the annual value of pepper and melon production are approximately 700 and 43 4 million respectively cajamar 2021 depending on price sweet pepper is generally the most or second most important crop in this greenhouse system in terms of cropping area sweet pepper is mostly grown with a summer to winter cropping cycle and melon with a spring to summer cycle often these two crops are grown in sequence approximately 90 of the greenhouse surface area in se spain is cropped in soil garcía et al 2016 in this system irrigation and nutrients are automatically applied to both soil and substrate grown drip irrigated vegetable crops using advanced fertigation systems garcía et al 2016 thompson et al 2007 2017a nutrient solutions commonly supplying all essential nutrients are applied in each irrigation to soil grown crops the fertigation systems used have the technical capacity to frequently apply nutrients and irrigation throughout a crop as required by the crop thompson et al 2017a however this technical capacity is not effectively used because most growers apply nutrients and irrigation based on local experience of what ensures high levels of production thompson et al 2007 2017a there is little use of science based tools and approaches to optimise nutrient and irrigation application thompson et al 2017a 2017b 2020 the most commonly used type of fertigation system in soil grown vegetable crops in almeria greenhouses is the use of several tanks most commonly 3 4 of concentrated fertiliser solution generally with one or two fertilisers per tank garcía et al 2016 these concentrated solutions are added to the irrigation water through venturi valves or dosing pumps generally standard nutrient concentrations are applied in the nutrient solution these are normally either constant for 1 a phenological phase with 3 4 phases during a crop or 2 the duration of a crop fernández rodríguez and camacho ferre 2013 while the customary use of standard complete nutrient solutions is associated with profitable production it is also associated with excessive nutrient application this has resulted in considerable nitrate no3 contamination of underlying aquifers pulido bosch et al 2018 and the accumulation of available phosphorus p and exchangeable potassium k in greenhouse soils gil de carrasco 2000 all greenhouse production areas in the province of almeria and in neighbouring provinces have been designated as being nitrate vulnerable zones boja 2020a and are required to implement improved crop nutrient management practices boja 2020b in addition to the environmental consequences the established nutrient management practices represent an on going unnecessary cost for growers consequently for both economic and environmental reasons there is a pressing requirement to develop and implement science based crop nutrient management of all macronutrients to replace the experiential management being used for optimal nutrient management of soil grown greenhouse crops numerous factors must be considered such as available soil nutrient supply climate soil and crop characteristics and greenhouse characteristics user friendly decision support systems dsss can process large and diverse amounts of information to provide nutrient and irrigation recommendations for greenhouse vegetable production gallardo et al 2020 the incorporation of simulation models into such dsss enables crop and site specific assessment gallardo et al 2020 the currently available vegsyst dss v1 provides recommendations of nitrogen n concentration in the nutrient solution n fertiliser rate and irrigation volumes for seven vegetable species grown in greenhouses in almeria gallardo et al 2014 2016 a ms windows compatible computer programme gallardo et al 2017 is available in english and spanish https w3 ual es gruposinv nitrogeno vegsyst dss shtml vegsyst dss v1 is based on the vegsyst simulation model gallardo et al 2011 2014 2016 which calculates daily dry matter production dmp crop n uptake and crop evapotranspiration etc vegsyst dss v1 uses these outputs to calculate crop n and irrigation requirements and the recommended applied n concentration gallardo et al 2014 vegsyst dss prepares plans of nutrient recommendations as concentration or rate prior to cropping using long term climate data within almeria greenhouses in a stable mediterranean climate long term climatic data are very similar to real time data bonachela et al 2006 it is intended that the nutrient plans prepared by vegsyst dss will be the prescriptive component of a package of prescriptive corrective management granados et al 2013 thompson et al 2017a 2017b the intended corrective or monitoring component involving for example petiole sap and or soil solution analysis thompson et al 2017a 2017b using on farm rapid analysis peña fleitas et al 2021 will enable rapid manual adjustment of the applied nutrient solution to ensure on going optimal crop nutritional status considering that in this system the macronutrients k p ca and mg are normally applied in each irrigation using standard concentrations based on what works and that excessive soil p and k accumulation is occurring gil de carrasco 2000 there is a need to develop science based recommendation systems for these macronutrients incorporating these macronutrients into vegsyst dss will enable the preparation of nutrient solutions in which the concentrations of all macronutrients n k p ca and mg meet the specific requirements of each crop and greenhouse on a scientific basis for soil grown crops a prior step to being able to provide recommendations for these macronutrients with the vegsyst dss is the simulation of daily nutrient uptake by the vegsyst model component of the dss gallardo et al 2016 recently gallardo et al 2021 adapted the vegsyst model to simulate crop uptake of k p ca and mg of greenhouse tomato producing vegsyst model v3 the present work consists of three components firstly the vegsyst model was calibrated and validated to simulate daily and seasonal uptake of p k ca and mg for soil grown sweet pepper and muskmelon crops in greenhouses in se spain secondly the revised dss vegsyst dss v2 was developed by adding a new component to vegsyst dss v1 for recommendations of the macronutrients p k ca and mg for these two species that considers crop demand and soil nutrient availability thirdly vegsyst dss v2 was used to conduct scenario analyses to demonstrate how recommended concentrations and amounts of k p ca and mg vary with soil nutrient availability using soil test results from a local soil testing laboratory 2 materials and methods 2 1 crops and determinations four crops of sweet pepper capsicum annuum l and two of muskmelon cucumis melo l were grown in soil in a plastic greenhouse under similar conditions to those of commercial intensive vegetable production in southeastern se spain at the experimental station of the university of almeria in retamar almeria se spain 36 51 n 2 16 w and 92 m elevation the cropping area of the greenhouse was 1300 m2 the greenhouse the soil and the configuration of the drip system are described by rodríguez et al 2020a the four sweet pepper crops were california type cv melchor zeraim iberica syngenta and were grown during autumn winter the two muskmelon crops were both cantaloupe type cv tezac in 2020 and cv bosito in 2021 seminis inc bayer and were grown during spring summer the 2014 15 sweet pepper crop hereafter referred to as pepper 14 was grown from 12 august 2014 29 january 2015 170 days the 2016 17 sweet pepper crop hereafter referred to as pepper 16 was grown from 19 july 2016 9 march 2017 233 days the 2017 18 sweet pepper crop hereafter referred to as pepper 17 was grown from 21 july 2017 20 february 2018 214 days and the 2020 21 sweet pepper hereafter referred to as pepper 20 was grown from 22 july 2020 28 january 2021 190 days the first muskmelon crop hereafter referred to as melon 20 was grown from 27 february to 11 june 2020 105 days and the second crop hereafter referred to as melon 21 was grown from 26 february to 7 june 2021 101 days drip irrigation and fertigation were used in all crops all macronutrients and micronutrients were applied throughout the crops by fertigation in all irrigations to ensure that none of them were limiting the concentrations applied were very similar to those recommended for local commercial farmers fernández rodríguez and camacho ferre 2013 these concentrations are similar to those used with crops grown in substrate with no nutrient supplying capacity fernández rodríguez and camacho ferre 2013 the average composition of the nutrient solutions used are indicated in supplementary table 1 irrigation was scheduled using tensiometers to maintain the soil matric potential in the root zone at 15 cm depth within 10 to 30 kpa for all crops climatic conditions of air temperature and relative humidity and solar radiation were continuously monitored inside the greenhouse as described by rodriguez et al 2020a to determine the crop content of k p ca and mg representative oven dried samples of i leaves stems and fruits from regular biomass samplings ii all pruned material and iii fruit from various harvests were separately finely ground contents of k p ca and mg were determined by inductively coupled plasma icp spectrometry model icap 6500duo thermofisher scientific ma usa after acid digestion above ground crop uptake of k p ca and mg was calculated for each biomass sampling in each crop as the sum of uptake in leaves stems and immature fruit plus the uptake in pruned and harvested material until the biomass sampling for each crop component on each date uptake was calculated as the product of dry matter production dmp and the crop content of the nutrient additionally data of rincón et al 1995 were included in the current study to provide additional data on the relationship of the crop p content to dmp in sweet pepper this crop was grown in a plastic greenhouse using drip irrigation and fertigation crop management followed local practices this sweet pepper crop was grown from 27 december 1991 30 may 1992 with a planting density of 2 5 plants m 2 there were nine samplings of dmp in each sampling crop p uptake was determined full details of the experiment and methodology are available in rincón et al 1995 2 2 calibration and validation of the vegsyst model for uptake of macronutrients the vegsyst model was calibrated to simulate above ground uptake of macronutrients in sweet pepper and muskmelon following the procedures described by gallardo et al 2021 for tomato the uptake of p k ca and mg for a given day i was the product of dmpi i e the dmp of that day and the simulated crop nutrient content nutrienti of the same day which was calculated as 1 nutrienti a x dmp b i were a and b are the equation coefficients for the best fitting power equations describing the relationship of nutrient content to dmp for the calibration of sweet pepper for k ca and mg data of dmp and nutrient contents from the pepper 20 crop were used to derive the equation coefficients for p in sweet pepper data from the pepper 20 crop and rincón et al 1995 were used for muskmelon data from the melon 20 crop were used all these crops are described in section 2 1 for each nutrient daily uptake was calculated as the product of simulated daily dmp with the vegsyst model and the simulated daily nutrient content eq 1 the equations used to simulate daily values of dmp crop n uptake and etc in the vegsyst model are described in gallardo et al 2016 the performance of the simulation of p k ca and mg uptake in sweet pepper and muskmelon by vegsyst model v3 was validated using experimental data from three pepper crops pepper 14 pepper 16 and pepper 17 and one muskmelon crop melon 21 all described in section 2 1 to evaluate the agreement between simulated and measured values the following statistical indices were used i the root mean square error rmse ii the relative error re stöckle et al 2004 iii the willmott index of agreement d willmott 1982 and iv the slope m and coefficient of determination r2 of the linear regression between simulated and measured values values of re 0 25 and d 0 75 were considered to indicate adequate model performance following yang et al 2014 2 3 development of the vegsyst dss v2 for recommendations of fertiliser requirements and concentrations in the nutrient solution for p k ca and mg an appreciably revised version of vegsyst dss vegsyst dss v2 is described here which compared to the previous version gallardo et al 2014 provides recommendations of the p k ca and mg concentrations in the applied nutrient solution in mmol l 1 and the recommended amounts of these macronutrients in kg ha 1 vegsyst dss v2 consists of the vegsyst simulation model v3 that calculates daily uptake of p k ca and mg and a revised dss component that estimates crop requirements of these four nutrients considering crop uptake and soil test results a schematic representation of vegsyst dss v2 is presented in fig 1 which shows the calculations made by the vegsyst simulation model v3 component and the calculations of recommended amounts and concentrations made by the complementary modified dss component a prototype of vegsyst dss v2 was prepared in microsoft excel 365 the vegsyst simulation model v3 component for crop p k ca and mg uptake was calibrated for sweet pepper and muskmelon as the product of i the simulated daily crop p k ca and mg content described in section 2 2 and ii simulated daily dmp the calibration parameters for dmp and etc in the simulation model component were described in gallardo et al 2016 only the new modules for p k ca and mg are described here the new component in vegsyst dss v2 calculates the daily p k ca and mg requirement in kg ha 1 considering their available exchangeable content in soil and crop uptake the strategy used to interpret soil analysis results is an adaptation of the build up or maintenance approaches described by delgado et al 2016 with these approaches when a soil analysis result is below a threshold value a build up approach is used that applies sufficient fertiliser to increase soil fertility when the soil analysis result is above the threshold value a maintenance approach is used that applies fertiliser to compensate or partly compensate for crop removal of the nutrient the daily crop nutrient uptake values are used with daily etc to calculate daily applied nutrient concentration values the daily values of nutrient uptake and etc are summed for four week periods to calculate recommended nutrient concentrations for four week periods which is how nutrient concentration output is provided the new p k ca and mg component of vegsyst dss v2 requires measured data of a general soil parameters such as texture organic matter and total carbonate content and of b a recent soil analysis of the available exchangeable forms of these nutrients nitrogen which forms part of vegsyst dss v2 is described elsewhere gallardo et al 2014 2016 for texture soils are classified as either type 1 sandy sandy loam loam sandy clay loam silty loam sandy clay or type 2 clay loam silty clay loam clay for available p the olsen extraction is used as it is widely used in spain and is suited to alkaline soils which are predominant in coastal se spain to interpret the results of soil analysis classifications were developed for interpreting available p and exchangeable k ca and mg table 1 considering the interpretation systems of delgado et al 2016 jordan meille et al 2012 and hartz 2020 and a local soil laboratory http www labcolor coex es associated with a large local farmers association coexphal https www coexphal es five classification ranges were developed for p and k being very low vl low l medium m high h and very high vh four classification ranges were developed for ca and mg being vl l m and h table 1 each of these classifications for each nutrient corresponds to a nutrient application factor f1 which is multiplied by the amount of nutrient absorbed by the crop delgado et al 2016 jordan meille et al 2012 nutrient application factors of 1 associated with relatively low soil analyses result in a build up approach those 1 associated with higher soil analyses result in a maintenance approach for p and k the classification of soil fertility considers soil texture there being two classification systems depending on whether the soil corresponds to soil texture group 1 or 2 table 1 fuentes yagüe 1994 the soil total carbonate content is also considered for p fuentes yagüe 1994 the f1 values for p in table 1 correspond to soils with carbonate contents of 20 for carbonate contents 20 the f1 factor is increased by 0 2 for soils classified as medium and low to precisely relate fertiliser recommendations to measured soil analysis values a best fit function was derived for each nutrient for the relation between the soil analysis value and the associated f1 factor these functions relate the average value of each classification range vl l m h vh to the corresponding f1 values for that range tables 1 and 2 in the case of p the highest olsen p value see fig 2 was included to ensure that the range of olsen p included values commonly obtained in almeria greenhouses for p hyperbolic decline equations were fitted for k ca and mg linear regressions were fitted the coefficients of the fitted equations for each nutrient are presented in table 2 graphical examples of these functions for p and k for soil type 1 with low carbonate content are presented in fig 2 for exchangeable k ca and mg antagonistic effects were considered based on soil analysis results expressed in meq 100 g the antagonistic effects considered are related to mg k ratios and to ca mg ratios mg k ratios of 2 can induce mg deficiency those of 10 can cause k deficiency delgado et al 2016 ca mg ratios of 10 can induce mg deficiency while ratios 2 can cause ca deficiency delgado et al 2016 the nutrient antagonism factor f2 adjusts nutrient applications to reduce the risk of antagonisms between k ca and mg the f2 factors listed in table 3 are used to reduce the risk of these cation antagonisms occurring for each cation a combined fertilisation adjustment factor f that combines the nutrient application factor f1 and the nutrient antagonism factor f2 is obtained as f f1 f2 for exchangeable cations f is 0 f 2 and for available p f f1 for each nutrient available p and exchangeable k ca and mg the daily requirement kg ha 1 is calculated as daily simulated crop nutrient uptake multiplied by the fertilisation adjustment factor f following the approach described by jordan meille et al 2012 daily concentrations of each nutrient mmol l 1 are calculated from the daily values of nutrient requirement and daily etc as follows nutrient mmol l 1 daily nutrient requirement daily etc 100 aw where aw is the molecular weight in g weekly nutrient requirements kg ha 1 and weekly etc mm are calculated as the sum of daily requirements during each week the weekly concentration of nutrients mmol l 1 in the nutrient solution are calculated by dividing the weekly nutrient requirement by the weekly etc mm the same calculation procedures are used to determine the nutrient concentration for four week periods for all nutrients the applied concentrations have maximum and minimum permissible limits to avoid excessive applications and to ensure that minimum concentrations are applied the maximum and minimum permissible limits for p are 2 and 0 25 mmol l 1 for k are 10 and 2 mmol l 1 for ca are 6 and 1 mmol l 1 and for mg are 3 and 0 5 mmol l 1 2 4 scenario analysis using the vegsyst dss v2 to demonstrate the use of vegsyst dss v2 a scenario analysis was conducted where the p k ca and mg requirements and concentrations of nutrient solution were calculated for different crops grown in soils with different nutrient status the crops in the scenario analysis were sweet pepper and muskmelon vertically supported as opposed to prostate melon growth which were examined in three hypothetical representative soils the three hypothetical soils representing relatively low average and high soil nutrient status for soils from almeria greenhouse were identified from analysis of a data set of 382 complete soil analyses conducted in 2020 these analyses were from soils from commercial greenhouses in almeria and were conducted by the commercial laboratory labcolor http www labcolor coex es which is closely associated with the large producer association coexphal https www coexphal es the three hypothetical soils were characterised for available phosphorus olsen exchangeable cations k ca and mg soil texture and total carbonate content frequency analysis was conducted for each soil nutrient to identify 1 median soil nutrient status corresponding to 50 of the cumulative frequency ii relatively low soil nutrient status corresponding to 15 of the cumulative frequency and iii relatively high soil nutrient status corresponding to 85 of the cumulative frequency the soil texture for the three hypothetical soils was the most commonly occurring soil texture class the planting dates cropping cycles and greenhouse whitewashing practices application of caco3 suspension to reduce temperature were selected as the most frequently used for these two species in greenhouses in almeria province garcía et al 2016 the cropping cycles used in the scenario analyses were i an autumn winter sweet pepper crop grown from 15 july to 15 february and ii a spring muskmelon crop from 15 february to 15 june the roof transmissivity values following application of whitewashing with caco3 suspension were for sweet pepper 20 from 15 july to 31 august and 35 from 1 september to 30 september for the remaining periods for sweet pepper and for the duration of the muskmelon crop the transmissivity was 65 which is typical of non whitewashed plastic greenhouses in almeria fernández et al 2010 no white washing was used with the muskmelon crop in the scenario analysis 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the vegsyst model v3 for uptake of macronutrients in pepper and melon the relationships between crop contents of p k ca and mg with dmp were described by power equations with r2 values of 0 52 0 94 table 4 the coefficients of the power equations between the content of each nutrient and dmp table 4 were used as calibration parameters for the simulation of nutrient uptake in vegsyst model v3 simulated values of p k ca and mg cumulative uptake were plotted against measured cumulative values for the calibration and validation crops in sweet pepper and muskmelon fig 3a d for p k and mg uptake in sweet pepper most values were close to the 1 1 line fig 3a b d indicating that the model adequately simulated p k and mg uptake in the three validation crops the statistical indices used table 5 showed good model performance for simulation of p k and mg uptake in sweet pepper table 5 for these simulations re values were 0 25 and d 0 97 table 5 the only exception to generally good simulation of p k and mg uptake in sweet pepper was the simulation of p in the pepper 14 crop where p uptake was slightly underestimated m 0 75 and the re was 0 35 table 5 larger errors occurred with the simulation of ca uptake in two of the three sweet pepper validation crops with re values of 0 48 and 0 41 for pepper 16 and pepper 17 respectively table 5 there was a general tendency to overestimate ca uptake m 1 3 in the pepper 16 and pepper 17 crops table 5 fig 3c in contrast the simulation of ca uptake in the pepper 14 crop was good re 0 16 the validation muskmelon crop melon 21 had excellent performance for the simulation of uptake of all macronutrients as indicated by the statistical indices re 0 25 d 0 99 table 5 and the very close proximity of values to the 1 1 line fig 3a d 3 2 characterisation of greenhouse soils in almeria the results of the frequency analysis of the soil data base for available olsen p and exchangeable k ca and mg are presented in fig 4 and for total carbonate content and soil texture in fig 5 for each parameter except texture the frequencies are presented as both relative and cumulative relative values all nutrients had a skewed distribution with high numbers of occurrences of values within relatively limited ranges and a large spread of a smaller number of occurrences in higher ranges fig 4 for available olsen p 72 of soils had values within the range of 200 400 mg kg 1 fig 4a for exchangeable k 88 of soils were within the range of 200 600 mg kg 1 fig 4b for exchangeable ca 80 of soils were within the range of 800 1600 mg kg 1 fig 4c for exchangeable mg 85 of soils were within the range of 200 400 mg kg 1 fig 4d regarding total carbonate content 73 of greenhouse soils were in the range of 5 20 fig 5a the most commonly occurring textures were sandy loam 33 of soils and sandy clay loam 20 of soils fig 5b both being soil texture type 1 as defined in section 2 3 in general the predominant soil textures were medium low and medium textures fig 5 these frequency analyses were used to identify theoretical greenhouse soils in almeria with relatively low medium and high status for available p and exchangeable k ca and mg and total carbonates content table 6 for each of these parameters medium low and high relative values were obtained respectively as the median and the values corresponding to cumulative relative frequencies of 15 and 85 the available olsen p content in these relative classes were 140 250 and 490 mg kg 1 in the low medium and high soils respectively table 6 these values of available p in almeria are very high in relation to the values of 26 50 mg kg 1 generally considered adequate for high yield crops in loamy soils table 1 for exchangeable k relatively low medium high values in greenhouse soils in almeria were 80 240 and 513 mg kg 1 respectively table 6 these relative classifications for exchangeable k in almeria soils are similar to those in the classes of low medium and high for the general interpretation of soil test results presented in table 1 for exchangeable ca and mg the categories for the relative distribution of results in greenhouse soils of almeria table 6 were similar to those for the general interpretation of soil test results presented in table 1 3 3 scenario analysis using vegsyst dss adapted for macronutrients recommendations the seasonal evolution of the concentration of p k ca and mg in the nutrient solution recommended by the vegsyst dss v3 for the three different scenarios relatively low medium and high soil nutrient status in almeria greenhouses are presented for sweet pepper in fig 6a c e g and for muskmelon in fig 6b d f h the concentrations recommended to farmers for soil grown crops in almeria greenhouses fernandez rodriguez and camacho ferre 2013 are included in each panel these recommendations are considered here to be farmers practice for the scenario of high relative soil nutrient status the concentrations recommended by the dss were consistently much lower than those used by farmers fig 6 table 7 for soils of medium relative soil nutrient status the concentrations recommended by the dss were generally consistently lower than those used by farmers fig 6 table 7 the only exceptions in the scenario medium were dss recommendations of k in sweet pepper and ca in muskmelon which were similar to or slightly above farmer practice during part of the season fig 6c f for scenario low the dss recommended concentrations were below or equal to farmers practice for p ca and mg in sweet pepper and for p k and mg in muskmelon fig 6 table 7 in the low scenario the dss recommendations for k in sweet pepper and ca in muskmelon were slightly above farmers practice fig 6c f in the three p scenarios the initial recommended p concentration as calculated was close to zero throughout the crop fig 4 because of the generally very high levels of available p in greenhouse soils in almeria table 6 as described in section 2 3 the dss has maximum and minimum permissible concentrations for each nutrient in the three scenarios with p the minimum permissible p concentration of 0 25 mmol l 1 was applied fig 6a similarly in pepper and melon for the high k scenarios the minimum permissible concentration of 2 mmol l 1 was applied because the initial calculated concentrations were close to zero fig 6c d averaged throughout the crop the dss recommended concentrations were generally lower than or were similar to farmers practice for both sweet pepper and muskmelon table 7 the only clear exception was k in the low scenario for sweet pepper table 7 the ratios of dss recommended nutrient amounts to farmer practice were generally 1 for sweet pepper for the high medium and low scenarios these ratios for k were 0 35 1 1 and 1 5 and for ca and mg they were 0 4 0 6 and 0 7 table 7 for muskmelon for the high medium and low scenarios these ratios for k were 0 6 0 9 and 1 1 for ca and mg they were 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 table 7 in general the recommended amounts of applied nutrients in the scenario analyses were higher than modelled crop uptake for both pepper and melon table 7 there were some exceptions being i recommended applied p in all scenarios was very low because of the very high contents of available soil p in these soils ii k in the high scenario for both crops where recommended amounts were well below crop uptake and iii ca and mg in the high scenarios for both crops where amounts were similar to crop uptake table 7 4 discussion 4 1 simulation of macronutrients uptake in this study vegsyst model v3 was calibrated and validated to simulate daily and seasonal uptake of p k ca and mg for sweet pepper and muskmelon crops grown in soil in greenhouses in se spain vegsyst model v3 provided generally good simulation of the uptake of these macronutrients in sweet pepper and muskmelon crops in sweet pepper simulation was good for p k and mg uptake in three validation crops simulation of ca uptake was poor because of overestimation in two of the sweet pepper validation crops it was good in a third validation crop in muskmelon there was excellent performance for the simulation of p k ca and mg uptake in the validation crop by combining the work reported here with i gallardo et al 2021 who calibrated the vegsyst model for p k ca and mg uptake in tomato and ii gallardo et al 2016 who calibrated n uptake for various species an expanded version of vegsyst model v3 was produced which simulates uptake of all macro nutrients n p k ca and mg in tomato pepper and melon three of the most important species grown in greenhouses in se spain few models simulate the uptake of macronutrients other than n in vegetable crops grown in greenhouses generally the models that have been developed are aggregations of scientific knowledge or have been produced specifically for substrate grown crops some models are mechanistic with considerable data input marcelis et al 2005 bar yosef et al 2004 ramírez pérez et al 2018 others have been developed for closed soilless crops e g bar yosef et al 2004 the empirical model of pardossi et al 2004 for melon and the simulation model of crop water and mineral relations of massa et al 2011 the hortisyst model for tomato martínez ruiz et al 2019 was developed for open soilless crops there are very few simulation models of macronutrient uptake that can be used for practical nutrient management of soil grown greenhouse vegetable crops 4 2 vegsyst dss v2 vegsyst dss v2 which incorporates the present work and previous studies gallardo et al 2014 2016 2021 provides recommendations of n p k ca and mg and irrigation for sweet pepper supported muskmelon and tomato the work reported here developed the dss component for p k ca and mg recommendations for sweet pepper and muskmelon until further data are available it is recommended that vegsyst be calibrated for environments other than almeria particularly when these environments differ appreciably from the conditions in almeria there are several available dsss for nutrient management of vegetable crops gallardo et al 2020 most were developed to assist with n fertilisation of outdoor crops e g azofert machet et al 2007 n expert 4 feller 2015 considers n p and k but it is for mechanically applied fertilisers not those applied by fertigation gescon elia and conversa 2015 provides n and irrigation recommendations for fertigated outdoor processing tomato crops similarly fertirrigere v2 11 battilani et al 2006 provides fertigation recommendations of several macronutrients but only for open field processing tomato to our knowledge vegsyst dss v2 is the only dss that provides site and crop specific recommendations of irrigation and n p k ca and mg applied by fertigation to vegetable crops grown in soil in greenhouses 4 3 scenario analysis the scenario analyses conducted in this work showed that by considering crop demand and soil nutritional status appreciable reductions can be achieved in the amounts of macronutrients applied to soil grown sweet pepper and muskmelon crops in greenhouses in almeria previous work demonstrated similar results for n management in greenhouse soil grown tomato gallardo et al 2014 once suitable calibrations are available this approach can be used to obtain similar appreciable reductions in nutrient application for all vegetable species grown in greenhouses in almeria the soil test results from 2020 that were used for the scenario analysis confirmed an earlier study gil de carrasco 2000 that suggested high levels of available p and exchangeable k in greenhouse soils in almeria the available p contents in 2020 were particularly high 4 4 using vegsyst dss to provide recommendations for nutrient solutions vegsyst dss v2 developed in this work provides recommendations of the concentration of n p k ca and mg in an ideal nutrient solution that considers species cropping cycle soil characteristics and fertility climate and crop management e g roof whitening for cooling the dss calculates daily values of recommended concentration however the recommended concentrations are presented to users for four week periods by doing so users can see the overall value for a given period and trends the dss is prepared for users having fertigation systems with several tanks of different concentrated fertiliser solutions such fertigation systems enable periodic adjustment of the nutrient solution during the crop for practical use of vegsyst dss v2 recommendations various practical adjustments will be made to the ideal nutrient solution as generally occurs with recommended nutrient solutions in farming practice users will need to make adjustments to the composition of the nutrient solution to consider factors such as i nutrients present in the irrigation water ii the composition of the compound fertilisers used to prepare the concentrated fertiliser solutions in the various tanks and iii ph adjustment these adjustments will result in some differences to the recommended ideal concentrations the plans prepared prior to cropping with vegsyst dss and after making the previously referred to adjustments are the prescriptive component of a prescriptive corrective approach granados et al 2013 thompson et al 2017a 2017b being developed for fertigated vegetable crops in se spain where it is used in combination with regular corrective monitoring management such as petiole sap or soil solution analysis rodríguez et al 2020b 2021 adjustments would be made to the composition of the applied nutrient solution to ensure optical crop nutrition similarly users can adjust the composition of the applied nutrient solution to take into account aspects such as crop phenology climate or soil conditions e g soils with very low p reserves it is recognised that the approach of basing nutrient solution composition on crop demand and soil supply of available nutrients rather than the established practice of using of standard solutions that sometimes consider phenology will meet some resistance this different approach will initially be something of a philosophical challenge for growers and advisors in this system with time it is anticipated that growers will see that these recommendations will enable appreciable savings in fertiliser use without risking production to further evaluate this dss and to facilitate its adoption a number of trials and demonstrations will be undertaken in commercial greenhouses in almeria and various countries of the mediterranean basin in the near future relative to september 2022 in future developments real time and forecast climate data could be used given that suitable interfaces are developed to automatically supply such data to the dss this would permit real time calculation of nutrient concentration recommendations or the preparation of nutrient recommendations for coming periods of for example one week 5 conclusions for greenhouse soil grown pepper and melon vegsyst model v3 simulated k p ca and mg uptake in validation crops of sweet pepper and muskmelon the exception was ca uptake in two of the three validation crops in sweet pepper which was overestimated vegsyst dss v2 which incorporates vegsyst model v3 was developed which provides recommendations of the concentrations of n p k ca and mg to be applied in the fertigation nutrient solution in mmol l 1 considering the available exchangeable content of these nutrients in soil and crop uptake simulated with the vegsyst model three theoretical scenarios of nutrient recommendations for representative cropping cycles of sweet pepper and muskmelon in soils with relatively low medium and high available nutrient content were calculated using vegsyst dss v2 and compared to farmers practice for all scenarios with p a minimum permissible application of p was recommended by the dss because of the very high contents of available p in all greenhouse soils in almeria for the most commonly occurring available nutrient content scenario medium scenario the dss recommendations for cations were generally 60 of farmers practice the exceptions were k in sweet pepper and ca in muskmelon where the recommendations were similar to farmers practice for soils with relatively high contents of available nutrients the dss recommendations were appreciably lower being generally 20 60 of farmers practice for soils relatively low in available nutrients the dss recommendations were generally similar to or slightly less than farmers practice they were relatively somewhat higher for k in sweet pepper this work showed that is possible to reduce appreciably the application of various nutrients in sweet pepper and muskmelon crops in greenhouses of almeria

9097,vegsyst model v3 was calibrated and validated to simulate daily and seasonal p k ca and mg uptake of soil grown sweet pepper and muskmelon crops in greenhouses in se spain the model adequately simulated p k and mg uptake in three validation crops of sweet pepper and ca uptake in one crop p k ca and mg uptake were accurately simulated in one validation muskmelon crop the decision support system vegsyst dss v2 was developed by adding a component for recommendations of p k ca and mg for pepper and muskmelon to vegsyst dss v1 the new dss component which combines with vegsyst model v3 calculates i daily p k ca and mg requirement in kg ha 1 and ii nutrient concentration recommendations for fertigation nutrient solution considering soil available exchangeable content and simulated crop uptake recommended concentrations of p k ca and mg in mmol l 1 are calculated from simulated uptake of each nutrient and crop evapotranspiration etc scenario analyses were conducted for nutrient recommendations of representative cropping cycles of pepper and melon with hypothetical soils of relatively low medium and high p k ca and mg availability obtained from a local soil database the scenario analyses showed most soils had ample available soil p and required minimal applications of p for soils with relatively high levels of available nutrients dss recommendations were much lower 20 60 than farming practice for soils with a medium supply of available nutrients the dss recommendations were generally approximately 60 of farmer practice except for k in pepper and ca in muskmelon for soils that were relatively low in available nutrients the recommendations were generally similar to or slightly less than farming practice the crop and greenhouse specific recommendations of vegsyst dss v2 can appreciably reduce the application of p k ca and mg while meeting crop requirements keywords decision support system model phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium soil nutrient solution data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the greenhouse vegetable production system located in southeastern se spain is one of the most important economic sectors in this region this system is mostly concentrated in the province of almeria where there are currently 32 550 ha of greenhouses cajamar 2021 two of the most important crops are sweet pepper and melon within this system sweet pepper and melon are grown respectively on 12 300 and 3200 ha annually cajamar 2021 the annual value of pepper and melon production are approximately 700 and 43 4 million respectively cajamar 2021 depending on price sweet pepper is generally the most or second most important crop in this greenhouse system in terms of cropping area sweet pepper is mostly grown with a summer to winter cropping cycle and melon with a spring to summer cycle often these two crops are grown in sequence approximately 90 of the greenhouse surface area in se spain is cropped in soil garcía et al 2016 in this system irrigation and nutrients are automatically applied to both soil and substrate grown drip irrigated vegetable crops using advanced fertigation systems garcía et al 2016 thompson et al 2007 2017a nutrient solutions commonly supplying all essential nutrients are applied in each irrigation to soil grown crops the fertigation systems used have the technical capacity to frequently apply nutrients and irrigation throughout a crop as required by the crop thompson et al 2017a however this technical capacity is not effectively used because most growers apply nutrients and irrigation based on local experience of what ensures high levels of production thompson et al 2007 2017a there is little use of science based tools and approaches to optimise nutrient and irrigation application thompson et al 2017a 2017b 2020 the most commonly used type of fertigation system in soil grown vegetable crops in almeria greenhouses is the use of several tanks most commonly 3 4 of concentrated fertiliser solution generally with one or two fertilisers per tank garcía et al 2016 these concentrated solutions are added to the irrigation water through venturi valves or dosing pumps generally standard nutrient concentrations are applied in the nutrient solution these are normally either constant for 1 a phenological phase with 3 4 phases during a crop or 2 the duration of a crop fernández rodríguez and camacho ferre 2013 while the customary use of standard complete nutrient solutions is associated with profitable production it is also associated with excessive nutrient application this has resulted in considerable nitrate no3 contamination of underlying aquifers pulido bosch et al 2018 and the accumulation of available phosphorus p and exchangeable potassium k in greenhouse soils gil de carrasco 2000 all greenhouse production areas in the province of almeria and in neighbouring provinces have been designated as being nitrate vulnerable zones boja 2020a and are required to implement improved crop nutrient management practices boja 2020b in addition to the environmental consequences the established nutrient management practices represent an on going unnecessary cost for growers consequently for both economic and environmental reasons there is a pressing requirement to develop and implement science based crop nutrient management of all macronutrients to replace the experiential management being used for optimal nutrient management of soil grown greenhouse crops numerous factors must be considered such as available soil nutrient supply climate soil and crop characteristics and greenhouse characteristics user friendly decision support systems dsss can process large and diverse amounts of information to provide nutrient and irrigation recommendations for greenhouse vegetable production gallardo et al 2020 the incorporation of simulation models into such dsss enables crop and site specific assessment gallardo et al 2020 the currently available vegsyst dss v1 provides recommendations of nitrogen n concentration in the nutrient solution n fertiliser rate and irrigation volumes for seven vegetable species grown in greenhouses in almeria gallardo et al 2014 2016 a ms windows compatible computer programme gallardo et al 2017 is available in english and spanish https w3 ual es gruposinv nitrogeno vegsyst dss shtml vegsyst dss v1 is based on the vegsyst simulation model gallardo et al 2011 2014 2016 which calculates daily dry matter production dmp crop n uptake and crop evapotranspiration etc vegsyst dss v1 uses these outputs to calculate crop n and irrigation requirements and the recommended applied n concentration gallardo et al 2014 vegsyst dss prepares plans of nutrient recommendations as concentration or rate prior to cropping using long term climate data within almeria greenhouses in a stable mediterranean climate long term climatic data are very similar to real time data bonachela et al 2006 it is intended that the nutrient plans prepared by vegsyst dss will be the prescriptive component of a package of prescriptive corrective management granados et al 2013 thompson et al 2017a 2017b the intended corrective or monitoring component involving for example petiole sap and or soil solution analysis thompson et al 2017a 2017b using on farm rapid analysis peña fleitas et al 2021 will enable rapid manual adjustment of the applied nutrient solution to ensure on going optimal crop nutritional status considering that in this system the macronutrients k p ca and mg are normally applied in each irrigation using standard concentrations based on what works and that excessive soil p and k accumulation is occurring gil de carrasco 2000 there is a need to develop science based recommendation systems for these macronutrients incorporating these macronutrients into vegsyst dss will enable the preparation of nutrient solutions in which the concentrations of all macronutrients n k p ca and mg meet the specific requirements of each crop and greenhouse on a scientific basis for soil grown crops a prior step to being able to provide recommendations for these macronutrients with the vegsyst dss is the simulation of daily nutrient uptake by the vegsyst model component of the dss gallardo et al 2016 recently gallardo et al 2021 adapted the vegsyst model to simulate crop uptake of k p ca and mg of greenhouse tomato producing vegsyst model v3 the present work consists of three components firstly the vegsyst model was calibrated and validated to simulate daily and seasonal uptake of p k ca and mg for soil grown sweet pepper and muskmelon crops in greenhouses in se spain secondly the revised dss vegsyst dss v2 was developed by adding a new component to vegsyst dss v1 for recommendations of the macronutrients p k ca and mg for these two species that considers crop demand and soil nutrient availability thirdly vegsyst dss v2 was used to conduct scenario analyses to demonstrate how recommended concentrations and amounts of k p ca and mg vary with soil nutrient availability using soil test results from a local soil testing laboratory 2 materials and methods 2 1 crops and determinations four crops of sweet pepper capsicum annuum l and two of muskmelon cucumis melo l were grown in soil in a plastic greenhouse under similar conditions to those of commercial intensive vegetable production in southeastern se spain at the experimental station of the university of almeria in retamar almeria se spain 36 51 n 2 16 w and 92 m elevation the cropping area of the greenhouse was 1300 m2 the greenhouse the soil and the configuration of the drip system are described by rodríguez et al 2020a the four sweet pepper crops were california type cv melchor zeraim iberica syngenta and were grown during autumn winter the two muskmelon crops were both cantaloupe type cv tezac in 2020 and cv bosito in 2021 seminis inc bayer and were grown during spring summer the

hereafter referred to as melon 21 was grown from 26 february to 7 june 2021 101 days drip irrigation and fertigation were used in all crops all macronutrients and micronutrients were applied throughout the crops by fertigation in all irrigations to ensure that none of them were limiting the concentrations applied were very similar to those recommended for local commercial farmers fernández rodríguez and camacho ferre 2013 these concentrations are similar to those used with crops grown in substrate with no nutrient supplying capacity fernández rodríguez and camacho ferre 2013 the average composition of the nutrient solutions used are indicated in supplementary table 1 irrigation was scheduled using tensiometers to maintain the soil matric potential in the root zone at 15 cm depth within 10 to 30 kpa for all crops climatic conditions of air temperature and relative humidity and solar radiation were continuously monitored inside the greenhouse as described by rodriguez et al 2020a to determine the crop content of k p ca and mg representative oven dried samples of i leaves stems and fruits from regular biomass samplings ii all pruned material and iii fruit from various harvests were separately finely ground contents of k p ca and mg were determined by inductively coupled plasma icp spectrometry model icap 6500duo thermofisher scientific ma usa after acid digestion above ground crop uptake of k p ca and mg was calculated for each biomass sampling in each crop as the sum of uptake in leaves stems and immature fruit plus the uptake in pruned and harvested material until the biomass sampling for each crop component on each date uptake was calculated as the product of dry matter production dmp and the crop content of the nutrient additionally data of rincón et al 1995 were included in the current study to provide additional data on the relationship of the crop p content to dmp in sweet pepper this crop was grown in a plastic greenhouse using drip irrigation and fertigation crop management followed local practices this sweet pepper crop was grown from 27 december 1991 30 may 1992 with a planting density of 2 5 plants m 2 there were nine samplings of dmp in each sampling crop p uptake was determined full details of the experiment and methodology are available in rincón et al 1995 2 2 calibration and validation of the vegsyst model for uptake of macronutrients the vegsyst model was calibrated to simulate above ground uptake of macronutrients in sweet pepper and muskmelon following the procedures described by gallardo et al 2021 for tomato the uptake of p k ca and mg for a given day i was the product of dmpi i e the dmp of that day and the simulated crop nutrient content nutrienti of the same day which was calculated as 1 nutrienti a x dmp b i were a and b are the equation coefficients for the best fitting power equations describing the relationship of nutrient content to dmp for the calibration of sweet pepper for k ca and mg data of dmp and nutrient contents from the pepper 20 crop were used to derive the equation coefficients for p in sweet pepper data from the pepper 20 crop and rincón et al 1995 were used for muskmelon data from the melon 20 crop were used all these crops are described in section 2 1 for each nutrient daily uptake was calculated as the product of simulated daily dmp with the vegsyst model and the simulated daily nutrient content eq 1 the equations used to simulate daily values of dmp crop n uptake and etc in the vegsyst model are described in gallardo et al 2016 the performance of the simulation of p k ca and mg uptake in sweet pepper and muskmelon by vegsyst model v3 was validated using experimental data from three pepper crops pepper 14 pepper 16 and pepper 17 and one muskmelon crop melon 21 all described in section 2 1 to evaluate the agreement between simulated and measured values the following statistical indices were used i the root mean square error rmse ii the relative error re stöckle et al 2004 iii the willmott index of agreement d willmott 1982 and iv the slope m and coefficient of determination r2 of the linear regression between simulated and measured values values of re 0 25 and d 0 75 were considered to indicate adequate model performance following yang et al 2014 2 3 development of the vegsyst dss v2 for recommendations of fertiliser requirements and concentrations in the nutrient solution for p k ca and mg an appreciably revised version of vegsyst dss vegsyst dss v2 is described here which compared to the previous version gallardo et al 2014 provides recommendations of the p k ca and mg concentrations in the applied nutrient solution in mmol l 1 and the recommended amounts of these macronutrients in kg ha 1 vegsyst dss v2 consists of the vegsyst simulation model v3 that calculates daily uptake of p k ca and mg and a revised dss component that estimates crop requirements of these four nutrients considering crop uptake and soil test results a schematic representation of vegsyst dss v2 is presented in fig 1 which shows the calculations made by the vegsyst simulation model v3 component and the calculations of recommended amounts and concentrations made by the complementary modified dss component a prototype of vegsyst dss v2 was prepared in microsoft excel 365 the vegsyst simulation model v3 component for crop p k ca and mg uptake was calibrated for sweet pepper and muskmelon as the product of i the simulated daily crop p k ca and mg content described in section 2 2 and ii simulated daily dmp the calibration parameters for dmp and etc in the simulation model component were described in gallardo et al 2016 only the new modules for p k ca and mg are described here the new component in vegsyst dss v2 calculates the daily p k ca and mg requirement in kg ha 1 considering their available exchangeable content in soil and crop uptake the strategy used to interpret soil analysis results is an adaptation of the build up or maintenance approaches described by delgado et al 2016 with these approaches when a soil analysis result is below a threshold value a build up approach is used that applies sufficient fertiliser to increase soil fertility when the soil analysis result is above the threshold value a maintenance approach is used that applies fertiliser to compensate or partly compensate for crop removal of the nutrient the daily crop nutrient uptake values are used with daily etc to calculate daily applied nutrient concentration values the daily values of nutrient uptake and etc are summed for four week periods to calculate recommended nutrient concentrations for four week periods which is how nutrient concentration output is provided the new p k ca and mg component of vegsyst dss v2 requires measured data of a general soil parameters such as texture organic matter and total carbonate content and of b a recent soil analysis of the available exchangeable forms of these nutrients nitrogen which forms part of vegsyst dss v2 is described elsewhere gallardo et al 2014 2016 for texture soils are classified as either type 1 sandy sandy loam loam sandy clay loam silty loam sandy clay or type 2 clay loam silty clay loam clay for available p the olsen extraction is used as it is widely used in spain and is suited to alkaline soils which are predominant in coastal se spain to interpret the results of soil analysis classifications were developed for interpreting available p and exchangeable k ca and mg table 1 considering the interpretation systems of delgado et al 2016 jordan meille et al 2012 and hartz 2020 and a local soil laboratory http www labcolor coex es associated with a large local farmers association coexphal https www coexphal es five classification ranges were developed for p and k being very low vl low l medium m high h and very high vh four classification ranges were developed for ca and mg being vl l m and h table 1 each of these classifications for each nutrient corresponds to a nutrient application factor f1 which is multiplied by the amount of nutrient absorbed by the crop delgado et al 2016 jordan meille et al 2012 nutrient application factors of 1 associated with relatively low soil analyses result in a build up approach those 1 associated with higher soil analyses result in a maintenance approach for p and k the classification of soil fertility considers soil texture there being two classification systems depending on whether the soil corresponds to soil texture group 1 or 2 table 1 fuentes yagüe 1994 the soil total carbonate content is also considered for p fuentes yagüe 1994 the f1 values for p in table 1 correspond to soils with carbonate contents of 20 for carbonate contents 20 the f1 factor is increased by 0 2 for soils classified as medium and low to precisely relate fertiliser recommendations to measured soil analysis values a best fit function was derived for each nutrient for the relation between the soil analysis value and the associated f1 factor these functions relate the average value of each classification range vl l m h vh to the corresponding f1 values for that range tables 1 and 2 in the case of p the highest olsen p value see fig 2 was included to ensure that the range of olsen p included values commonly obtained in almeria greenhouses for p hyperbolic decline equations were fitted for k ca and mg linear regressions were fitted the coefficients of the fitted equations for each nutrient are presented in table 2 graphical examples of these functions for p and k for soil type 1 with low carbonate content are presented in fig 2 for exchangeable k ca and mg antagonistic effects were considered based on soil analysis results expressed in meq 100 g the antagonistic effects considered are related to mg k ratios and to ca mg ratios mg k ratios of 2 can induce mg deficiency those of 10 can cause k deficiency delgado et al 2016 ca mg ratios of 10 can induce mg deficiency while ratios 2 can cause ca deficiency delgado et al 2016 the nutrient antagonism factor f2 adjusts nutrient applications to reduce the risk of antagonisms between k ca and mg the f2 factors listed in table 3 are used to reduce the risk of these cation antagonisms occurring for each cation a combined fertilisation adjustment factor f that combines the nutrient application factor f1 and the nutrient antagonism factor f2 is obtained as f f1 f2 for exchangeable cations f is 0 f 2 and for available p f f1 for each nutrient available p and exchangeable k ca and mg the daily requirement kg ha 1 is calculated as daily simulated crop nutrient uptake multiplied by the fertilisation adjustment factor f following the approach described by jordan meille et al 2012 daily concentrations of each nutrient mmol l 1 are calculated from the daily values of nutrient requirement and daily etc as follows nutrient mmol l 1 daily nutrient requirement daily etc 100 aw where aw is the molecular weight in g weekly nutrient requirements kg ha 1 and weekly etc mm are calculated as the sum of daily requirements during each week the weekly concentration of nutrients mmol l 1 in the nutrient solution are calculated by dividing the weekly nutrient requirement by the weekly etc mm the same calculation procedures are used to determine the nutrient concentration for four week periods for all nutrients the applied concentrations have maximum and minimum permissible limits to avoid excessive applications and to ensure that minimum concentrations are applied the maximum and minimum permissible limits for p are 2 and 0 25 mmol l 1 for k are 10 and 2 mmol l 1 for ca are 6 and 1 mmol l 1 and for mg are 3 and 0 5 mmol l 1 2 4 scenario analysis using the vegsyst dss v2 to demonstrate the use of vegsyst dss v2 a scenario analysis was conducted where the p k ca and mg requirements and concentrations of nutrient solution were calculated for different crops grown in soils with different nutrient status the crops in the scenario analysis were sweet pepper and muskmelon vertically supported as opposed to prostate melon growth which were examined in three hypothetical representative soils the three hypothetical soils representing relatively low average and high soil nutrient status for soils from almeria greenhouse were identified from analysis of a data set of 382 complete soil analyses conducted in 2020 these analyses were from soils from commercial greenhouses in almeria and were conducted by the commercial laboratory labcolor http www labcolor coex es which is closely associated with the large producer association coexphal https www coexphal es the three hypothetical soils were characterised for available phosphorus olsen exchangeable cations k ca and mg soil texture and total carbonate content frequency analysis was conducted for each soil nutrient to identify 1 median soil nutrient status corresponding to 50 of the cumulative frequency ii relatively low soil nutrient status corresponding to 15 of the cumulative frequency and iii relatively high soil nutrient status corresponding to 85 of the cumulative frequency the soil texture for the three hypothetical soils was the most commonly occurring soil texture class the planting dates cropping cycles and greenhouse whitewashing practices application of caco3 suspension to reduce temperature were selected as the most frequently used for these two species in greenhouses in almeria province garcía et al 2016 the cropping cycles used in the scenario analyses were i an autumn winter sweet pepper crop grown from 15 july to 15 february and ii a spring muskmelon crop from 15 february to 15 june the roof transmissivity values following application of whitewashing with caco3 suspension were for sweet pepper 20 from 15 july to 31 august and 35 from 1 september to 30 september for the remaining periods for sweet pepper and for the duration of the muskmelon crop the transmissivity was 65 which is typical of non whitewashed plastic greenhouses in almeria fernández et al 2010 no white washing was used with the muskmelon crop in the scenario analysis 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the vegsyst model v3 for uptake of macronutrients in pepper and melon the relationships between crop contents of p k ca and mg with dmp were described by power equations with r2 values of 0 52 0 94 table 4 the coefficients of the power equations between the content of each nutrient and dmp table 4 were used as calibration parameters for the simulation of nutrient uptake in vegsyst model v3 simulated values of p k ca and mg cumulative uptake were plotted against measured cumulative values for the calibration and validation crops in sweet pepper and muskmelon fig 3a d for p k and mg uptake in sweet pepper most values were close to the 1 1 line fig 3a b d indicating that the model adequately simulated p k and mg uptake in the three validation crops the statistical indices used table 5 showed good model performance for simulation of p k and mg uptake in sweet pepper table 5 for these simulations re values were 0 25 and d 0 97 table 5 the only exception to generally good simulation of p k and mg uptake in sweet pepper was the simulation of p in the pepper 14 crop where p uptake was slightly underestimated m 0 75 and the re was 0 35 table 5 larger errors occurred with the simulation of ca uptake in two of the three sweet pepper validation crops with re values of 0 48 and 0 41 for pepper 16 and pepper 17 respectively table 5 there was a general tendency to overestimate ca uptake m 1 3 in the pepper 16 and pepper 17 crops table 5 fig 3c in contrast the simulation of ca uptake in the pepper 14 crop was good re 0 16 the validation muskmelon crop melon 21 had excellent performance for the simulation of uptake of all macronutrients as indicated by the statistical indices re 0 25 d 0 99 table 5 and the very close proximity of values to the 1 1 line fig 3a d 3 2 characterisation of greenhouse soils in almeria the results of the frequency analysis of the soil data base for available olsen p and exchangeable k ca and mg are presented in fig 4 and for total carbonate content and soil texture in fig 5 for each parameter except texture the frequencies are presented as both relative and cumulative relative values all nutrients had a skewed distribution with high numbers of occurrences of values within relatively limited ranges and a large spread of a smaller number of occurrences in higher ranges fig 4 for available olsen p 72 of soils had values within the range of 200 400 mg kg 1 fig 4a for exchangeable k 88 of soils were within the range of 200 600 mg kg 1 fig 4b for exchangeable ca 80 of soils were within the range of 800 1600 mg kg 1 fig 4c for exchangeable mg 85 of soils were within the range of 200 400 mg kg 1 fig 4d regarding total carbonate content 73 of greenhouse soils were in the range of 5 20 fig 5a the most commonly occurring textures were sandy loam 33 of soils and sandy clay loam 20 of soils fig 5b both being soil texture type 1 as defined in section 2 3 in general the predominant soil textures were medium low and medium textures fig 5 these frequency analyses were used to identify theoretical greenhouse soils in almeria with relatively low medium and high status for available p and exchangeable k ca and mg and total carbonates content table 6 for each of these parameters medium low and high relative values were obtained respectively as the median and the values corresponding to cumulative relative frequencies of 15 and 85 the available olsen p content in these relative classes were 140 250 and 490 mg kg 1 in the low medium and high soils respectively table 6 these values of available p in almeria are very high in relation to the values of 26 50 mg kg 1 generally considered adequate for high yield crops in loamy soils table 1 for exchangeable k relatively low medium high values in greenhouse soils in almeria were 80 240 and 513 mg kg 1 respectively table 6 these relative classifications for exchangeable k in almeria soils are similar to those in the classes of low medium and high for the general interpretation of soil test results presented in table 1 for exchangeable ca and mg the categories for the relative distribution of results in greenhouse soils of almeria table 6 were similar to those for the general interpretation of soil test results presented in table 1 3 3 scenario analysis using vegsyst dss adapted for macronutrients recommendations the seasonal evolution of the concentration of p k ca and mg in the nutrient solution recommended by the vegsyst dss v3 for the three different scenarios relatively low medium and high soil nutrient status in almeria greenhouses are presented for sweet pepper in fig 6a c e g and for muskmelon in fig 6b d f h the concentrations recommended to farmers for soil grown crops in almeria greenhouses fernandez rodriguez and camacho ferre 2013 are included in each panel these recommendations are considered here to be farmers practice for the scenario of high relative soil nutrient status the concentrations recommended by the dss were consistently much lower than those used by farmers fig 6 table 7 for soils of medium relative soil nutrient status the concentrations recommended by the dss were generally consistently lower than those used by farmers fig 6 table 7 the only exceptions in the scenario medium were dss recommendations of k in sweet pepper and ca in muskmelon which were similar to or slightly above farmer practice during part of the season fig 6c f for scenario low the dss recommended concentrations were below or equal to farmers practice for p ca and mg in sweet pepper and for p k and mg in muskmelon fig 6 table 7 in the low scenario the dss recommendations for k in sweet pepper and ca in muskmelon were slightly above farmers practice fig 6c f in the three p scenarios the initial recommended p concentration as calculated was close to zero throughout the crop fig 4 because of the generally very high levels of available p in greenhouse soils in almeria table 6 as described in section 2 3 the dss has maximum and minimum permissible concentrations for each nutrient in the three scenarios with p the minimum permissible p concentration of 0 25 mmol l 1 was applied fig 6a similarly in pepper and melon for the high k scenarios the minimum permissible concentration of 2 mmol l 1 was applied because the initial calculated concentrations were close to zero fig 6c d averaged throughout the crop the dss recommended concentrations were generally lower than or were similar to farmers practice for both sweet pepper and muskmelon table 7 the only clear exception was k in the low scenario for sweet pepper table 7 the ratios of dss recommended nutrient amounts to farmer practice were generally 1 for sweet pepper for the high medium and low scenarios these ratios for k were 0 35 1 1 and 1 5 and for ca and mg they were 0 4 0 6 and 0 7 table 7 for muskmelon for the high medium and low scenarios these ratios for k were 0 6 0 9 and 1 1 for ca and mg they were 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 table 7 in general the recommended amounts of applied nutrients in the scenario analyses were higher than modelled crop uptake for both pepper and melon table 7 there were some exceptions being i recommended applied p in all scenarios was very low because of the very high contents of available soil p in these soils ii k in the high scenario for both crops where recommended amounts were well below crop uptake and iii ca and mg in the high scenarios for both crops where amounts were similar to crop uptake table 7 4 discussion 4 1 simulation of macronutrients uptake in this study vegsyst model v3 was calibrated and validated to simulate daily and seasonal uptake of p k ca and mg for sweet pepper and muskmelon crops grown in soil in greenhouses in se spain vegsyst model v3 provided generally good simulation of the uptake of these macronutrients in sweet pepper and muskmelon crops in sweet pepper simulation was good for p k and mg uptake in three validation crops simulation of ca uptake was poor because of overestimation in two of the sweet pepper validation crops it was good in a third validation crop in muskmelon there was excellent performance for the simulation of p k ca and mg uptake in the validation crop by combining the work reported here with i gallardo et al 2021 who calibrated the vegsyst model for p k ca and mg uptake in tomato and ii gallardo et al 2016 who calibrated n uptake for various species an expanded version of vegsyst model v3 was produced which simulates uptake of all macro nutrients n p k ca and mg in tomato pepper and melon three of the most important species grown in greenhouses in se spain few models simulate the uptake of macronutrients other than n in vegetable crops grown in greenhouses generally the models that have been developed are aggregations of scientific knowledge or have been produced specifically for substrate grown crops some models are mechanistic with considerable data input marcelis et al 2005 bar yosef et al 2004 ramírez pérez et al 2018 others have been developed for closed soilless crops e g bar yosef et al 2004 the empirical model of pardossi et al 2004 for melon and the simulation model of crop water and mineral relations of massa et al 2011 the hortisyst model for tomato martínez ruiz et al 2019 was developed for open soilless crops there are very few simulation models of macronutrient uptake that can be used for practical nutrient management of soil grown greenhouse vegetable crops 4 2 vegsyst dss v2 vegsyst dss v2 which incorporates the present work and previous studies gallardo et al 2014 2016 2021 provides recommendations of n p k ca and mg and irrigation for sweet pepper supported muskmelon and tomato the work reported here developed the dss component for p k ca and mg recommendations for sweet pepper and muskmelon until further data are available it is recommended that vegsyst be calibrated for environments other than almeria particularly when these environments differ appreciably from the conditions in almeria there are several available dsss for nutrient management of vegetable crops gallardo et al 2020 most were developed to assist with n fertilisation of outdoor crops e g azofert machet et al 2007 n expert 4 feller 2015 considers n p and k but it is for mechanically applied fertilisers not those applied by fertigation gescon elia and conversa 2015 provides n and irrigation recommendations for fertigated outdoor processing tomato crops similarly fertirrigere v2 11 battilani et al 2006 provides fertigation recommendations of several macronutrients but only for open field processing tomato to our knowledge vegsyst dss v2 is the only dss that provides site and crop specific recommendations of irrigation and n p k ca and mg applied by fertigation to vegetable crops grown in soil in greenhouses 4 3 scenario analysis the scenario analyses conducted in this work showed that by considering crop demand and soil nutritional status appreciable reductions can be achieved in the amounts of macronutrients applied to soil grown sweet pepper and muskmelon crops in greenhouses in almeria previous work demonstrated similar results for n management in greenhouse soil grown tomato gallardo et al 2014 once suitable calibrations are available this approach can be used to obtain similar appreciable reductions in nutrient application for all vegetable species grown in greenhouses in almeria the soil test results from 2020 that were used for the scenario analysis confirmed an earlier study gil de carrasco 2000 that suggested high levels of available p and exchangeable k in greenhouse soils in almeria the available p contents in 2020 were particularly high 4 4 using vegsyst dss to provide recommendations for nutrient solutions vegsyst dss v2 developed in this work provides recommendations of the concentration of n p k ca and mg in an ideal nutrient solution that considers species cropping cycle soil characteristics and fertility climate and crop management e g roof whitening for cooling the dss calculates daily values of recommended concentration however the recommended concentrations are presented to users for four week periods by doing so users can see the overall value for a given period and trends the dss is prepared for users having fertigation systems with several tanks of different concentrated fertiliser solutions such fertigation systems enable periodic adjustment of the nutrient solution during the crop for practical use of vegsyst dss v2 recommendations various practical adjustments will be made to the ideal nutrient solution as generally occurs with recommended nutrient solutions in farming practice users will need to make adjustments to the composition of the nutrient solution to consider factors such as i nutrients present in the irrigation water ii the composition of the compound fertilisers used to prepare the concentrated fertiliser solutions in the various tanks and iii ph adjustment these adjustments will result in some differences to the recommended ideal concentrations the plans prepared prior to cropping with vegsyst dss and after making the previously referred to adjustments are the prescriptive component of a prescriptive corrective approach granados et al 2013 thompson et al 2017a 2017b being developed for fertigated vegetable crops in se spain where it is used in combination with regular corrective monitoring management such as petiole sap or soil solution analysis rodríguez et al 2020b 2021 adjustments would be made to the composition of the applied nutrient solution to ensure optical crop nutrition similarly users can adjust the composition of the applied nutrient solution to take into account aspects such as crop phenology climate or soil conditions e g soils with very low p reserves it is recognised that the approach of basing nutrient solution composition on crop demand and soil supply of available nutrients rather than the established practice of using of standard solutions that sometimes consider phenology will meet some resistance this different approach will initially be something of a philosophical challenge for growers and advisors in this system with time it is anticipated that growers will see that these recommendations will enable appreciable savings in fertiliser use without risking production to further evaluate this dss and to facilitate its adoption a number of trials and demonstrations will be undertaken in commercial greenhouses in almeria and various countries of the mediterranean basin in the near future relative to september 2022 in future developments real time and forecast climate data could be used given that suitable interfaces are developed to automatically supply such data to the dss this would permit real time calculation of nutrient concentration recommendations or the preparation of nutrient recommendations for coming periods of for example one week 5 conclusions for greenhouse soil grown pepper and melon vegsyst model v3 simulated k p ca and mg uptake in validation crops of sweet pepper and muskmelon the exception was ca uptake in two of the three validation crops in sweet pepper which was overestimated vegsyst dss v2 which incorporates vegsyst model v3 was developed which provides recommendations of the concentrations of n p k ca and mg to be applied in the fertigation nutrient solution in mmol l 1 considering the available exchangeable content of these nutrients in soil and crop uptake simulated with the vegsyst model three theoretical scenarios of nutrient recommendations for representative cropping cycles of sweet pepper and muskmelon in soils with relatively low medium and high available nutrient content were calculated using vegsyst dss v2 and compared to farmers practice for all scenarios with p a minimum permissible application of p was recommended by the dss because of the very high contents of available p in all greenhouse soils in almeria for the most commonly occurring available nutrient content scenario medium scenario the dss recommendations for cations were generally 60 of farmers practice the exceptions were k in sweet pepper and ca in muskmelon where the recommendations were similar to farmers practice for soils with relatively high contents of available nutrients the dss recommendations were appreciably lower being generally 20 60 of farmers practice for soils relatively low in available nutrients the dss recommendations were generally similar to or slightly less than farmers practice they were relatively somewhat higher for k in sweet pepper this work showed that is possible to reduce appreciably the application of various nutrients in sweet pepper and muskmelon crops in greenhouses of almeria

ess threatening food and water security therefore how to optimize ecological restoration patterns to ensure grain yield and ess is an important issue in arid regions this study evaluated the changes in grain yield water yield wy and water purification wp from 2000 to 2020 in the bosten lake region china then planting vegetation pv scenarios on different slopes and riparian vegetation buffer rvb scenarios with different widths were established to reveal the effects of different ecological restoration rules on ess finally the optimal ecological restoration scenario was determined based on es efficiency and trade offs synergies the results showed that grain yield increased 23 83 at the expense of wp and wy 14 76 and 0 57 from 2000 to 2020 the agricultural development scenario further reduced wp 7 99 grain yield increased and wp and wy decreased under the pv scenarios the rvb scenarios had the potential to improve ess guarantee grain yield and eliminate es trade offs the effect of forest restoration on ess was greater than that of grassland restoration and the effect of rvb scenarios on es efficiency was greater than that of pv scenarios with the increase in the riparian buffer zone the wy efficiency increased nonlinearly and the wp efficiency decreased nonlinearly the riparian grass buffer scenarios achieved higher wp at the expense of less wy with the 200 m wide riparian grass buffer being the best ecological restoration scenario the ecological benefits varied with the type location and scale of vegetation restoration this study proposed a framework to determine the optimal ecological restoration pattern the results can provide a scientific reference for water resource management decision making in arid regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords water resource

this expansion is expected to increase with the degree of drought intensifying further huang et al 2016 yao et al 2020 population growth and economic development have brought about increasing demand

expansion of cultivated land in arid regions mostly occurred in water limited areas cai et al 2022 liu et al 2021b in addition nonpoint source pollution caused by agricultural expansion makes water pollution in arid regions increasingly serious and poses challenges to water security wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 thus water resource challenges in arid regions include not only water shortages but also nonpoint source pollution ecosystems in arid regions are fragile and sensitive to water scarcity yao et al 2021 assessing water supply and water quality in arid regions is of great significance for the rational utilization of water resources however previous studies mostly focused on the single aspect of water supply or nonpoint source pollution and rarely considered both water

al 2019 previous studies have often chosen forest restoration for ecological restoration but some studies have shown that forest restoration may bring serious ecological problems to arid regions such as water resource shortages however the effect of different vegetation types such as forest and grass when implementing ecological restoration for water related ess in arid regions remains unclear the compatibility between agricultural development and ecological restoration in arid regions remains to be studied moreover previous studies tend to focus on a single land use land cover lulc conversion rule restricted slope or width without comparing the effects of different ecological restoration rules the lack of information on the es efficiency of different ecological restoration rules brings significant difficulties to decision making thus this study established different ecological restoration scenarios based on different lulc conversion rules and revealed the ecological benefits of these scenarios to help decision makers find the best ecological restoration pattern in arid regions bosten lake is the largest inland freshwater lake in the arid region and an important ecological source for socioeconomic development and human survival in western china however in recent years the rapid development of the social economy has led to a series of ecological and environmental problems mainly manifested as the reduction in lake water and eutrophication of water resulting in drinking water and irrigation water shortages and serious water pollution affecting agricultural

average climate data in this study soil property data were derived from the national tibetan plateau data center http data tpdc ac cn zh hans all data used in this study table 1 were unified to 30 m by using bilinear interpolation in r 2 3 framework for ecological restoration in arid regions this study proposed an operational and applicable framework to explore optimal ecological restoration patterns based on water security and food security in arid regions fig 2 the framework includes 5 stages 1 analyzing the influence of lulc change on ess from 2000 to 2020 2 designing an agricultural development ad scenario and different ecological restoration scenarios including planting vegetation pv and fvb scenarios 3 evaluating ess under each scenario and comparing them with the actual ess in 2020 to reveal the impact of different ecological restoration scenarios on ess and the es efficiency of different ecological restoration rules 4 determining the optimal ecological restoration scenario based on the es efficiency and trade offs synergies and 5 proposing measures for ecosystem restoration to achieve sustainable ecosystem development in arid regions the framework can also be used to determine ecological restoration patterns in other regions 2 4 scenario design this study used 2000 2020 as an actual scenario to analyze the impact of past lulc changes on ess we then designed an ad scenario in which cultivated land would be maximized in this scenario first urban land and water body were kept in line with 2020 and then any area that was cultivated land in 2000 and 2020 was kept as cultivated land in addition in this scenario the areas where forest land and grassland were converted to bare land between 2000 and 2020 were still bare land but no bare land was converted to forest land or grassland and the rest were in line with 2020 in other words this was a cultivated land and bare land maximization scenario with no ecological restoration we compared the ess under the ad scenario and 2020 to reflect the impact of agricultural development on ess without ecological restoration this scenario is a worst case scenario for the ecology and we tried to implement ecological restoration on this basis to improve ess and make ess after ecological restoration exceed those in 2020 different ecological restoration scenarios were designed based on the ad scenario and compared with 2020 to highlight the benefits of ecological restoration we designed ecological restoration scenarios based on the following three principles 1 using ecological restoration models indicated to be effective 2 improving water related ess and 3 guaranteeing grain yield zheng et al 2016 we set up two categories of ecological restoration scenarios based on different lulc conversion rules pv scenarios and rvb scenarios pv scenarios refer to cultivated land and bare land above a certain slope that was converted into forest land or grassland so we designed planting forest pf scenarios and planting grass pg scenarios according to the actual implementation of different areas we divided the slopes into 5 10 15 20 and 25 liu et al 2021a peng et al 2019 sun et al 2022 thus pf scenarios included pf above 5 pf1 10 pf2 15 pf3 20 pf4 and 25 pf5 scenarios and pg scenarios included pg above 5 pg1 10 pg2 15 pg3 20 pg4 and 25 pg5 scenarios similarly rvb scenarios refer to the conversion of all lulc types except urban land within a certain distance of the riparian to forest land rfb or grassland rgb buffer according to the actual implementation of different areas we divided the distance of the riparian buffer to 50 m 100 m 150 m 200 m and 250 m liu et al 2021a ma et al 2022a sun et al 2022 thus rfb scenarios included rfb within 50 m rfb1 100 m rfb2 150 m rfb3 200 m rfb4 and 250 m rfb5 scenarios and rgb scenarios included rgb within 50 m rgb1 100 m rgb2 150 m rgb3 200 m rgb4 and 250 m rgb5 scenarios in general we designed a total of 20 ecological restoration scenarios table 2 this study contributes an increased understanding of the impact of ecological restoration intensity on ess and can help decision makers determine the best rules for ecological restoration finally we identified the best ecological restoration scenario by comparing the ess es efficiency of ecological restoration and es trade offs synergies in these ecological scenarios with those in 2020 when all ess increase synergistically and have high es efficiency in a certain scenario we consider this scenario to be the best ecological restoration scenario 2 5 ecosystem services and their trade offs synergies grain yield is directly linked to food security therefore grain yield is considered an important es to ensure food security the distribution of cultivated land in the blr was concentrated and there was little difference in natural conditions in the region where cultivated land was located so this study assumed that the grain yield per unit area of cultivated land was the same thus cultivated land area was used as an indicator to characterize grain yield in this study water quantity is closely related to human survival agricultural irrigation and industrial production which is extremely important in arid regions and water quality directly affects public health fang et al 2022a 2022b therefore wy and wp are considered two key ess to ensure water security in arid regions the nonpoint source pollution in the blr was mainly nitrogen pollution and wp was difficult to quantify directly therefore nitrogen export ne was used to reflect wp in this study an increase in ne means a decrease in wp and a decrease in ne means an increase in wp wy and ne were quantified by using the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs invest model a model widely used for assessing ess and proven to be applicable in the blr yang 2020 yang et al 2020 wy was calculated by the water yield module of the invest model based on water balance liu et al 2022a the formula is as follows wy x 1 aet x p x p x where wy x aet x and p x are the annual wy mm actual evapotranspiration mm and precipitation mm at pixel x respectively aet x p x 1 ω x pet x 1 ω x pet x 1 pet x where pet x and ω x are the potential evapotranspiration mm and experience parameter respectively ω x z awc x p x 1 25 where z is the seasonal constant and awc x is the water content available to vegetation the calculations of z and awc x refer to the invest user s guide https naturalcapitalproject stanford edu software invest and the related literature donohue et al 2012 yang et al 2019 ne was calculated by the nutrient delivery ratio module of the invest model which estimates the contribution of vegetation and soil to decontaminating nonpoint source pollution through simplified hydrological and biophysical processes sharps et al 2017 xia et al 2022 the main formula is as follows alv x hss x pol x where alv x hss x and pol x are the adjustment load value kg ha hydrological sensitivity and output coefficients kg ha of ne for pixel x respectively in this study the decrease in ne was used as the increase in wp the model relevant parameter settings in the study referred to the invest user s guide and used localized parameters yang 2020 the simulated results of the invest model in this study were validated by the data of the hydrologic stations water resources bulletin and published data in blr yang et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 the detailed calculation process and specific parameter settings can be found in the supplementary materials to better compare the ess under different ecological restoration scenarios we proposed an indicator the es efficiency of ecological restoration the es efficiency of ecological restoration in this study is defined as the percentage change in ess in vegetation restoration regions compared with the ad scenario because these scenarios are ecological restoration based on the ad scenario they can directly reflect ecological benefits compared with the ad scenario this connection can help policy makers understand the relative benefits of different ecological restoration methods this study used a simple method to judge es trade offs synergies that is when the two es change trends were consistent increase or decrease at the same time we believed that there was a synergistic relationship between them when the change trends were inconsistent one increased and the other decreased we believed that there was a trade off relationship between them we compared the ecological restoration scenario to 2020 to examine es tradeoffs synergies 3 results 3 1 lulc change under each scenario grassland covered the largest area in the blr accounting for almost half and was widely distributed in hejing county fig 3 the second largest lulc was bare land accounting for more than one third mostly occurring in the southeast of the blr with some bare land scattered in the west and north the proportion of cultivated land was between 6 and 9 which was concentrated in the southeast of the blr water body accounted for nearly 5 half of which were distributed in bohu county and the other half in the midwestern hejing county the proportion of urban land was less than 1 which was scattered in and around cultivated land forest land accounted for less than 1 mostly scattered around hejing county from 2000 to 2020 urban land and forest land expanded rapidly by 146 55 and 120 28 respectively table 3 urban land expansion occurred in the southeast of the blr with expansion in korla city being the most pronounced forest land expansion was scattered mostly in eastern southern and western hejing county with some expansion in northern heshuo county the area of bare land decreased the most 1528 38 km2 while the area of cultivated land increased the most 1193 54 km2 cultivated land showed an outward expansion trend mainly in the southeast of the blr especially in korla city and bare land shanked markedly in hejing county although there was little decrease 263 66 km2 in grassland area a marked expansion of grassland was observed in the west and southeast while a marked reduction was observed in the north from the perspective of land conversion from 2000 to 2020 fig 4 bare land was mainly converted into grassland 2486 23 km2 cultivated land 1154 61 km2 and urban land 110 41 km2 at the same time 2222 41 km2 of grassland was converted to bare land in addition grassland has been converted into cultivated land 259 64 km2 forest land and water body cultivated land was mainly converted to grassland 161 16 km2 and urban land 125 78 km2 compared with 2020 bare land and cultivated land increased by 2478 90 km2 and 176 96 km2 in the ad scenario while grassland and forest land decreased by 2259 79 km2 and 396 07 km2 respectively table 3 spatially the expansion of bare land and the reduction in grassland in the west and southeast and the reduction in forest land in the middle were observed under the ad scenario grassland under the pf1 pf5 scenarios was consistent with that in the ad scenario fig 5 from the pf1 scenario to the pf5 scenario cultivated land and bare land increased while forest land decreased fig 6 under the pf1 and pf5 scenarios cultivated land increased by 170 27 km2 and 176 34 km2 forest land increased by 9890 86 km2 and 3652 05 km2 and bare land decreased by 7801 34 km2 and 1568 60 km2 respectively forest land under the pg1 pg5 scenarios was consistent with that in the ad scenario and cultivated land and bare land under the pg1 pg5 scenarios were consistent with those under the corresponding pf1 pf5 scenarios from the pg1 to pg5 scenarios the grassland decreased and the grassland in the pg1 and pg5 scenarios increased by 8027 14 km2 and 1788 33 km2 respectively compared with that in 2020 from the rfb1 scenario to the rfb5 scenario cultivated land grassland and bare land decreased while forest land increased under the rfb1 and rfb5 scenarios cultivated land increased by 128 95 km2 and decreased by 7 54 km2 forest land decreased by 73 97 km2 and increased by 840 98 km2 grassland decreased by 2481 19 km2 and 3092 48 km2 and bare land increased by 2426 21 km2 and 2259 04 km2 respectively compared with that in 2020 cultivated land and bare land under the rgb1 rgb5 scenarios were consistent with those under the corresponding rfb1 rfb5 scenarios from the rgb1 to the rgb5 scenario forest land decreased while grassland increased under the rgb1 and rgb5 scenarios forest land decreased by 397 23 km2 and 401 81 km2 and grassland decreased by 2157 92 km2 and 1849 68 km2 respectively compared with that in 2020 3 2 changes in ess under each scenario wy showed a decreasing trend from northwest to southeast with a total wy of 14 32 billion m3 in 2000 fig 7 from 2000 to 2020 wy decreased in the west and southeast and increased in the north and the total wy decreased by 82 09 million m3 table 4 wy under the ad scenario mainly increased in the west with a few in the central and southeast and almost no areas of wy decrease occurred resulting in a total wy increase of 199 56 million m3 compared with that in 2020 the high value of ne mainly appeared in the southeast and the ne in other regions was small with a total ne of 5341 93 t in 2000 fig 7 from 2000 to 2020 the increase in ne occurred in the southeast and the total ne increased by 788 42 t compared with the ne in 2020 the ne in the ad scenario also increased in the southeast region and the total ne increased by 489 87 t grain yield is closely related to cultivated land area so the regions with high grain yield were mainly concentrated in the southeast fig 3 similarly from 2000 to 2020 grain yield also increased in the southeast in 2000 the area of cultivated land was 5008 91 km2 from 2000 to 2020 the cultivated land increased by 1193 54 km2 so the grain yield increased by approximately 23 83 in the ad scenario grain yield was further increased by 3 53 compared with that in 2020 in general grain yield and ne increased while wy decreased from 2000 to 2020 in the ad scenario grain yield wy and ne all increased further compared with wy in 2020 wy increased slightly in the southeast but decreased in the central northern and western regions under the pf1 pf5 scenarios fig 8 a similar trend was observed for wy under the pg1 pg5 scenarios the expansion of the high wy value region in the central northern and western regions was observed both from the pf1 scenario to the pf5 scenario and from the pg1 scenario to the pg5 scenario compared with ne in 2020 there was no obvious change in ne in other regions except for the increase in ne in the southeast regions under the pf1 pf5 scenarios and pg1 pg5 scenarios fig 9 in addition it was difficult to observe a clear difference between regions either from the pf1 scenario to the pf5 scenario or from the pg1 scenario to the pg5 scenario compared with wy in 2020 wy increased in the west and southeast but decreased around the water body under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios and rgb1 rgb5 scenarios the area with reduced wy around the water body expanded from the rfb1 scenario to the rfb5 scenario and from the rgb1 scenario to the rgb5 scenario in these regions wy decreased more under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios than under the corresponding rgb1 rgb5 scenarios compared with ne in 2020 the increase and decrease in ne occurred in the southeast under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios and rgb1 rgb5 scenarios under these scenarios ne not only decreased around the water body but also in some adjacent cultivated land in these regions ne decreased more under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios than under the corresponding rgb1 rgb5 scenarios the area with reduced ne expanded from rfb1 to rfb5 scenario and from the rgb1 scenario to the rgb5 scenario there was no obvious change in grain yield under the pf1 pf5 scenarios and pg1 pg5 scenarios the grain yield under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios was consistent with that under the corresponding rgb1 rgb5 scenarios in these scenarios the reduction in grain yield occurred around the water body and the area with reduced grain yield expanded from the rfb1 scenario to the rfb5 scenario and from the rgb1 scenario to the rgb5 scenario changes in ess under each ecological restoration scenario relative to 2020 are shown in table 5 compared with wy in 2020 wy decreased under the pf1 pf5 scenarios and pg1 pg5 scenarios and increased under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios and rgb1 rgb5 scenarios wy decreased progressively from the pf1 scenario to the pf5 scenario and from the pg1 scenario to the pg5 scenario wy decreased the most under the pf1 scenario 816 69 million m3 and decreased the least under the pg5 scenario 88 52 million m3 similarly wy increased progressively from the rfb1 scenario to the rfb5 scenario and from the rgb1 scenario to the rgb5 scenario wy increased the most under the rgb1 scenario 194 51 million m3 and increased the least under the rfb5 scenario 152 55 million m3 compared with ne in 2020 ne increased under the pf1 pf5 scenarios and pg1 pg5 scenarios and decreased under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios and rgb3 rgb5 scenarios that is wp improved under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios and rgb3 rgb5 scenarios but decreased under the pf1 pf5 scenarios and pg1 pg5 scenarios ne increased progressively from the pf1 scenario to the pf5 scenario from the pg1 scenario to the pg5 scenario and from the rgb1 scenario to the rgb2 scenario ne increased the most under the pf1 scenario 724 83 t and increased the least under the rgb2 scenario 63 05 t ne decreased more and more from the rfb1 scenario to the rfb5 scenario and from the rgb3 scenario to the rgb5 scenario ne decreased the most under the rfb5 scenario 368 39 t and decreased the least under the rgb3 scenario 29 74 t that is wp improved the most under the rfb 5 scenario and improved the least under the rgb3 scenario except for the reduced grain yield under the rfb5 and rgb5 scenarios 7 54 km2 the grain yield in the other ecological restoration scenarios increased compared to the grain yield in 2020 grain yield increased the most under the pf1 and pg1 scenarios 170 27 km2 and increased the least under the rfb4 and rgb4 scenarios 24 67 km2 3 3 es efficiency and trade offs synergies under each scenario all scenarios reduced wy and grain yield but improved wp compared to the ad scenario the es efficiency excluding grain yield of the vegetation restoration region under each ecological restoration scenario is shown in fig 10 the forest restoration scenarios pf1 pf5 scenarios and rfb1 rfb5 scenarios had a greater effect on wy and wp than the grassland restoration scenarios pg1 pg5 scenarios and rgb1 rgb5 scenarios the wy efficiency under the pv scenarios pf1 pf5 scenarios and pg1 pg5 scenarios first increased and then decreased with the increasing slope reached maximum values of 9 05 and 6 29 under the pf2 scenario and pg2 scenario and reached minimum values under the pf5 scenario and pg5 scenario 9 74 and 6 65 similarly the wy efficiency under the rvb scenarios rfb1 rfb5 scenario and rgb1 rgb5 scenario showed an n shaped trend with increasing riparian buffer width reached maximum values of 18 53 and 8 04 under the rfb2 scenario and rgb2 scenario and reached minimum values under the rfb1 scenario and rgb1 scenario 9 74 and 6 65 the wy efficiency under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios was almost twice as high as that under the pf1 pf5 scenarios the wy efficiency under the rgb1 rgb5 scenarios was slightly lower than that under the pg1 pg5 scenarios the wp efficiency under the pv scenarios pf1 pf5 scenarios and pg1 pg5 scenarios first decreased and then increased with increasing slope and reached minimum values of 45 87 and 27 36 under the pf3 scenario and pg3 scenario and reached maximum values under the pf1 scenario and pg1 scenario 49 22 and 30 89 the wp efficiency under the rvb scenarios rfb1 rfb5 scenarios and rgb1 rgb5 scenarios showed an inverted n shaped change with increasing riparian buffer width reached minimum values of 94 11 and 92 71 under the rfb2 scenario and rgb2 scenario and reached maximum values under the rfb1 scenario and rgb1 scenario 98 58 and 97 72 the wp efficiency under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios was nearly twice that under the pf1 pf5 scenarios while the wp efficiency under the rgb1 rgb5 scenarios was more than three times that under the pg1 pg5 scenarios the pg1 pg5 scenarios achieved the lowest wp efficiency at the expense of the lowest wy efficiency and the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios achieved the largest wp efficiency at the highest wy efficiency in contrast the rgb1 rgb5 scenarios traded off relatively low wy efficiency for high wp efficiency thus es efficiency was better under the rgb1 rgb5 scenario table 6 shows the es trade offs synergies under each ecological restoration scenario relative to 2020 most ecological restoration scenarios resulted in es trade offs grain yield showed a trade off with other ess under the pf1 pf5 scenario and under the pg1 pg5 scenario and the same result was observed under the rfb5 and rgb5 scenarios however the change trend of es under these scenarios was distinct wy and wp increased and grain yield decreased under the pf1 pf5 scenario and under the pg1 pg5 scenarios while the opposite was true under the rfb5 and rgb5 scenarios wp and other es showed a trade off relationship under the rgb1 and rgb2 scenarios mainly manifested as wp decreasing while wy and grain yield increased ess increased synergistically under the rfb1 rfb4 scenarios and rgb3 rgb4 scenarios combining es tradeoff synergy and es efficiency the rgb3 and rgb4 scenarios were better ecological restoration scenarios in the blr compared with 2020 the average percentage increase in the three ess under the rgb4 scenario was 1 17 times that under the rgb3 scenario in addition the wp obtained by sacrificing the same percentage of wy under the rgb4 scenario 11 58 times was slightly higher than that under the rgb3 scenario 11 49 times therefore the rgb4 scenario was the optimal ecological restoration scenario in the blr 4 discussion 4 1 changes in lulc and ess from 2000 to 2020 the blr experienced extensive cultivated land expansion and bare land reduction with 75 of new cultivated land coming from bare land and 17 from grassland on the one hand the sharp increase in population increased the demand for food and stimulated the expansion of cultivated land on the other hand global warming improved the hydrothermal conditions in the north which accelerated the increase in cultivated land to a certain extent ma et al 2022a potapov et al 2022 however the massive expansion of cultivated land has also increased the use of water for agricultural irrigation putting enormous pressure on local water resources liu et al 2022a the large reduction in bare land is due to the implementation of ecological restoration programs such as the three north shelterbelt program ouyang et al 2016 our results showed that 11 of bare land was converted to grassland and that there was an increase in forest land during 2000 2020 indicating that ecological restoration has achieved significant benefits unfortunately over 2000 km2 of grassland has been reduced to bare land due to overgrazing and poor grassland management liu et al 2021a ma et al 2022a moreover the frequency of drought events is also an important reason for large scale grassland degradation luo et al 2021 the large scale expansion of cultivated land and the degradation of grassland may cause indelible negative effects on the ecological environment the increase in grain yield from 2000 to 2020 was at the expense of wy and wp there is no doubt that agriculture is the main source of nonpoint source pollution and the expansion of cultivated land is bound to increase ne and reduce wp guo et al 2021 ma et al 2021b therefore there is a synergistic relationship between grain yield and ne that is grain yield and wp are trade offs forest land and grassland have high evaporation compared to other lulc types in addition they require a large amount of water for growth so wy in forest land and grassland is low wang and dai 2020 the conversion of large areas of bare land to grassland led to a decrease in wy but at the same time the conversion of large areas of grassland to bare land increased wy since the increase in grassland mostly occurred in the area of high precipitation in the west of the blr it had a significant impact on wy because crops require water to grow and cultivated land with crops has higher evaporation than bare land converting bare land to cultivated land also reduces wy ma et al 2022a however cultivated land expansion mainly occurred in the southeastern blr where precipitation was low and evaporation was high so agricultural development had a limited impact on wy thus the decrease in wy was mainly due to vegetation restoration in the western blr in general agricultural development led to a decrease in wp while grassland restoration led to a decrease in wy agricultural development is conducive to ensuring food security while es is closely related to human well being and there is often a trade off between them ma et al 2022b zheng et al 2019 it is necessary to rationally balance food security and ecological security 4 2 impacts of ecological restoration on ess continuing to develop agriculture without implementing ecological restoration would increase wy and grain yield but decrease wp which would cause more serious water pollution fang et al 2022b it is important to implement ecological restoration to improve ess multiple ecological restoration scenarios were set up in this study based on different ecological restoration rules the ecological benefits of different ecological restoration methods may vary greatly or very little our results found that the pv scenarios reduced wy while the rvb scenarios increased wy compared with 2020 as noted in previous studies large scale vegetation restoration may increase evaporation and lead to a decrease in runoff feng et al 2016 li et al 2021 the vegetation restoration area under the pv scenarios was much larger than that under the rvb scenarios compared with the ad scenario wy decreased in these scenarios but wy decreased less under the rvb scenario so compared with 2020 wy increased therefore it is important to determine the scale of vegetation restoration to improve ess especially in arid regions excessive vegetation restoration could not only reduce runoff but also reduce groundwater resulting in less water for agricultural irrigation li et al 2021 in other words the scale of vegetation restoration in arid regions has an important impact on water and food security moderate revegetation can improve ess while excessive revegetation may reduce ess peng et al 2019 interestingly compared with 2020 wp under the pv scenario did not improve while wp under the rvb scenario improved it is well known that forest and grass have low nitrogen input and high nitrogen retention which helps to reduce ne zheng et al 2019 due to the difference in ecological restoration modes pv and rvb the improvement effect of wy in the pv scenario with a larger vegetation restoration area was not obvious the main source of ne is cultivated land while vegetation restoration under pv scenarios is often far from cultivated land and vegetation restoration under rvb scenarios is adjacent to cultivated land which can prevent nitrogen converging upstream from entering water and maximize the ability of vegetation to purify water quality zhao et al 2019 therefore wp efficiency under rvb scenarios is higher than that under pv scenarios different vegetation types have different effects on ecological restoration and the ecological benefits of forest land restoration are often greater than those of grassland restoration it is easy to understand that forest restoration has a greater impact on wy and wp than grassland restoration due to the difference in evaporation and nitrogen uptake and retention capacity of vegetation types ma et al 2021b mashayekhi et al 2010 pham et al 2018 we also found that wy increased and pv decreased with increasing slope under the pv scenarios but es efficiency decreased nonlinearly similarly wy decreased and wp increased with the widening of the riparian buffer zone under the rvb scenario but es efficiency decreased nonlinearly this phenomenon indicates that although blindly pursuing vegetation restoration can affect ess to a great extent the efficiency generated by restoring vegetation per unit area is decreasing ma et al 2021a peng et al 2019 in other words there is a nonlinear relationship between the improvement in es and the area of vegetation restoration ma et al 2021c at the same time the location of vegetation restoration also has an important impact on ecological benefits zheng et al 2019 unreasonable ecological restoration may not only reduce the efficiency of ess but also reduce ess and lead to es trade offs moderate ecological restoration can improve multiple ess simultaneously therefore decision makers need to comprehensively consider the type scale and location of vegetation restoration and restore vegetation on limited land to maximize ecological benefits especially in arid regions where ecosystems are sensitive increasing water demand due to population growth not only places higher demands on water quality but also poses challenges to food security godfray et al 2010 schewe et al 2014 previous ecological restoration has often enhanced other ess at the expense of grain yield so implementing rational ecological restoration is essential to achieve food security and water security feng et al 2016 ma et al 2022c although grain yield did not decrease under the pv scenario wy and wp decreased compared with 2020 so the pv scenario is not suitable for blr ecological restoration in contrast some rvb scenarios could achieve synergistic increases in grain yield wy and wp and the efficiency of es under the rgb scenario was higher which was suitable for the ecological restoration mode in the blr in arid regions with water shortages grassland restoration is beneficial to water saving and rgb can effectively improve water quality and eliminate es trade offs thus rgb is an effective measure to ensure food security and water security in the arid regions 4 3 implications and suggestions water shortages seriously restrict the development of agriculture in arid areas it is necessary to develop high efficiency water saving irrigation agriculture such as drip irrigation and plant drought resistant and water saving crops li et al 2022a wang et al 2021a moreover the promotion of organic farming no tillage and crop rotation technology can help increase grain yield guo et al 2019 the government can establish high standard farmland demonstration areas and promote them in various regions it is impossible to completely ban the use of pesticides and fertilizers which need to be limited to reduce the pollution of water quality ma et al 2022b payments for ess could be used to encourage farmers to adjust agricultural structures and farming practices and encourage pastoralists to reduce grazing in addition to agriculture public awareness of water conservation should be raised and governments should be advised to establish sound water resource management policies liu et al 2022a current ecological restoration has not achieved good ecological benefits so it is necessary to rationally plan agricultural development and vegetation protection and restoration grassland provides important ess and there is a need to enhance grassland protection such as establishing more grassland reserves restoring and managing grasslands and using remote sensing to monitor the effects of drought on grasslands bai and cotrufo 2022 huang et al 2021 ecological restoration policies need to balance agricultural production and ecological protection forest land restoration tends to consume more water than grassland restoration and it is suggested to use grassland restoration instead of forest land restoration in arid regions rgb is an effective method of ecological restoration in arid regions that can improve wp while guaranteeing agricultural production zheng et al 2019 it is recommended to select drought resistant grass types for ecological restoration decision makers can refer to the framework of this study to determine the best implementation width of rgb 4 4 limitations this study only used cultivated land area as an indicator of grain yield while people in arid areas rely not only on agricultural products but also on animal husbandry grain yield needs to be more accurately quantified in the future the ess considered in this study were limited and important ess such as biodiversity and carbon storage were not considered this study only considered the influence of lulc change on ess while the ecosystem in arid regions is very sensitive to climate change karakani et al 2021 climate change should be taken into account in future to assess ecosystem services in arid regions similarly we designed ecological restoration scenarios only from a policy perspective without considering the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities future research should take these factors into account to more realistically simulate lulc under ecological restoration policies through scenario analysis this study concluded that rgb is more suitable for ecological restoration in arid regions and empirical studies in various regions are still needed despite the limitations of this study we believe that the results can make an important contribution to ecological restoration in arid regions 5 conclusions this study analyzed the impact of lulc changes on ess from 2000 to 2020 and designed an ad scenario to indicate the impact of agricultural development and multiple ecological restoration scenarios which allowed for the exploration of the benefits of different ecological restoration rules the results showed that grain yield increased at the expense of wy and ne from 2000 to 2020 grain yield and wy increased while wp decreased under the ad scenario although the pf and pg scenarios could guarantee grain yield wy and wp decreased the rfb1 rfb4 scenarios and rgb3 rgb4 scenarios can guarantee food and water security the pv scenarios had a greater impact on wy while the rvb scenarios had a greater impact on wp the effect of forest land restoration on water related ess was greater than that of grassland restoration especially on wy the effect of rfb scenarios on wp was slightly higher than that of corresponding rgb scenarios compared with the ad scenario the rgb scenarios achieved higher wp at the expense of less wy which was more suitable for ecological restoration in arid regions with the increase in the riparian buffer zone the wy efficiency increased nonlinearly and the wp efficiency decreased nonlinearly under the rgb scenarios rgb1 rgb5 rgb4 was the best ecological restoration scenario because the average percentage increase in the three ess was higher ecological benefits are not necessarily positively correlated with the area of vegetation restoration moderate ecological restoration can achieve maximum ecological benefits decision makers should comprehensively consider the type location and scale of vegetation restoration when making ecological restoration policies this study can provide inspiration for sustainable agricultural development and ecosystem management in arid regions credit authorship contribution

in grain yield water yield wy and water purification wp from 2000 to 2020 in the bosten lake region china then planting vegetation pv scenarios on different slopes and riparian vegetation buffer rvb scenarios with different widths were established to reveal the effects of different ecological restoration rules on ess finally the optimal ecological restoration scenario was determined based on es efficiency and trade offs synergies the results showed that grain yield increased 23 83 at the expense of wp and wy 14 76 and 0 57 from 2000 to 2020 the agricultural development scenario further reduced wp 7 99 grain yield increased and wp and wy decreased under the pv scenarios the rvb scenarios had the potential to improve ess guarantee grain yield and eliminate es trade offs the effect of forest restoration on ess was greater than that of grassland restoration and the effect of rvb scenarios on es efficiency was greater than that of pv scenarios with the increase in the riparian buffer zone the wy efficiency increased nonlinearly and the wp efficiency decreased nonlinearly the riparian grass buffer scenarios achieved higher wp at the expense of less wy with the 200 m wide riparian grass buffer being the best ecological restoration scenario the ecological benefits varied with the type location and scale of vegetation restoration this study proposed a framework to determine the optimal ecological restoration pattern the results can provide a scientific reference for water resource management decision making in arid regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords water resource agricultural development ecosystem service scenario analysis arid regions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is an important basis for human survival and socioeconomic development and provides essential ecosystem services ess keeler et al 2012 lin et al 2021 however rapid economic development intensified anthropogenic activities and climate change have led to significant pressure on global water resources chung et al 2021 novick et al 2016 van loon and laaha 2015 especially in arid regions water shortages and agricultural development have aroused widespread concern gerten et al 2020 shirmohammadi et al 2020a therefore ensuring water and food security in arid regions is critical to achieving sustainable development goals the protection and utilization of water resources are very important in arid regions with human water conflicts shirmohammadi et al 2020b wang et al 2021b for a long time water resources in arid regions barely maintained the balance of fragile ecosystems and human survival and development liu et al 2022b in recent years due to global warming and water resource development arid regions have been expanding this expansion is expected to increase with the degree of drought intensifying further huang et al 2016 yao et al 2020 population growth and economic development have brought about increasing demand for water resulting in this resource problem in arid regions becoming a key challenge to the sustainable development of ecosystems and socioeconomic factors balkanlou et al 2020 wang et al 2021b the expansion of cultivated land in arid regions mostly occurred in water limited areas cai et al 2022 liu et al 2021b in addition nonpoint source pollution caused by agricultural expansion makes water pollution in arid regions increasingly serious and poses challenges to water security wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 thus water resource challenges in arid regions include not only water shortages but also nonpoint source pollution ecosystems in arid regions are fragile and sensitive to water scarcity yao et al 2021 assessing water supply and water quality in arid regions is of great significance for the rational utilization of water resources however previous studies mostly focused on the single aspect of water supply or nonpoint source pollution and rarely considered both water quantity and water quality hou et al 2021 liu et al 2022a how to improve both water quantity and water quality in arid regions is a realistic problem that needs to be urgently solved ecological restoration programs affect ecological processes by changing landscape patterns thereby improving water related ess guo et al 2021 ma et al 2021a traditional afforestation programs such as the grain for green program and three north shelterbelt program are widely promoted and applied to improve water related ess ma et al 2022c wang et al 2019 typical afforestation is often implemented on sloping cultivated land which can effectively improve soil conservation capacity prevent soil erosion and reduce sediment in rivers li et al 2022b wang et al 2016 however many studies have shown that afforestation may lead to reduced water yield wy feng et al 2016 peng et al 2019 it remains to be discussed whether afforestation is still the best mode to improve wy and water purification wp in addition some studies have shown that establishing riparian vegetation zones plays an important role in improving wp hou et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 zheng et al 2016 noted that the establishment of riparian vegetation buffer rvb can effectively improve multiple ess including water quantity and wp and reduce es trade offs indicating that rvb is also an effective method these ecological restoration programs often involve the cultivated conversion which inevitably reduces grain yield and food security is also important in arid regions how can the best method of ecological restoration be determined to guarantee grain yield and improve wy and wp scenario analysis is an effective method to quantify the response of wy and wp to ecological restoration decisions ma et al 2021a scholte et al 2018 this approach can be used not only to determine the extent to which wy and wp can be improved in the future but also to explore the potential trade offs among grain yield wy and wp peng et al 2019 previous studies have often chosen forest restoration for ecological restoration but some studies have shown that forest restoration may bring serious ecological problems to arid regions such as water resource shortages however the effect of different vegetation types such as forest and grass when implementing ecological restoration for water related ess in arid regions remains unclear the compatibility between agricultural development and ecological restoration in arid regions remains to be studied moreover previous studies tend to focus on a single land use land cover lulc conversion rule restricted slope or width without comparing the effects of different ecological restoration rules the lack of information on the es efficiency of different ecological restoration rules brings significant difficulties to decision making thus this study established different ecological restoration scenarios based on different lulc conversion rules and revealed the ecological benefits of these scenarios to help decision makers find the best ecological restoration pattern in arid regions bosten lake is the largest inland freshwater lake in the arid region and an important ecological source for socioeconomic development and human survival in western china however in recent years the rapid development of the social economy has led to a series of ecological and environmental problems mainly manifested as the reduction in lake water and eutrophication of water resulting in drinking water and irrigation water shortages and serious water pollution affecting agricultural sustainability and human well being guo and shen 2016 it is necessary to implement ecological restoration to increase wy wp and grain yield in the bosten lake region blr this study proposed a framework to determine the optimal ecological restoration model in arid regions and designed multiple ecological restoration scenarios based on different lulc conversion rules the objectives of this study were 1 to analyze lulc change under different ecological restoration scenarios 2 to quantify the impact of different ecological restoration scenarios on wy wp and grain yield 3 to reveal the es efficiency of different ecological restoration methods and 4 to determine the best ecological restoration pattern based on the es efficiency and trade offs synergies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area blr 82 46 e 88 21 e 41 42 n 43 56 n is located in the central part of xinjiang uygur autonomous region and covers an area of 61 333 21 km2 including korla city yanqi hui autonomous county hejing county heshuo county and bohu county fig 1 the elevation difference is large ranging from 868 m to 5050 m and the terrain is high in the northwest and low in the southeast due to its large geographical span the climate of the blr has obvious spatial heterogeneity and is a temperate continental arid climate precipitation in the blr is rare the average annual precipitation is between 80 mm and 760 mm the temperature varies significantly and the average annual temperature is between 13 c and 13 c precipitation shows a decreasing trend from northwest to southwest while temperature shows an opposite trend due to the large elevation difference vegetation and soil have obvious vertical zonality the upper reaches of bosten lake are important water sources for agricultural irrigation and industrial production good natural conditions make it a key agricultural reclamation area and it also has one of the best economies in the xinjiang uygur autonomous region thus it is important to guarantee water security and food security in the blr 2 2 data source land use land cover lulc data in 2000 and 2020 were derived from globeland30 http globeland30 org the digital elevation model dem was derived from geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn climate data including precipitation and potential evaporation from 1990 to 2020 were derived from the national earth system science data center http www geodata cn to eliminate climate effects e g interannual variability and climate extremes and to obtain generalizable results for universality we used 30 year average climate data in this study soil property data were derived from the national tibetan plateau data center http data tpdc ac cn zh hans all data used in this study table 1 were unified to 30 m by using bilinear interpolation in r 2 3 framework for ecological restoration in arid regions this study proposed an operational and applicable framework to explore optimal ecological restoration patterns based on water security and food security in arid regions fig 2 the framework includes 5 stages 1 analyzing the influence of lulc change on ess from 2000 to 2020 2 designing an agricultural development ad scenario and different ecological restoration scenarios including planting vegetation pv and fvb scenarios 3 evaluating ess under each scenario and comparing them with the actual ess in 2020 to reveal the impact of different ecological restoration scenarios on ess and the es efficiency of different ecological restoration rules 4 determining the optimal ecological restoration scenario based on the es efficiency and trade offs synergies and 5 proposing measures for ecosystem restoration to achieve sustainable ecosystem development in arid regions the framework can also be used to determine ecological restoration patterns in other regions 2 4 scenario design this study used 2000 2020 as an actual scenario to analyze the impact of past lulc changes on ess we then designed an ad scenario in which cultivated land would be maximized in this scenario first urban land and water body were kept in line with 2020 and then any area that was cultivated land in 2000 and 2020 was kept as cultivated land in addition in this scenario the areas where forest land and grassland were converted to bare land between 2000 and 2020 were still bare land but no bare land was converted to forest land or grassland and the rest were in line with 2020 in other words this was a cultivated land and bare land maximization scenario with no ecological restoration we compared the ess under the ad scenario and 2020 to reflect the impact of agricultural development on ess without ecological restoration this scenario is a worst case scenario for the ecology and we tried to implement ecological restoration on this basis to improve ess and make ess after ecological restoration exceed those in 2020 different ecological restoration scenarios were designed based on the ad scenario and compared with 2020 to highlight the benefits of ecological restoration we designed ecological restoration scenarios based on the following three principles 1 using ecological restoration models indicated to be effective 2 improving water related ess and 3 guaranteeing grain yield zheng et al 2016 we set up two categories of ecological restoration scenarios based on different lulc conversion rules pv scenarios and rvb scenarios pv scenarios refer to cultivated land and bare land above a certain slope that was converted into forest land or grassland so we designed planting forest pf scenarios and planting grass pg scenarios according to the actual implementation of different areas we divided the slopes into 5 10 15 20 and 25 liu et al 2021a peng et al 2019 sun et al 2022 thus pf scenarios included pf above 5 pf1 10 pf2 15 pf3 20 pf4 and 25 pf5 scenarios and pg scenarios included pg above 5 pg1 10 pg2 15 pg3 20 pg4 and 25 pg5 scenarios similarly rvb scenarios refer to the conversion of all lulc types except urban land within a certain distance of the riparian to forest land rfb or grassland rgb buffer according to the actual implementation of different areas we divided the distance of the riparian buffer to 50 m 100 m 150 m 200 m and 250 m liu et al 2021a ma et al 2022a sun et al 2022 thus rfb scenarios included rfb within 50 m rfb1 100 m rfb2 150 m rfb3 200 m rfb4 and 250 m rfb5 scenarios and rgb scenarios included rgb within 50 m rgb1 100 m rgb2 150 m rgb3 200 m rgb4 and 250 m rgb5 scenarios in general we designed a total of 20 ecological restoration scenarios table 2 this study contributes an increased understanding of the impact of ecological restoration intensity on ess and can help decision makers determine the best rules for ecological restoration finally we identified the best ecological restoration scenario by comparing the ess es efficiency of ecological restoration and es trade offs synergies in these ecological scenarios with those in 2020 when all ess increase synergistically and have high es efficiency in a certain scenario we consider this scenario to be the best ecological restoration scenario 2 5 ecosystem services and their trade offs synergies grain yield is directly linked to food security therefore grain yield is considered an important es to ensure food security the distribution of cultivated land in the blr was concentrated and there was little difference in natural conditions in the region where cultivated land was located so this study assumed that the grain yield per unit area of cultivated land was the same thus cultivated land area was used as an indicator to characterize grain yield in this study water quantity is closely related to human survival agricultural irrigation and industrial production which is extremely important in arid regions and water quality directly affects public health fang et al 2022a 2022b therefore wy and wp are considered two key ess to ensure water security in arid regions the nonpoint source pollution in the blr was mainly nitrogen pollution and wp was difficult to quantify directly therefore nitrogen export ne was used to reflect wp in this study an increase in ne means a decrease in wp and a decrease in ne means an increase in wp wy and ne were quantified by using the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs invest model a model widely used for assessing ess and proven to be applicable in the blr yang 2020 yang et al 2020 wy was calculated by the water yield module of the invest model based on water balance liu et al 2022a the formula is as follows wy x 1 aet x p x p x where wy x aet x and p x are the annual wy mm actual evapotranspiration mm and precipitation mm at pixel x respectively aet x p x 1 ω x pet x 1 ω x pet x 1 pet x where pet x and ω x are the potential evapotranspiration mm and experience parameter respectively ω x z awc x p x 1 25 where z is the seasonal constant and awc x is the water content available to vegetation the calculations of z and awc x refer to the invest user s guide https naturalcapitalproject stanford edu software invest and the related literature donohue et al 2012 yang et al 2019 ne was calculated by the nutrient delivery ratio module of the invest model which estimates the contribution of vegetation and soil to decontaminating nonpoint source pollution through simplified hydrological and biophysical processes sharps et al 2017 xia et al 2022 the main formula is as follows alv x hss x pol x where alv x hss x and pol x are the adjustment load value kg ha hydrological sensitivity and output coefficients kg ha of ne for pixel x respectively in this study the decrease in ne was used as the increase in wp the model relevant parameter settings in the study referred to the invest user s guide and used localized parameters yang 2020 the simulated results of the invest model in this study were validated by the data of the hydrologic stations water resources bulletin and published data in blr yang et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 the detailed calculation process and specific parameter settings can be found in the supplementary materials to better compare the ess under different ecological restoration scenarios we proposed an indicator the es efficiency of ecological restoration the es efficiency of ecological restoration in this study is defined as the percentage change in ess in vegetation restoration regions compared with the ad scenario because these scenarios are ecological restoration based on the ad scenario they can directly reflect ecological benefits compared with the ad scenario this connection can help policy makers understand the relative benefits of different ecological restoration methods this study used a simple method to judge es trade offs synergies that is when the two es change trends were consistent increase or decrease at the same time we believed that there was a synergistic relationship between them when the change trends were inconsistent one increased and the other decreased we believed that there was a trade off relationship between them we compared the ecological restoration scenario to 2020 to examine es tradeoffs synergies 3 results 3 1 lulc change under each scenario grassland covered the largest area in the blr accounting for almost half and was widely distributed in hejing county fig 3 the second largest lulc was bare land accounting for more than one third mostly occurring in the southeast of the blr with some bare land scattered in the west and north the proportion of cultivated land was between 6 and 9 which was concentrated in the southeast of the blr water body accounted for nearly 5 half of which were distributed in bohu county and the other half in the midwestern hejing county the proportion of urban land was less than 1 which was scattered in and around cultivated land forest land accounted for less than 1 mostly scattered around hejing county from 2000 to 2020 urban land and forest land expanded rapidly by 146 55 and 120 28 respectively table 3 urban land expansion occurred in the southeast of the blr with expansion in korla city being the most pronounced forest land expansion was scattered mostly in eastern southern and western hejing county with some expansion in northern heshuo county the area of bare land decreased the most 1528 38 km2 while the area of cultivated land increased the most 1193 54 km2 cultivated land showed an outward expansion trend mainly in the southeast of the blr especially in korla city and bare land shanked markedly in hejing county although there was little decrease 263 66 km2 in grassland area a marked expansion of grassland was observed in the west and southeast while a marked reduction was observed in the north from the perspective of land conversion from 2000 to 2020 fig 4 bare land was mainly converted into grassland 2486 23 km2 cultivated land 1154 61 km2 and urban land 110 41 km2 at the same time 2222 41 km2 of grassland was converted to bare land in addition grassland has been converted into cultivated land 259 64 km2 forest land and water body cultivated land was mainly converted to grassland 161 16 km2 and urban land 125 78 km2 compared with 2020 bare land and cultivated land increased by 2478 90 km2 and 176 96 km2 in the ad scenario while grassland and forest land decreased by 2259 79 km2 and 396 07 km2 respectively table 3 spatially the expansion of bare land and the reduction in grassland in the west and southeast and the reduction in forest land in the middle were observed under the ad scenario grassland under the pf1 pf5 scenarios was consistent with that in the ad scenario fig 5 from the pf1 scenario to the pf5 scenario cultivated land and bare land increased while forest land decreased fig 6 under the pf1 and pf5 scenarios cultivated land increased by 170 27 km2 and 176 34 km2 forest land increased by 9890 86 km2 and 3652 05 km2 and bare land decreased by 7801 34 km2 and 1568 60 km2 respectively forest land under the pg1 pg5 scenarios was consistent with that in the ad scenario and cultivated land and bare land under the pg1 pg5 scenarios were consistent with those under the corresponding pf1 pf5 scenarios from the pg1 to pg5 scenarios the grassland decreased and the grassland in the pg1 and pg5 scenarios increased by 8027 14 km2 and 1788 33 km2 respectively compared with that in 2020 from the rfb1 scenario to the rfb5 scenario cultivated land grassland and bare land decreased while forest land increased under the rfb1 and rfb5 scenarios cultivated land increased by 128 95 km2 and decreased by 7 54 km2 forest land decreased by 73 97 km2 and increased by 840 98 km2 grassland decreased by 2481 19 km2 and 3092 48 km2 and bare land increased by 2426 21 km2 and 2259 04 km2 respectively compared with that in 2020 cultivated land and bare land under the rgb1 rgb5 scenarios were consistent with those under the corresponding rfb1 rfb5 scenarios from the rgb1 to the rgb5 scenario forest land decreased while grassland increased under the rgb1 and rgb5 scenarios forest land decreased by 397 23 km2 and 401 81 km2 and grassland decreased by 2157 92 km2 and 1849 68 km2 respectively compared with that in 2020 3 2 changes in ess under each scenario wy showed a decreasing trend from northwest to southeast with a total wy of 14 32 billion m3 in 2000 fig 7 from 2000 to 2020 wy decreased in the west and southeast and increased in the north and the total wy decreased by 82 09 million m3 table 4 wy under the ad scenario mainly increased in the west with a few in the central and southeast and almost no areas of wy decrease occurred resulting in a total wy increase of 199 56 million m3 compared with that in 2020 the high value of ne mainly appeared in the southeast and the ne in other regions was small with a total ne of 5341 93 t in 2000 fig 7 from 2000 to 2020 the increase in ne occurred in the southeast and the total ne increased by 788 42 t compared with the ne in 2020 the ne in the ad scenario also increased in the southeast region and the total ne increased by 489 87 t grain yield is closely related to cultivated land area so the regions with high grain yield were mainly concentrated in the southeast fig 3 similarly from 2000 to 2020 grain yield also increased in the southeast in 2000 the area of cultivated land was 5008 91 km2 from 2000 to 2020 the cultivated land increased by 1193 54 km2 so the grain yield increased by approximately 23 83 in the ad scenario grain yield was further increased by 3 53 compared with that in 2020 in general grain yield and ne increased while wy decreased from 2000 to 2020 in the ad scenario grain yield wy and ne all increased further compared with wy in 2020 wy increased slightly in the southeast but decreased in the central northern and western regions under the pf1 pf5 scenarios fig 8 a similar trend was observed for wy under the pg1 pg5 scenarios the expansion of the high wy value region in the central northern and western regions was observed both from the pf1 scenario to the pf5 scenario and from the pg1 scenario to the pg5 scenario compared with ne in 2020 there was no obvious change in ne in other regions except for the increase in ne in the southeast regions under the pf1 pf5 scenarios and pg1 pg5 scenarios fig 9 in addition it was difficult to observe a clear difference between regions either from the pf1 scenario to the pf5 scenario or from the pg1 scenario to the pg5 scenario compared with wy in 2020 wy increased in the west and southeast but decreased around the water body under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios and rgb1 rgb5 scenarios the area with reduced wy around the water body expanded from the rfb1 scenario to the rfb5 scenario and from the rgb1 scenario to the rgb5 scenario in these regions wy decreased more under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios than under the corresponding rgb1 rgb5 scenarios compared with ne in 2020 the increase and decrease in ne occurred in the southeast under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios and rgb1 rgb5 scenarios under these scenarios ne not only decreased around the water body but also in some adjacent cultivated land in these regions ne decreased more under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios than under the corresponding rgb1 rgb5 scenarios the area with reduced ne expanded from rfb1 to rfb5 scenario and from the rgb1 scenario to the rgb5 scenario there was no obvious change in grain yield under the pf1 pf5 scenarios and pg1 pg5 scenarios the grain yield under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios was consistent with that under the corresponding rgb1 rgb5 scenarios in these scenarios the reduction in grain yield occurred around the water body and the area with reduced grain yield expanded from the rfb1 scenario to the rfb5 scenario and from the rgb1 scenario to the rgb5 scenario changes in ess under each ecological restoration scenario relative to 2020 are shown in table 5 compared with wy in 2020 wy decreased under the pf1 pf5 scenarios and pg1 pg5 scenarios and increased under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios and rgb1 rgb5 scenarios wy decreased progressively from the pf1 scenario to the pf5 scenario and from the pg1 scenario to the pg5 scenario wy decreased the most under the pf1 scenario 816 69 million m3 and decreased the least under the pg5 scenario 88 52 million m3 similarly wy increased progressively from the rfb1 scenario to the rfb5 scenario and from the rgb1 scenario to the rgb5 scenario wy increased the most under the rgb1 scenario 194 51 million m3 and increased the least under the rfb5 scenario 152 55 million m3 compared with ne in 2020 ne increased under the pf1 pf5 scenarios and pg1 pg5 scenarios and decreased under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios and rgb3 rgb5 scenarios that is wp improved under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios and rgb3 rgb5 scenarios but decreased under the pf1 pf5 scenarios and pg1 pg5 scenarios ne increased progressively from the pf1 scenario to the pf5 scenario from the pg1 scenario to the pg5 scenario and from the rgb1 scenario to the rgb2 scenario ne increased the most under the pf1 scenario 724 83 t and increased the least under the rgb2 scenario 63 05 t ne decreased more and more from the rfb1 scenario to the rfb5 scenario and from the rgb3 scenario to the rgb5 scenario ne decreased the most under the rfb5 scenario 368 39 t and decreased the least under the rgb3 scenario 29 74 t that is wp improved the most under the rfb 5 scenario and improved the least under the rgb3 scenario except for the reduced grain yield under the rfb5 and rgb5 scenarios 7 54 km2 the grain yield in the other ecological restoration scenarios increased compared to the grain yield in 2020 grain yield increased the most under the pf1 and pg1 scenarios 170 27 km2 and increased the least under the rfb4 and rgb4 scenarios 24 67 km2 3 3 es efficiency and trade offs synergies under each scenario all scenarios reduced wy and grain yield but improved wp compared to the ad scenario the es efficiency excluding grain yield of the vegetation restoration region under each ecological restoration scenario is shown in fig 10 the forest restoration scenarios pf1 pf5 scenarios and rfb1 rfb5 scenarios had a greater effect on wy and wp than the grassland restoration scenarios pg1 pg5 scenarios and rgb1 rgb5 scenarios the wy efficiency under the pv scenarios pf1 pf5 scenarios and pg1 pg5 scenarios first increased and then decreased with the increasing slope reached maximum values of 9 05 and 6 29 under the pf2 scenario and pg2 scenario and reached minimum values under the pf5 scenario and pg5 scenario 9 74 and 6 65 similarly the wy efficiency under the rvb scenarios rfb1 rfb5 scenario and rgb1 rgb5 scenario showed an n shaped trend with increasing riparian buffer width reached maximum values of 18 53 and 8 04 under the rfb2 scenario and rgb2 scenario and reached minimum values under the rfb1 scenario and rgb1 scenario 9 74 and 6 65 the wy efficiency under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios was almost twice as high as that under the pf1 pf5 scenarios the wy efficiency under the rgb1 rgb5 scenarios was slightly lower than that under the pg1 pg5 scenarios the wp efficiency under the pv scenarios pf1 pf5 scenarios and pg1 pg5 scenarios first decreased and then increased with increasing slope and reached minimum values of 45 87 and 27 36 under the pf3 scenario and pg3 scenario and reached maximum values under the pf1 scenario and pg1 scenario 49 22 and 30 89 the wp efficiency under the rvb scenarios rfb1 rfb5 scenarios and rgb1 rgb5 scenarios showed an inverted n shaped change with increasing riparian buffer width reached minimum values of 94 11 and 92 71 under the rfb2 scenario and rgb2 scenario and reached maximum values under the rfb1 scenario and rgb1 scenario 98 58 and 97 72 the wp efficiency under the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios was nearly twice that under the pf1 pf5 scenarios while the wp efficiency under the rgb1 rgb5 scenarios was more than three times that under the pg1 pg5 scenarios the pg1 pg5 scenarios achieved the lowest wp efficiency at the expense of the lowest wy efficiency and the rfb1 rfb5 scenarios achieved the largest wp efficiency at the highest wy efficiency in contrast the rgb1 rgb5 scenarios traded off relatively low wy efficiency for high wp efficiency thus es efficiency was better under the rgb1 rgb5 scenario table 6 shows the es trade offs synergies under each ecological restoration scenario relative to 2020 most ecological restoration scenarios resulted in es trade offs grain yield showed a trade off with other ess under the pf1 pf5 scenario and under the pg1 pg5 scenario and the same result was observed under the rfb5 and rgb5 scenarios however the change trend of es under these scenarios was distinct wy and wp increased and grain yield decreased under the pf1 pf5 scenario and under the pg1 pg5 scenarios while the opposite was true under the rfb5 and rgb5 scenarios wp and other es showed a trade off relationship under the rgb1 and rgb2 scenarios mainly manifested as wp decreasing while wy and grain yield increased ess increased synergistically under the rfb1 rfb4 scenarios and rgb3 rgb4 scenarios combining es tradeoff synergy and es efficiency the rgb3 and rgb4 scenarios were better ecological restoration scenarios in the blr compared with 2020 the average percentage increase in the three ess under the rgb4 scenario was 1 17 times that under the rgb3 scenario in addition the wp obtained by sacrificing the same percentage of wy under the rgb4 scenario 11 58 times was slightly higher than that under the rgb3 scenario 11 49 times therefore the rgb4 scenario was the optimal ecological restoration scenario in the blr 4 discussion 4 1 changes in lulc and ess from 2000 to 2020 the blr experienced extensive cultivated land expansion and bare land reduction with 75 of new cultivated land coming from bare land and 17 from grassland on the one hand the sharp increase in population increased the demand for food and stimulated the expansion of cultivated land on the other hand global warming improved the hydrothermal conditions in the north which accelerated the increase in cultivated land to a certain extent ma et al 2022a potapov et al 2022 however the massive expansion of cultivated land has also increased the use of water for agricultural irrigation putting enormous pressure on local water resources liu et al 2022a the large reduction in bare land is due to the implementation of ecological restoration programs such as the three north shelterbelt program ouyang et al 2016 our results showed that 11 of bare land was converted to grassland and that there was an increase in forest land during 2000 2020 indicating that ecological restoration has achieved significant benefits unfortunately over 2000 km2 of grassland has been reduced to bare land due to overgrazing and poor grassland management liu et al 2021a ma et al 2022a moreover the frequency of drought events is also an important reason for large scale grassland degradation luo et al 2021 the large scale expansion of cultivated land and the degradation of grassland may cause indelible negative effects on the ecological environment the increase in grain yield from 2000 to 2020 was at the expense of wy and wp there is no doubt that agriculture is the main source of nonpoint source pollution and the expansion of cultivated land is bound to increase ne and reduce wp guo et al 2021 ma et al 2021b therefore there is a synergistic relationship between grain yield and ne that is grain yield and wp are trade offs forest land and grassland have high evaporation compared to other lulc types in addition they require a large amount of water for growth so wy in forest land and grassland is low wang and dai 2020 the conversion of large areas of bare land to grassland led to a decrease in wy but at the same time the conversion of large areas of grassland to bare land increased wy since the increase in grassland mostly occurred in the area of high precipitation in the west of the blr it had a significant impact on wy because crops require water to grow and cultivated land with crops has higher evaporation than bare land converting bare land to cultivated land also reduces wy ma et al 2022a however cultivated land expansion mainly occurred in the southeastern blr where precipitation was low and evaporation was high so agricultural development had a limited impact on wy thus the decrease in wy was mainly due to vegetation restoration in the western blr in general agricultural development led to a decrease in wp while grassland restoration led to a decrease in wy agricultural development is conducive to ensuring food security while es is closely related to human well being and there is often a trade off between them ma et al 2022b zheng et al 2019 it is necessary to rationally balance food security and ecological security 4 2 impacts of ecological restoration on ess continuing to develop agriculture without implementing ecological restoration would increase wy and grain yield but decrease wp which would cause more serious water pollution fang et al 2022b it is important to implement ecological restoration to improve ess multiple ecological restoration scenarios were set up in this study based on different ecological restoration rules the ecological benefits of different ecological restoration methods may vary greatly or very little our results found that the pv scenarios reduced wy while the rvb scenarios increased wy compared with 2020 as noted in previous studies large scale vegetation restoration may increase evaporation and lead to a decrease in runoff feng et al 2016 li et al 2021 the vegetation restoration area under the pv scenarios was much larger than that under the rvb scenarios compared with the ad scenario wy decreased in these scenarios but wy decreased less under the rvb scenario so compared with 2020 wy increased therefore it is important to determine the scale of vegetation restoration to improve ess especially in arid regions excessive vegetation restoration could not only reduce runoff but also reduce groundwater resulting in less water for agricultural irrigation li et al 2021 in other words the scale of vegetation restoration in arid regions has an important impact on water and food security moderate revegetation can improve ess while excessive revegetation may reduce ess peng et al 2019 interestingly compared with 2020 wp under the pv scenario did not improve while wp under the rvb scenario improved it is well known that forest and grass have low nitrogen input and high nitrogen retention which helps to reduce ne zheng et al 2019 due to the difference in ecological restoration modes pv and rvb the improvement effect of wy in the pv scenario with a larger vegetation restoration area was not obvious the main source of ne is cultivated land while vegetation restoration under pv scenarios is often far from cultivated land and vegetation restoration under rvb scenarios is adjacent to cultivated land which can prevent nitrogen converging upstream from entering water and maximize the ability of vegetation to purify water quality zhao et al 2019 therefore wp efficiency under rvb scenarios is higher than that under pv scenarios different vegetation types have different effects on ecological restoration and the ecological benefits of forest land restoration are often greater than those of grassland restoration it is easy to understand that forest restoration has a greater impact on wy and wp than grassland restoration due to the difference in evaporation and nitrogen uptake and retention capacity of vegetation types ma et al 2021b mashayekhi et al 2010 pham et al 2018 we also found that wy increased and pv decreased with increasing slope under the pv scenarios but es efficiency decreased nonlinearly similarly wy decreased and wp increased with the widening of the riparian buffer zone under the rvb scenario but es efficiency decreased nonlinearly this phenomenon indicates that although blindly pursuing vegetation restoration can affect ess to a great extent the efficiency generated by restoring vegetation per unit area is decreasing ma et al 2021a peng et al 2019 in other words there is a nonlinear relationship between the improvement in es and the area of vegetation restoration ma et al 2021c at the same time the location of vegetation restoration also has an important impact on ecological benefits zheng et al 2019 unreasonable ecological restoration may not only reduce the efficiency of ess but also reduce ess and lead to es trade offs moderate ecological restoration can improve multiple ess simultaneously therefore decision makers need to comprehensively consider the type scale and location of vegetation restoration and restore vegetation on limited land to maximize ecological benefits especially in arid regions where ecosystems are sensitive increasing water demand due to population growth not only places higher demands on water quality but also poses challenges to food security godfray et al 2010 schewe et al 2014 previous ecological restoration has often enhanced other ess at the expense of grain yield so implementing rational ecological restoration is essential to achieve food security and water security feng et al 2016 ma et al 2022c although grain yield did not decrease under the pv scenario wy and wp decreased compared with 2020 so the pv scenario is not suitable for blr ecological restoration in contrast some rvb scenarios could achieve synergistic increases in grain yield wy and wp and the efficiency of es under the rgb scenario was higher which was suitable for the ecological restoration mode in the blr in arid regions with water shortages grassland restoration is beneficial to water saving and rgb can effectively improve water quality and eliminate es trade offs thus rgb is an effective measure to ensure food security and water security in the arid regions 4 3 implications and suggestions water shortages seriously restrict the development of agriculture in arid areas it is necessary to develop high efficiency water saving irrigation agriculture such as drip irrigation and plant drought resistant and water saving crops li et al 2022a wang et al 2021a moreover the promotion of organic farming no tillage and crop rotation technology can help increase grain yield guo et al 2019 the government can establish high standard farmland demonstration areas and promote them in various regions it is impossible to completely ban the use of pesticides and fertilizers which need to be limited to reduce the pollution of water quality ma et al 2022b payments for ess could be used to encourage farmers to adjust agricultural structures and farming practices and encourage pastoralists to reduce grazing in addition to agriculture public awareness of water conservation should be raised and governments should be advised to establish sound water resource management policies liu et al 2022a current ecological restoration has not achieved good ecological benefits so it is necessary to rationally plan agricultural development and vegetation protection and restoration grassland provides important ess and there is a need to enhance grassland protection such as establishing more grassland reserves restoring and managing grasslands and using remote sensing to monitor the effects of drought on grasslands bai and cotrufo 2022 huang et al 2021 ecological restoration policies need to balance agricultural production and ecological protection forest land restoration tends to consume more water than grassland restoration and it is suggested to use grassland restoration instead of forest land restoration in arid regions rgb is an effective method of ecological restoration in arid regions that can improve wp while guaranteeing agricultural production zheng et al 2019 it is recommended to select drought resistant grass types for ecological restoration decision makers can refer to the framework of this study to determine the best implementation width of rgb 4 4 limitations this study only used cultivated land area as an indicator of grain yield while people in arid areas rely not only on agricultural products but also on animal husbandry grain yield needs to be more accurately quantified in the future the ess considered in this study were limited and important ess such as biodiversity and carbon storage were not considered this study only considered the influence of lulc change on ess while the ecosystem in arid regions is very sensitive to climate change karakani et al 2021 climate change should be taken into account in future to assess ecosystem services in arid regions similarly we designed ecological restoration scenarios only from a policy perspective without considering the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities future research should take these factors into account to more realistically simulate lulc under ecological restoration policies through scenario analysis this study concluded that rgb is more suitable for ecological restoration in arid regions and empirical studies in various regions are still needed despite the limitations of this study we believe that the results can make an important contribution to ecological restoration in arid regions 5 conclusions this study analyzed the impact of lulc changes on ess from 2000 to 2020 and designed an ad scenario to indicate the impact of agricultural development and multiple ecological restoration scenarios which allowed for the exploration of the benefits of different ecological restoration rules the results showed that grain yield increased at the expense of wy and ne from 2000 to 2020 grain yield and wy increased while wp decreased under the ad scenario although the pf and pg scenarios could guarantee grain yield wy and wp decreased the rfb1 rfb4 scenarios and rgb3 rgb4 scenarios can guarantee food and water security the pv scenarios had a greater impact on wy while the rvb scenarios had a greater impact on wp the effect of forest land restoration on water related ess was greater than that of grassland restoration especially on wy the effect of rfb scenarios on wp was slightly higher than that of corresponding rgb scenarios compared with the ad scenario the rgb scenarios achieved higher wp at the expense of less wy which was more suitable for ecological restoration in arid regions with the increase in the riparian buffer zone the wy efficiency increased nonlinearly and the wp efficiency decreased nonlinearly under the rgb scenarios rgb1 rgb5 rgb4 was the best ecological restoration scenario because the average percentage increase in the three ess was higher ecological benefits are not necessarily positively correlated with the area of vegetation restoration moderate ecological restoration can achieve maximum ecological benefits decision makers should comprehensively consider the type location and scale of vegetation restoration when making ecological restoration policies this study can provide inspiration for sustainable agricultural development and ecosystem management in arid regions credit authorship contribution

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction tomato solanum lycopersicum l a crop widely cultivated around the world is one of the important vegetables because of its delicious taste and high nutritional value passam et al 2007 qu et al 2022 wang and xing 2017 the tomato production in asia accounts for 44 of the world s production 182 million tons in a dominant position in 2017 fao 2018 china is the leader of the world in terms of tomato cultivation area over 1 million hectares and tomato production 56 million tons per year zhao et al 2021 fao 2018 tomato is commonly planted both in open field and greenhouse environments chand et al 2020 solar greenhouse is dominantly used for vegetable cultivation in china over the past few decades because it not only has the potential for off season production of high quality vegetables and high profit but also serves as an artificially controlled enclosed area to resist climate change lv et al 2019 yao et al 2019 the continuous population growth and global food demand necessitate adequate food production lahoz et al 2016 liao et al 2021 thus it is crucial to develop sustainable greenhouse production system for better crop growth stable and high tomato yield irrigation is considered as the only method of enhancing soil water content and providing plants with water in greenhouse based production systems zhong et al 2017 it is of great importance to reduce agricultural water consumption for alleviating the problem of scarce water resources in arid and semi arid areas chen et al 2018 water waste is still serious with a lot soil evaporation and loss to the deep soil but less crop utilization al ghobari dewidar 2018 among several irrigation management strategies appropriate deficit irrigation generally maximizes crop water productivity khapte et al 2019 patanè et al 2010 wu et al 2021 additionally the three major nutrients for greenhouse tomato production are nitrogen phosphorus and potassium mainly applied by fertilizers kuneva et al 2017 importantly irrigation and fertilization are intrinsically linked the coupling effects of water and fertilizer application on plant growth has been explored in different regions of the world but the results varied among the studies depending on the cultivation methods and soil environments li et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 besides the excessive fertilization and irrigation is common to minimize the risk of yield reduction which has dramatically escalated the waste of resources and environmental damage such as the eutrophication of groundwater and soil nutrient leaching lv et al 2020 li et al 2017b therefore people should strive to ensure the appropriate irrigation and fertilization strategies for efficient resources utilization and sustained tomato yield with the development of irrigation technology drip irrigation has become a widely adopted irrigation method in the arid agroecosystems of the world tao et al 2018 yao et al 2019 compared with conventional flood or furrow irrigation drip irrigation is superior in saving large amount of irrigation water and effectively improving water productivity through providing irrigation water directly to the root zone of plants lv et al 2019 besides drip irrigation systems can be used for fertilization since fertilizers can be dissolved in the water and applied to the field with irrigation simultaneously under drip fertigation chand et al 2020 fan et al 2017 jayakumar et al 2017 drip irrigation with optimized fertilization strategy has the potential of significantly reducing fertilizer use inhibiting nutrient and fertilizer leaching below the root zone increasing nitrogen use efficiency and crop yield and minimizing the impact of fertilizer on the environment liu et al 2021 zhong et al 2017 zheng et al 2013 however the responses of tomato yield and water productivity varied according to the climate condition of experimental sites and soil properties in drip fertigation zhang et al 2017 unfortunately the shortcomings of drip fertilization have also gradually appeared in recent years such as soil compaction and soil quality deterioration especially in the poor soil with low organic carbon content li et al 2017a considerable amounts of nutrients and salts often accumulate in the soil wetting area such as the greenhouse tomato fertigated with much higher nutrient concentrations and drip irrigated with moderately saline water on the southeast spanish mediterranean coast bonachela et al 2022 cabrera corral et al 2016 current drip fertilization mode relies strongly on the soluble inorganic fertilizers application instead of organic fertilizers use tao et al 2018 there have been studies reporting that the partial substitution of organic fertilizer for chemical fertilizer under drip irrigation promoted soil nutrient content and improved cotton yield tao et al 2017 hence there is an urgent need to further optimize the drip fertigation regime for a better greenhouse tomato production chemical and organic fertilizers play dissimilar advantages in crop production synthetic chemical fertilizers provide crops with directly available nitrate ammonia and other nutrients díaz pérez et al 2021 da silva et al 2020 organic fertilizer containing a variety of nutrients and microorganisms beneficial for increasing crop yield and improving soil water and nutrient holding capacity is widely used for striking a balance between crop production and environment preservation fan et al 2017 guo et al 2016 li et al 2017a norris and congreves 2018 wu et al 2020 however organic nutrients from organic fertilizers must be mineralized into inorganic forms to be available to plants díaz pérez et al 2021 meanwhile a large number of studies reported that organic fertilizer was potentially used to subsidize the vast need for synthetic chemical fertilizers tao et al 2018 barzee et al 2019 previous studies have showed that a combination of inorganic and organic fertilizers may also contribute to significantly improving crop growth and productivity by enhancing the nutrient rich rhizosphere environment on a sustainable basis zhang et al 2022 zhang et al 2016 leskovar and othman 2018 to date the direct influences of chemical and organic fertilizer application on tomato growth and water consumption and soil enviroment in drip fertigated greenhouse production systems are still not fully understood this study focused on investigating the effects of chemical and organic fertilizers on plant growth water consumption characteristics soil nitrate nitrogen residue and fruit yield of greenhouse tomato under drip fertigation it was hypothesized that the integration of chemical and organic fertilizer using the drip fertigation system could promote the tomato growth and realize water saving greenhouse production for the sustainable agricultural development the objectives thus were to explore the optimal water fertilizer scheme that achieved efficient water use and to ascertain the relationship among tomato growth water consumption soil nitrate nitrogen residue and fruit yield in greenhouse production systems in the arid and semi arid

correlations among growth characteristics dry matter of each organ water consumption soil nitrate nitrogen residue and fruit yield of tomato were analyzed in spring and autumn seasons fig 8 in spring yield had the significantly positive correlation with leaf spad leaf fruit and root dry matter and soil nitrate nitrogen reside fig 8a water consumption also had significantly positive correlation with plant height leaf area index leaf dry matter and soil nitrate nitrogen reside fig 8a however only stem diameter in spring showed significantly negative correlation with leaf spad stem and leaf dry matter otherwise yield in autumn had significantly positive correlation with leaf spad dry matter of each organ as well as water consumption before the harvest stage fig 8b structural equation modeling sem manifested that the putative pathways through which plant growth water consumption soil nitrate nitrogen residue ultimately influenced fruit yield were diverse in spring fig 9a and autumn

found that as the irrigation level increased tomato plant height leaf area index and dry matter increased figs 1 2 4 this was consistent with the finding of kuşçu et al 2014 who reported that deficit irrigation inhibited the vegetative growth of crops this was because the reduced plant photosynthesis under water stress provided less metabolites and energy for crop growth gamareldawla et al 2017 which was also confirmed by the leaf spad and correlation analysis in this study table 1 figs 3 8 additionally it was concluded that total dry matter of tomato plant was larger in spring than in autumn but greater root shoot ratio was obtained in autumn fig 4 the reason may be that temperature was one of the crucial environmental factors influencing tomato growth xiao et al 2018 and the higher average temperature in spring was more conducive to tomato growth than the lower temperature in autumn fig s1 previous studies indicated that the optimum temperature for tomato growth was 18 3 32 2 c shamshiri et al 2018 and 16 18 5 c for seedling stage of tomato jones 2013 18 20 c for fruit expanding stage of tomato he et al 2019 the reason for the variation of root shoot ratio in different growing seasons was that less irrigation in autumn did not effectively promote root growth and roots absorbed more water and nutrients from the rhizosphere soil to maintain plant growth this study confirmed that deficit irrigation improved tomato root weight and length nangare et al 2016 however both stem and root dry matter could not enter the sem in spring and autumn fig 9 in autumn leaf dry matter positively affected fruit dry matter and fruit yield confirming that leaves were the main organs for energy intake in relatively low temperature environment sosc enhanced plant height and dry matter of greenhouse tomato but cc obtained the larger leaf area index only under w3 in autumn seasons and under w1 in autumn 2015 this result indicated that the combination of chemical and organic fertilizers promoted plant growth islam et al 2017 besides both so and sosc had relatively higher root shoot ratio this can be due to the positive effect of humic acid in soluble organic fertilizer on root growth shen et al 2017 as for sc treatment sufficient nutrient and water supply under w1 in spring led to larger stem diameter and plant overgrowth before the flowering stage of tomato which inhibited the nutrient absorption of tomato fruit at fruit expanding stage this was the reason why total dry matter was low under sc chen et al 2019 indicated that compared with the synthetic chemical fertilizer application alone the integration of organic and inorganic fertilizers significantly enhanced leaf chlorophyll content this result was consistent with the finding of this study fig 3 in addition sosc showed the advantage of increasing leaf spad compared with cc besides soluble organic fertilizer applied many times during tomato growth effectively increased root growth the greater roots had the ability to strongly absorb soil nitrogen nutrition that can be used to support aboveground growth so more nitrogen distributed to the leaves was beneficial to the synthesis of chlorophyll for improving plant photosynthesis liu et al 2020 by comparing the correlation in different seasons stem diameter had the negative correlation with growth characteristics and water consumption only in spring fig 8 the reasons can be that higher temperature and radiation in spring were beneficial for enhancing leaf spad leaf dry matter and water consumption and then inhibiting the increase of stem diameter gong et al 2021 in spring improved leaf area index and leaf dry matter had significantly positive correlation with water consumption which reconfirmed this result fig 8a nevertheless inhibited leaf growth and leaf spad in autumn promoted the increase of plant height which had significantly positive correlation with tomato yield zhang et al 2021 gorni et al 2022 4 2 water consumption and soil nitrate nitrogen residue the water consumption amount of tomato in this study was consistent with that of 224 0 319 9 mm in the north china plain li et al 2017c total water consumption had positive relationship with irrigation amount lu et al 2019 water transport in the soil plant atmosphere system is a passive process driven by the energy gradient between soil and atmosphere fricke 2017 irrigation directly improves soil moisture content which is a key factor to maintain leaf stomatal function and the driving force of water transportation in the plant zhang et al 2018 crops in arid environment would inform twigs to limit plant transpiration and then reduce water consumption through signal transmission wang et al 2019 moreover with the decrease of irrigation amount the difference of water consumption among various fertilization practices reduced table 2 full irrigation is helpful for different fertilization practices to show their respective advantages sadras et al 2012 proposed that nitrogen fertilizer played a better role under sufficient water supply fertilization practices influenced water consumption at each growth stage of tomato tables 2 3 fig 5 sosc increased water consumption in each growing period of tomato but cc got the opposite result combined with the results from tomato growth of this study exuberant aboveground and root growth consumed and absorbed more water there was a significantly positive correlation between water consumption and dry matter of plant especially leaf dry matter in spring cantero et al 2016 compared with cc sosc significantly enhanced tomato growth and water utilization additionally sc had greater water consumption at seedling stage and blooming and setting stage but its advantage gradually decreased at fruit expanding stage under w1 and w2 water consumption at harvest stage were even lower under sc than under so and sosc on the contrary so increased water consumption at the fruit expansion stage under the three irrigation levels as well as at the harvest stage under w1 and w2 consequently sc improved water consumption in the vegetative growth period of tomato but reduced water consumption in the reproductive growth period it confirmed again that there was a certain plant overgrowth under sc compared with other fertilization strategies ravshanov et al 2022 proposed that enhanced n supply often caused overgrowth of plant vegetative organs and possible misbalance of nutrients in the plant tissue as n supply progressed soil nitrate nitrogen the main form of inorganic nitrogen in the agricultural soil is an important evaluation index of crop available nitrogen and it is easy to migrate with irrigation water or runoff liu et al 2017 the present study showed that snr increased with the increasing irrigation amount w3 50 etc not only inhibited nutrient uptake and plant growth but also promoted soil nitrate leaching previous results indicated that crop roots absorbed nitrogen from surface soil resulting in the reduction of topsoil nitrate nitrogen cavagnaro et al 2015 as for the effects of fertilization practices on snr snr was higher under sc than under the other three fertilization modes under w1 in autumn w3 in spring and w2 in autumn and spring indicating that sufficient irrigation could better promote crops to absorb snr under suitable environmental conditions in spring for tomato production the reason was that seriously deficient water could not satisfy the strong demand of crop growth in spring under w3 and soil nitrate nitrogen produced by nitrification in spring could not be absorbed in time which resulted in a large amount of soil nitrate nitrogen accumulation the result was consistent with the finding of fan et al 2017 who found that annual nitrogen leaching loss under inorganic fertilizer treatment was higher than that under the other fertilization modes nevertheless unlike under sc snr under so was larger in spring especially under w1 but smaller in autumn the reason was that the strong mineralization in spring was conducive to the rapid conversion of organic nitrogen into inorganic nitrogen for crop nitrogen absorption and utilization the elevated temperature significantly promoted net n mineralization rates of shallow soils song et al 2018 although a large amount of available nitrogen was utilized for crop growth under so in spring snr was still larger in spring generally sosc had lower snr in the 0 60 cm soil layer than the other fertilization modes under w1 and w2 in autumn 2015 autumn 2016 and spring 2017 comprehensively considering tomato growth and soil nitrate residue it was found that sosc had the advantages of both organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer liquid inorganic nitrogen fertilizer can be immediately absorbed and utilized by crops celestina et al 2019 strong mineralization of soluble organic fertilizer in the surface soil produced abundant available nitrogen so as to promote crop growth although more inorganic nitrogen fertilizer was applied under sc than under sosc better tomato growth under sosc forced the roots to absorb nutrients in the deep soil therefore the snr of 0 60 cm soil layer was less under sosc 5 conclusions increasing irrigation amount significantly increased plant height leaf area index leaf spad dry matter water consumption and fruit yield of tomato with the decrease of irrigation amount the difference of both leaf area index and water consumption under various fertilization practices reduced conversely the root shoot ratio in autumn 3 21 10 2 was greater than that in spring 2 05 10 2 due to the vigorous roots growth in autumn for obtaining more nutrition and water in soils in autumn leaf dry matter positively affected fruit dry matter and fruit yield in spring only fruit dry matter positively affected fruit yield additionally sosc improved plant height dry matter and leaf spad while both so and sosc obtained higher the root shoot ratio as for the water consumption both sc and sosc had greater water consumption at seedling stage and at blooming and setting stage than cc water consumption at harvest stage under both so and sosc was higher than that under sc sosc obtained higher yield but both cc and sc under w1 obtained lower yield while the difference of yield between cc and sc reduced with increase in water deficit in general sosc has the potential of increasing plant growth leaf spad water consumption and fruit yield of tomato as well as reducing soil nitrate nitrogen residue according to the comprehensive consideration

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction tomato solanum lycopersicum l a crop widely cultivated around the world is one of the important vegetables because of its delicious taste and high nutritional value passam et al 2007 qu et al 2022 wang and xing 2017 the tomato production in asia accounts for 44 of the world s production 182 million tons in a dominant position in 2017 fao 2018 china is the leader of the world in terms of tomato cultivation area over 1 million hectares and tomato production 56 million tons per year zhao et al 2021 fao 2018 tomato is commonly planted both in open field and greenhouse environments chand et al 2020 solar greenhouse is dominantly used for vegetable cultivation in china over the past few decades because it not only has the potential for off season production of high quality vegetables and high profit but also serves as an artificially controlled enclosed area to resist climate change lv et al 2019 yao et al 2019 the continuous population growth and global food demand necessitate adequate food production lahoz et al 2016 liao et al 2021 thus it is crucial to develop sustainable greenhouse production system for better crop growth stable and high tomato yield irrigation is considered as the only method of enhancing soil water content and providing plants with water in greenhouse based production systems zhong et al 2017 it is of great importance to reduce agricultural water consumption for alleviating the problem of scarce water resources in arid and semi arid areas chen et al 2018 water waste is still serious with a lot soil evaporation and loss to the deep soil but less crop utilization al ghobari dewidar 2018 among several irrigation management strategies appropriate deficit irrigation generally maximizes crop water productivity khapte et al 2019 patanè et al 2010 wu et al 2021 additionally the three major nutrients for greenhouse tomato production are nitrogen phosphorus and potassium mainly applied by fertilizers kuneva et al 2017 importantly irrigation and fertilization are intrinsically linked the coupling effects of water and fertilizer application on plant growth has been explored in different regions of the world but the results varied among the studies depending on the cultivation methods and soil environments li et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 besides the excessive fertilization and irrigation is common to minimize the risk of yield reduction which has dramatically escalated the waste of resources and environmental damage such as the eutrophication of groundwater and soil nutrient leaching lv et al 2020 li et al 2017b therefore people should strive to ensure the appropriate irrigation and fertilization strategies for efficient resources utilization and sustained tomato yield with the development of irrigation technology drip irrigation has become a widely adopted irrigation method in the arid agroecosystems of the world tao et al 2018 yao et al 2019 compared with conventional flood or furrow irrigation drip irrigation is superior in saving large amount of irrigation water and effectively improving water productivity through providing irrigation water directly to the root zone of plants lv et al 2019 besides drip irrigation systems can be used for fertilization since fertilizers can be dissolved in the water and applied to the field with irrigation simultaneously under drip fertigation chand et al 2020 fan et al 2017 jayakumar et al 2017 drip irrigation with optimized fertilization strategy has the potential of significantly reducing fertilizer use inhibiting nutrient and fertilizer leaching below the root zone increasing nitrogen use efficiency and crop yield and minimizing the impact of fertilizer on the environment liu et al 2021 zhong et al 2017 zheng et al 2013 however the responses of tomato yield and water productivity varied according to the climate condition of experimental sites and soil properties in drip fertigation zhang et al 2017 unfortunately the shortcomings of drip fertilization have also gradually appeared in recent years such as soil compaction and soil quality deterioration especially in the poor soil with low organic carbon content li et al 2017a considerable amounts of nutrients and salts often accumulate in the soil wetting area such as the greenhouse tomato fertigated with much higher nutrient concentrations and drip irrigated with moderately saline water on the southeast spanish mediterranean coast bonachela et al 2022 cabrera corral et al 2016 current drip fertilization mode relies strongly on the soluble inorganic fertilizers application instead of organic fertilizers use tao et al 2018 there have been studies reporting that the partial substitution of organic fertilizer for chemical fertilizer under drip irrigation promoted soil nutrient content and improved cotton yield tao et al 2017 hence there is an urgent need to further optimize the drip fertigation regime for a better greenhouse tomato production chemical and organic fertilizers play dissimilar advantages in crop production synthetic chemical fertilizers provide crops with directly available nitrate ammonia and other nutrients díaz pérez et al 2021 da silva et al 2020 organic fertilizer containing a variety of nutrients and microorganisms beneficial for increasing crop yield and improving soil water and nutrient holding capacity is widely used for striking a balance between crop production and environment preservation fan et al 2017 guo et al 2016 li et al 2017a norris and congreves 2018 wu et al 2020 however organic nutrients from organic fertilizers must be mineralized into inorganic forms to be available to plants díaz pérez et al 2021 meanwhile a large number of studies reported that organic fertilizer was potentially used to subsidize the vast need for synthetic chemical fertilizers tao et al 2018 barzee et al 2019 previous studies have showed that a combination of inorganic and organic fertilizers may also contribute to significantly improving crop growth and productivity by enhancing the nutrient rich rhizosphere environment on a sustainable basis zhang et al 2022 zhang et al 2016 leskovar and othman 2018 to date the direct influences of chemical and organic fertilizer application on tomato growth and water consumption and soil enviroment in drip fertigated greenhouse production systems are still not fully understood this study focused on investigating the effects of chemical and organic fertilizers on plant growth water consumption characteristics soil nitrate nitrogen residue and fruit yield of greenhouse tomato under drip fertigation it was hypothesized that the integration of chemical and organic fertilizer using the drip fertigation system could promote the tomato growth and realize water saving greenhouse production for the sustainable agricultural development the objectives thus were to explore the optimal water fertilizer scheme that achieved efficient water use and to ascertain the relationship among tomato growth water consumption soil nitrate nitrogen residue and fruit yield in greenhouse production systems in the arid and semi arid

correlations among growth characteristics dry matter of each organ water consumption soil nitrate nitrogen residue and fruit yield of tomato were analyzed in spring and autumn seasons fig 8 in spring yield had the significantly positive correlation with leaf spad leaf fruit and root dry matter and soil nitrate nitrogen reside fig 8a water consumption also had significantly positive correlation with plant height leaf area index leaf dry matter and soil nitrate nitrogen reside fig 8a however only stem diameter in spring showed significantly negative correlation with leaf spad stem and leaf dry matter otherwise yield in autumn had significantly positive correlation with leaf spad dry matter of each organ as well as water consumption before the harvest stage fig 8b structural equation modeling sem manifested that the putative pathways through which plant growth water consumption soil nitrate nitrogen residue ultimately influenced fruit yield were diverse in spring fig 9a and autumn seasons fig 9b in spring water consumption at harvest stage had direct significantly negative effects on fruit yield of greenhouse tomato λ 0 702 p 0 001 water consumption at fruit expanding stage had

found that as the irrigation level increased tomato plant height leaf area index and dry matter increased figs 1 2 4 this was consistent with the finding of kuşçu et al 2014 who reported that deficit irrigation inhibited the vegetative growth of crops this was because the reduced plant photosynthesis under water stress provided less metabolites and energy for crop growth gamareldawla et al 2017 which was also confirmed by the leaf spad and correlation analysis in this study table 1 figs 3 8 additionally it was concluded that total dry matter of tomato plant was larger in spring than in autumn but greater root shoot ratio was obtained in autumn fig 4 the reason may be that temperature was one of the crucial environmental factors influencing tomato growth xiao et al 2018 and the higher average temperature in spring was more conducive to tomato growth than the lower temperature in autumn fig s1 previous studies indicated that the optimum temperature for tomato growth was 18 3 32 2 c shamshiri et al 2018 and 16 18 5 c for seedling stage of tomato jones 2013 18 20 c for fruit expanding stage of tomato he et al 2019 the reason for the variation of root shoot ratio in different growing seasons was that less irrigation in autumn did not effectively promote root growth and roots absorbed more water and nutrients from the rhizosphere soil to maintain plant growth this study confirmed that deficit irrigation improved tomato root weight and length nangare et al 2016 however both stem and root dry matter could not enter the sem in spring and autumn fig 9 in autumn leaf dry matter positively affected fruit dry matter and fruit yield confirming that leaves were the main organs for energy intake in relatively low temperature environment sosc enhanced plant height and dry matter of greenhouse tomato but cc obtained the larger leaf area index only under w3 in autumn seasons and under w1 in autumn 2015 this result indicated that the combination of chemical and organic fertilizers promoted plant growth islam et al 2017 besides both so and sosc had relatively higher root shoot ratio this can be due to the positive effect of humic acid in soluble organic fertilizer on root growth shen et al 2017 as for sc treatment sufficient nutrient and water supply under w1 in spring led to larger stem diameter and plant overgrowth before the flowering stage of tomato which inhibited the nutrient absorption of tomato fruit at fruit expanding stage this was the reason why total dry matter was low under sc chen et al 2019 indicated that compared with the synthetic chemical fertilizer application alone the integration of organic and inorganic fertilizers significantly enhanced leaf chlorophyll content this result was consistent with the finding of this study fig 3 in addition sosc showed the advantage of increasing leaf spad compared with cc besides soluble organic fertilizer applied many times during tomato growth effectively increased root growth the greater roots had the ability to strongly absorb soil nitrogen nutrition that can be used to support aboveground growth so more nitrogen distributed to the leaves was beneficial to the synthesis of chlorophyll for improving plant photosynthesis liu et al 2020 by comparing the correlation in different seasons stem diameter had the negative correlation with growth characteristics and water consumption only in spring fig 8 the reasons can be that higher temperature and radiation in spring were beneficial for enhancing leaf spad leaf dry matter and water consumption and then inhibiting the increase of stem diameter gong et al 2021 in spring improved leaf area index and leaf dry matter had significantly positive correlation with water consumption which reconfirmed this result fig 8a nevertheless inhibited leaf growth and leaf spad in autumn promoted the increase of plant height which had significantly positive correlation with tomato yield zhang et al 2021 gorni et al 2022 4 2 water consumption and soil nitrate nitrogen residue the water consumption amount of tomato in this study was consistent with that of 224 0 319 9 mm in the north china plain li et al 2017c total water consumption had positive relationship with irrigation amount lu et al 2019 water transport in the soil plant atmosphere system is a passive process driven by the energy gradient between soil and atmosphere fricke 2017 irrigation directly improves soil moisture content which is a key factor to maintain leaf stomatal function and the driving force of water transportation in the plant zhang et al 2018 crops in arid environment would inform twigs to limit plant transpiration and then reduce water consumption through signal transmission wang et al 2019 moreover with the decrease of irrigation amount the difference of water consumption among various fertilization practices reduced table 2 full irrigation is helpful for different fertilization practices to show their respective advantages sadras et al 2012 proposed that nitrogen fertilizer played a better role under sufficient water supply fertilization practices influenced water consumption at each growth stage of tomato tables 2 3 fig 5 sosc increased water consumption in each growing period of tomato but cc got the opposite result combined with the results from tomato growth of this study exuberant aboveground and root growth consumed and absorbed more water there was a significantly positive correlation between water consumption and dry matter of plant especially leaf dry matter in spring cantero et al 2016 compared with cc sosc significantly enhanced tomato growth and water utilization additionally sc had greater water consumption at seedling stage and blooming and setting stage but its advantage gradually decreased at fruit expanding stage under w1 and w2 water consumption at harvest stage were even lower under sc than under so and sosc on the contrary so increased water consumption at the fruit expansion stage under the three irrigation levels as well as at the harvest stage under w1 and w2 consequently sc improved water consumption in the vegetative growth period of tomato but reduced water consumption in the reproductive growth period it confirmed again that there was a certain plant overgrowth under sc compared with other fertilization strategies ravshanov et al 2022 proposed that enhanced n supply often caused overgrowth of plant vegetative organs and possible misbalance of nutrients in the plant tissue as n supply progressed soil nitrate nitrogen the main form of inorganic nitrogen in the agricultural soil is an important evaluation index of crop available nitrogen and it is easy to migrate with irrigation water or runoff liu et al 2017 the present study showed that snr increased with the increasing irrigation amount w3 50 etc not only inhibited nutrient uptake and plant growth but also promoted soil nitrate leaching previous results indicated that crop roots absorbed nitrogen from surface soil resulting in the reduction of topsoil nitrate nitrogen cavagnaro et al 2015 as for the effects of fertilization practices on snr snr was higher under sc than under the other three fertilization modes under w1 in autumn w3 in spring and w2 in autumn and spring indicating that sufficient irrigation could better promote crops to absorb snr under suitable environmental conditions in spring for tomato production the reason was that seriously deficient water could not satisfy the strong demand of crop growth in spring under w3 and soil nitrate nitrogen produced by nitrification in spring could not be absorbed in time which resulted in a large amount of soil nitrate nitrogen accumulation the result was consistent with the finding of fan et al 2017 who found that annual nitrogen leaching loss under inorganic fertilizer treatment was higher than that under the other fertilization modes nevertheless unlike under sc snr under so was larger in spring especially under w1 but smaller in autumn the reason was that the strong mineralization in spring was conducive to the rapid conversion of organic nitrogen into inorganic nitrogen for crop nitrogen absorption and utilization the elevated temperature significantly promoted net n mineralization rates of shallow soils song et al 2018 although a large amount of available nitrogen was utilized for crop growth under so in spring snr was still larger in spring generally sosc had lower snr in the 0 60 cm soil layer than the other fertilization modes under w1 and w2 in autumn 2015 autumn 2016 and spring 2017 comprehensively considering tomato growth and soil nitrate residue it was found that sosc had the advantages of both organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer liquid inorganic nitrogen fertilizer can be immediately absorbed and utilized by crops celestina et al 2019 strong mineralization of soluble organic fertilizer in the surface soil produced abundant available nitrogen so as to promote crop growth although more inorganic nitrogen fertilizer was applied under sc than under sosc better tomato growth under sosc forced the roots to absorb nutrients in the deep soil therefore the snr of 0 60 cm soil layer was less under sosc 5 conclusions increasing irrigation amount significantly increased plant height leaf area index leaf spad dry matter water consumption and fruit yield of tomato with the decrease of irrigation amount the difference of both leaf area index and water consumption under various fertilization practices reduced conversely the root shoot ratio in autumn 3 21 10 2 was greater than that in spring 2 05 10 2 due to the vigorous roots growth in autumn for obtaining more nutrition and water in soils in autumn leaf dry matter positively affected fruit dry matter and fruit yield in spring only fruit dry matter positively affected fruit yield additionally sosc improved plant height dry matter and leaf spad while both so and sosc obtained higher the root shoot ratio as for the water consumption both sc and sosc had greater water consumption at seedling stage and at blooming and setting stage than cc water consumption at harvest stage under both so and sosc was higher than that under sc sosc obtained higher yield but both cc and sc under w1 obtained lower yield while the difference of yield between cc and sc reduced with increase in water deficit in general sosc has the potential of increasing plant growth leaf spad water consumption and fruit yield of tomato as well as reducing soil nitrate nitrogen residue according to the comprehensive consideration of highly efficient greenhouse production and sustainable agriculture development in arid and semiarid regions the optimum combinations of irrigation amount and fertilization practice recommended in
