study of global hydrology climate and carbon cycle hydrological variables are of particular importance however generating this data on a global scale is still a major challenge the purpose of the earth data collection system ldas is to integrate satellite data and ground observational data using advanced surface models and data collection techniques to provide input hydrological variables to hydrological and climatic models and facilitate modeling gldas data are generated within the land information system lis software framework for land surface modeling the hydrological science subgroup developed the lis at nasa s goddard space flight center gsfc the gldas model is supported by nasa s energy and water cycle studies news to date gldas has generated spatial and temporal surface data for nearly 40 years 1979 until now the cru was first established at the college of east anglia in 1972 the number of stations used in it varied so that for the early years of this data 1901 the number of stations used in these datasets production was 4957 stations increased to 14 572 station in 1981 harris et al 2014 this dataset includes various information such as precipitation p number of wet

evaluation criterias gldas agmerra gldas cru gldas agcfsr networked meteorological datasets have been evaluated in estimating the yield and actual evapotranspiration eta of wheat and maize crops and comparing it with the estimated values of qazvin synoptic station information in this study the results of the scenarios with the data of qazvin station for two maize and wheat crops by error statistical criteria including determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and normal square root mean square error nrmse maximum error me were compared explanation coefficient is one of the most important criteria for evaluating the relationship between two variables x and y which is displayed dimensionless this coefficient is directly related to the correlation coefficient in this way by taking the square root of the determination coefficient the correlation coefficient between the two series can be obtained as with the correlation coefficient the closer the value of the determination coefficient is to one the stronger the relationship between the two variables if the determination coefficient is multiplied by 100 the value obtained represents the variance of the variable x described by the variable y the pearson coefficient classification is given in the table below joinior et al 2017 excel software was used to calculate the explanation coefficient table 3 the nrmse index indicates the level of estimation the nrmse classification by jamieson et al 1991 is given in table 4 jamieson et al 1991 5 nrmse 1 o i 1 n o i p i 2 n the me index indicates the highest error in the model calculated using formula 5 too high me indicates the worst performance 6 me max o i p i o i and p i are observational and predicted amount o is the mean of the observational amounts and n is the number of data or time duration series statistical analyses were performed with minitab v18 0 pearson correlation coefficients were adopted to investigate the correlation between wheat and maize yield with climatic variables the pearson correlation coefficient is the most frequently used for normally distributed data chok et al 2009 the regression equations between climate variables and yield and the associated correlation of determination r2 are presented 3 result and discussion 3 1 climatic variable average potential evapotranspiration etp mm day minimum temperature tmin and maximum temperature tmax of qazvin synoptic station and datasets in 1980 2010 are presented in fig 2 the results of evaluating the tmin and tmax of datasets with synoptic stations from 1980 to 2010 are given in table 5 a study conducted by lashkari et al 2016 in examining the applicability of agmerra meteorological datasets data with synoptic data showed that agmerra datasets data has a high correlation in simulating the maximum temperature tmax at mashhad station in a study that bahrololum et al 2020a 2020b used meteorological datasets to evaluate the yield and water requirement of wheat in the qazvin synoptic station similar results were obtained and the correlation coefficient for the agmerra dataset shows 0 88 khalili et al 2014 evaluated the wheat yield simulation in north khorasan province that similar results were obtained and the correlation coefficient was 0 86 masanganise et al 2013 evaluated the aqua crop model in simulating maize yield in zimbabwe and the results showed that the model has a good ability to simulate this crop rahimikhoob et al 2014 calibrated the aqua crop model for forage maize in the qazvin region with similar results and the average error of the model was about 10 the monthly average potential evapotranspiration etp evaluation of datasets with synoptic stations during 1980 2010 is given in table 6 the low accuracy of estimating potential evapotranspiration in scenarios 4 and 6 for wheat and maize may be because the potential evapotranspiration of agmerra and agcfsr datasets in these scenarios are used and the potential evapotranspiration of these datasets is less accurate than cru bases and gldas model a study conducted by faraji et al 2017 explained the explanation coefficient of 0 82 for the total monthly precipitation p of the gldas model and qazvin station during the years 1995 2005 also for evapotranspiration et from the lysimeter of ismail abad station in qazvin and gldas from 1979 to 1382 has reported an explanation coefficient of 0 95 the results of moiwo et al 2012 research also indicate that gldas evapotranspiration with lysimeter evapotranspiration data at best shows an explanation coefficient of 0 92 and rmse 0 4 a alizadeh et al 2010 h alizadeh et al 2010 evaluated the efficiency of the aqua crop model in wheat yield in low irrigation conditions the results showed that this model is able to simulate the et of wheat with relatively appropriate accuracy with a mean squared error of 4 9 and a maximum error of 8 21 3 2 yield local sensitivity analysis of aqua crop model for wheat and corn in qazvin plain adabi et al 2020 calibration of this model kamali et al 2016 raamezani etedali et al 2016 and calibration of lars wg model in qazvin plain akbari et al 2019 was performed by researchers and therefore in this study sensitivity analysis and calibration were not performed in order to study the relationship between climatic variables and yield the distribution of yield was examined at a 5 significance level fig 3 the probability distribution was normal for wheat while it was normal for maize at a 1 significance level regression analysis was performed to investigate the impact of climate variables on the yield of wheat and maize tables 7 8 first the correlation between yield and each of the climate variables was examined table 5 the relationship between yield and precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration etp was positive for maize and negative for wheat while the relationship between the minimum temperature tmin and maximum temperature tmax was negative for maize and positive for wheat p for maize had the highest correlation coefficient r2 0 48 at a 5 significance level the correlations between climatic variables of p tmin and tmax and maize yield were higher than the correlation with wheat yield the relationship between climatic variables and maize yield was stronger than for wheat yield for maize the regression equation with a positive effect of p etp and tmax and a negative effect of tmin had the highest coefficient of determination r2 0 5 the results of this study are consistent with some studies nazari et al 2020 examined regression analysis between climatic variables and yield of wheat in qazvin province during 2004 2005 their results showed that the relationship between yield and etp for the qazvin station is negative consistent with the results of this study nichalls 1997 studied climate change on wheat yield in australia and concluded that wheat yield increases by 3 5 with an increase in temperature lobell and asner 2003 studied climate change on maize yield in the united states and peng et al 2004 on rice yield in the philippines and liangzhi et al 2005 on wheat yield in china and concluded that temperature t increase have a negative effect on yield products the statistical evaluation of scenarios with qazvin synoptic station for yield is shown in fig 4 the wheat and maize yield with aqua crop for scenarios 1 6 in 1980 2010 are presented in figs 4 and 5 the average annual yield of wheat in scenario six and maize in scenario 4 was higher than in other scenarios explanation coefficient for the estimated yield of maize and wheat in fig 6 shows that the estimated data and the synoptic station data have the highest correlation in scenario 3 for maize and in scenarios 2 and 4 for wheat the nrmse parameter shows that the error percentage for wheat and maize scenarios is in the excellent category the me parameter for scenario 1 of maize and scenarios 2 and 4 of wheat have better results than other scenarios the reason for more accurate estimation of wheat yield using the databases in scenarios 2 and 4 may be due to the fact that the aquacrop model is based on growing degree days and temperature data are most effective in estimating yield the difference between the observed and simulated maximum daily temperature can affect crop models in yield simulation using this datasets because in simulating crop yield fluctuations in maximum daily temperature will have a great impact on simulation yield iizumi et al 2014 so that if the difference in maximum daily temperature coincides with the critical growth stages of crops including flowering and seed filling completely different results will be obtained agmerra and agcfsr datasets are more accurate in estimating minimum and maximum temperatures than cru datasets the difference in outputs may be related to how these datasets are configured and how observational data are analyzed in the region haji hosseini et al 2013 in examining the correlation coefficient between climatic variables and yield table 8 the results showed that the minimum temperature tmin and maximum temperature tmax have a greater effect on wheat yield and in these scenarios agmerra dataset temperature was used in a study ghahramanzadeh et al 2014 examined climatic variables effect on the yield of drained wheat irrigated wheat and corn in qazvin province the results showed that the tmin and tmax for maize had a significant effect on yield and the tmax in the growing period had a negative effect on yield the results of this study are consistent with the results obtained in this study 3 3 actual evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration eta of the wheat and maize simulated with aquacrop for scenarios 1 6 in 1980 2010 are presented in figs 7 and 8 the average annual actual evapotranspiration for both wheat and maize in scenario 1 was higher than in other scenarios the statistical evaluation of the annual actual evapotranspiration of scenarios with qazvin synoptic station data are presented in fig 9 the explanation coefficient for the actual evapotranspiration of maize and wheat estimated in fig 9 shows the estimated data and the data of the synoptic station have little correlation the highest correlation 0 42 was obtained for wheat in scenario six and maize in scenario 3 the nrmse parameter shows that the error percentage for wheat and maize scenarios is in the good category in most scenarios the me parameter in scenario 1 for maize and scenario 3 for wheat has better results than the other scenarios 4 conclusion using datasets data is a good tool for studying the temporal spatial changes of meteorological variables the gldas surface model is an important source of information for global water cycle research in this study the pearson regression coefficient was used to investigate the correlation between climatic variables and wheat and maize yield the results showed that the relationship between yield and precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration etp was positive for maize and negative for wheat while the relationship between minimum temperature tmin and maximum temperature tmax was negative for maize and positive for wheat gldas agmerra gldas cru gldas agcfsr networked meteorological datasets were evaluated in estimating the yield and actual evapotranspiration eta of wheat and maize crops and comparing with qazvin synoptic station data the results showed that in general these data have good accuracy in estimating yield the results showed that these data do not have good accuracy in estimating eta the calculated statistical parameters showed that in estimating the yield of the simulated wheat plant using scenario 2 and 4 for maize scenarios 1 and 3 were better correlated with other scenarios in terms of eta scenario 3 for maize and scenario 6 for wheat were better correlated for a more accurate evaluation it is recommended that more stations be considered in different climates to achieve better results also can evaluate more products due to the fact that the gldas model data is updated and modified every month so it is recommended to conduct the present study once every six months before using the gldas surface model data declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

harvest index b biomass model inputs include four categories of meteorological plant management and soil information table 2 shows the required data for each section golabi and naseri 2015 in the study of global hydrology climate and carbon cycle hydrological variables are of particular importance however generating this data on a global scale is still a major challenge the purpose of the earth data collection system ldas is to integrate satellite data and ground observational data using advanced surface models and data collection techniques to provide input hydrological variables to hydrological and climatic models and facilitate modeling gldas data are generated within the land information system lis software framework for land surface modeling the hydrological science subgroup developed the lis at nasa s goddard space flight center gsfc the gldas model is supported by nasa s energy and water cycle studies news to date gldas has generated spatial and temporal surface data for nearly 40 years 1979 until now the cru was first established at the college of east anglia in 1972 the number of stations used in it varied so that for the early years of this data 1901 the number of stations used in these datasets production was 4957 stations increased to 14 572 station in 1981 harris et al 2014 this dataset includes various information such as precipitation p number of wet days average minimum temperature tmin average maximum temperature tmax cloud cover potential evapotranspiration etp and air vapor pressure which is available to the whole world with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 degrees and a monthly temporal separation mitchell et al 2004 in 2014 the us national aeronautics and space administration and columbia university developed the agmerra dataset with the goal of creating a global network for use in agricultural research food security and plant growth models in producing agmerra precipitation data two sets gpcc and cru also persiann cmorph and trmm satellites have been used in combination with merra data ruane et al 2015 this set includes maximum and minimum temperature precipitation p radiation wind speed and water vapor pressure spatial resolution for precipitation data in this dataset is 0 25 0 25 degrees the agcfsr dataset is a collection of data developed by columbia university and the goddard institute for space studies affiliated with the national aeronautics and space administration to assess the needs of the agmip project for meteorological data and to create a global network for use in agricultural studies security food and plant models have been developed razavi et al 2018 the cru dataset precipitation p is calculated and available for world with a resolution of 0 25 0 25 degrees 2 3 statistical evaluation criterias gldas agmerra gldas cru gldas agcfsr networked meteorological datasets have been evaluated in estimating the yield and actual evapotranspiration eta of wheat and maize crops and comparing it with the estimated values of qazvin synoptic station information in this study the results of the scenarios with the data of qazvin station for two maize and wheat crops by error statistical criteria including determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and normal square root mean square error nrmse maximum error me were compared explanation coefficient is one of the most important criteria for evaluating the relationship between two variables x and y which is displayed dimensionless this coefficient is directly related to the correlation coefficient in this way by taking the square root of the determination coefficient the correlation coefficient between the two series can be obtained as with the correlation coefficient the closer the value of the determination coefficient is to one the stronger the relationship between the two variables if the determination coefficient is multiplied by 100 the value obtained represents the variance of the variable x described by the variable y the pearson coefficient classification is given in the table below joinior et al 2017 excel software was used to calculate the explanation coefficient table 3 the nrmse index indicates the level of estimation the nrmse classification by jamieson et al 1991 is given in table 4 jamieson et al 1991 5 nrmse 1 o i 1 n o i p i 2 n the me index indicates the highest error in the model calculated using formula 5 too high me indicates the worst performance 6 me max o i p i o i and p i are observational and predicted amount o is the mean of the observational amounts and n is the number of data or time duration series statistical analyses were performed with minitab v18 0 pearson correlation coefficients were adopted to investigate the correlation between wheat and maize yield with climatic variables the pearson correlation coefficient is the most frequently used for normally distributed data chok et al 2009 the regression equations between climate variables and yield and the associated correlation of determination r2 are presented 3 result and discussion 3 1 climatic variable average potential evapotranspiration etp mm day minimum temperature tmin and maximum temperature tmax of qazvin synoptic station and datasets in 1980 2010 are presented in fig 2 the results of evaluating the tmin and tmax of datasets with synoptic stations from 1980 to 2010 are given in table 5 a study conducted by lashkari et al 2016 in examining the applicability of agmerra meteorological datasets data with synoptic data showed that agmerra datasets data has a high correlation in simulating the maximum temperature tmax at mashhad station in a study that bahrololum et al 2020a 2020b used meteorological datasets to evaluate the yield and water requirement of wheat in the qazvin synoptic station similar results were obtained and the correlation coefficient for the agmerra dataset shows 0 88 khalili et al 2014 evaluated the wheat yield simulation in north khorasan province that similar results were obtained and the correlation coefficient was 0 86 masanganise et al 2013 evaluated the aqua crop model in simulating maize yield in zimbabwe and the results showed that the model has a good ability to simulate this crop rahimikhoob et al 2014 calibrated the aqua crop model for forage maize in the qazvin region with similar results and the average error of the model was about 10 the monthly average potential evapotranspiration etp evaluation of datasets with synoptic stations during 1980 2010 is given in table 6 the low accuracy of estimating potential evapotranspiration in scenarios 4 and 6 for wheat and maize may be because the potential evapotranspiration of agmerra and agcfsr datasets in these scenarios are used and the potential evapotranspiration of these datasets is less accurate than cru bases and gldas model a study conducted by faraji et al 2017 explained the explanation coefficient of 0 82 for the total monthly precipitation p of the gldas model and qazvin station during the years 1995 2005 also for evapotranspiration et from the lysimeter of ismail abad station in qazvin and gldas from 1979 to 1382 has reported an explanation coefficient of 0 95 the results of moiwo et al 2012 research also indicate that gldas evapotranspiration with lysimeter evapotranspiration data at best shows an explanation coefficient of 0 92 and rmse 0 4 a alizadeh et al 2010 h alizadeh et al 2010 evaluated the efficiency of the aqua crop model in wheat yield in low irrigation conditions the results showed that this model is able to simulate the et of wheat with relatively appropriate accuracy with a mean squared error of 4 9 and a maximum error of 8 21 3 2 yield local sensitivity analysis of aqua crop model for wheat and corn in qazvin plain adabi et al 2020 calibration of this model kamali et al 2016 raamezani etedali et al 2016 and calibration of lars wg model in qazvin plain akbari et al 2019 was performed by researchers and therefore in this study sensitivity analysis and calibration were not performed in order to study the relationship between climatic variables and yield the distribution of yield was examined at a 5 significance level fig 3 the probability distribution was normal for wheat while it was normal for maize at a 1 significance level regression analysis was performed to investigate the impact of climate variables on the yield of wheat and maize tables 7 8 first the correlation between yield and each of the climate variables was examined table 5 the relationship between yield and precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration etp was positive for maize and negative for wheat while the relationship between the minimum temperature tmin and maximum temperature tmax was negative for maize and positive for wheat p for maize had the highest correlation coefficient r2 0 48 at a 5 significance level the correlations between climatic variables of p tmin and tmax and maize yield were higher than the correlation with wheat yield the relationship between climatic variables and maize yield was stronger than for wheat yield for maize the regression equation with a positive effect of p etp and tmax and a negative effect of tmin had the highest coefficient of determination r2 0 5 the results of this study are consistent with some studies nazari et al 2020 examined regression analysis between climatic variables and yield of wheat in qazvin province during 2004 2005 their results showed that the relationship between yield and etp for the qazvin station is negative consistent with the results of this study nichalls 1997 studied climate change on wheat yield in australia and concluded that wheat yield increases by 3 5 with an increase in temperature lobell and asner 2003 studied climate change on maize yield in the united states and peng et al 2004 on rice yield in the philippines and liangzhi et al 2005 on wheat yield in china and concluded that temperature t increase have a negative effect on yield products the statistical evaluation of scenarios with qazvin synoptic station for yield is shown in fig 4 the wheat and maize yield with aqua crop for scenarios 1 6 in 1980 2010 are presented in figs 4 and 5 the average annual yield of wheat in scenario six and maize in scenario 4 was higher than in other scenarios explanation coefficient for the estimated yield of maize and wheat in fig 6 shows that the estimated data and the synoptic station data have the highest correlation in scenario 3 for maize and in scenarios 2 and 4 for wheat the nrmse parameter shows that the error percentage for wheat and maize scenarios is in the excellent category the me parameter for scenario 1 of maize and scenarios 2 and 4 of wheat have better results than other scenarios the reason for more accurate estimation of wheat yield using the databases in scenarios 2 and 4 may be due to the fact that the aquacrop model is based on growing degree days and temperature data are most effective in estimating yield the difference between the observed and simulated maximum daily temperature can affect crop models in yield simulation using this datasets because in simulating crop yield fluctuations in maximum daily temperature will have a great impact on simulation yield iizumi et al 2014 so that if the difference in maximum daily temperature coincides with the critical growth stages of crops including flowering and seed filling completely different results will be obtained agmerra and agcfsr datasets are more accurate in estimating minimum and maximum temperatures than cru datasets the difference in outputs may be related to how these datasets are configured and how observational data are analyzed in the region haji hosseini et al 2013 in examining the correlation coefficient between climatic variables and yield table 8 the results showed that the minimum temperature tmin and maximum temperature tmax have a greater effect on wheat yield and in these scenarios agmerra dataset temperature was used in a study ghahramanzadeh et al 2014 examined climatic variables effect on the yield of drained wheat irrigated wheat and corn in qazvin province the results showed that the tmin and tmax for maize had a significant effect on yield and the tmax in the growing period had a negative effect on yield the results of this study are consistent with the results obtained in this study 3 3 actual evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration eta of the wheat and maize simulated with aquacrop for scenarios 1 6 in 1980 2010 are presented in figs 7 and 8 the average annual actual evapotranspiration for both wheat and maize in scenario 1 was higher than in other scenarios the statistical evaluation of the annual actual evapotranspiration of scenarios with qazvin synoptic station data are presented in fig 9 the explanation coefficient for the actual evapotranspiration of maize and wheat estimated in fig 9 shows the estimated data and the data of the synoptic station have little correlation the highest correlation 0 42 was obtained for wheat in scenario six and maize in scenario 3 the nrmse parameter shows that the error percentage for wheat and maize scenarios is in the good category in most scenarios the me parameter in scenario 1 for maize and scenario 3 for wheat has better results than the other scenarios 4 conclusion using datasets data is a good tool for studying the temporal spatial changes of meteorological variables the gldas surface model is an important source of information for global water cycle research in this study the pearson regression coefficient was used to investigate the correlation between climatic variables and wheat and maize yield the results showed that the relationship between yield and precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration etp was positive for maize and negative for wheat while the relationship between minimum temperature tmin and maximum temperature tmax was negative for maize and positive for wheat gldas agmerra gldas cru gldas agcfsr networked meteorological datasets were evaluated in estimating the yield and actual evapotranspiration eta of wheat and maize crops and comparing with qazvin synoptic station data the results showed that in general these data have good accuracy in estimating yield the results showed that these data do not have good accuracy in estimating eta the calculated statistical parameters showed that in estimating the yield of the simulated wheat plant using scenario 2 and 4 for maize scenarios 1 and 3 were better correlated with other scenarios in terms of eta scenario 3 for maize and scenario 6 for wheat were better correlated for a more accurate evaluation it is recommended that more stations be considered in different climates to achieve better results also can evaluate more products due to the fact that the gldas model data is updated and modified every month so it is recommended to conduct the present study once every six months before using the gldas surface model data declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9921,timely and accurate detection of crop water stress is vital for precision irrigation whether the accuracy of the prevailing diagnosis of crop water stress using vegetation indices vis and spectral reflectance can be improved still remains to be investigated the crop surface characteristics such as grayscale or color vary under different water stress so in this study one more variable image texture was utilized together to diagnose water stress for this end the canopy image of winter wheat in bloom was obtained by unmanned aerial vehicle uav equipped with multispectral sensor and the effect of soil background was eliminated using vegetation index threshold method on this basis grey level co occurrence matrix glcm was used to calculate the mean mea variance var homogeneity hom contrast con dissimilarity dis entropy ent second moment sec and correlation cor of the image texture under different spatial resolutions 0 008 m 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 05 m 0 1 m and 0 2 m next the canopy vegetation indices were obtained by mathematical transformation of canopy reflectance and then sensitive image texture and vegetation indices by full subset regression method finally cubist bpnn back propagation neural network and elm extreme learning machine methods were adopted to build the estimation models of the stomatal conductance gs of winter wheat between the sensitive image texture and gs and between vegetation index and gs and the water stress map was plotted based on the optimal gs estimation model the result showed i the image texture obtained from the high resolution multispectral image had a high correlation with gs and the image texture var hom con dis ent and sec at 550 nm had the most significant correlation ii the higher the ground resolution the higher the correlation between the gs and the image texture the vegetation indices respectively the image texture with a ground resolution of 0 008 m combined with vis and gs had the highest correlation and combining image texture and vegetation index can significantly improve the estimation accuracy of winter wheat gs iii among the three estimation models the bpnn model constructed by combining the image texture and vis mea var ent dwsi and exg had the best estimation performance calibration r c 2 0 899 rmse c 0 01 mae c 0 006 validation r c 2 0 834 rmse v 0 018 mae v 0 014 and an accurate estimation could even be achieved at a lower gs value compared with the bpnn model solely based on vis or image texture the r c 2 of the bpnn model based on the combined variables increased by 24 and 22 48 respectively therefore combining uav multispectral image texture and vis to estimate gs provides a feasible and accurate method for water stress diagnosis of winter wheat keywords unmanned aerial vehicle vegetation indices image texture stomatal conductance water stress 1 introduction water stress on crops will seriously disrupt crop growth and decrease crop yield jiang et al 2020 cai et al 2020 therefore timely and accurate diagnosis of crop water stress is essential to solve this problem stomatal conductance gs is an important index to characterize crop water stress inversion of crop gs by uav remote sensing can avoid such problems as low efficiency high cost and difficult field operation ezenne et al 2019 this method has been proved to be effective in the detection of crop water stress in order to overcome the deficiency of the traditional measurement of crop parameters many scholars used uav borne multispectral remote sensing to detect crop information for example sun et al 2019 and yu et al 2014 used a multispectral system to accurately retrieve leaf chlorophyll and moisture content and found that chlorophyll fluorescence could effectively reflect the photosynthesis and water of crops under water stress ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 leinonen and jones 2004 and torres sánchez et al 2015 found that water index wi renormalized difference vegetation index rdvi and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi could be applied to water stress detection in sweet pepper berni et al 2009 and suárez et al 2008 found that vegetation indices such as pri and wi were more sensitive to changes in carotenoids and lutein under water stress and successfully used these two indices to detect crop water stress however vis have some limitations in diagnosing water stress in the reproductive stage of crops the main problem is that the complex canopy structure in the reproductive stage leads to poor inversion of crop properties cao et al 2019 torres sánchez et al 2015 at the same time the image obtained by the drone has a high resolution which cannot be ignored due to the effect of the background such as soil i e the problem of mixed pixels prudnikova et al 2019 haboudane et al 2002 found that tcari was highly sensitive to chlorophyll concentration but it was still prone to the background noise when the chlorophyll concentration was low if the background pixels are not eliminated the accuracy of spectral inversion will be decreased because the crop canopy spectrum which contains some information of crop and soil background is a variable with rapid response for plant growth and stress some scholars have carried out researches on how to eliminate non crop pixels in remote sensing images using various vis and algorithms nutter and schultz 1995 torres sánchez et al 2015 yu et al 2014 which have effectively improved the accuracy of water stress detection in addition most of the previous researches merely used the spectral information of remote sensing images and the removal of the background with image processing technology has improved the inversion accuracy in some degree but the inherent spatial information in the form of texture has not yet been discovered image texture is a method of quantifying the changes in pixel values between adjacent pixels so as to effectively reflect the physical properties of the object s surface yang et al 2017 different surface features of different objects have different grayscales or colors and the surfaces of the objects will also produce different texture images therefore as an extremely important attribute of images texture occupies a pivotal position in computer vision and image processing but so far most studies have only used texture for image classification or plant biomass estimation haralick et al 1973 meyer et al 1998 yue et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 and the use of image texture to detect crop water stress has still rarely been reported high resolution image texture and vis were seldom used to detect the water stress of winter wheat therefore this study took the gs of winter wheat as an indicator of water stress and used image texture vis and their combinations to estimate the gs and assess crop water stress in particular gs estimation models of cubist padarian et al 2014 bpnn zeng et al 2015 zhang and subbarayan 2002 and elm liang huang et al 2006 were built based on sensitive vegetation indices image texture as well as their combination based on the optimal gs estimation model the water stress inversion map of winter wheat was drawn so as to evaluate whether the combination of image texture and vis could effectively improve the inversion accuracy of water stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the experimental field is located at the institute of water saving agriculture in arid areas of china 34 17 42 n 108 4 2 e fig 1 northwest a f university yangling shaanxi china the study area is a typical dryland agricultural region in northwest china with a subhumid drought prone climate the average annual rainfall in this area is 635 mm and the rainfall is mainly concentrated from july through september the soil 0 60 cm is medium loam with an average field capacity fc of 26 and a wilting coefficient of 8 6 the dry bulk density ph value organic matter content and total nitrogen content of the soil are 1 44 g cm3 8 1 13 3 g kg and 0 82 g kg respectively the mean annual meteorological data for the trial site and the soil properties within the 0 60 cm of soil are described in table 1 the layout of the experimental plots was completely random and the planting time was october 15 2018 as is shown in 1c four irrigation levels were set and the irrigation limits were set as t1 field capacity of 35 50 t2 field capacity of 50 65 t3 field capacity of 60 80 and t4 the control group field capacity of 80 95 each irrigation level had three repeats and altogether there were 12 plots the four different treatments were severe water stress t1 moderate water stress t2 mild water stress t3 and full irrigation t4 nitrogen fertilizer and phosphate fertilizer 240 kg ha respectively were applied as base fertilizer before sowing the winter wheat was a variety named xiaoyan 22 popularized in central shaanxi province the plots 4 m 4 m had a row spacing of 0 25 m and a density of 1 million plants ha fig 1c winter wheat were irrigated using a drip system with one line per row and the drippers which had a flow rate of 1 2 l h were spaced at intervals of 0 1 m 2 2 data collection and processing 2 2 1 multispectral data acquisition and processing the uav multispectral data were collected at 13 o clock on april 24 25 26 and 30 2019 when winter wheat was in bloom during the experiment the uav m600 made by dajiang innovation technology with multispectral sensors multispectral camera micro mca produced by tetracam company fig 2 minařík et al 2019 was used to obtain multispectral images of winter wheat canopy the camera had 6 channels for spectrum acquisition and its central wavelengths were 490 550 680 720 800 900 nm and its wave width was 20 nm the multispectral camera lens was vertically downward and the uav flew at the height of 15 m the corresponding ground resolution of the multispectral image was 0 008 m and the radiometric correction of the image was carried out using a white reference plate with a reflectance of 100 placed in the experimental field the collected spectral images had been preprocessed by the software pixelwrench2 which was compatible with the multispectral camera micro mca according to the related characteristics of vegetation the mca camera was specially configured with the band range of six channels whose central wavelengths were 490 nm blue 550 nm green 680 nm red 720 nm red edge 800 nm near infrared and 900 nm near infrared respectively basically covering the spectrum range from visible to near infrared the detailed parameters of the micro mca multispectral sensor was shown in the fig 2 the method of vegetation index threshold zhang et al 2020 was used for the threshold segmentation of the preprocessed multispectral image in the software envi5 3 and python 3 6 3 to eliminate the soil background and accurately obtain the average reflectance of the wheat canopy in this study the nearest neighbor was adopted to resample the original multispectral images with a ground resolution of 0 008 m to the multispectral images with ground resolutions of 0 01 0 02 0 1 and 0 2 m respectively 2 2 2 data acquisition and processing of water stress after the multispectral images of the wheat canopy were collected the photosynthetic fluorescence system li6400 xt was used to measure the gs mol h2o m 2 s 1 of wheat leaves at 13 o clock when the gs of winter wheat under different water treatments changed most significantly buckley et al 2019 jones 1999 kataoka et al 2003 the soil water content swc of 0 10 cm 0 20 cm 0 30 cm 0 40 cm and 0 60 cm depth was collected by drying method in the experiment the five point sampling method three wheats at each point was used to measure the gs of the flag leaves of the winter wheat marked in each plot then the average gs of the winter wheat in the same plot was taken as the measured gs value of the plot and finally the gs of the sample in each corresponding plot was obtained 2 3 calculation of image textures and vegetation indices according to the grey level co occurrence matrix glcm zheng et al 2019 eight kinds of image texture were selected to evaluate their correlation with the gs the row spacing of the winter wheat is usually 0 2 0 3 m while the ground resolution of uav borne multispectral images is ultrahigh so most of the window sizes involve soil background and wheat plants therefore in this study the image texture was generated from multispectral images with different resolutions 0 008 m 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 05 m 0 1 m and 0 2 m and the texture analysis was performed with the smallest window size 3 3 pixels the 8 kinds of texture are mean mea variance var homogeneity hom contrast con dissimilarity dis entropy ent second moment sec and correlation cor detailed description is available for reference yue et al 2019 and the calculation formulae are as follows 1 m e a i j i p i j 2 v a r i j i u 2 p i j 3 h o m i j

where p i j is the value of the i j th entry in the gray level co occurrence matrix n g is the number of distinct gray levels in the quantized image μx and σx are the mean and standard deviation of x rows in matrix calculation μy and σy are the mean and standard deviation of y rows in the matrix calculation based on the 6 bands 490 550 680 720 800 and 900 nm of the multispectral images the vis related to crop water stress were selected in the relevant literature schumacher et al 2016 sims and gamon 2002 to diagnose the water stress of winter wheat table 2 2 4 selection of image texture and vis the full subset selection brown et al 2002 is a method based on all possible combinations of different independent variables used to conduct fitting and modeling analysis on the selected variable combinations through the least square method the selected vis image texture and combination of image texture and vis were respectively subjected to full subset selection to obtain the most sensitive variables the results of variable screening are shown in table 3 in the selection of the optimal variable the following two aspects have been taken into consideration i maximum likelihood function ii minimization of unknown parameters in least squares regression model in this study the input variables of the cubist bpnn and elm models are all combinations of variables that use the results of the full subset selection table 3 and the input variables of these models in the same section are the same in so doing we aimed to find the best balance between model fitting accuracy and model complexity similar to akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic burnham and anderson 2016 is often used as an evaluation criterion in model selection however the bic can more effectively avoid the problem of over complex models caused by high model accuracy than the aic when the dimensionality is too large and the number of samples is relatively small the bic can also effectively avoid too many selected variables therefore the principle of the smallest bic value was observed in the selection of variables and the leaps package of the software r3 5 1 was used to conduct the full subset selection analysis the calculation formula of bic is 9 bic kln n 2ln l where k is the number of model parameters n is the number of samples and l is the likelihood function 2 5 statistical analysis of gs and water stress diagnosis table 4 shows the sample size of the modeling set and validation set used to build the machine learning model and describes the statistical characteristics of the gs of the samples the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were used to evaluate the gs estimation models statistically models with higher r 2 and smaller rmse and mae are more accurate fig 3 shows the distribution characteristics of gs under different water treatments it can be seen that the gs value under t1 treatment mainly concentrated in the range of 0 2 0 23 showing severe stress the gs values under t2 treatment mainly ranged from 0 23 to 0 26 showing moderate stress the gs value under t3 treatment mainly ranged from 0 26 to 0 29 showing mild stress the gs value under t4 treatment was close to that of t3 mainly in the range of 0 28 0 31 and there was almost no water stress in this study cubist bpnn and elm were used to evaluate the correlation between gs and high resolution image texture between gs and vis between gs and their combination the gs estimation model was used to diagnose the water stress of winter wheat fig 4 describes the experimental method for the diagnosis of water stress in this study including data methods results and evaluation 3 results 3 1 vis based estimation model of the gs of winter wheat fig 5 a shows the pearson correlation coefficient between waveband reflectance and gs between vis and gs a positive correlation exists between vis and gs while most winter wheat canopy reflectance has a weak negative correlation with gs fig 5 b and c reflect the correlations between the reflectance of 550 nm and gs as well as between pri and gs respectively most of the band reflectance and gs are weakly negatively correlated while vis and gs are both significantly positively correlated p 0 05 this shows that as gs increases pri increases while the reflectance of the 550 nm decreases due to the correlation between most vegetation index variables and gs full subset selection was used to screen all vis and band reflectance then with the selected optimal index combination as the independent variables b800 b900 dwsi ngrdi and mrndvi and gs as the dependent variable a gs estimation model was constructed based on cubist bpnn and elm as is shown in fig 6 based on the cubist bpnn and eml methods the estimated gs values of the modeling set and the verification set were obtained at the same time the estimation accuracy of the model r 2 rmse mae was verified by comparing the correlation between the model estimation and the measured gs the results showed the bpnn model had the lowest estimation accuracy r c 2 0 725 r v 2 0 834 while the cubist model had the highest estimation accuracy and the determination coefficients of modeling and verification r c 2 0 815 r v 2 0 795 were relatively close indicating that the cubist model had the highest stability and the eml model was the second in stability r c 2 0 807 r v 2 0 753 however in the models based on cubist bpnn and elm if the estimated gs values were low the measured gs values were also low indicating that the accuracy of the estimation models was low when the measured gs values were low 3 2 response of multispectral image texture to the gs fig 7 a shows the pearson correlation coefficient between multispectral image texture 0 008 m gr and gs the different colors and lengths in the histogram represent different kinds of image texture mea var hom con dis ent sem and cor of different bands the results showed that the image texture of the 6 bands had some correlation with gs the texture of most bands had a weak correlation with gs but the image texture of 550 nm had a high correlation with gs r 0 6 as is shown in fig 7 b the correlation between the image textures of 550 nm and gs at different resolutions differed greatly generally as the resolution decreased and the correlation decreased fig 7 a and b showed a positive correlation between the gs and the image texture var con dis and ent of 550 nm in the 6 bands at different resolutions through the correlation analysis between the image texture of different bands and gs it can be seen that the image texture at 550 nm has the most significant correlation with gs while the image textures of other bands have lower correlation with gs the use of other unobvious image texture will increase r 2 slightly but this will also lead to a decrease in the predictive power of the model however the effect of image resolutions on the correlation between other image texture and gs was still unclear therefore when only image texture is used to estimate the gs of winter wheat it is necessary to consider the image texture of the bands and the corresponding ground resolutions 3 3 gs estimation model based on image texture in the study the full subset selection was adopted to screen the image texture of 550 nm gr 0 008 m cubist bpnn and elm models were established with the optimal texture combination as independent variable mea dis sec and cor and gs as dependent variable it can be seen from fig 7 that the screened image texture mea dis sec cor has a positive correlation with the gs then based solely on the image texture the cubist bpnn and elm models were constructed to estimate the gs value of the winter wheat and the measured and estimated gs values were compared fig 8 the results showed that the accuracy of the estimation models based on the three machine learning methods and image texture were satisfying comparatively the model based on cubist had the lowest accuracy the determination coefficient of the calibration 0 828 was much larger than that of the validation 0 519 indicating a serious over fitting between the estimated and measured gs the estimation model based on elm had the highest accuracy r c 2 0 788 r v 2 0 767 moreover the rmae c 0 014 and rmse v 0 018 of the modeling set and validation set models were both small and the mae c 0 010 and mae v 0 015 were both the minimum when the gs of winter wheat was actually low the gs estimated by the model was also low the elm model based only on image texture and gs had the highest accuracy however the accuracy of gs estimation models fig 6 based on pure image texture was lower than that based on pure vis fig 8 if the estimated gs values were small the measured gs values were also small indicating that the accuracy of the estimation models based on only image texture was low when the measured gs values were small image texture has a big difference between spectral reflectance and it mainly reflects the physical properties of the crop surface therefore the combination of image texture and vis to construct a water stress diagnosis model needed further research 3 4 gs estimation model based on combined image texture and vis full subset selection was used to screen all the vis and the image texture at 550 nm so as to generate the optimal combination of image texture and vis based on which gs estimation models were constructed as can be seen from figs 5 and 7 the selected optimal combination of variables mea var ent dwsi exg is positively correlated with the gs and fig 9 reflects the relationship between the measured and predicted gs values in the modeling and verification sets comparatively the bpnn model had the highest accuracy in gs estimation modeling set r c 2 0 899 rmse c 0 01 mae c 0 006 validation set r c 2 0 834 rmse v 0 018 mae v 0 014 moreover when the gs estimation model was based on the combination of the filtered image texture and vis the estimated value corresponding to the small measured gs value was not small it can be seen from fig 9 that the r2 of all models are greater than 0 8 while the r2 of the models in figs 8 and 6 are generally less than 0 8 indicating that the accuracy of the models constructed using a single vis or image texture was lower and the combination of vis and image texture could effectively improve the accuracy of the estimation models therefore the machine learning models based on the combination of the image texture and the vis had higher accuracy than those based solely on the vis or image texture and the estimated gs value was more accurate fig 9 shows a map of the water stress of winter wheat obtained from the bpnn model based on the combination of image texture and vis mea var ent dwsi and exg for the estimation of the gs distribution in the three repeated plots treated by t1 severe stress the gs values mainly ranged from 0 20 to 0 23 mol h2o m 2 s 1 in the three t2 treated moderate stress replicas the gs values mainly ranged from 0 23 to 0 26 mol h2o m 2 s 1 in the three t3 treated mild stress replicative plots the gs values mainly ranged from 0 26 to 0 29 mol h2o m 2 s 1 however gs under t4 treatment no water stress was also partially in the range of 0 26 0 29 mol h2o m 2 s 1 but mainly in the range of more than 0 29 mol h2o m 2 s 1 we can see that the gs distribution fig 9 estimated by the bpnn model conforms to the irrigation level fig 3 and the estimated gs values corresponding to the highly irrigated plot are also high these results showed that bpnn model based on the combination of vis and image texture had great potential in diagnosing the water stress of winter wheat at the same time the gs value of 0 29 mol h2o m 2 s 1 could also be used as the water stress baseline at the flower stage of winter wheat and the winter wheat lower than this value was considered to have stress and irrigation while the winter wheat higher than this value was considered to have no stress fig 10 4 discussion the crop coverage is relatively high in the period of lush crop growth flowering stage and the canopy information obtained by the sensor is mainly crop information which contains less soil information and the accuracy of using canopy spectrum information to estimate swc is low because there is an indirect conversion process for inverting swc through crop canopy spectrum information to diagnose crop water stress carpintero et al 2020 gs is a physiological index widely used to detect crop water stress buckley 2019 ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 jiang et al 2020 and the use of canopy spectrum information to estimate gs can directly diagnose the water stress status of crops at present the gs is mainly applied in optical technology lu 2007 thenkabail et al 2010 but this method has some limitations the main reason is that it is easily affected by the soil background in the acquisition of crop canopy information and the vis are prone to light saturation when the crop coverage is thin féret et al 2017 rossini et al 2013 therefore this study used the high resolution image texture obtained by the uav equipped with a multispectral camera to estimate the gs which could be used to diagnose the water stress of winter wheat 4 1 effect of soil background on water stress diagnosis images with high ground resolution contain high frequency leaves canopy shadows and soil pixels as the ground resolution decreases the mixture of crop pixels and soil pixels leads to the complex change of canopy information in a single pixel magney et al 2016 prudnikova et al 2019 yue et al 2019 used visible light images of different resolutions to evaluate the effect of texture and estimate wheat biomass but they failed to remove the background from the high resolution images prudnikova et al 2019 found that the soil background had the most obvious effect on the spectral reflectance in the visible range of 350 500 nm and 620 690 nm and the elimination of the soil background could effectively improve the inversion accuracy therefore it is necessary to eliminate the soil background in the application of high resolution uav remote sensing data in this study the vegetation index threshold method was used to reduce the effect of soil background table 5 shows the comparison of the digital number dn values at 550 nm before and after removing the soil background t1 0 008 gr 15 3 114 7 t1 0 008 gr 16 3 100 3 this means that soil background removal can effectively reduce the dn value range of the winter wheat canopy and avoid the interference of soil pixels meanwhile the wheat coverage decreased as the irrigation level decreased and the dn value range of the image increased with the decrease of irrigation level t1 0 008 m gr 15 3 114 7 t4 0 008 m gr 9 7 79 0 it shows that the coverage also affects the fluctuation range of the dn value and reduce the effect of soil background on canopy image subsequent research can choose crop growth stage crop canopy size and farming methods to minimize the effect of soil background 4 2 the effect of ground resolution on the texture of multispectral images the texture is related to the spatial distribution of dark areas winter wheat and shadow and bright areas soil in the image prudnikova et al 2019 such distribution has a great effect on the diagnosis of water stress in winter wheat for multispectral images with different ground resolutions different crop canopy information carried by their pixels may result in huge differences in the pixel distributions in the dark and bright areas the standard deviation of the dn value at 550 nm can be minimized by increasing the ground resolution of the image table 5 because the leaves small dn values canopy shadow small dn values and soil background large dn values can be effectively distinguished in the multispectral images with high ground resolution but as the image resolution decreases the high frequency information of the ground feature gradually mixes together making it difficult to distinguish crop pixels and non crop pixels nichol and sarker 2011 and yue et al 2019 also used image texture with different resolutions to construct the inversion model but this method often reduced the inversion accuracy because many non crop pixels contained in the image texture with low resolution led to low inversion accuracy comparison of the correlations between different kinds of image texture at 550 nm with different resolutions fig 11 showed that the pearson correlation coefficient between the image texture decreased as the image resolution decreased the image texture with ground resolutions of 0 008 m 0 01 m and 0 02 m were all positively correlated while the image texture with ground resolutions of 0 05 m 0 1 m and 0 2 m were negatively correlated the higher the resolution the more significant the correlation therefore this study adopted the image texture with the highest resolution 0 008 m to diagnose the water stress as the resolution decreased the mixture of soil and crop pixels became more serious which resulted in a decrease in the correlation between the image texture and the gs on the contrary high frequency information contained in the high resolution images represented winter wheat so the image texture had a high correlation with the gs however diagnosing the water stress of winter wheat using uav remote sensing was affected by not only image resolution but also crop canopy size and row spacing therefore study of water stress diagnosis in the future should take different row spacing growth periods and crop types into consideration 4 3 response of image texture to water stress application of image texture to water stress diagnosis provides a potential technology for precision agriculture at present the utilization of image texture mainly focuses on vegetation classification or biomass estimation nichol and sarker 2011 because the canopy of winter wheat is composed of complex leaves ears soil shadows and stems its high resolution digital images have abundant high frequency texture information which enhances the detection of complex vegetation structure some studies even showed that the image texture obtained from high resolution remote sensing data was more accurate than vis in estimating crop parameters dube and mutanga 2015 schumacher et al 2016 the high frequency information in the high resolution texture images reflects the luxuriance of crops the higher the level of irrigation the more luxuriant the crop however the lower the ground resolution the more serious the mixture of the wheat and soil pixels hence the decrease of the correlation between the image texture and the gs fig 7 in other words the high frequency information increased with the increase of the irrigation level of winter wheat which could effectively reflect the crop water stress although image texture and vis are acquired in different ways their complementary information content can help improve gs estimation and water stress diagnosis the results of this study demonstrated that the combination of vis and image texture especially uav multispectral images with high ground resolution 0 008 m could overcome the underestimation of gs and was quite effective in the diagnosis of crop water stress fig 9 in addition the machine learning methods adopted in this study were effective in estimating the gs of winter wheat and were likely to be equally effective for other crops this study also has some limitations firstly the glcm adopted in this study has turned out to be quite effective but whether there are other more effective algorithms still remains to be investigated secondly the method of full subset selection used in this study had a satisfying accuracy it is quite probable that there are other more effective methods there was no in depth study on quantitative irrigation in this study but from the correlation analysis between gs and swc fig 12 it can be seen that gs was significantly correlated with swc which could effectively support water management gago et al 2015 in the follow up research the gs can be used to indicate the soil water status and precise irrigation can be achieved under different water stress conditions and other algorithms and selection methods can also be tried in water stress diagnosis 5 conclusion in order to estimate water stress more effectively this study adopted three variables the gs multispectral image texture and vis to diagnose the water stress of winter wheat the method of full subset selection was used to screen the vis 8 kinds of image texture and their optimal combination then three machine learning methods cubist bpnn and elm were used to construct the gs estimation models finally based on the optimal gs estimation model a map of water stress was obtained the study has reached the following conclusions 1 uav multispectral image texture had great potential in estimating the gs of winter wheat significant correlation existed between the gs and the 8 kinds of selected image texture with high ground resolution among which the image texture var hom con dis ent sec at 550 nm had the highest significant correlation p 0 05 2 the resolution and soil background had great effect on the estimation accuracy of the gs of winter wheat the soil background led to the underestimation of the gs value of the winter wheat with low level of irrigation as the image resolution decreased the mixed pixels of soil and wheat increased which also caused the decrease of the gs estimation accuracy therefore in order to improve the estimation accuracy the more effective method is to combine the vis and the image texture with a ground resolution of 0 008 m fig 9 rather than the mere use of vis fig 6 or image texture fig 8 3 among the three machine learning models based on the combination of image texture and vis the bpnn model mea var ent dwsi exg had the highest estimation accuracy and could estimate accurately even with a smaller gs value compared with the bpnn model solely based on vis or image texture the r c 2 of the bpnn model based on the combined variables increased by 24 and 22 48 respectively therefore the combination of uav multispectral image texture and vis to estimate gs provides a feasible and accurate method

9921,timely and accurate detection of crop water stress is vital for precision irrigation whether the accuracy of the prevailing diagnosis of crop water stress using vegetation indices vis and spectral reflectance can be improved still remains to be investigated the crop surface characteristics such as grayscale or color vary under different water stress so in this study one more variable image texture was utilized together to diagnose water stress for this end the canopy image of winter wheat in bloom was obtained by unmanned aerial vehicle uav equipped with multispectral sensor and the effect of soil background was eliminated using vegetation index threshold method on this basis grey level co occurrence matrix glcm was used to calculate the mean mea variance var homogeneity hom contrast con dissimilarity dis entropy ent second moment sec and correlation cor of the image texture under different spatial resolutions 0 008 m 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 05 m 0 1 m and 0 2 m next the canopy vegetation indices were obtained by mathematical transformation of canopy reflectance and then sensitive image texture and vegetation indices by full subset regression method finally cubist bpnn back propagation neural network and elm extreme learning machine methods were adopted to build the estimation models of the stomatal conductance gs of winter wheat between the sensitive image texture and gs and between vegetation index and gs and the water stress map was plotted based on the optimal gs estimation model the result showed i the image texture obtained from the high resolution multispectral image had a high correlation with gs and the image texture var hom con dis ent and sec at 550 nm had the most significant correlation ii the higher the ground resolution the higher the correlation between the gs and the image texture the vegetation indices respectively the image texture with a ground resolution of 0 008 m combined with vis and gs had the highest correlation and combining image texture and vegetation index can significantly improve the estimation accuracy of winter wheat gs iii among the three estimation models the bpnn model constructed by combining the image texture and vis mea var ent dwsi and exg had the best estimation performance calibration r c 2 0 899 rmse c 0 01 mae c 0 006 validation r c 2 0 834 rmse v 0 018 mae v 0 014 and an accurate estimation could even be achieved at a lower gs value compared with the bpnn model solely based on vis or image texture the r c 2 of the bpnn model based on the combined variables increased by 24 and 22 48 respectively therefore combining uav multispectral image texture and vis to estimate gs provides a feasible and accurate method for water stress diagnosis of winter wheat keywords unmanned aerial vehicle vegetation indices image texture stomatal conductance water stress 1 introduction water stress on crops will seriously disrupt crop growth and decrease crop yield jiang et al 2020 cai et al 2020 therefore timely and accurate diagnosis of crop water stress is essential to solve this problem stomatal conductance gs is an important index to characterize crop water stress inversion of crop gs by uav remote sensing can avoid such problems as low efficiency high cost and difficult field operation ezenne et al 2019 this method has been proved to be effective in the detection of crop water stress in order to overcome the deficiency of the traditional measurement of crop parameters many scholars used uav borne multispectral remote sensing to detect crop information for example sun et al 2019 and yu et al 2014 used a multispectral system to accurately retrieve leaf chlorophyll and moisture content and found that chlorophyll fluorescence could effectively reflect the photosynthesis and water of crops under water stress ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 leinonen and jones 2004 and torres sánchez et al 2015 found that water index wi renormalized difference vegetation index rdvi and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi could be applied to water stress detection in sweet pepper berni et al 2009 and suárez et al 2008 found that vegetation indices such as pri and wi were more sensitive to changes in carotenoids and lutein under water stress and successfully used these two indices to detect crop water stress however vis have some limitations in diagnosing water stress in the reproductive stage of crops the main problem is that the complex canopy structure in the reproductive stage leads to poor inversion of crop properties cao et al 2019 torres sánchez et al 2015 at the same time the image obtained by the drone has a high resolution which cannot be ignored due to the effect of the background such as soil i e the problem of mixed pixels prudnikova et al 2019 haboudane et al 2002 found that tcari was highly sensitive to chlorophyll concentration but it was still prone to the background noise when the chlorophyll concentration was low if the background pixels are not eliminated the accuracy of spectral inversion will be decreased because the crop canopy spectrum which contains some information of crop and soil background is a variable with rapid response for plant growth and stress some scholars have carried out researches on how to eliminate non crop pixels in remote sensing images using various vis and algorithms nutter and schultz 1995 torres sánchez et al 2015 yu et al 2014 which have effectively improved the accuracy of water stress detection in addition most of the previous researches merely used the spectral information of remote sensing images and the removal of the background with image processing technology has improved the inversion accuracy in some degree but the inherent spatial information in the form of texture has not yet been discovered image texture is a method of quantifying the changes in pixel values between adjacent pixels so as to effectively reflect the physical properties of the object s surface yang et al 2017 different surface features of different objects have different grayscales or colors and the surfaces of the objects will also produce different texture images therefore as an extremely important attribute of images texture occupies a pivotal position in computer vision and image processing but so far most studies have only used texture for image classification or plant biomass estimation haralick et al 1973 meyer et al 1998 yue et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 and the use of image texture to detect crop water stress has still rarely been reported high resolution image texture and vis were seldom used to detect the water stress of winter wheat therefore this study took the gs of winter wheat as an indicator of water stress and used image texture vis and their combinations to estimate the gs and assess crop water stress in particular gs estimation models of cubist padarian et al 2014 bpnn zeng et al 2015 zhang and subbarayan 2002 and elm liang huang et al 2006 were built based on sensitive vegetation indices image texture as well as their combination based on the optimal gs estimation model the water stress inversion map of winter wheat was drawn so as to evaluate whether the combination of image texture and vis could effectively improve the inversion accuracy of water stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the experimental field is located at the institute of water saving agriculture in arid areas of china 34 17 42 n 108 4 2 e fig 1 northwest a f university yangling shaanxi china the study area is a typical dryland agricultural region in northwest china with a subhumid drought prone climate the average annual rainfall in this area is 635 mm and the rainfall is mainly concentrated from july through september the soil 0 60 cm is medium loam with an average field capacity fc of 26 and a wilting coefficient of 8 6 the dry bulk density ph value organic matter content and total nitrogen content of the soil are 1 44 g cm3 8 1 13 3 g kg and 0 82 g kg respectively the mean annual meteorological data for the trial site and the soil properties within the 0 60 cm of soil are described in table 1 the layout of the experimental plots was completely random and the planting time was october 15 2018 as is shown in 1c four irrigation levels were set and the irrigation limits were set as t1 field capacity of 35 50 t2 field capacity of 50 65 t3 field capacity of 60 80 and t4 the control group field capacity of 80 95 each irrigation level had three repeats and altogether there were 12 plots the four different treatments were severe water stress t1 moderate water stress t2 mild water stress t3 and full irrigation t4 nitrogen fertilizer and phosphate fertilizer 240 kg ha respectively were applied as base fertilizer before sowing the winter wheat was a variety named xiaoyan 22 popularized in central shaanxi province the plots 4 m 4 m had a row spacing of 0 25 m and a density of 1 million plants ha fig 1c winter wheat were irrigated using a drip system with one line per row and the drippers which had a flow rate of 1 2 l h were spaced at intervals of 0 1 m 2 2 data collection and processing 2 2 1 multispectral data acquisition and processing the uav multispectral data were collected at 13 o clock on april 24 25 26 and 30 2019 when winter wheat was in bloom during the experiment the uav m600 made by dajiang innovation technology with multispectral sensors multispectral camera micro mca produced by tetracam company fig 2 minařík et al 2019 was used to obtain multispectral images of winter wheat canopy the camera had 6 channels for spectrum acquisition and its central wavelengths were 490 550 680 720 800 900 nm and its wave width was 20 nm the multispectral camera lens was vertically downward and the uav flew at the height of 15 m the corresponding ground resolution of the multispectral image was 0 008 m and the radiometric correction of the image was carried out using a white reference plate with a reflectance of 100 placed in the experimental field the collected spectral images had been preprocessed by the software pixelwrench2 which was compatible with the multispectral camera micro mca according to the related characteristics of vegetation the mca camera was specially configured with the band range of six channels whose central wavelengths were 490 nm blue 550 nm green 680 nm red 720 nm red edge 800 nm near infrared and 900 nm near infrared respectively basically covering the spectrum range from visible to near infrared the detailed parameters of the micro mca multispectral sensor was shown in the fig 2 the method of vegetation index threshold zhang et al 2020 was used for the threshold segmentation of the preprocessed multispectral image in the software envi5 3 and python 3 6 3 to eliminate the soil background and accurately obtain the average reflectance of the wheat canopy in this study the nearest neighbor was adopted to resample the original multispectral images with a ground resolution of 0 008 m to the multispectral images with ground resolutions of 0 01 0 02 0 1 and 0 2 m respectively 2 2 2 data acquisition and processing of water stress after the multispectral images of the wheat canopy were collected the photosynthetic fluorescence system li6400 xt was used to measure the gs mol h2o m 2 s 1 of wheat leaves at 13 o clock when the gs of winter wheat under different water treatments changed most significantly buckley et al 2019 jones 1999 kataoka et al 2003 the soil water content swc of 0 10 cm 0 20 cm 0 30 cm 0 40 cm and 0 60 cm depth was collected by drying method in the experiment the five point sampling method three wheats at each point was used to measure the gs of the flag leaves of the winter wheat marked in each plot then the average gs of the winter wheat in the same plot was taken as the measured gs value of the plot and finally the gs of the sample in each corresponding plot was obtained 2 3 calculation of image textures and vegetation indices according to the grey level co occurrence matrix glcm zheng et al 2019 eight kinds of image texture were selected to evaluate their correlation with the gs the row spacing of the winter wheat is usually 0 2 0 3 m while the ground resolution of uav borne multispectral images is ultrahigh so most of the window sizes involve soil background and wheat plants therefore in this study the image texture was generated from multispectral images with different resolutions 0 008 m 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 05 m 0 1 m and 0 2 m and the texture analysis was performed with the smallest window size 3 3 pixels the 8 kinds of texture are mean mea variance var homogeneity hom contrast con dissimilarity dis entropy ent second moment sec and correlation cor detailed description is available for reference yue et al 2019 and the calculation formulae are as follows 1 m e a i j i p i j 2 v a r i j i u 2 p i j 3 h o m i j

where p i j is the value of the i j th entry in the gray level co occurrence matrix n g is the number of distinct gray levels in the quantized image μx and σx are the mean and standard deviation of x rows in matrix calculation μy and σy are the mean and standard deviation of y rows in the matrix calculation based on the 6 bands 490 550 680 720 800 and 900 nm of the multispectral images the vis related to crop water stress were selected in the relevant literature schumacher et al 2016 sims and gamon 2002 to diagnose the water stress of winter wheat table 2 2 4 selection of image texture and vis the full subset selection brown et al 2002 is a method based on all possible combinations of different independent variables used to conduct fitting and modeling analysis on the selected variable combinations through the least square method the selected vis image texture and combination of image texture and vis were respectively subjected to full subset selection to obtain the most sensitive variables the results of variable screening are shown in table 3 in the selection of the optimal variable the following two aspects have been taken into consideration i maximum likelihood function ii minimization of unknown parameters in least squares regression model in this study the input variables of the cubist bpnn and elm models are all combinations of variables that use the results of the full subset selection table 3 and the input variables of these models in the same section are the same in so doing we aimed to find the best balance between model fitting accuracy and model complexity similar to akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic burnham and anderson 2016 is often used as an evaluation criterion in model selection however the bic can more effectively avoid the problem of over complex models caused by high model accuracy than the aic when the dimensionality is too large and the number of samples is relatively small the bic can also effectively avoid too many selected variables therefore the principle of the smallest bic value was observed in the selection of variables and the leaps package of the software r3 5 1 was used to conduct the full subset selection analysis the calculation formula of bic is 9 bic kln n 2ln l where k is the number of model parameters n is the number of samples and l is the likelihood function 2 5 statistical analysis of gs and water stress diagnosis table 4 shows the sample size of the modeling set and validation set used to build the machine learning model and describes the statistical characteristics of the gs of the samples the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were used to evaluate the gs estimation models statistically models with higher r 2 and smaller rmse and mae are more accurate fig 3 shows the distribution characteristics of gs under different water treatments it can be seen that the gs value under t1 treatment mainly concentrated in the range of 0 2 0 23 showing severe stress the gs values under t2 treatment mainly ranged from 0 23 to 0 26 showing moderate stress the gs value under t3 treatment mainly ranged from 0 26 to 0 29 showing mild stress the gs value under t4 treatment was close to that of t3 mainly in the range of 0 28 0 31 and there was almost no water stress in this study cubist bpnn and elm were used to evaluate the correlation between gs and high resolution image texture between gs and vis between gs and their combination the gs estimation model was used to diagnose the water stress of winter wheat fig 4 describes the experimental method for the diagnosis of water stress in this study including data methods results and evaluation 3 results 3 1 vis based estimation model of the gs of winter wheat fig 5 a shows the pearson correlation coefficient between waveband reflectance and gs between vis and gs a positive correlation exists between vis and gs while most winter wheat canopy reflectance has a weak negative correlation with gs fig 5 b and c reflect the correlations between the reflectance of 550 nm and gs as well as between pri and gs respectively most of the band reflectance and gs are weakly negatively correlated while vis and gs are both significantly positively correlated p 0 05 this shows that as gs increases pri increases while the reflectance of the 550 nm decreases due to the correlation between most vegetation index variables and gs full subset selection was used to screen all vis and band reflectance then with the selected optimal index combination as the independent variables b800 b900 dwsi ngrdi and mrndvi and gs as the dependent variable a gs estimation model was constructed based on cubist bpnn and elm as is shown in fig 6 based on the cubist bpnn and eml methods the estimated gs values of the modeling set and the verification set were obtained at the same time the estimation accuracy of the model r 2 rmse mae was verified by comparing the correlation between the model estimation and the measured gs the results showed the bpnn model had the lowest estimation accuracy r c 2 0 725 r v 2 0 834 while the cubist model had the highest estimation accuracy and the determination coefficients of modeling and verification r c 2 0 815 r v 2 0 795 were relatively close indicating that the cubist model had the highest stability and the eml model was the second in stability r c 2 0 807 r v 2 0 753 however in the models based on cubist bpnn and elm if the estimated gs values were low the measured gs values were also low indicating that the accuracy of the estimation models was low when the measured gs values were low 3 2 response of multispectral image texture to the gs fig 7 a shows the pearson correlation coefficient between multispectral image texture 0 008 m gr and gs the different colors and lengths in the histogram represent different kinds of image texture mea var hom con dis ent sem and cor of different bands the results showed that the image texture of the 6 bands had some correlation with gs the texture of most bands had a weak correlation with gs but the image texture of 550 nm had a high correlation with gs r 0 6 as is shown in fig 7 b the correlation between the image textures of 550 nm and gs at different resolutions differed greatly generally as the resolution decreased and the correlation decreased fig 7 a and b showed a positive correlation between the gs and the image texture var con dis and ent of 550 nm in the 6 bands at different resolutions through the correlation analysis between the image texture of different bands and gs it can be seen that the image texture at 550 nm has the most significant correlation with gs while the image textures of other bands have lower correlation with gs the use of other unobvious image texture will increase r 2 slightly but this will also lead to a decrease in the predictive power of the model however the effect of image resolutions on the correlation between other image texture and gs was still unclear therefore when only image texture is used to estimate the gs of winter wheat it is necessary to consider the image texture of the bands and the corresponding ground resolutions 3 3 gs estimation model based on image texture in the study the full subset selection was adopted to screen the image texture of 550 nm gr 0 008 m cubist bpnn and elm models were established with the optimal texture combination as independent variable mea dis sec and cor and gs as dependent variable it can be seen from fig 7 that the screened image texture mea dis sec cor has a positive correlation with the gs then based solely on the image texture the cubist bpnn and elm models were constructed to estimate the gs value of the winter wheat and the measured and estimated gs values were compared fig 8 the results showed that the accuracy of the estimation models based on the three machine learning methods and image texture were satisfying comparatively the model based on cubist had the lowest accuracy the determination coefficient of the calibration 0 828 was much larger than that of the validation 0 519 indicating a serious over fitting between the estimated and measured gs the estimation model based on elm had the highest accuracy r c 2 0 788 r v 2 0 767 moreover the rmae c 0 014 and rmse v 0 018 of the modeling set and validation set models were both small and the mae c 0 010 and mae v 0 015 were both the minimum when the gs of winter wheat was actually low the gs estimated by the model was also low the elm model based only on image texture and gs had the highest accuracy however the accuracy of gs estimation models fig 6 based on pure image texture was lower than that based on pure vis fig 8 if the estimated gs values were small the measured gs values were also small indicating that the accuracy of the estimation models based on only image texture was low when the measured gs values were small image texture has a big difference between spectral reflectance and it mainly reflects the physical properties of the crop surface therefore the combination of image texture and vis to construct a water stress diagnosis model needed further research 3 4 gs estimation model based on combined image texture and vis full subset selection was used to screen all the vis and the image texture at 550 nm so as to generate the optimal combination of image texture and vis based on which gs estimation models were constructed as can be seen from figs 5 and 7 the selected optimal combination of variables mea var ent dwsi exg is positively correlated with the gs and fig 9 reflects the relationship between the measured and predicted gs values in the modeling and verification sets comparatively the bpnn model had the highest accuracy in gs estimation modeling set r c 2 0 899 rmse c 0 01 mae c 0 006 validation set r c 2 0 834 rmse v 0 018 mae v 0 014 moreover when the gs estimation model was based on the combination of the filtered image texture and vis the estimated value corresponding to the small measured gs value was not small it can be seen from fig 9 that the r2 of all models are greater than 0 8 while the r2 of the models in figs 8 and 6 are generally less than 0 8 indicating that the accuracy of the models constructed using a single vis or image texture was lower and the combination of vis and image texture could effectively improve the accuracy of the estimation models therefore the machine learning models based on the combination of the image texture and the vis had higher accuracy than those based solely on the vis or image texture and the estimated gs value was more accurate fig 9 shows a map of the water stress of winter wheat obtained from the bpnn model based on the combination of image texture and vis mea var ent dwsi and exg for the estimation of the gs distribution in the three repeated plots treated by t1 severe stress the gs values mainly ranged from 0 20 to 0 23 mol h2o m 2 s 1 in the three t2 treated moderate stress replicas the gs values mainly ranged from 0 23 to 0 26 mol h2o m 2 s 1 in the three t3 treated mild stress replicative plots the gs values mainly ranged from 0 26 to 0 29 mol h2o m 2 s 1 however gs under t4 treatment no water stress was also partially in the range of 0 26 0 29 mol h2o m 2 s 1 but mainly in the range of more than 0 29 mol h2o m 2 s 1 we can see that the gs distribution fig 9 estimated by the bpnn model conforms to the irrigation level fig 3 and the estimated gs values corresponding to the highly irrigated plot are also high these results showed that bpnn model based on the combination of vis and image texture had great potential in diagnosing the water stress of winter wheat at the same time the gs value of 0 29 mol h2o m 2 s 1 could also be used as the water stress baseline at the flower stage of winter wheat and the winter wheat lower than this value was considered to have stress and irrigation while the winter wheat higher than this value was considered to have no stress fig 10 4 discussion the crop coverage is relatively high in the period of lush crop growth flowering stage and the canopy information obtained by the sensor is mainly crop information which contains less soil information and the accuracy of using canopy spectrum information to estimate swc is low because there is an indirect conversion process for inverting swc through crop canopy spectrum information to diagnose crop water stress carpintero et al 2020 gs is a physiological index widely used to detect crop water stress buckley 2019 ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 jiang et al 2020 and the use of canopy spectrum information to estimate gs can directly diagnose the water stress status of crops at present the gs is mainly applied in optical technology lu 2007 thenkabail et al 2010 but this method has some limitations the main reason is that it is easily affected by the soil background in the acquisition of crop canopy information and the vis are prone to light saturation when the crop coverage is thin féret et al 2017 rossini et al 2013 therefore this study used the high resolution image texture obtained by the uav equipped with a multispectral camera to estimate the gs which could be used to diagnose the water stress of winter wheat 4 1 effect of soil background on water stress diagnosis images with high ground resolution contain high frequency leaves canopy shadows and soil pixels as the ground resolution decreases the mixture of crop pixels and soil pixels leads to the complex change of canopy information in a single pixel magney et al 2016 prudnikova et al 2019 yue et al 2019 used visible light images of different resolutions to evaluate the effect of texture and estimate wheat biomass but they failed to remove the background from the high resolution images prudnikova et al 2019 found that the soil background had the most obvious effect on the spectral reflectance in the visible range of 350 500 nm and 620 690 nm and the elimination of the soil background could effectively improve the inversion accuracy therefore it is necessary to eliminate the soil background in the application of high resolution uav remote sensing data in this study the vegetation index threshold method was used to reduce the effect of soil background table 5 shows the comparison of the digital number dn values at 550 nm before and after removing the soil background t1 0 008 gr 15 3 114 7 t1 0 008 gr 16 3 100 3 this means that soil background removal can effectively reduce the dn value range of the winter wheat canopy and avoid the interference of soil pixels meanwhile the wheat coverage decreased as the irrigation level decreased and the dn value range of the image increased with the decrease of irrigation level t1 0 008 m gr 15 3 114 7 t4 0 008 m gr 9 7 79 0 it shows that the coverage also affects the fluctuation range of the dn value and reduce the effect of soil background on canopy image subsequent research can choose crop growth stage crop canopy size and farming methods to minimize the effect of soil background 4 2 the effect of ground resolution on the texture of multispectral images the texture is related to the spatial distribution of dark areas winter wheat and shadow and bright areas soil in the image prudnikova et al 2019 such distribution has a great effect on the diagnosis of water stress in winter wheat for multispectral images with different ground resolutions different crop canopy information carried by their pixels may result in huge differences in the pixel distributions in the dark and bright areas the standard deviation of the dn value at 550 nm can be minimized by increasing the ground resolution of the image table 5 because the leaves small dn values canopy shadow small dn values and soil background large dn values can be effectively distinguished in the multispectral images with high ground resolution but as the image resolution decreases the high frequency information of the ground feature gradually mixes together making it difficult to distinguish crop pixels and non crop pixels nichol and sarker 2011 and yue et al 2019 also used image texture with different resolutions to construct the inversion model but this method often reduced the inversion accuracy because many non crop pixels contained in the image texture with low resolution led to low inversion accuracy comparison of the correlations between different kinds of image texture at 550 nm with different resolutions fig 11 showed that the pearson correlation coefficient between the image texture decreased as the image resolution decreased the image texture with ground resolutions of 0 008 m 0 01 m and 0 02 m were all positively correlated while the image texture with ground resolutions of 0 05 m 0 1 m and 0 2 m were negatively correlated the higher the resolution the more significant the correlation therefore this study adopted the image texture with the highest resolution 0 008 m to diagnose the water stress as the resolution decreased the mixture of soil and crop pixels became more serious which resulted in a decrease in the correlation between the image texture and the gs on the contrary high frequency information contained in the high resolution images represented winter wheat so the image texture had a high correlation with the gs however diagnosing the water stress of winter wheat using uav remote sensing was affected by not only image resolution but also crop canopy size and row spacing therefore study of water stress diagnosis in the future should take different row spacing growth periods and crop types into consideration 4 3 response of image texture to water stress application of image texture to water stress diagnosis provides a potential technology for precision agriculture at present the utilization of image texture mainly focuses on vegetation classification or biomass estimation nichol and sarker 2011 because the canopy of winter wheat is composed of complex leaves ears soil shadows and stems its high resolution digital images have abundant high frequency texture information which enhances the detection of complex vegetation structure some studies even showed that the image texture obtained from high resolution remote sensing data was more accurate than vis in estimating crop parameters dube and mutanga 2015 schumacher et al 2016 the high frequency information in the high resolution texture images reflects the luxuriance of crops the higher the level of irrigation the more luxuriant the crop however the lower the ground resolution the more serious the mixture of the wheat and soil pixels hence the decrease of the correlation between the image texture and the gs fig 7 in other words the high frequency information increased with the increase of the irrigation level of winter wheat which could effectively reflect the crop water stress although image texture and vis are acquired in different ways their complementary information content can help improve gs estimation and water stress diagnosis the results of this study demonstrated that the combination of vis and image texture especially uav multispectral images with high ground resolution 0 008 m could overcome the underestimation of gs and was quite effective in the diagnosis of crop water stress fig 9 in addition the machine learning methods adopted in this study were effective in estimating the gs of winter wheat and were likely to be equally effective for other crops this study also has some limitations firstly the glcm adopted in this study has turned out to be quite effective but whether there are other more effective algorithms still remains to be investigated secondly the method of full subset selection used in this study had a satisfying accuracy it is quite probable that there are other more effective methods there was no in depth study on quantitative irrigation in this study but from the correlation analysis between gs and swc fig 12 it can be seen that gs was significantly correlated with swc which could effectively support water management gago et al 2015 in the follow up research the gs can be used to indicate the soil water status and precise irrigation can be achieved under different water stress conditions and other algorithms and selection methods can also be tried in water stress diagnosis 5 conclusion in order to estimate water stress more effectively this study adopted three variables the gs multispectral image texture and vis to diagnose the water stress of winter wheat the method of full subset selection was used to screen the vis 8 kinds of image texture and their optimal combination then three machine learning methods cubist bpnn and elm were used to construct the gs estimation models finally based on the optimal gs estimation model a map of water stress was obtained the study has reached the following conclusions 1 uav multispectral image texture had great potential in estimating the gs of winter wheat significant correlation existed between the gs and the 8 kinds of selected image texture with high ground resolution among which the image texture var hom con dis ent sec at 550 nm had the highest significant correlation p 0 05 2 the resolution and soil background had great effect on the estimation accuracy of the gs of winter wheat the soil background led to the underestimation of the gs value of the winter wheat with low level of irrigation as the image resolution decreased the mixed pixels of soil and wheat increased which also caused the decrease of the gs estimation accuracy therefore in order to improve the estimation accuracy the more effective method is to combine the vis and the image texture with a ground resolution of 0 008 m fig 9 rather than the mere use of vis fig 6 or image texture fig 8 3 among the three machine learning models based on the combination of image texture and vis the bpnn model mea var ent dwsi exg had the highest estimation accuracy and could estimate accurately even with a smaller gs value compared with the bpnn model solely based on vis or image texture the r c 2 of the bpnn model based on the combined variables increased by 24 and 22 48 respectively therefore the combination of uav multispectral image texture and vis to estimate gs provides a feasible and accurate method

9922,because the pattern of climate and thus water demand varies rapidly an accurate assessment of available water aw must be determined in order to manage water resources sustainable this study investigated the components of basin aw using a comprehensive water balance framework based on the swat model it consists of a system of relationships describing different components of water balance to estimate diverse forms of aw the resulting modelling system is capable of displaying current status and past trends in the components of aw highlight links between blue and green water components assess aw at farm and basin scales and forecast spatial and temporal variations of aw components under different water policies and climate scenarios as well as evaluating potential water shortage to explore this methodology the system was applied to the tashk bakhtegan basin iran the results for the historical period showed wide changes in the blue water components which was very lower for the green water ones for instance it was between 63 and 56 for renewable bw and 11 and 24 for renewable gw with respect to their long term means similarly blue water was more sensitive than green water to future annual precipitation variations evaluation of the construction of the basin s major dam showed that it has drastic impact on the spatial blue aw components such that they are increased in the adjacent subbasin up to 97 and reduced to half the status quo in the downstream subbasins the basin has also experienced 30 increase in cropped areas resulting in 1500 million meter cubic mcm water shortage in the current condition considering the framework as a relatively easy to use tools with readily available data is strongly recommended for other regions graphical abstract flowchart of the model structure to retrieve components of available water ga1 keywords available water green blue available water integrated framework swat model tashk bakhtegan basin 1 introduction it is widely understood that the sustainability of freshwater supplies is affected by increases in water demand and ongoing changes in climatic conditions management decisions pertaining to sustainable water require an accurate understanding of these processes and recent data regarding available water aw padowski and jawitz 2012 koshida et al 2015 various definitions of aw have been offered in the literature generally it is the amount of fresh water that is available for human consumption aw encompasses the dynamic cycle of rainfall and hydrological responses as well as different management measures like agriculture practices and engineered infrastructure storage or diversion of water that eventually effect temporal and spatial variations in accessible water rijsberman 2006 tidwell et al 2012 raeisi et al 2019 component proxies have been also formulated to provide insight into specific aspects of aw tidwell et al 2012 the concept of blue and green water resources were first proposed by falkenmark and rockström 2004 hereof blue water is the sum of river discharge and deep aquifer recharge surface runoff and groundwater formed by precipitation and can also include temporary storage in lakes and reservoirs green water includes the water that is infiltrated in the unsaturated soil layer from precipitation rockstrom et al 2009 and then stored and constitute green water storage velpuri and gabrie 2017 green water flow is also the actual evapotranspiration eta releases to the atmosphere through a combination of evaporation from soil and water bodies and transpiration from vegetation zuo et al 2014 this can be originated from blue and green water resources however distinction between green and blue water consumption is not straightforward in irrigated area hoekstra 2019 since blue water converts to green water through evapotranspiration process falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 mao et al 2018 also not all green water storage can be available for plants transpiration studies have reported that blue and green water resources change in response to human activity where it alters water cycle dynamics and the proportion of blue and green water in a river basin faramarzi et al 2017 pokhrel et al 2012 porkka et al 2016 a green water soil moisture content shortage may cause an increase in blue water irrigation demand this increased demand of blue water resources can then increase evapotranspiration and decrease streamflow veettil and mishra 2018 using these concepts untapped blue green aw resources or mounting pressure on them can be detected and identified for new development or mitigation measures tidwell et al 2016 2018 research often focuses on hydrological cycles and renewable water as the difference between received precipitation and evaporation fao 2003 from this perspective the european environmental agency considers freshwater resources such as river flow snow and glaciers to be critical water storage eea 2009 this approach assesses the basin hydrological response to climate and land conditions jaramillo and destouni 2014 in fact researchers who follow a renewable water approach consider water resources that have not yet been exploited as being available regardless of the feasibility of use in the case of green water not all renewable aw can be provided for use unused evaporation and soil retention in excess of plant uptake ability are portions of aw that cannot be counted on as useful a major problem with the previous approach is that due to technical limitations and environmental restrictions not all resources can or should be considered as options to meet water demand in light of this it is perhaps more useful to examine aw in terms of exploitable or utilizable water resources fao report 23 on country water resources is an example in which use and exploitation has been substituted for water offer however a limitation of this method is its lack of widespread use at basin scale failure to consider non renewable groundwater fao 2003 furthermore the role of return flows in surface groundwater interactions and consequently on aw i e blue water yield are crucial ahmadzadeh et al 2015 raeisi et al 2019 stored blue aw also requires consideration in many basins today infrastructures such as dams flood control and hydropower production vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 and related change release scheduling are used to reduce the effect of drought padowski and jawitz 2012 wanders and wada 2015 by altering hydrological systems and increasing storage capacity aghakouchak et al 2016 however most of these studies have focused only on surface water resources because there are often no accurate estimates of groundwater recharge rates available xu and wu 2017 from a green water resources perspective both flows from cropland and permanent pastureland are considered however not all utilizable green aw can be used productively productive green water flow components transpiration also could be considered as manageable green aw the difference between manageable green water and green water availability represents the potential for improving green water productivity rockstrom et al 2009 the aforementioned components are not only affected by human activities it is of key importance to also understand the influence of climatic variability on aw which results in changes in available freshwater resource distribution in spatial and temporal dimensions gohar and cashman 2016 mishra et al 2020 integrated process based conceptual hydrological models that facilitate assessment of water availability are required in order to accurately consider the dependence of dynamic water resources on natural features and human factors the modelling capability can enable policymakers and administrators in making robust decisions under uncertain future conditions such models can be used to estimate the temporal spatial variation of blue and green water resources with clearer physical mechanism and assess the impacts of different scenarios a capability that cannot be achieved by relying on databases alone schuol et al 2008 zang et al 2012 it has been demonstrated that the soil and water assessment tool swat model arnold et al 1998 can simulate most processes related to hydrology climate and water and agricultural management arabi et al 2008 this model already has widespread applications and has been proven to be effective for studying hydrological impacts globally on a wide variety of scales gassman et al 2007 jayakrishnan et al 2005 krysanova and white 2015 the swat model has been used to quantify the available water green and blue resources at the continental scale for africa schuol et al 2008 and europe abbaspour et al 2015 and at basin scale in china zang et al 2012 and brazil rodrigues et al 2014 this study aims to evaluate green and blue available water components in an integrated framework with four main objectives 1 determine whether the swat hydrological model can be effectively adopted to simulate green and blue water dynamics components and their interlinkages 2 determine the implication of the green and blue water assessment and how it can provide useful information for planning and management e g through different quantitative indices at the field and basin scale 3 determine how the dynamics of the aw s components temporally and spatially can be tracked as the results of human and climate impacts and their distinctions as well and 4 capability to be applied for evaluation of different agricultural water management as well as projection of climate change scenarios 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data the tashk bakhtegan basin was selected for this study this basin is located on the central plateau of iran and encompasses 27 500 km2 at 29 n and 31 20ˈn longitude and 51 50ˈe and 54 40ˈe latitude fig 1 the average annual rainfall in the basin is 150 645 mm precipitation falls mainly in winter and the highest rainfall sums are recorded in the northwest the kor river is the major river in the basin originating from the zagros mountains and flowing into tashk and bakhtegan lakes at southern end of the basin the land cover in the basin is chiefly composed of pastoral land 62 and agricultural land 27 the total irrigated area is 423 000 ha crops and orchards cover 88 and 12 of this area respectively where wheat sunflower and almond have the highest cultivated areas the rainfed orchards are also very popular in the study area where almond grape and fig are the main products the dominant soil texture class of the agricultural lands is clay loam the construction of dorodzan mulla sadra and sivand dams with the normal volumes of 993 440 and 150 million cubic meter mcm respectively has facilitated withdrawal of stored surface water for agricultural use however about 80 of the withdrawal in the basin is actually from groundwater resources in order to meet irrigated farming demands ministry of energy 2018 such consumption has seriously reduced runoff evidenced by the drying up of many natural lakes in the basin despite water shortages agricultural land in this region continues to expand a comparison of the basin s land use shows a 30 increase in cultivated lands between 1987 and 2015 farrokhnia et al 2020 table 1 shows the provided data and respective sources for the case study it includes hydro climate agriculture management and hydro structure data as well as spatial remote sensing e g digital elevation model dem soil and land use information the locations of the selected meteorological and discharge stations are shown in fig 1 2 2 conceptual framework fig 2 provides a conceptual framework for available water with the details considered in this study aw includes both green and blue water resources renewable blue water is calculated as the sum of runoff and recharge to the aquifer blue water yield represents the amount of water from runoff the return flow from the aquifer and the subsurface flow minus possible losses blue water is stored in surface reservoirs natural or structural and underground aquifers because blue water flow is composed of outflow from streams it has no value in a closed basin like the study area if a water transfer plan is in place these resources will be added to or deducted from the blue water flow loss caused by evaporation from the blue water bodies is inevitable the available green water resources are similarly divided renewable green water resources is the total soil moisture content the utilizable green water can be calculated by adding complimentary deducting the evaporation and soil retention from agricultural and pastoral lands where there is irrigation these new resources also will be considered to be utilizable green water resources after subtracting the amount of evaporation utilizable green water resources can be divided into two parts green water storage moisture stored in the root zone and manageable green water outflow through transpiration 2 3 swat model the swat model is a process based hydrological model that can accommodate various hydrological components and spatial and temporal distribution of blue and green water content in the basin in the model the hydrological cycle is simulated based on the water balance equation neitsch et al 2011 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw t where sw t is the final soil water content mm sw 0 is the previous soil water content mm t is the step of time day r day q surf and e a are the amount of precipitation and irrigation surface runoff and evapotranspiration on day i mm respectively w seep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm and q gw is the return flow on day i mm it includes lateral flows and deep percolation neitsch et al 2011 arcswat 2012 was selected for the model framework based on a monthly time step it requires digital elevation land use and soil maps as well as meteorological information for hydrological modelling these spatial layers were used to delineate the basin and divide it into multiple sub basins each sub basin was further partitioned into combined land use soil and management units called hydrologic response units hrus the study area was divided into 17 sub basins and 403 hrus after the formation of the basin structure information about water management and use reservoir operation and agricultural practice e g crop pattern planting calendar irrigation source and scheduling across the landscape were introduced to the model four major crops were considered as proxies for rainfed agricultural land wheat grapes almonds figs and five major crops as proxies for irrigated land wheat rice beans sunflowers almonds the sources of these data and information are illustrated in table 1 simulation of the hydrological processes was based on the water balance at each hru after the simulations were performed at the hru level they were aggregated and summarized at the sub basin level a detailed explanation of swat computational equations can be found in neitsch et al 2011 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et has a major role in estimation of aw especially to estimate green water swat calculates et in the forms of potential et pet and actual et aet the model offers different options to estimate pet and here we chose to apply the hargreaves hg method considering data available for the study area the model calculates evaporation e based on pet by combining et from soil and plants individually during rainy days swat first evaporates interceptions by the plant canopy then it calculates the maximum amount of transpiration t and soil e or sublimation s if there is snow model results display the actual s and e from the soil surface the same process will be implemented for canopy and plant transpiration the sum of e from the canopy and soil as well as t from plant constitutes et it is clear that aet may vary depending upon the water availability in the soil profile water table depth and or canopy characteristics i e daily leaf area index lai lai directly affect crop yield more details in this regard are available in neitsch et al 2011 in some of the studies where there were limitations of aet measurements the model calibration was performed using crop yield records to indirectly evaluate the model capability for simulate of aet faramarzi et al 2017 zuo et al 2014 zang and mao 2019 2 3 1 available water computation using swat model the model consists of a system of relationships describing the basic principles of water balance in the aeration zone of the soil including the effect of vegetation cover and groundwater the hydrologic fluxes used to quantify water availability were runoff groundwater evapotranspiration sub surface flow and streamflow water storage includes soil moisture groundwater storage shallow and deep aquifers surface reservoirs and natural lakes the components of aw of the basin were extracted from different model outputs fig 3 summarizes the variables of each aw component according to the conceptual model information about the specific outputs of the model were used to quantify the simulated hydrological processes 2 3 1 1 blue water estimation to represent available blue water using different approaches different water resource components were selected considering swat modules and methodology the computational relationships used in each approach are discussed below from a water offer perspective aw is actually the renewable water resources of the basin these are designated as renewable because they occur every year in the natural cycle of precipitation before external factors resulting from human interference and harvesting affect them surface runoff and recharge to the aquifer at each hru were used to calculate the renewable blue water these variables were aggregated for each sub basin using the mean annual values renewable blue water can be calculated as 2 baw r q r q l q g where b aw r is the renewable blue water q r is the average annual amount of surface runoff q l is the lateral sub surface flow and q g is the groundwater recharge the water yield based approach involves losses blue water yield is considered to be accessible water because inevitable losses including evaporation and transmission losses have been included in the calculation the amount of runoff in the hrus reaching the streams of the sub basin q r forms the basis of local available water blue water yield can be calculated as 3 baw y q r q lat q gw t loss where baw y is natural water yield q lat is subsurface lateral flow q gw is groundwater participation in surface flow and t loss is transmission loss blue water yield can be obtained from the model outputs directly as water yield at the outlet point of each sub basin another approach was used to determine the water resources ready for new development surface outflow from each sub basin is often considered useless possibly released due to environmental considerations or downstream water rights however this blue water source could be considered aw if there are no plans for use or downstream rights in place the outflow consists of local water yield and upstream inflow to each sub basin this is routed along the stream until it arrives at the sub basin outlet the variable travel time method was used to simulate the channel routing process in this method in addition to input from upstream the effects of existing water withdrawals imports and storage infrastructures is included in model calculations ultimately only a fraction of the stream flow of each sub basin reaches its outlet and is calculated as net sub basin outflow and reported as water resources provided for new development blue water flow is calculated as 4 baw f v q where baw f is blue water flow and v q is the average volume of outflow from sub basin streams this value can be calculated from model output files using the outflow variable at each sub basin the net values are calculated as the difference between the inlet and outlet flows of the sub basins another perspective for determining stored water considers the amount of water stored in natural and structural reservoirs these resources can be called manageable or exploitable water as they are net resources which can exploited directly and are routinely used for different allocations these resources are provided by local water yield and inflow to each sub basin from upstream and net groundwater recharge water resources stored in the sub basin depends on the reservoir capacity and or operation blue water storage can be calculated as 5 b aw s v v v g where baw s is blue water storage v v and v g are the average volume of water stored at the surface and in underground reservoirs respectively the groundwater storage value is the difference between recharge and discharge i e net change at each time step the amount of available water calculated in this research eqs 2 to 5 at each simulation time step are presented as equivalent water heights relative to area for the basin in order to obtain a better understanding of the amount of water resources available 2 3 1 2 green water estimation available green water components were calculated in situ at the hru level as the sum of the soil moisture and evapotranspiration values simulated by the model the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 was used to estimate potential evapotranspiration once the total potential evapotranspiration had been determined swat first evaporated any rainfall intercepted by the plant canopy the remaining evaporative water demand was partitioned between the vegetation and soil in the hargreaves method for swat transpiration is calculated as a function of the plant leaf area index the actual amount of transpiration may decrease from a lack of aw in the soil when the water content of the soil is below field capacity fc the evaporative demand for soil decreases to the wilting point wp the fc and permanent wp are the amount of water held in the soil at a tension of 0 033 and 1 5 mpa respectively this is considered to be the available waster for plant extraction awc water in excess of fc is available for percolation or lateral flow as 6 awc fc wp the wp per soil layer is calculated as 7 wp ly 0 4 m c ρ b 100 8 soil 1 ρ b ρ s where soil is the porosity expressed as a fraction of the total soil volume m c is the clay content of the soil ρ b is the bulk density mg m 3 and ρ s is the particle density mg m 3 details about how these processes are simulated can be found in the swat user manual renewable green water resources were calculated from the sum of natural evapotranspiration and soil moisture storage these values were aggregated and reported at the sub basin basin level evapotranspiration was calculated as the accumulated flow through the plants to the air by time step one month however only the soil moisture content in the root zone layer of the soil was used as water use often occurs at this depth this value was calculated at the end of each time step as 9 gaw r et t sw t where g aw r is the renewable green water et t is the average annual amount of evapotranspiration and sw t is the soil water in root depth that portion of the green water resources was denoted as the utilizable green water resources these resources are the amount of evapotranspiration and root zone soil moisture in agricultural and pastoral lands that can lead to economically efficient vegetable consumption as 10 gaw u et u sw u where g aw u is the utilizable green water and et u and sw u are the average annual amount of utilizable evapotranspiration and soil water respectively that occur in agricultural and pastoral lands the utilizable green water resources consist of stored green water and manageable or output green water the soil moisture in the root zone in agricultural and pastoral lands are denoted as green water storage gaw s the actual transpiration from agricultural and pastoral lands t m is denoted as manageable green water gaw m as 11 gaw s sw u 12 gaw m t m 2 4 evaluation of water availability under climate change scenarios changing precipitation and temperature are the main consequences of climate change leading to the disruption of aw as well however the precise timing and extent of these impacts remain deeply uncertain the applied framework is capable of addressing this issue and supporting respected algorithms used to make decision under such conditions e g robust decision making lempert and groves 2010 the sensitivity of an aw components to climate change can be considered as the proportional change of simulated bw and gw availability in different respected scenarios compared to the no change state for precipitation and temperature it can be calculated as 13 aw aw p t aw 0 0 aw 0 0 100 where aw is the response of aw to precipitation and temperature change p and t are precipitation and temperature variations under climate change scenarios respectively aw p t is the aw under hypothetical climate change scenarios aw 0 0 is the aw under the no change scenario for precipitation and temperature here aw is any component of available blue or green water 2 5 modelling scenarios to estimate aw to estimate different components of aw the model must be run with different management scenarios with respect to the objective of study for this they are as follows 2 5 1 actual conditions ac this scenario simulates the current agriculture management in the basin including dam operations irrigation management planting harvesting fertilizer etc table 1 the area under cultivation and irrigation schedules were held constant to allow investigation of only the effects of climate on available water 2 5 2 no withdrawal nw the no withdrawal scenario assumes no human water management thus there is not any irrigation and effects of infrastructures dam structure and operation were excluded this approach runs without irrigation withdrawal to exclude the effect of water abstraction in this scenario water resource equilibrium over the study period was determined by groundwater calibration 2 5 3 automatic irrigation ai irrigation influences discharge into streams and transpiration from irrigated crops in this scenario all of the basin water management and dams operated such that all crop water requirements were fulfilled by auto irrigation and unlimited water resources this ai calculates maximum plant transpiration and soil evaporation as explained by neitsch et al 2011 therefore as soon as any water stress occurs irrigation will be automatically activated 2 6 evaluation indicators and indices due to the flexibility of the aforementioned framework many different indicators and indices can be used to evaluate the water status of the study area here we only use a few of them martin carrasco et al 2013 boulay et al 2018 water supply index this index evaluates the water system s capacity s to meet agricultural water demand d as follow 14 i s s d exploitable water renewable green water en vironmental demand maximun damand et s and d need to be estimated based on the nw and ai scenarios respectively demand supply index expecting the reliability of a water system to meet water demands at 100 of days is too conservative for agricultural sector the reliability of 85 is an acceptable threshold martin carrasco et al 2013 however any other ratio can be applied 15 i r s d 0 85 green water capacity index the index explores the ration of basin s potential productive green water resources i e manageable green water in appendix a to its maximum productive green water resources 16 gw c manageable gw ac manageab le gw ai the nominator and denominator of the equation are based on the ac and ai scenarios respectively water shortage indicator in order to investigate water shortage the relationship presented in the eq 14 is used in this regard the difference between available water and water demand is calculated 17 wsh aw d where wsh is water shortage aw is available water exploitable or renewable water and d is water demand respectively the method is very flexible and can be calculated at unit area subbasin and basin levels as well as daily monthly and yearly time scales to estimate aw and d the modelling framework needs to be run for nw and ai scenarios 2 7 model calibration and validation for calibration of swat we applied a multi variable and multi site calibration since conventional reliance on hydrometric data is insufficient other variables like crop yields are also included for this the swat cup tool developed by abbaspour 2012 was applied for parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration it includes different algorithms and among them the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 a semi automatic inverse modelling procedure was selected to analyse the swat s parameters in the smallest number of model runs the sensitivity analysis revealed that most of the 22 global parameters of hydrological simulations were sensitive to river discharge however parameters such as cn2 scs runoff curve number plaps annual precipitation gradient gw delay groundwater delay time were the most sensitive parameters because the model cannot simulate groundwater volume and water table fluctuations these were performed in a relative manner to ensure calibration of groundwater parameters and volume of groundwater storage the model is able to estimate the amount of recharge to the aquifer therefore groundwater storage has been expressed as net aquifer change the parameters were selected and calibrated such that the long term change in groundwater under natural conditions and without human intervention nw scenario would be approximately zero in the long run surface water and groundwater interaction were in equilibrium additionally the tashk bakhtegan lake s volume and crop yields are other information that are considered for this step fig 4 diagrams the steps in this process the first year of the study period was used as a warm up the 20 year period from 1986 to 2005 was considered for calibration and the remaining years 2006 2015 for validation of the model to compare the ability of swat to reproduce streamflow and observations the performance criteria of the mean and standard deviation of simulations coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency e p factor and r factor were used the calibration and validation results are presented in table 2 the table shows the values of r2 and ns are generally more than 0 5 which indicate an acceptable model performance for stream flow simulation in the calibration and validation periods as stated before to ensure calibration results model simulation of the crop yield and volume of basin lakes was examined using limited observational data the results of this comparison are shown in table 3 and fig 5 it was concluded that the performance of the model was satisfactory and the calibrated model was able to replicate the watershed hydrology of the tashk bakhtegan basin 3 results and discussion 3 1 aw assessment under management and climate scenarios 3 1 1 aw assessment during historical period this section explores the modelling framework s capabilities in analysing aw status in the tashk bakhtegan basin as stated before different approaches especially water accounting based indices can be applied we first evaluate the green and blue water components during the driest and wettest years of the record period this comparison demonstrates the sensitivity of these components to the basin s climate variability then the historical record was assessed within 5 years periods using a number of indices that rely on green and blue water components fig 6 shows the 3 years mean status of green and blue water components for the basin s wettest i e 1991 1992 and 2004 and driest 1987 2008 and 2010 periods they are then compared with their long term annual rainfall means it is clear that the green water was less susceptible to changes in annual precipitation also the reaction of blue water to high rainfall years was more severe while the reaction of green water to the low rainfall years was more severe among the blue and green aw components blue and green water storage were most affected by changes in precipitation changes fig 7 illustrates the evaluation of the basin water resources at each five year period using the demand supply water supply and green water capacity indices the time interval is matched with the iranian 5 year development plan the figure shows that demand supply index and water supply index have negative trends one of the main reasons for this situation can be attributed to the negative trend in the basin s precipitation imani et al 2019 have also reported positive trends in the basin s temperature it can be concluded that the five year development plans are not be effective in adapting to this situation as expected the green water capacity index is less sensitive to these changes 3 1 2 aw change under dam construction impact of the dorudzan dam on aw was assessed using the applied methodology and considering renewable water and exploitable water the results showed no significant impact from this infrastructure on aw at basin level but when the assessments were made at the sub basin scale the changes in exploitable water were significant fig 8 shows this issue and how it is changed due to construction of the dam as the main storage facility in the basin it is seen that the dam has increased aw in the respected subbasin up to 97 i e more capacity to store water but has substantially reduced aw in downstream subbasins where the task bakhtegan wetland is located 3 1 3 effect of land use changes on water shortage the impact of land use changes on aw components is important the swat model is also capable of handling such as an issue wang et al 2014 as stated before comparison of the 1987 and 2015 land use of the basin shows a roughly 30 increase in the agricultural lands the effect of such a change on the basin s water shortage is evaluated in this section for this aim the modelling framework was run using the two land uses under ai and ac scenarios to calculate wsh in eq 17 at the basin level and monthly time scale the results showed fig 10 that the 30 increase in agricultural land has caused significant changes in water shortages the basin was almost in equilibrium in 1987 while the results shows about 1500 mcm water shortage algebraic sum of the monthly water shortages in fig 9 as expected whs is more pronounced between april and september that is the cropping season it is noteworthy that the order of the months has changed in terms of water shortage that can be attributed to the change in basin s cropping pattern e g expansion of rice cultivation as mentioned before due to the evaluations at basin scale he results for exploitable and renewable aw are not much significant 3 1 4 effect of climate change scenarios green blue on available water components fig 10 shows the results of sensitivity assessment of aw components using a range of climatic scenarios using the basin s climate change study by massah et al 2020 based on the projections of aogcm ar5 models as well as the third national communication to unfccc department of environment 2017 it was assumed that changes in precipitation ranged from 30 20 and the temperature changes ranged from 0 5 to 2 c fig 10 fig 10 illustrates the changes in projected precipitation and temperature in relation to the components of the green and blue water compared to the ac scenario current situation this shows more sensitivity of the components to the change in precipitation similar results are also reported by verbista et al 2020 while evaluating the la paloma reservoir volume a part of blue water storage for different temperatures and precipitation values furthermore comparison of the blue and green water components i e fig 10 a c e and g vs b d f and h reveals more sensitivity in blue components when compared with green components for instance a 25 reduction of precipitation causes about 25 reduction in renewable blue water while it is only 10 in the renewable green water fig 10 a and b respectively considering the results and reliance of the basin on blue water resources it can be concluded that robust and flexible adaptation strategies are required to address increased climate risk within basin and surrounding regions as stated before the green water components are robust in the face of climate variations so the current policies on dryland farming especially fig as one of the basin s exportable products can be continued and more planning should be done for it air temperature is also an important factor affecting green water availability as expected an increase in temperature decreased the available blue and green water storage however evapotranspiration increased to a lesser extent under warmer conditions these results can be used to improve scientific understanding of the evolution of blue and green water resources as affected by climate change in the basins and is especially necessary for sustainable water use in arid and semi arid regions 4 conclusions this research focused on creating an integrated framework to evaluate blue green available water and related components the effort builds on an innovative approach of aw modelling using the swat model we fund the developed methodology and modelling framework very suitable for agricultural water management some of the features that could be presented in this article are 1 presentation of interlinkages of blue and green water components 2 systematic presentation of the current status and past trends in the components of aw as well as future situation under different climate and management scenarios 3 spatial variation of aw components under different water policies at basin and subbasin scales 4 assessment of water saving measures on aw components at farm and basin scales for achieving of realistic planning 5 temporal pattern of aw components at daily monthly and yearly time scales 6 possibility to show spatial and temporal status of water shortage 7 possibility to distinguish impacts of human and climate variability on aw and 8 flexibility to be applied with a variety of indices regarding planning and management it is showed that swat model could effectively simulate the green and blue water dynamics components and their interlinkages however it needs a kind of multi variable calibration in another word the conventional reliance on hydrometric data is not enough and other processes like actual evapotranspiration need to be included in the course of calibration the proposed modelling framework can provide relevant information on aw as well as the potential influence of anthropogenic and climate variables this methodology is very applicable where different polices measures like watershed management agriculture water saving and environment water supply need to be evaluated in an integrated framework and their effects and side effects should be considered finally it is an easy to use tools with readily available data in order to facilitate water availability assessment and is strongly recommended for other regions to show the capability of the methodology tashk bkhtegan basin is applied as the case study it is showed that 1 using the historical information of basin 1986 2015 the components of aw for a set of dry and wet years were computed and compared the results showed more sensitivity of the blue water components to climate variability than green ones for instance it was between 63 and 56 for renewable bw and 11 and 24 for renewable gw with respect to their long term means 2 evaluation of the construction of the durodzan dam showed that it has drastic impact on spatial blue aw components such that they are increased in the adjacent subbasin up to 97 and reduced to half the status quo in the downstream subbasins thus the modelling framework provides relevant information for the future operation of dam possible changes in the environment flows and even the expected social consequences e g upstream downstream conflicts 3 the basin has experienced 30 increase in its cropped areas between 1987 and 2015 as a result it has significantly increased the difference between available water and water demand in another words while the basin was almost in equilibrium in 1987 it is now faced with 1500 mcm water shortage in current condition and 4 application of the modelling framework for the projected changes of precipitation and temperature showed more sensitivity of the components to the change in precipitation also it was shown that the blue water components are more sensitive while the basin is more dependent to these resources therefore adaptation strategies are seriously required to address climate risk of the basin with respect to more stability of the green water components the current policies on rainfed farming are more robust data availability statement these data were derived from the following resources available in the public domain digital elevation model dem 30 m

9922,because the pattern of climate and thus water demand varies rapidly an accurate assessment of available water aw must be determined in order to manage water resources sustainable this study investigated the components of basin aw using a comprehensive water balance framework based on the swat model it consists of a system of relationships describing different components of water balance to estimate diverse forms of aw the resulting modelling system is capable of displaying current status and past trends in the components of aw highlight links between blue and green water components assess aw at farm and basin scales and forecast spatial and temporal variations of aw components under different water policies and climate scenarios as well as evaluating potential water shortage to explore this methodology the system was applied to the tashk bakhtegan basin iran the results for the historical period showed wide changes in the blue water components which was very lower for the green water ones for instance it was between 63 and 56 for renewable bw and 11 and 24 for renewable gw with respect to their long term means similarly blue water was more sensitive than green water to future annual precipitation variations evaluation of the construction of the basin s major dam showed that it has drastic impact on the spatial blue aw components such that they are increased in the adjacent subbasin up to 97 and reduced to half the status quo in the downstream subbasins the basin has also experienced 30 increase in cropped areas resulting in 1500 million meter cubic mcm water shortage in the current condition considering the framework as a relatively easy to use tools with readily available data is strongly recommended for other regions graphical abstract flowchart of the model structure to retrieve components of available water ga1 keywords available water green blue available water integrated framework swat model tashk bakhtegan basin 1 introduction it is widely understood that the sustainability of freshwater supplies is affected by increases in water demand and ongoing changes in climatic conditions management decisions pertaining to sustainable water require an accurate understanding of these processes and recent data regarding available water aw padowski and jawitz 2012 koshida et al 2015 various definitions of aw have been offered in the literature generally it is the amount of fresh water that is available for human consumption aw encompasses the dynamic cycle of rainfall and hydrological responses as well as different management measures like agriculture practices and engineered infrastructure storage or diversion of water that eventually effect temporal and spatial variations in accessible water rijsberman 2006 tidwell et al 2012 raeisi et al 2019 component proxies have been also formulated to provide insight into specific aspects of aw tidwell et al 2012 the concept of blue and green water resources were first proposed by falkenmark and rockström 2004 hereof blue water is the sum of river discharge and deep aquifer recharge surface runoff and groundwater formed by precipitation and can also include temporary storage in lakes and reservoirs green water includes the water that is infiltrated in the unsaturated soil layer from precipitation rockstrom et al 2009 and then stored and constitute green water storage velpuri and gabrie 2017 green water flow is also the actual evapotranspiration eta releases to the atmosphere through a combination of evaporation from soil and water bodies and transpiration from vegetation zuo et al 2014 this can be originated from blue and green water resources however distinction between green and blue water consumption is not straightforward in irrigated area hoekstra 2019 since blue water converts to green water through evapotranspiration process falkenmark and rockstrom 2006 mao et al 2018 also not all green water storage can be available for plants transpiration studies have reported that blue and green water resources change in response to human activity where it alters water cycle dynamics and the proportion of blue and green water in a river basin faramarzi et al 2017 pokhrel et al 2012 porkka et al 2016 a green water soil moisture content shortage may cause an increase in blue water irrigation demand this increased demand of blue water resources can then increase evapotranspiration and decrease streamflow veettil and mishra 2018 using these concepts untapped blue green aw resources or mounting pressure on them can be detected and identified for new development or mitigation measures tidwell et al 2016 2018 research often focuses on hydrological cycles and renewable water as the difference between received precipitation and evaporation fao 2003 from this perspective the european environmental agency considers freshwater resources such as river flow snow and glaciers to be critical water storage eea 2009 this approach assesses the basin hydrological response to climate and land conditions jaramillo and destouni 2014 in fact researchers who follow a renewable water approach consider water resources that have not yet been exploited as being available regardless of the feasibility of use in the case of green water not all renewable aw can be provided for use unused evaporation and soil retention in excess of plant uptake ability are portions of aw that cannot be counted on as useful a major problem with the previous approach is that due to technical limitations and environmental restrictions not all resources can or should be considered as options to meet water demand in light of this it is perhaps more useful to examine aw in terms of exploitable or utilizable water resources fao report 23 on country water resources is an example in which use and exploitation has been substituted for water offer however a limitation of this method is its lack of widespread use at basin scale failure to consider non renewable groundwater fao 2003 furthermore the role of return flows in surface groundwater interactions and consequently on aw i e blue water yield are crucial ahmadzadeh et al 2015 raeisi et al 2019 stored blue aw also requires consideration in many basins today infrastructures such as dams flood control and hydropower production vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 and related change release scheduling are used to reduce the effect of drought padowski and jawitz 2012 wanders and wada 2015 by altering hydrological systems and increasing storage capacity aghakouchak et al 2016 however most of these studies have focused only on surface water resources because there are often no accurate estimates of groundwater recharge rates available xu and wu 2017 from a green water resources perspective both flows from cropland and permanent pastureland are considered however not all utilizable green aw can be used productively productive green water flow components transpiration also could be considered as manageable green aw the difference between manageable green water and green water availability represents the potential for improving green water productivity rockstrom et al 2009 the aforementioned components are not only affected by human activities it is of key importance to also understand the influence of climatic variability on aw which results in changes in available freshwater resource distribution in spatial and temporal dimensions gohar and cashman 2016 mishra et al 2020 integrated process based conceptual hydrological models that facilitate assessment of water availability are required in order to accurately consider the dependence of dynamic water resources on natural features and human factors the modelling capability can enable policymakers and administrators in making robust decisions under uncertain future conditions such models can be used to estimate the temporal spatial variation of blue and green water resources with clearer physical mechanism and assess the impacts of different scenarios a capability that cannot be achieved by relying on databases alone schuol et al 2008 zang et al 2012 it has been demonstrated that the soil and water assessment tool swat model arnold et al 1998 can simulate most processes related to hydrology climate and water and agricultural management arabi et al 2008 this model already has widespread applications and has been proven to be effective for studying hydrological impacts globally on a wide variety of scales gassman et al 2007 jayakrishnan et al 2005 krysanova and white 2015 the swat model has been used to quantify the available water green and blue resources at the continental scale for africa schuol et al 2008 and europe abbaspour et al 2015 and at basin scale in china zang et al 2012 and brazil rodrigues et al 2014 this study aims to evaluate green and blue available water components in an integrated framework with four main objectives 1 determine whether the swat hydrological model can be effectively adopted to simulate green and blue water dynamics components and their interlinkages 2 determine the implication of the green and blue water assessment and how it can provide useful information for planning and management e g through different quantitative indices at the field and basin scale 3 determine how the dynamics of the aw s components temporally and spatially can be tracked as the results of human and climate impacts and their distinctions as well and 4 capability to be applied for evaluation of different agricultural water management as well as projection of climate change scenarios 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data the tashk bakhtegan basin was selected for this study this basin is located on the central plateau of iran and encompasses 27 500 km2 at 29 n and 31 20ˈn longitude and 51 50ˈe and 54 40ˈe latitude fig 1 the average annual rainfall in the basin is 150 645 mm precipitation falls mainly in winter and the highest rainfall sums are recorded in the northwest the kor river is the major river in the basin originating from the zagros mountains and flowing into tashk and bakhtegan lakes at southern end of the basin the land cover in the basin is chiefly composed of pastoral land 62 and agricultural land 27 the total irrigated area is 423 000 ha crops and orchards cover 88 and 12 of this area respectively where wheat sunflower and almond have the highest cultivated areas the rainfed orchards are also very popular in the study area where almond grape and fig are the main products the dominant soil texture class of the agricultural lands is clay loam the construction of dorodzan mulla sadra and sivand dams with the normal volumes of 993 440 and 150 million cubic meter mcm respectively has facilitated withdrawal of stored surface water for agricultural use however about 80 of the withdrawal in the basin is actually from groundwater resources in order to meet irrigated farming demands ministry of energy 2018 such consumption has seriously reduced runoff evidenced by the drying up of many natural lakes in the basin despite water shortages agricultural land in this region continues to expand a comparison of the basin s land use shows a 30 increase in cultivated lands between 1987 and 2015 farrokhnia et al 2020 table 1 shows the provided data and respective sources for the case study it includes hydro climate agriculture management and hydro structure data as well as spatial remote sensing e g digital elevation model dem soil and land use information the locations of the selected meteorological and discharge stations are shown in fig 1 2 2 conceptual framework fig 2 provides a conceptual framework for available water with the details considered in this study aw includes both green and blue water resources renewable blue water is calculated as the sum of runoff and recharge to the aquifer blue water yield represents the amount of water from runoff the return flow from the aquifer and the subsurface flow minus possible losses blue water is stored in surface reservoirs natural or structural and underground aquifers because blue water flow is composed of outflow from streams it has no value in a closed basin like the study area if a water transfer plan is in place these resources will be added to or deducted from the blue water flow loss caused by evaporation from the blue water bodies is inevitable the available green water resources are similarly divided renewable green water resources is the total soil moisture content the utilizable green water can be calculated by adding complimentary deducting the evaporation and soil retention from agricultural and pastoral lands where there is irrigation these new resources also will be considered to be utilizable green water resources after subtracting the amount of evaporation utilizable green water resources can be divided into two parts green water storage moisture stored in the root zone and manageable green water outflow through transpiration 2 3 swat model the swat model is a process based hydrological model that can accommodate various hydrological components and spatial and temporal distribution of blue and green water content in the basin in the model the hydrological cycle is simulated based on the water balance equation neitsch et al 2011 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw t where sw t is the final soil water content mm sw 0 is the previous soil water content mm t is the step of time day r day q surf and e a are the amount of precipitation and irrigation surface runoff and evapotranspiration on day i mm respectively w seep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm and q gw is the return flow on day i mm it includes lateral flows and deep percolation neitsch et al 2011 arcswat 2012 was selected for the model framework based on a monthly time step it requires digital elevation land use and soil maps as well as meteorological information for hydrological modelling these spatial layers were used to delineate the basin and divide it into multiple sub basins each sub basin was further partitioned into combined land use soil and management units called hydrologic response units hrus the study area was divided into 17 sub basins and 403 hrus after the formation of the basin structure information about water management and use reservoir operation and agricultural practice e g crop pattern planting calendar irrigation source and scheduling across the landscape were introduced to the model four major crops were considered as proxies for rainfed agricultural land wheat grapes almonds figs and five major crops as proxies for irrigated land wheat rice beans sunflowers almonds the sources of these data and information are illustrated in table 1 simulation of the hydrological processes was based on the water balance at each hru after the simulations were performed at the hru level they were aggregated and summarized at the sub basin level a detailed explanation of swat computational equations can be found in neitsch et al 2011 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et has a major role in estimation of aw especially to estimate green water swat calculates et in the forms of potential et pet and actual et aet the model offers different options to estimate pet and here we chose to apply the hargreaves hg method considering data available for the study area the model calculates evaporation e based on pet by combining et from soil and plants individually during rainy days swat first evaporates interceptions by the plant canopy then it calculates the maximum amount of transpiration t and soil e or sublimation s if there is snow model results display the actual s and e from the soil surface the same process will be implemented for canopy and plant transpiration the sum of e from the canopy and soil as well as t from plant constitutes et it is clear that aet may vary depending upon the water availability in the soil profile water table depth and or canopy characteristics i e daily leaf area index lai lai directly affect crop yield more details in this regard are available in neitsch et al 2011 in some of the studies where there were limitations of aet measurements the model calibration was performed using crop yield records to indirectly evaluate the model capability for simulate of aet faramarzi et al 2017 zuo et al 2014 zang and mao 2019 2 3 1 available water computation using swat model the model consists of a system of relationships describing the basic principles of water balance in the aeration zone of the soil including the effect of vegetation cover and groundwater the hydrologic fluxes used to quantify water availability were runoff groundwater evapotranspiration sub surface flow and streamflow water storage includes soil moisture groundwater storage shallow and deep aquifers surface reservoirs and natural lakes the components of aw of the basin were extracted from different model outputs fig 3 summarizes the variables of each aw component according to the conceptual model information about the specific outputs of the model were used to quantify the simulated hydrological processes 2 3 1 1 blue water estimation to represent available blue water using different approaches different water resource components were selected considering swat modules and methodology the computational relationships used in each approach are discussed below from a water offer perspective aw is actually the renewable water resources of the basin these are designated as renewable because they occur every year in the natural cycle of precipitation before external factors resulting from human interference and harvesting affect them surface runoff and recharge to the aquifer at each hru were used to calculate the renewable blue water these variables were aggregated for each sub basin using the mean annual values renewable blue water can be calculated as 2 baw r q r q l q g where b aw r is the renewable blue water q r is the average annual amount of surface runoff q l is the lateral sub surface flow and q g is the groundwater recharge the water yield based approach involves losses blue water yield is considered to be accessible water because inevitable losses including evaporation and transmission losses have been included in the calculation the amount of runoff in the hrus reaching the streams of the sub basin q r forms the basis of local available water blue water yield can be calculated as 3 baw y q r q lat q gw t loss where baw y is natural water yield q lat is subsurface lateral flow q gw is groundwater participation in surface flow and t loss is transmission loss blue water yield can be obtained from the model outputs directly as water yield at the outlet point of each sub basin another approach was used to determine the water resources ready for new development surface outflow from each sub basin is often considered useless possibly released due to environmental considerations or downstream water rights however this blue water source could be considered aw if there are no plans for use or downstream rights in place the outflow consists of local water yield and upstream inflow to each sub basin this is routed along the stream until it arrives at the sub basin outlet the variable travel time method was used to simulate the channel routing process in this method in addition to input from upstream the effects of existing water withdrawals imports and storage infrastructures is included in model calculations ultimately only a fraction of the stream flow of each sub basin reaches its outlet and is calculated as net sub basin outflow and reported as water resources provided for new development blue water flow is calculated as 4 baw f v q where baw f is blue water flow and v q is the average volume of outflow from sub basin streams this value can be calculated from model output files using the outflow variable at each sub basin the net values are calculated as the difference between the inlet and outlet flows of the sub basins another perspective for determining stored water considers the amount of water stored in natural and structural reservoirs these resources can be called manageable or exploitable water as they are net resources which can exploited directly and are routinely used for different allocations these resources are provided by local water yield and inflow to each sub basin from upstream and net groundwater recharge water resources stored in the sub basin depends on the reservoir capacity and or operation blue water storage can be calculated as 5 b aw s v v v g where baw s is blue water storage v v and v g are the average volume of water stored at the surface and in underground reservoirs respectively the groundwater storage value is the difference between recharge and discharge i e net change at each time step the amount of available water calculated in this research eqs 2 to 5 at each simulation time step are presented as equivalent water heights relative to area for the basin in order to obtain a better understanding of the amount of water resources available 2 3 1 2 green water estimation available green water components were calculated in situ at the hru level as the sum of the soil moisture and evapotranspiration values simulated by the model the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 was used to estimate potential evapotranspiration once the total potential evapotranspiration had been determined swat first evaporated any rainfall intercepted by the plant canopy the remaining evaporative water demand was partitioned between the vegetation and soil in the hargreaves method for swat transpiration is calculated as a function of the plant leaf area index the actual amount of transpiration may decrease from a lack of aw in the soil when the water content of the soil is below field capacity fc the evaporative demand for soil decreases to the wilting point wp the fc and permanent wp are the amount of water held in the soil at a tension of 0 033 and 1 5 mpa respectively this is considered to be the available waster for plant extraction awc water in excess of fc is available for percolation or lateral flow as 6 awc fc wp the wp per soil layer is calculated as 7 wp ly 0 4 m c ρ b 100 8 soil 1 ρ b ρ s where soil is the porosity expressed as a fraction of the total soil volume m c is the clay content of the soil ρ b is the bulk density mg m 3 and ρ s is the particle density mg m 3 details about how these processes are simulated can be found in the swat user manual renewable green water resources were calculated from the sum of natural evapotranspiration and soil moisture storage these values were aggregated and reported at the sub basin basin level evapotranspiration was calculated as the accumulated flow through the plants to the air by time step one month however only the soil moisture content in the root zone layer of the soil was used as water use often occurs at this depth this value was calculated at the end of each time step as 9 gaw r et t sw t where g aw r is the renewable green water et t is the average annual amount of evapotranspiration and sw t is the soil water in root depth that portion of the green water resources was denoted as the utilizable green water resources these resources are the amount of evapotranspiration and root zone soil moisture in agricultural and pastoral lands that can lead to economically efficient vegetable consumption as 10 gaw u et u sw u where g aw u is the utilizable green water and et u and sw u are the average annual amount of utilizable evapotranspiration and soil water respectively that occur in agricultural and pastoral lands the utilizable green water resources consist of stored green water and manageable or output green water the soil moisture in the root zone in agricultural and pastoral lands are denoted as green water storage gaw s the actual transpiration from agricultural and pastoral lands t m is denoted as manageable green water gaw m as 11 gaw s sw u 12 gaw m t m 2 4 evaluation of water availability under climate change scenarios changing precipitation and temperature are the main consequences of climate change leading to the disruption of aw as well however the precise timing and extent of these impacts remain deeply uncertain the applied framework is capable of addressing this issue and supporting respected algorithms used to make decision under such conditions e g robust decision making lempert and groves 2010 the sensitivity of an aw components to climate change can be considered as the proportional change of simulated bw and gw availability in different respected scenarios compared to the no change state for precipitation and temperature it can be calculated as 13 aw aw p t aw 0 0 aw 0 0 100 where aw is the response of aw to precipitation and temperature change p and t are precipitation and temperature variations under climate change scenarios respectively aw p t is the aw under hypothetical climate change scenarios aw 0 0 is the aw under the no change scenario for precipitation and temperature here aw is any component of available blue or green water 2 5 modelling scenarios to estimate aw to estimate different components of aw the model must be run with different management scenarios with respect to the objective of study for this they are as follows 2 5 1 actual conditions ac this scenario simulates the current agriculture management in the basin including dam operations irrigation management planting harvesting fertilizer etc table 1 the area under cultivation and irrigation schedules were held constant to allow investigation of only the effects of climate on available water 2 5 2 no withdrawal nw the no withdrawal scenario assumes no human water management thus there is not any irrigation and effects of infrastructures dam structure and operation were excluded this approach runs without irrigation withdrawal to exclude the effect of water abstraction in this scenario water resource equilibrium over the study period was determined by groundwater calibration 2 5 3 automatic irrigation ai irrigation influences discharge into streams and transpiration from irrigated crops in this scenario all of the basin water management and dams operated such that all crop water requirements were fulfilled by auto irrigation and unlimited water resources this ai calculates maximum plant transpiration and soil evaporation as explained by neitsch et al 2011 therefore as soon as any water stress occurs irrigation will be automatically activated 2 6 evaluation indicators and indices due to the flexibility of the aforementioned framework many different indicators and indices can be used to evaluate the water status of the study area here we only use a few of them martin carrasco et al 2013 boulay et al 2018 water supply index this index evaluates the water system s capacity s to meet agricultural water demand d as follow 14 i s s d exploitable water renewable green water en vironmental demand maximun damand et s and d need to be estimated based on the nw and ai scenarios respectively demand supply index expecting the reliability of a water system to meet water demands at 100 of days is too conservative for agricultural sector the reliability of 85 is an acceptable threshold martin carrasco et al 2013 however any other ratio can be applied 15 i r s d 0 85 green water capacity index the index explores the ration of basin s potential productive green water resources i e manageable green water in appendix a to its maximum productive green water resources 16 gw c manageable gw ac manageab le gw ai the nominator and denominator of the equation are based on the ac and ai scenarios respectively water shortage indicator in order to investigate water shortage the relationship presented in the eq 14 is used in this regard the difference between available water and water demand is calculated 17 wsh aw d where wsh is water shortage aw is available water exploitable or renewable water and d is water demand respectively the method is very flexible and can be calculated at unit area subbasin and basin levels as well as daily monthly and yearly time scales to estimate aw and d the modelling framework needs to be run for nw and ai scenarios 2 7 model calibration and validation for calibration of swat we applied a multi variable and multi site calibration since conventional reliance on hydrometric data is insufficient other variables like crop yields are also included for this the swat cup tool developed by abbaspour 2012 was applied for parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration it includes different algorithms and among them the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 a semi automatic inverse modelling procedure was selected to analyse the swat s parameters in the smallest number of model runs the sensitivity analysis revealed that most of the 22 global parameters of hydrological simulations were sensitive to river discharge however parameters such as cn2 scs runoff curve number plaps annual precipitation gradient gw delay groundwater delay time were the most sensitive parameters because the model cannot simulate groundwater volume and water table fluctuations these were performed in a relative manner to ensure calibration of groundwater parameters and volume of groundwater storage the model is able to estimate the amount of recharge to the aquifer therefore groundwater storage has been expressed as net aquifer change the parameters were selected and calibrated such that the long term change in groundwater under natural conditions and without human intervention nw scenario would be approximately zero in the long run surface water and groundwater interaction were in equilibrium additionally the tashk bakhtegan lake s volume and crop yields are other information that are considered for this step fig 4 diagrams the steps in this process the first year of the study period was used as a warm up the 20 year period from 1986 to 2005 was considered for calibration and the remaining years 2006 2015 for validation of the model to compare the ability of swat to reproduce streamflow and observations the performance criteria of the mean and standard deviation of simulations coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency e p factor and r factor were used the calibration and validation results are presented in table 2 the table shows the values of r2 and ns are generally more than 0 5 which indicate an acceptable model performance for stream flow simulation in the calibration and validation periods as stated before to ensure calibration results model simulation of the crop yield and volume of basin lakes was examined using limited observational data the results of this comparison are shown in table 3 and fig 5 it was concluded that the performance of the model was satisfactory and the calibrated model was able to replicate the watershed hydrology of the tashk bakhtegan basin 3 results and discussion 3 1 aw assessment under management and climate scenarios 3 1 1 aw assessment during historical period this section explores the modelling framework s capabilities in analysing aw status in the tashk bakhtegan basin as stated before different approaches especially water accounting based indices can be applied we first evaluate the green and blue water components during the driest and wettest years of the record period this comparison demonstrates the sensitivity of these components to the basin s climate variability then the historical record was assessed within 5 years periods using a number of indices that rely on green and blue water components fig 6 shows the 3 years mean status of green and blue water components for the basin s wettest i e 1991 1992 and 2004 and driest 1987 2008 and 2010 periods they are then compared with their long term annual rainfall means it is clear that the green water was less susceptible to changes in annual precipitation also the reaction of blue water to high rainfall years was more severe while the reaction of green water to the low rainfall years was more severe among the blue and green aw components blue and green water storage were most affected by changes in precipitation changes fig 7 illustrates the evaluation of the basin water resources at each five year period using the demand supply water supply and green water capacity indices the time interval is matched with the iranian 5 year development plan the figure shows that demand supply index and water supply index have negative trends one of the main reasons for this situation can be attributed to the negative trend in the basin s precipitation imani et al 2019 have also reported positive trends in the basin s temperature it can be concluded that the five year development plans are not be effective in adapting to this situation as expected the green water capacity index is less sensitive to these changes 3 1 2 aw change under dam construction impact of the dorudzan dam on aw was assessed using the applied methodology and considering renewable water and exploitable water the results showed no significant impact from this infrastructure on aw at basin level but when the assessments were made at the sub basin scale the changes in exploitable water were significant fig 8 shows this issue and how it is changed due to construction of the dam as the main storage facility in the basin it is seen that the dam has increased aw in the respected subbasin up to 97 i e more capacity to store water but has substantially reduced aw in downstream subbasins where the task bakhtegan wetland is located 3 1 3 effect of land use changes on water shortage the impact of land use changes on aw components is important the swat model is also capable of handling such as an issue wang et al 2014 as stated before comparison of the 1987 and 2015 land use of the basin shows a roughly 30 increase in the agricultural lands the effect of such a change on the basin s water shortage is evaluated in this section for this aim the modelling framework was run using the two land uses under ai and ac scenarios to calculate wsh in eq 17 at the basin level and monthly time scale the results showed fig 10 that the 30 increase in agricultural land has caused significant changes in water shortages the basin was almost in equilibrium in 1987 while the results shows about 1500 mcm water shortage algebraic sum of the monthly water shortages in fig 9 as expected whs is more pronounced between april and september that is the cropping season it is noteworthy that the order of the months has changed in terms of water shortage that can be attributed to the change in basin s cropping pattern e g expansion of rice cultivation as mentioned before due to the evaluations at basin scale he results for exploitable and renewable aw are not much significant 3 1 4 effect of climate change scenarios green blue on available water components fig 10 shows the results of sensitivity assessment of aw components using a range of climatic scenarios using the basin s climate change study by massah et al 2020 based on the projections of aogcm ar5 models as well as the third national communication to unfccc department of environment 2017 it was assumed that changes in precipitation ranged from 30 20 and the temperature changes ranged from 0 5 to 2 c fig 10 fig 10 illustrates the changes in projected precipitation and temperature in relation to the components of the green and blue water compared to the ac scenario current situation this shows more sensitivity of the components to the change in precipitation similar results are also reported by verbista et al 2020 while evaluating the la paloma reservoir volume a part of blue water storage for different temperatures and precipitation values furthermore comparison of the blue and green water components i e fig 10 a c e and g vs b d f and h reveals more sensitivity in blue components when compared with green components for instance a 25 reduction of precipitation causes about 25 reduction in renewable blue water while it is only 10 in the renewable green water fig 10 a and b respectively considering the results and reliance of the basin on blue water resources it can be concluded that robust and flexible adaptation strategies are required to address increased climate risk within basin and surrounding regions as stated before the green water components are robust in the face of climate variations so the current policies on dryland farming especially fig as one of the basin s exportable products can be continued and more planning should be done for it air temperature is also an important factor affecting green water availability as expected an increase in temperature decreased the available blue and green water storage however evapotranspiration increased to a lesser extent under warmer conditions these results can be used to improve scientific understanding of the evolution of blue and green water resources as affected by climate change in the basins and is especially necessary for sustainable water use in arid and semi arid regions 4 conclusions this research focused on creating an integrated framework to evaluate blue green available water and related components the effort builds on an innovative approach of aw modelling using the swat model we fund the developed methodology and modelling framework very suitable for agricultural water management some of the features that could be presented in this article are 1 presentation of interlinkages of blue and green water components 2 systematic presentation of the current status and past trends in the components of aw as well as future situation under different climate and management scenarios 3 spatial variation of aw components under different water policies at basin and subbasin scales 4 assessment of water saving measures on aw components at farm and basin scales for achieving of realistic planning 5 temporal pattern of aw components at daily monthly and yearly time scales 6 possibility to show spatial and temporal status of water shortage 7 possibility to distinguish impacts of human and climate variability on aw and 8 flexibility to be applied with a variety of indices regarding planning and management it is showed that swat model could effectively simulate the green and blue water dynamics components and their interlinkages however it needs a kind of multi variable calibration in another word the conventional reliance on hydrometric data is not enough and other processes like actual evapotranspiration need to be included in the course of calibration the proposed modelling framework can provide relevant information on aw as well as the potential influence of anthropogenic and climate variables this methodology is very applicable where different polices measures like watershed management agriculture water saving and environment water supply need to be evaluated in an integrated framework and their effects and side effects should be considered finally it is an easy to use tools with readily available data in order to facilitate water availability assessment and is strongly recommended for other regions to show the capability of the methodology tashk bkhtegan basin is applied as the case study it is showed that 1 using the historical information of basin 1986 2015 the components of aw for a set of dry and wet years were computed and compared the results showed more sensitivity of the blue water components to climate variability than green ones for instance it was between 63 and 56 for renewable bw and 11 and 24 for renewable gw with respect to their long term means 2 evaluation of the construction of the durodzan dam showed that it has drastic impact on spatial blue aw components such that they are increased in the adjacent subbasin up to 97 and reduced to half the status quo in the downstream subbasins thus the modelling framework provides relevant information for the future operation of dam possible changes in the environment flows and even the expected social consequences e g upstream downstream conflicts 3 the basin has experienced 30 increase in its cropped areas between 1987 and 2015 as a result it has significantly increased the difference between available water and water demand in another words while the basin was almost in equilibrium in 1987 it is now faced with 1500 mcm water shortage in current condition and 4 application of the modelling framework for the projected changes of precipitation and temperature showed more sensitivity of the components to the change in precipitation also it was shown that the blue water components are more sensitive while the basin is more dependent to these resources therefore adaptation strategies are seriously required to address climate risk of the basin with respect to more stability of the green water components

9923,due to economic and environmental considerations there exists a need for effective efficient and nondestructive methods for locating buried agricultural drainage pipes previous research indicates that thermal infrared tir imagery obtained with an unmanned aerial vehicle uav has potential for mapping agricultural subsurface drainage systems thereby warranting further investigation to determine the best time of day to conduct these uav tir surveys accordingly a set of sunrise to sunset uav tir surveys were carried out at four different farm field sites in ohio u s a late morning through late afternoon uav tir surveys were generally found to work well for determining drainage system patterns during late morning through late afternoon the apparent radiant temperature of the soil surface over the drain lines was higher than between the drain lines i e emitted tir radiation from the soil surface over a drain line was greater than between the drain lines conversely near sunrise or sunset the uav surveys often showed the apparent radiant temperature of the soil surface over the drain lines to be lower than between the drain lines i e less emitted tir radiation over the drain lines than between drain lines some excellent uav tir drainage mapping results were obtained near sunrise sunset due to tir drain line responses that were more easily distinguished from those of farm field operations however difficulties were occasionally encountered processing this sunrise sunset tir imagery likely due to the impact on image quality from high relative humidity during these times of the day consequently strictly on a consistency of success basis alone late morning through late afternoon are the best times for locating drainage pipes with uav tir surveys however in certain cases uav tir surveys at sunrise sunset can provide exceptional drainage pattern recognition these results provide valuable guidance for those considering uav tir drainage mapping surveys keywords agricultural subsurface drainage systems unmanned aerial vehicles uavs thermal infrared tir imagery drainage pipe mapping 1 introduction 1 1 rationale for drainage mapping research the widespread adoption of subsurface drainage practices to remove excess soil water has enabled the midwest u s a to become one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world a 1985 economic survey showed that several states within this region illinois indiana iowa ohio minnesota michigan missouri and wisconsin had by that year approximately 12 5 million ha containing subsurface drainage systems with cropland accounting for the vast majority of areas having buried drainage pipes pavelis 1987 these systems are typically comprised of 10 cm diameter older clay tile or newer corrugated plastic tubing drain line networks buried 0 6 1 3 m beneath the surface since 1985 a substantial amount of additional agricultural drainage pipe has been installed farmers within this region and other parts of the world where agricultural drainage practices are common often need to repair drain lines that are not functioning correctly or in order to increase crop yields install new drain lines between the old ones to improve soil water removal efficiency either for system repairs or efficiency improvements locations of the preexisting drain lines are required however in most cases a map of the original subsurface drainage system installation is no longer available furthermore subsurface drainage practices can release substantial amounts of nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 from farm fields into adjacent waterways sims et al 1998 zucker and brown 1998 which in turn degrades surface water bodies on local regional and national scales risk assessment of this environmental hazard from a farm field perspective calls for knowledge of the installed drainage pipe network including extent of coverage and drain line spacing distance regardless of whether the need is economic or environmental finding drain lines with a hand held tile probe is time consuming extremely tedious and if not careful can damage buried pipes fig 1a using heavy trenching equipment is generally effective but always causes considerable pipe damage requiring costly repairs fig 1b subsurface drainage system patterns can be complex fig 2 further hampering efforts to map drain lines using traditional tile probe or trenching detection methods consequently there is a crucial necessity for effective efficient and nondestructive drainage pipe mapping methods proximal soil sensing or imagery obtained with unmanned aerial vehicles uavs can potentially provide a viable means for mapping these agricultural subsurface drainage systems 1 2 prior research into nondestructive methods for mapping subsurface drainage ground penetrating radar gpr a proximal soil sensing method has proven capable in many instances of locating buried drainage pipes under a range of soil conditions allred et al 2004 2005 2018a allred and redman 2010 allred 2013 chow and rees 1989 koganti et al 2020 however gpr is somewhat inefficient for providing detailed maps of subsurface drainage systems in large farm fields both visible vis i e wavelengths within the 400 700 nm visible light portion of electromagnetic spectrum and color infrared cir comprised of green red and near infrared wavelengths airplane photography obtained outside the growing season have been tested to a limited extent for mapping subsurface drainage systems naz et al 2009 verma et al 1996 these studies noted that optimal drainage mapping field conditions exist several days after a rainfall event equal or greater than 2 5 or 5 0 cm although scheduling an airplane to obtain aerial imagery when these field conditions are present can be problematic and expensive alternatively scheduling an aerial survey with an unmanned aerial vehicle uav is far more flexible and could solve this timing availability issue but uavs have not been extensively tested for drainage pipe mapping even though some aerial vis and cir drainage pipe detection studies have been conducted there has been very little research on the use of thermal infrared tir imagery to map drainage pipes abdel hadi et al 1970 provides several excellent examples in which tir imagery detected subsurface features such as pipelines and buried stream channels thereby indicating that tir aerial surveys may have the capability for drainage pipe mapping a laboratory experiment conducted by woo et al 2019 demonstrated the potential of tir imagery for locating buried drainage pipe further implying that timing relative to rainfall can impact the success of using tir imagery for this purpose in a preliminary case study by allred et al 2018b a uav deploying a tir camera detected roughly 60 of the subsurface drainage infrastructure known to be present at an agricultural field near mount gilead ohio u s a at the same field site used by allred et al 2018b freeland et al 2019 found that pairing of real time kinematic rtk global navigation satellite system gnss technology with the uav tir survey was essential for accurately locating buried drain lines williamson et al 2019 utilized both uav multispectral ms often including separate narrow bands of blue green red red edge and near infrared wavelengths and tir imagery in a complementary approach to map random drain lines in two conservation tillage farm fields near harlan indiana u s a tlapáková et al 2017 documented success using manned aircraft and uavs with vis cir near infrared nir and tir sensors to map agricultural drainage systems in the czech republic kratt et al 2020 carried out uav surveys at two illinois farm fields four days after a small rainfall event and found visible color vis c imagery better than tir imagery at finding drainage pipe locations aerial surveys using a uav with visible color vis c ms and tir cameras were conducted by allred et al 2020 at 29 agricultural field sites in the midwest u s a and overall results showed that vis c ms and tir imagery detected at least some of the drainage pipe present at 48 59 and 69 of the sites respectively based on this past research additional investigation is certainly warranted particularly on the use of uav tir imagery for mapping subsurface drainage 1 3 potential mechanisms for time of day impacts on thermal infrared drainage mapping the soil surface directly over top of a drain line is often drier than the soil surface between drain lines this phenomenon is especially true in the days after a significant rainfall because the soil over a drain line is dewatered at a faster rate than the soil between drain lines smedema et al 2004 the diurnal cycle in solar radiation received at the ground surface in conjunction with the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of soil pore water being significantly different from that of air within the pores can result in the drier soil surface over a drain line having a different true kinetic temperature than a wetter soil surface between drain lines hillel 1980 jenson 2007 as indicated by eq 1 the stefan boltzmann and kirchhoff s laws stipulate that the tir radiation emitted from an object m r w m 2 and the apparent radiant temperature t rad k are a function of that object s true kinetic temperature t kin k and dimensionless emissivity ε jenson 2007 kuenzer and dech 2013 1 m r σ t rad 4 ε σ t kin 4 where the stefan boltzmann constant σ equals 5 6695 10 8 w m 2 k 4 soil surface emissivity is impacted by its moisture level and generally a wet soil surface will have a higher ε value than a dry soil surface jenson 2007 mira et al 2007 a tir camera can detect soil surface variations in m r i e and t rad caused by variations in t kin and or ε several studies have showed that linear soil surface features depicted in uav tir imagery which exhibited t rad i e and m r different than their surroundings often revealed the presence buried agricultural drain lines allred et al 2018b 2020 freeland et al 2019 williamson et al 2019 the diurnal t kin range is much greater for a dry soil surface than a wet soil surface again due to the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of soil pore water being significantly different from that of air within the pores hillel 1980 jackson et al 1974 jenson 2007 mengistu et al 2018 from late morning to late afternoon the t kin of a dry soil surface is typically higher than for a wet soil surface jackson et al 1974 jenson 2007 mengistu et al 2018 abdel hadi et al 1970 conducted experiments with sandy and silty clay soils and found that the emitted tir radiation for both soils was substantially greater for a dry soil surface than a wet soil surface during daylight from 12 00 18 00 therefore from late morning to late afternoon the soil surface t rad over a drain line is likely to be higher than between drain lines most research indicates that from sunset to sunrise a dry soil surface t kin will still be slightly warmer than a wet soil surface jackson et al 1974 jenson 2007 however it is possible during the time from sunset to sunrise that the emitted tir radiation from a wetter soil surface to be greater than from a drier soil surface based on the stefan boltzmann and kirchhoff s laws this phenomenon could occur due to the wetter soil surface having a higher ε value than the drier soil surface even when the wetter soil surface has a slightly lower t kin than a drier soil surface see eq 1 experiments carried out by abdel hadi et al 1970 on sandy and silty clay soils and found the m r for both soils was somewhat greater for a wet soil surface than a dry soil surface from midnight 0 00 to sunrise 6 00 therefore it is possible near sunrise or sunset for the soil surface t rad over a drain line to be less than between drain lines the reverse of what would occur between late morning to late afternoon the common convention for grayscale uav tir imagery is for features that have lower t rad to be darker shaded and features that have higher t rad to be lighter shaded during the time of day from late morning to late afternoon previous studies allred et al 2018b 2020 freeland et al 2019 williamson et al 2019 have shown the drain line response depicted in uav tir imagery to be distinct lighter shaded linear features this late morning to late afternoon tir drainage pipe mapping result is again most certainly due to drier soil over the drain line having a higher t kin than wetter soil between drain lines jackson et al 1974 jenson 2007 mengistu et al 2018 the drainage pipe response obtained by uav tir imagery in the early morning hours near sunrise and the evening hours near sunset was unclear prior to this research based on previous discussions it would seem possible during early morning and late evening that the drier soil surface over a drain line could have a t rad i e and m r greater the same or less than the surrounding soil surfaces between the drain lines if the t rad at the soil surface over the drain line is the same as the t rad between drain lines then there would be no tir drainage pipe response while a t rad over the drain line less that between drain lines would be depicted as darker shaded linear features within typical uav tir grayscale imagery further complicating matters for drainage mapping with uav tir surveys conducted in early morning and evening hours is the increased relative humidity that occurs during these times of the day ackerman and knox 2015 ahrens 1988 high relative humidity causes atmospheric absorption and re emission of tir radiation azosensors 2018 flir systems 2018 jenson 2007 zhang et al 2016 this high relative humidity atmospheric effect in turn degrades the quality of individual tir images obtained during a uav survey thereby hampering the ability to stitch these images together to produce a complete tir orthomosaic map of the farm field area precisionhawk 2019 sensefly sa 2020 recommendations are that uav tir surveys not be carried out if the relative humidity is above 60 precisionhawk 2019 or 75 sensefly sa 2020 consequently daytime variations in meteorological conditions especially relative humidity can potentially affect tir image quality and may need careful consideration when planning a uav tir drainage mapping survey 1 4 research focus scope goal and hypothesis a large knowledge gap definitely exists on time of day impacts for uav tir subsurface drainage mapping as previously indicated 1 the tir drainage pipe response may change during the day and 2 daytime variations in meteorological conditions can affect tir image quality gaining insight on the best times of day to conduct a uav tir drainage mapping survey and the times of day to avoid required sets of sunrise to sunset uav tir surveys be conducted at four different farm field sites in ohio u s a with one of the fields visited twice note when this study was conducted nighttime commercial uav flights in the u s were not allowed without authorization and could normally only be carried out between the beginning of morning civil twilight 20 30 min before sunrise and the end of evening civil twilight 20 30 min after sunset aitken et al 2017 therefore the overall project goal was to obtain data needed to provide specific guidance on the best time of day from sunrise to sunset for uav tir drainage mapping based on 1 the tir drainage pipe response and 2 meteorological conditions this project had a stated research hypothesis late morning through late afternoon are the best times to conduct uav tir mapping of subsurface drainage systems 2 materials and methods note this research used much the same equipment and data processing procedures as employed for the allred et al 2020 study consequently for the most part information on equipment and data processing provided in subsections 2 1 and 2 2 were previously reported in allred et al 2020 the restating sometimes verbatim of equipment and data processing information in subsections 2 1 and 2 2 is done solely for the purpose of enabling readers to more easily comprehend how the uav imagery for this research was obtained and analyzed without having to go through the effort of gaining access and reviewing the previously published article by allred et al 2020 2 1 uav survey equipment a sensefly sa cheseaux sur lausanne switzerland ebee plus rtk ppk fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicle uav was employed to carry out the visible color vis c and thermal infrared tir surveys for this study the equipment set up for the system is shown in fig 3a and includes the uav itself 110 cm wingspan the ground modem antenna mounted on a tripod and a computer the ebee plus uav could accommodate a payload of one camera and one battery per flight the computer had an internal cellular modem that allowed field internet access the ground modem antenna connected to the computer provided communication with the uav the sensefly sa emotion3 software installed on the computer was used to plan control uav flight patterns along with managing the data collected during each survey flight plans employed a serpentine back and forth route containing a single set of parallel lines along which uav vis c and tir imagery were obtained each uav survey parallel line set was oriented in a manner to minimize end of flight line turn arounds thereby conserving battery power during flight the uav typically achieved speeds of 37 65 km h 20 35 kn two different cameras were utilized in this study s o d a sensor optimized for drone applications and thermomap the sensefly sa s o d a camera was used to collect high resolution 20 mpx vis c color 400 700 nm wavelength photos this camera had a 28 mm focal lens the uav as configured with the s o d a camera had real time kinematic rtk global navigation satellite system gnss functionality that provided survey grade positional accuracy 0 7 cm for the vis c photos obtained utilizing rtk gnss functionality with the uav s o d a configuration required onsite internet connection with the ohio department of transportation continuously operated reference station network to create a virtual local gnss base station ohio department of transportation 2020 the uav surveys conducted with the s o d a camera were flown approximately 122 m 400 ft above the ground with a surface resolution of 2 8 cm px a lateral photo overlap of 70 between adjacent flight lines and a longitudinal photo overlap of 60 along a flight line as will be described in greater detail later in this subsection the acquired s o d a imagery was used to adjust and improve the positional accuracy of the uav tir imagery obtained with the thermomap camera the sensefly sa thermomap radiometric thermal infrared tir camera captured 0 3 mpx 640 512 px images in a wavelength range of 8 5 11 5 µm 10 µm center wavelength the radiometric thermomap camera has a 72 field of view diagonal an image capture rate of 7 5 photos per second and a temperature resolution of 0 1 c the uav as configured with the thermomap camera did not have rtk gnss functionality and positional accuracy without adjustment was approximately 4 m the uav surveys conducted with the thermomap camera were flown approximately 85 107 m 280 350 ft above the ground surface with a resolution of 16 20 cm px a lateral photo overlap of 70 and a longitudinal photo overlap of 90 altitudes for the uav tir surveys were chosen based on obtaining the highest resolution imagery possible with a flight plan completed using one fully charged uav battery the thermomap camera performs an internal radiometric temperature calibration at every mission waypoint during this process the thermomap camera closes its external shutter and an image of the uniform calibration surface on the reverse side of the shutter is captured thereby enabling dynamic correction for in air system temperature variation essentially the camera correlates its own temperature with the temperature of the back of the shutter that has a known emissivity which in turn provides all the information needed to do the radiometric calibration carried out at the end of each flight line propeller aero surry hills new south wales australia aeropoints fig 3b capable of providing their own accurate latitude longitude positions at locations where they were placed were used as cloud connected ground control points gcps to confirm positional accuracy of the uav s o d a surveys the aeropoints did not show up well on tir images so a 61 cm 24 in diameter aluminum pizza pan was placed next to each aeropoint in the field fig 3b the aluminum pizza pans show up well on both s o d a and thermomap images consequently the s o d a survey having rtk gnss survey grade functionality was used to obtain accurate positional coordinates for the pizza pans thereby allowing the pizza pans to be employed as precision gcps for the thermomap survey through geospatial adjustments based on the pizza pan gcps the positional accuracy of the thermomap imagery was much improved this georeferencing approach for uav tir imagery is detailed by freeland et al 2019 2 2 data processing of uav imagery pix4d sa prilly switzerland software pix4dmapper pro was employed for initial data processing particularly stitching together of the overlapping camera images obtained during a uav survey the end product of this stitching process was a set of vis c and tir georeferenced orthomosaic image maps of the site area over which the uav vis c and tir surveys were flown all the orthomosaic maps generated were based on the nad 83 2011 geodetic reference system orthomosaic maps were post processed using arcmap 10 2 desktop software environmental systems research institute redlands california u s a where annotations were added and the image then saved in a manageable format size further processing was accomplished using the public access gnu image manipulation program gimp 2 10 10 image editor this software allowed for adjustment and enhancement of exposure sharpness image size and resolution the vis c orthomosaic maps are a stitched color image of the site as would be seen from above with the human eye the tir orthomosaic maps were generated in grayscale with lighter shaded features representing higher apparent radiant temperature t rad values i e greater emission of thermal infrared radiation m r for tir imagery obtained with the radiometric thermomap camera pixel brightness represents an absolute temperature based on an emissivity of 1 0 pix4dmapper pro converted this absolute temperature to t rad in celsius using 2 temperature in c pixel brightness value 100 100 consequently with respect to the tir orthomosaic maps presented in this study given emissivity set at 1 0 the grayscale pixel brightness at a location directly specifies t rad at that location in c after being generated the uav tir orthomosaic maps were closely inspected to determine whether there were linear features present indicative of drain lines 2 3 uav survey and field site information from early may 2019 through early november 2019 four agricultural field sites in ohio u s a were visited to evaluate time of day impacts on uav tir drainage system mapping fig 4 these four sites were chosen based on prior uav tir drainage mapping success allred et al 2020 one site in ross county was visited twice during the study for each site visit a set of sunrise to sunset uav tir surveys were conducted one uav vis c survey using the s o d a camera was also carried out along with each set of uav tir surveys and as previously mentioned used specifically for improving the positional accuracy of the tir imagery the uav tir survey set from each site was given a name that corresponded to the ohio county where they were conducted hardin co morrow co ross co a ross co b and seneca co for hardin co there were five uav tir surveys seven surveys for morrow co six surveys of ross co a four surveys for ross co b and six surveys for seneca co for these five sets of uav tir site surveys table 1 provides information regarding on site location latitude and longitude date of uav tir survey set daytime period over which the uav tir surveys were carried out sunrise sunset times area of the agricultural field and approximate total area covered by the uav tir surveys includes orthomosaic map area outside of field boundaries as indicated by table 1 the sets of uav tir surveys for hardin co ross co a and ross co b were all conducted in a single day during a period from near sunrise to near sunset the sets of uav tir surveys for morrow co and seneca co were carried out over two days with respect to morrow co the uav tir surveys started in early afternoon and ended near sunset on the first day while on the second day the surveys began near sunrise and were completed in the early afternoon the seneca co uav tir surveys started in late morning and ended near sunset on the first day while on the second day the surveys began near sunrise and were completed later in the early morning consequently whenever a site was visited in this study whether over one or two days efforts were made to conduct uav tir surveys representative of different times of the day from near sunrise through near sunset soil type surface characteristics and field wetness can potentially impact uav drainage mapping allred et al 2020 table 2 provides site information regarding prior rainfall surface characteristics bare ground weeds tillage crop residue and early crop establishment and soil types photos included in fig 4 offer a representative depiction of the ground surface present during each of the five sets of uav tir surveys subsurface drainage system maps for the four sites are shown in fig 5 the morrow co subsurface drainage system map in fig 5 covers only the east side of the field and the landowner provided recollections of the drainage system in place on the west side of the field land improvement contractors generated the hardin co morrow co and ross co drainage maps while the seneca co drainage map was developed from available uav vis c imagery with the retired drainage contractor landowner confirming the map s accuracy the previously mapped drainage patterns shown in fig 5 were compared to depicted tir imagery linear features to evaluate uav tir drainage mapping success at each site 2 4 process for assessing site meteorological conditions during uav tir surveys meteorological data were needed to assess the daytime impacts of air temperature dew point temperature relative humidity and wind speed on uav tir image quality an approach was developed for estimating site meteorological conditions during the period uav tir surveys were carried out for a particular site measurements were obtained from the two closest national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national weather service nws stations that provided hourly values of air temperature dew point temperature relative humidity and wind speed national centers for environmental information 2020 measurements from the two nws stations were then averaged to better assess site meteorological conditions during the time uav tir surveys were conducted statistical analyses including pearson correlation coefficient calculation excel microsoft corp redmond washington and linear polynomial regression grapher 13 golden software llc golden colorado were employed to evaluate any relationships between site meteorological conditions and uav tir image quality 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall results research results are summarized in table 3 examples of unmanned aerial vehicle uav thermal infrared tir imagery are shown in figs 6 7 and 8 separate uav tir surveys are designated by a combination site location abbreviation capital letters and a sequence number ordered from first to last survey conducted h1 to h5 for hardin co m1 to m7 for morrow co ra1 to ra6 for ross co a rb1 to rb4 for ross co b and s1 to s6 for seneca co again uav tir survey sets at hardin co and ross co a and b were done in one day while the uav tir survey sets at morrow co and seneca co were carried out over two days entries within the first column of table 3 color coded with a gray background are indicative of uav tir surveys where a complete tir orthomosaic map could not be generated this tir orthomosaic processing issue occurred when a large number of individual tir images obtained during the survey over an area were of poor quality hazy or blurred and could not be stitched together via pix4dmapper pro the individual tir images in fig 6 provide an example of this problem the fig 6a image was obtained during the m1 uav tir survey while the fig 6b was obtained during the m4 uav tir survey the fig 6a tir image is far more defined and less blurred than the fig 6b image for the northwest portion of the morrow co uav tir survey area that these images were obtained m1 images could be stitched together but m4 images could not and therefore a complete m4 orthomosaic was unable to be produced all uav tir surveys for which a complete orthomosaic could not be generated occurred when relative humidity was equal or greater than 66 compare the first and fifth columns in table 3 subsection 3 4 provides further discussion of relative humidity impact entries within the last column of table 3 are color coded with red blue and yellow backgrounds to indicate the uav tir survey drainage pipe response red soil surface apparent radiant temperature over drain lines t rad odl is greater than the soil surface apparent radiant temperature between drain lines t rad bdl blue t rad odl is less than t rad bdl and yellow t rad odl equals t rad bdl the tir drainage pipe response with t rad odl greater than t rad bdl occurs most often in the late morning to late afternoon hours the response with t rad odl less than t rad bdl occurred either near sunrise or near sunset and an absence of response due to t rad odl equaling t rad bdl occurred in early morning at the morrow co and seneca co sites compare the second and last columns in table 3 orthomosaic examples of tir drainage pipe responses from morrow co and seneca co are presented in figs 7 and 8 the drainage pipe responses are represented by lighter shaded linear features if t rad odl is greater than t rad bdl figs 7a and 8a darker shaded linear features if t rad odl is less than t rad bdl figs 7b and 8b and no drainage pipe responses depicted if t rad odl equals t rad bdl figs 7c and 8c the more closely spaced north south oriented generally lighter shaded linear features in figs 7 and 8 are due to farm field operations harvest tillage planting etc which can often be confused with features caused by drain lines linear tir drainage pipe responses were more easily differentiated from the farm operation linear features with the uav tir surveys where t rad odl was less than t rad bdl figs 7b and 8b in the cases that t rad odl equaled t rad bdl only the lighter shaded farm field operation linear features were found figs 7c and 8c note nearly all site drain lines in the fig 5 drainage maps were located by individual uav tir surveys in which a complete orthomosaic map was generated and t rad odl t rad bdl 3 2 time of day recommendations for uav tir drainage mapping and the impact of field wetness conditions due to prior rainfall the overall results of this research project indicate that the best time of day to conduct a unmanned aerial vehicle uav thermal infrared tir survey for drainage mapping based strictly on consistency of success is late morning through late afternoon as detailed in subsection 1 3 daytime heating during this period along with spatial variations in soil surface water content cause the soil surface apparent radiant temperature over drain lines t rad odl to be greater than between drain lines t rad bdl with t rad odl greater than trad bdl drainage pipe locations are indicated by lighter shaded linear features within uav tir orthomosaic maps see figs 7a and 8a regardless of the time of day farm field operations also tend to show up usually as lighter shaded linear features on the tir orthomosaic maps accordingly the major issue with the late morning through late afternoon tir orthomosaic maps is distinguishing the lighter shaded linear features due to drain lines from those caused by farm field operations allred et al 2020 addressed this issue by developing guidelines for distinguishing tir drain line responses from tir responses due to farm field operations drain line locations were indicated by darker shaded linear features in some but not all of the orthomosaic maps generated from uav tir surveys conducted near sunrise or sunset see figs 7b and 8b these darker shaded linear feature tir responses result when t rad odl is less than t rad bdl and as described in subsection 1 3 result from factors including air temperature cooling along with soil surface water content and emissivity spatial variations one advantage of the sunrise sunset uav tir surveys in which the drain lines show up as darker shaded linear features is that these drain line responses are easily distinguished from the usually lighter shaded linear feature responses due to farm field operations it was also noticed with many of the sunrise sunset orthomosaic maps that the farm field operation tir response was suppressed again making drain line responses easier to isolate based on these findings recent loosening of u s federal aviation administration rules to allow nighttime uav surveys could benefit tir drainage mapping the major disadvantage of the sunrise sunset or nighttime uav tir surveys is that high relative humidity is during these times of the day can degrade tir image quality and thus prevent production of an orthomosaic map more discussion on relative humidity effects are provided in subsection 3 4 in site cases where the tir drain line response was a lighter shaded linear feature from late morning to late afternoon and that of a darker shaded linear feature near sunrise and or sunset it follows that there were two times of the day when a transition occurred from one tir drain line response to the other when this transition occurs there is essentially no drain line response depicted in the orthomosaic map because t rad odl equals t rad bdl see figs 7c and 8c this study indicates that the transition period when drain lines cannot be detected is most likely to happen in early morning and early evening so these times of the day should be avoided regarding uav tir drainage mapping it is unclear as to why tir drain line responses were not detected with the fall season late morning to late afternoon rb2 rb3 and rb4 uav tir surveys but it is possible the thick corn stubble ground cover present may have played a role the uav tir surveys for this investigation were carried out with at least some bare ground present partial crop residue stubble cover and based on prior rainfall amounts surface moisture conditions ranging from extremely dry to extremely wet table 2 yet at all four sites there was drainage mapping success so for overall site conditions ranging from extremely dry to extremely wet there likely existed at least subtle differences in soil surface water content over the drain lines versus between drain lines thereby allowing uav tir measurement of the soil surface apparent radiant temperature t rad spatial variations that provided determination of drain line locations allred et al 2020 found that prior rainfall and the associated field wetness condition sometimes affected uav tir drainage mapping but oftentimes did not therefore as with allred et al 2020 this study clearly shows that uav tir surveys for drainage mapping are possible under a wider range of site wetness and dryness conditions than originally envisioned thereby making this technology far more attractive due to increased flexibility for deployment 3 3 magnitude of t rad drainage pipe response the sensefly sa thermomap radiometric camera used in this study provided tir imagery spatial resolutions 16 20 cm px and a temperature resolution 0 1 c considered quite good for a uav tir camera because this was a radiometric camera t rad could be obtained for each pixel comprising an orthomosaic map generated from the imagery obtained during a uav tir survey consequently due to the characteristics of this particular camera the orthomosaic maps produced in this research allowed investigation into the magnitude of the tir t rad drainage pipe response fig 9 shows a northwest field portion of the tir orthomosaic map generated from the hardin co h5 survey conducted near sunset 20 30 21 00 on july 1 2019 lighter shaded linear features depict locations of northwest southeast trending drain lines within this field area and the tir response is due to a t rad odl greater than t rad bdl extracted soil surface t rad values from locations over drain lines t rad odl and between drain lines t rad bdl are provided in the fig 9 enlarged inset as indicated by the values displayed the t rad of the soil surface over the drain lines was just 0 2 0 5 c greater than between drain lines fig 10 shows a north central field portion of the tir orthomosaic map generated from the seneca co s4 survey conducted near sunset 20 45 21 15 on june 21 2019 darker shaded linear features depict locations of northeast southwest trending drain lines within this field area and the tir response is due to a t rad odl less than t rad bdl extracted soil surface t rad values from locations over drain lines and between drain lines are provided in the fig 10 enlarged inset as indicated by the values displayed the t rad of the soil surface over the drain lines is just 0 3 0 7 c less than between drain lines results similar to those shown in figs 9 and 10 were found with the other orthomosaic maps produced for this investigation essentially t rad odl versus t rad bdl differences were found to be less than 1 0 c consequently in order to successfully map subsurface drainage systems with uav tir imagery the tir camera employed needs to have a sufficient spatial resolution less than 30 cm px to provide precise drain line demarcation and a temperature resolution no greater than 0 1 c capable of detecting subtle t rad variations across the soil surface these findings are quite remarkable due to the implication that infrastructure buried approximately a meter beneath the ground can potentially be detected via very subtle variations in the t rad measured at the soil surface 3 4 impact of site meteorological conditions on uav tir drainage mapping meteorological conditions can potentially influence the success of uav tir drainage mapping the site meteorological conditions presented in table 3 air temperature dew point relative humidity and wind speed as previously mentioned were based at each location on average values from the two closest national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national weather service nws stations having hourly measurements national centers for environmental information 2020 the two noaa nws stations used to estimate meteorological conditions at a site were in all cases within a 30 50 km distance within a radius of 30 50 km air temperature dew point temperature relative humidity and wind speed conditions in central ohio do not tend to vary greatly the noaa nws stations measure near surface meteorological conditions while the uav tir surveys were flown at heights of 85 107 m however good correspondence is generally expected between meteorological conditions near the surface and those at heights near 100 m consequently this approach was considered reasonable for gauging site meteorological condition impacts on the uav tir surveys for a particular uav tir survey there needs to be an adequate amount of overlap between individual tir images and a sufficient number of keypoint matches between overlapping tir images to properly stitch together enough individual images over all areas of the survey to produce a complete orthomosaic map during processing with the pix4dmapper pro software an image designated as uncalibrated is one that does not have sufficient keypoint matches to allow stitching with overlapping images not having enough keypoint matches is most often the result of poor image quality where individual tir images appear blurred or hazy see fig 6 when processing a set of imagery pix4dmapper pro provides a report indicating the percent of calibrated images this study found that when the percent calibrated tir images is above 65 a complete or nearly complete orthomosaic map was generated if the percent calibrated images was less than 50 large portions or nearly all of the orthomosaic map could not be produced calculated pearson correlation coefficients between the percent calibrated images from a uav tir survey and meteorological conditions at the time of the survey provided insight on the impact of these meteorological conditions air temperature dew point relative humidity and wind speed on the ability to create the orthomosaic maps used for drainage mapping for all the uav tir surveys carried out in this investigation 28 in total the correlation coefficients between percent calibrated images and air temperature or dew point temperature were both very low r 0 14 0 4 p 0 5 and r 0 27 0 1 p 0 2 respectively these low r values and relatively large statistical significance p indicate air temperature and dew point temperature clearly did not impact the ability to produce tir orthomosaic maps for drainage mapping therefore air and dew point temperatures by themselves are not a major concern for conducting uav tir drainage mapping surveys excepting of course extremely high or low air temperatures outside the operating limits of the uav equipment employed the correlation coefficient between percent calibrated images and the relative humidity was 0 63 p 0 001 thereby indicating that high relative humidity can adversely affect to some extent the ability to obtain tir orthomosaic maps for drainage mapping fig 11 provides additional insight regarding the impact of relative humidity on the generation of tir orthomosaic maps in this research for each uav tir survey conducted the percent calibrated images is plotted against relative humidity a linear relationship between percent calibrated images and relative humidity is depicted by the red line in fig 11 and has the equation 3 ci 0 98 rh 143 19 where ci is percent calibrated images and rh is relative humidity percent eq 3 has a coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 40 a 3rd degree polynomial relationship depicted by the green line in fig 11 has the equation 4 ci 0 00047 rh 3 0 0752 rh 2 4 417 rh 184 57 equation 4 has an r2 value of 0 44 therefore a 3rd degree polynomial equation is only slightly better than a linear equation at defining the relationship between percent calibrated images and relative humidity fig 11 shows that the data points for each uav tir survey can be separated into three distinct groups group i is characterized by relative humidity less than 60 and calibrated images greater than 80 there were no data processing problems producing complete tir orthomosaic maps from the group i uav tir surveys group ii is characterized by relative humidity greater than 60 and calibrated images greater than 65 there were no group ii data processing issues generating complete or near complete tir orthomosaic maps group iii had relative humidity values greater than 60 and calibrated images less than 50 there were substantial group iii data processing problems that in all cases prevented production of complete orthomosaic maps consequently if relative humidity was less than 60 fig 11 shows that no data processing problems were encountered and complete othomosaic maps were created from imagery obtained with the uav tir surveys however when relative humidity was greater than 60 data processing issues regarding production of orthomosaic maps sometimes did occur but also sometimes did not at high relative humidity values that are less than 100 water is still able to condense on hygroscopic airborne particles ahrens 1988 this condensed atmospheric water absorbs and re emits tir radiation azosensors 2018 flir systems 2018 jenson 2007 zhang et al 2016 frequently causing uav tir images to be hazy or blurred precisionhawk 2019 high relative humidity conditions will occur throughout a rainy day potentially causing substantial orthomosaic processing difficulties such as the case for the ross co a surveys table 3 for days without rainfall the highest relative humidity found during daylight hours occurs just before sunset through just after sunrise ackerman and knox 2015 ahrens 1988 consequently there is a trade off conducting uav tir drainage mapping surveys near sunrise or sunset where sometimes high relative humidity degrades tir image quality but in other cases a distinct darker shaded linear feature tir drainage pipe response t rad odl t rad bdl is often obtained which is easily be distinguished from the lighter shaded linear feature farm field operation tir response relative humidity is lowest in the middle of the day so at this time there is less chance of tir image quality problems therefore again strictly on a consistency of success basis uav tir drainage mapping is probably best conducted from late morning through late afternoon the pearson correlation coefficient between percent calibrated images and wind speed is 0 57 0 001 p 0 005 but is misleading in the implication that better uav tir imagery is obtained at higher wind speeds in fact the opposite is true at high wind speeds and associated air turbulence longitudinal and lateral overlap between images will be decreased within portions of the survey in turn causing problems stitching some of these images together to generate a complete tir orthomosaic map near surface wind speeds measured by noaa nws stations within 10 m of the ground surface are typically highest from late morning through late afternoon dai and sesser 1999 he et al 2013 the same daytime period when relative humidity tends to be lowest therefore it is the lower relative humidity and not the corresponding higher wind speeds that have a positive impact on obtaining good quality uav tir imagery for producing complete orthomosaic maps used for drainage mapping 4 conclusions there are both economic and environmental reasons for finding viable and nondestructive means for mapping agricultural subsurface drainage systems previous studies indicate that unmanned aerial vehicle uav thermal infrared tir imagery has drainage mapping potential knowing the best times of day to conduct uav tir surveys for drainage mapping is important for the successful employment of this technology within agricultural settings in order to determine the best time of day for carrying out a uav tir drainage mapping survey a set of sunrise to sunset uav tir surveys were carried out at each of four different farm fields in ohio u s a with one of the fields visited twice the key research findings are listed as follows a even under overall surface conditions ranging from extremely dry to extremely wet uav tir surveys were able to measure small apparent radiant temperature t rad differences of less than 1 0 c between the soil surface over drain lines versus the soil surface between drain lines thereby allowing subsurface drainage pipe network patterns to be mapped b high relative humidity 60 can sometimes adversely affect uav tir image quality causing inability to produce a complete orthomosaic map that can be used for drainage mapping high relative humidity is common on rainy days and the hours near sunset through near sunrise c the best time of the day to conduct a uav tir survey for drainage mapping based strictly on consistency of success is late morning through late afternoon when relative humidity is low for uav tir surveys carried out from late morning through late afternoon drainage pipe locations are indicated by lighter shaded linear features within the orthomosaic maps generated from survey imagery these lighter shaded linear features are indicative of the soil surface t rad over the drain line being greater than between drain lines d drain line locations were indicated by darker shaded linear features in some of the orthomosaic maps generated from uav tir surveys conducted near sunrise or sunset this darker shaded linear feature tir response is caused by t rad in the soil surface over drain lines being less than the soil surface t rad between drain lines these darker shaded linear drainage pipe features are easily distinguished from lighter shaded farm field operation linear features and as a consequence sunrise sunset uav tir surveys are sometimes excellent for determining subsurface drainage network patterns however a major disadvantage to sunrise sunset uav tir surveys is the high relative humidity occurring during these times of the day which can degrade the quality of the tir images collected e for site cases during the day in which the tir drain line response changes back and forth between lighter shaded linear features and darker shaded linear features there are transition periods where no tir drain line response is observed i e t rad is the same for the soil surface over drain lines as between drain lines early morning and early evening are the times of day that these transitions are most likely to happen and should be avoided for uav tir drainage mapping consequently the results from this investigation clearly show that uav tir surveys exhibit substantial promise for use in mapping subsurface drainage systems in farm fields future research should focus on developing site condition guidelines for uav tir drainage mapping test plot experiments to better quantify ground surface tir behavior advanced image processing techniques that enhance tir drain line responses and

9923,due to economic and environmental considerations there exists a need for effective efficient and nondestructive methods for locating buried agricultural drainage pipes previous research indicates that thermal infrared tir imagery obtained with an unmanned aerial vehicle uav has potential for mapping agricultural subsurface drainage systems thereby warranting further investigation to determine the best time of day to conduct these uav tir surveys accordingly a set of sunrise to sunset uav tir surveys were carried out at four different farm field sites in ohio u s a late morning through late afternoon uav tir surveys were generally found to work well for determining drainage system patterns during late morning through late afternoon the apparent radiant temperature of the soil surface over the drain lines was higher than between the drain lines i e emitted tir radiation from the soil surface over a drain line was greater than between the drain lines conversely near sunrise or sunset the uav surveys often showed the apparent radiant temperature of the soil surface over the drain lines to be lower than between the drain lines i e less emitted tir radiation over the drain lines than between drain lines some excellent uav tir drainage mapping results were obtained near sunrise sunset due to tir drain line responses that were more easily distinguished from those of farm field operations however difficulties were occasionally encountered processing this sunrise sunset tir imagery likely due to the impact on image quality from high relative humidity during these times of the day consequently strictly on a consistency of success basis alone late morning through late afternoon are the best times for locating drainage pipes with uav tir surveys however in certain cases uav tir surveys at sunrise sunset can provide exceptional drainage pattern recognition these results provide valuable guidance for those considering uav tir drainage mapping surveys keywords agricultural subsurface drainage systems unmanned aerial vehicles uavs thermal infrared tir imagery drainage pipe mapping 1 introduction 1 1 rationale for drainage mapping research the widespread adoption of subsurface drainage practices to remove excess soil water has enabled the midwest u s a to become one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world a 1985 economic survey showed that several states within this region illinois indiana iowa ohio minnesota michigan missouri and wisconsin had by that year approximately 12 5 million ha containing subsurface drainage systems with cropland accounting for the vast majority of areas having buried drainage pipes pavelis 1987 these systems are typically comprised of 10 cm diameter older clay tile or newer corrugated plastic tubing drain line networks buried 0 6 1 3 m beneath the surface since 1985 a substantial amount of additional agricultural drainage pipe has been installed farmers within this region and other parts of the world where agricultural drainage practices are common often need to repair drain lines that are not functioning correctly or in order to increase crop yields install new drain lines between the old ones to improve soil water removal efficiency either for system repairs or efficiency improvements locations of the preexisting drain lines are required however in most cases a map of the original subsurface drainage system installation is no longer available furthermore subsurface drainage practices can release substantial amounts of nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 from farm fields into adjacent waterways sims et al 1998 zucker and brown 1998 which in turn degrades surface water bodies on local regional and national scales risk assessment of this environmental hazard from a farm field perspective calls for knowledge of the installed drainage pipe network including extent of coverage and drain line spacing distance regardless of whether the need is economic or environmental finding drain lines with a hand held tile probe is time consuming extremely tedious and if not careful can damage buried pipes fig 1a using heavy trenching equipment is generally effective but always causes considerable pipe damage requiring costly repairs fig 1b subsurface drainage system patterns can be complex fig 2 further hampering efforts to map drain lines using traditional tile probe or trenching detection methods consequently there is a crucial necessity for effective efficient and nondestructive drainage pipe mapping methods proximal soil sensing or imagery obtained with unmanned aerial vehicles uavs can potentially provide a viable means for mapping these agricultural subsurface drainage systems 1 2 prior research into nondestructive methods for mapping subsurface drainage ground penetrating radar gpr a proximal soil sensing method has proven capable in many instances of locating buried drainage pipes under a range of soil conditions allred et al 2004 2005 2018a allred and redman 2010 allred 2013 chow and rees 1989 koganti et al 2020 however gpr is somewhat inefficient for providing detailed maps of subsurface drainage systems in large farm fields both visible vis i e wavelengths within the 400 700 nm visible light portion of electromagnetic spectrum and color infrared cir comprised of green red and near infrared wavelengths airplane photography obtained outside the growing season have been tested to a limited extent for mapping subsurface drainage systems naz et al 2009 verma et al 1996 these studies noted that optimal drainage mapping field conditions exist several days after a rainfall event equal or greater than 2 5 or 5 0 cm although scheduling an airplane to obtain aerial imagery when these field conditions are present can be problematic and expensive alternatively scheduling an aerial survey with an unmanned aerial vehicle uav is far more flexible and could solve this timing availability issue but uavs have not been extensively tested for drainage pipe mapping even though some aerial vis and cir drainage pipe detection studies have been conducted there has been very little research on the use of thermal infrared tir imagery to map drainage pipes abdel hadi et al 1970 provides several excellent examples in which tir imagery detected subsurface features such as pipelines and buried stream channels thereby indicating that tir aerial surveys may have the capability for drainage pipe mapping a laboratory experiment conducted by woo et al 2019 demonstrated the potential of tir imagery for locating buried drainage pipe further implying that timing relative to rainfall can impact the success of using tir imagery for this purpose in a preliminary case study by allred et al 2018b a uav deploying a tir camera detected roughly 60 of the subsurface drainage infrastructure known to be present at an agricultural field near mount gilead ohio u s a at the same field site used by allred et al 2018b freeland et al 2019 found that pairing of real time kinematic rtk global navigation satellite system gnss technology with the uav tir survey was essential for accurately locating buried drain lines williamson et al 2019 utilized both uav multispectral ms often including separate narrow bands of blue green red red edge and near infrared wavelengths and tir imagery in a complementary approach to map random drain lines in two conservation tillage farm fields near harlan indiana u s a tlapáková et al 2017 documented success using manned aircraft and uavs with vis cir near infrared nir and tir sensors to map agricultural drainage systems in the czech republic kratt et al 2020 carried out uav surveys at two illinois farm fields four days after a small rainfall event and found visible color vis c imagery better than tir imagery at finding drainage pipe locations aerial surveys using a uav with visible color vis c ms and tir cameras were conducted by allred et al 2020 at 29 agricultural field sites in the midwest u s a and overall results showed that vis c ms and tir imagery detected at least some of the drainage pipe present at 48 59 and 69 of the sites respectively based on this past research additional investigation is certainly warranted particularly on the use of uav tir imagery for mapping subsurface drainage 1 3 potential mechanisms for time of day impacts on thermal infrared drainage mapping the soil surface directly over top of a drain line is often drier than the soil surface between drain lines this phenomenon is especially true in the days after a significant rainfall because the soil over a drain line is dewatered at a faster rate than the soil between drain lines smedema et al 2004 the diurnal cycle in solar radiation received at the ground surface in conjunction with the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of soil pore water being significantly different from that of air within the pores can result in the drier soil surface over a drain line having a different true kinetic temperature than a wetter soil surface between drain lines hillel 1980 jenson 2007 as indicated by eq 1 the stefan boltzmann and kirchhoff s laws stipulate that the tir radiation emitted from an object m r w m 2 and the apparent radiant temperature t rad k are a function of that object s true kinetic temperature t kin k and dimensionless emissivity ε jenson 2007 kuenzer and dech 2013 1 m r σ t rad 4 ε σ t kin 4 where the stefan boltzmann constant σ equals 5 6695 10 8 w m 2 k 4 soil surface emissivity is impacted by its moisture level and generally a wet soil surface will have a higher ε value than a dry soil surface jenson 2007 mira et al 2007 a tir camera can detect soil surface variations in m r i e and t rad caused by variations in t kin and or ε several studies have showed that linear soil surface features depicted in uav tir imagery which exhibited t rad i e and m r different than their surroundings often revealed the presence buried agricultural drain lines allred et al 2018b 2020 freeland et al 2019 williamson et al 2019 the diurnal t kin range is much greater for a dry soil surface than a wet soil surface again due to the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of soil pore water being significantly different from that of air within the pores hillel 1980 jackson et al 1974 jenson 2007 mengistu et al 2018 from late morning to late afternoon the t kin of a dry soil surface is typically higher than for a wet soil surface jackson et al 1974 jenson 2007 mengistu et al 2018 abdel hadi et al 1970 conducted experiments with sandy and silty clay soils and found that the emitted tir radiation for both soils was substantially greater for a dry soil surface than a wet soil surface during daylight from 12 00 18 00 therefore from late morning to late afternoon the soil surface t rad over a drain line is likely to be higher than between drain lines most research indicates that from sunset to sunrise a dry soil surface t kin will still be slightly warmer than a wet soil surface jackson et al 1974 jenson 2007 however it is possible during the time from sunset to sunrise that the emitted tir radiation from a wetter soil surface to be greater than from a drier soil surface based on the stefan boltzmann and kirchhoff s laws this phenomenon could occur due to the wetter soil surface having a higher ε value than the drier soil surface even when the wetter soil surface has a slightly lower t kin than a drier soil surface see eq 1 experiments carried out by abdel hadi et al 1970 on sandy and silty clay soils and found the m r for both soils was somewhat greater for a wet soil surface than a dry soil surface from midnight 0 00 to sunrise 6 00 therefore it is possible near sunrise or sunset for the soil surface t rad over a drain line to be less than between drain lines the reverse of what would occur between late morning to late afternoon the common convention for grayscale uav tir imagery is for features that have lower t rad to be darker shaded and features that have higher t rad to be lighter shaded during the time of day from late morning to late afternoon previous studies allred et al 2018b 2020 freeland et al 2019 williamson et al 2019 have shown the drain line response depicted in uav tir imagery to be distinct lighter shaded linear features this late morning to late afternoon tir drainage pipe mapping result is again most certainly due to drier soil over the drain line having a higher t kin than wetter soil between drain lines jackson et al 1974 jenson 2007 mengistu et al 2018 the drainage pipe response obtained by uav tir imagery in the early morning hours near sunrise and the evening hours near sunset was unclear prior to this research based on previous discussions it would seem possible during early morning and late evening that the drier soil surface over a drain line could have a t rad i e and m r greater the same or less than the surrounding soil surfaces between the drain lines if the t rad at the soil surface over the drain line is the same as the t rad between drain lines then there would be no tir drainage pipe response while a t rad over the drain line less that between drain lines would be depicted as darker shaded linear features within typical uav tir grayscale imagery further complicating matters for drainage mapping with uav tir surveys conducted in early morning and evening hours is the increased relative humidity that occurs during these times of the day ackerman and knox 2015 ahrens 1988 high relative humidity causes atmospheric absorption and re emission of tir radiation azosensors 2018 flir systems 2018 jenson 2007 zhang et al 2016 this high relative humidity atmospheric effect in turn degrades the quality of individual tir images obtained during a uav survey thereby hampering the ability to stitch these images together to produce a complete tir orthomosaic map of the farm field area precisionhawk 2019 sensefly sa 2020 recommendations are that uav tir surveys not be carried out if the relative humidity is above 60 precisionhawk 2019 or 75 sensefly sa 2020 consequently daytime variations in meteorological conditions especially relative humidity can potentially affect tir image quality and may need careful consideration when planning a uav tir drainage mapping survey 1 4 research focus scope goal and hypothesis a large knowledge gap definitely exists on time of day impacts for uav tir subsurface drainage mapping as previously indicated 1 the tir drainage pipe response may change during the day and 2 daytime variations in meteorological conditions can affect tir image quality gaining insight on the best times of day to conduct a uav tir drainage mapping survey and the times of day to avoid required sets of sunrise to sunset uav tir surveys be conducted at four different farm field sites in ohio u s a with one of the fields visited twice note when this study was conducted nighttime commercial uav flights in the u s were not allowed without authorization and could normally only be carried out between the beginning of morning civil twilight 20 30 min before sunrise and the end of evening civil twilight 20 30 min after sunset aitken et al 2017 therefore the overall project goal was to obtain data needed to provide specific guidance on the best time of day from sunrise to sunset for uav tir drainage mapping based on 1 the tir drainage pipe response and 2 meteorological conditions this project had a stated research hypothesis late morning through late afternoon are the best times to conduct uav tir mapping of subsurface drainage systems 2 materials and methods note this research used much the same equipment and data processing procedures as employed for the allred et al 2020 study consequently for the most part information on equipment and data processing provided in subsections 2 1 and 2 2 were previously reported in allred et al 2020 the restating sometimes verbatim of equipment and data processing information in subsections 2 1 and 2 2 is done solely for the purpose of enabling readers to more easily comprehend how the uav imagery for this research was obtained and analyzed without having to go through the effort of gaining access and reviewing the previously published article by allred et al 2020 2 1 uav survey equipment a sensefly sa cheseaux sur lausanne switzerland ebee plus rtk ppk fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicle uav was employed to carry out the visible color vis c and thermal infrared tir surveys for this study the equipment set up for the system is shown in fig 3a and includes the uav itself 110 cm wingspan the ground modem antenna mounted on a tripod and a computer the ebee plus uav could accommodate a payload of one camera and one battery per flight the computer had an internal cellular modem that allowed field internet access the ground modem antenna connected to the computer provided communication with the uav the sensefly sa emotion3 software installed on the computer was used to plan control uav flight patterns along with managing the data collected during each survey flight plans employed a serpentine back and forth route containing a single set of parallel lines along which uav vis c and tir imagery were obtained each uav survey parallel line set was oriented in a manner to minimize end of flight line turn arounds thereby conserving battery power during flight the uav typically achieved speeds of 37 65 km h 20 35 kn two different cameras were utilized in this study s o d a sensor optimized for drone applications and thermomap the sensefly sa s o d a camera was used to collect high resolution 20 mpx vis c color 400 700 nm wavelength photos this camera had a 28 mm focal lens the uav as configured with the s o d a camera had real time kinematic rtk global navigation satellite system gnss functionality that provided survey grade positional accuracy 0 7 cm for the vis c photos obtained utilizing rtk gnss functionality with the uav s o d a configuration required onsite internet connection with the ohio department of transportation continuously operated reference station network to create a virtual local gnss base station ohio department of transportation 2020 the uav surveys conducted with the s o d a camera were flown approximately 122 m 400 ft above the ground with a surface resolution of 2 8 cm px a lateral photo overlap of 70 between adjacent flight lines and a longitudinal photo overlap of 60 along a flight line as will be described in greater detail later in this subsection the acquired s o d a imagery was used to adjust and improve the positional accuracy of the uav tir imagery obtained with the thermomap camera the sensefly sa thermomap radiometric thermal infrared tir camera captured 0 3 mpx 640 512 px images in a wavelength range of 8 5 11 5 µm 10 µm center wavelength the radiometric thermomap camera has a 72 field of view diagonal an image capture rate of 7 5 photos per second and a temperature resolution of 0 1 c the uav as configured with the thermomap camera did not have rtk gnss functionality and positional accuracy without adjustment was approximately 4 m the uav surveys conducted with the thermomap camera were flown approximately 85 107 m 280 350 ft above the ground surface with a resolution of 16 20 cm px a lateral photo overlap of 70 and a longitudinal photo overlap of 90 altitudes for the uav tir surveys were chosen based on obtaining the highest resolution imagery possible with a flight plan completed using one fully charged uav battery the thermomap camera performs an internal radiometric temperature calibration at every mission waypoint during this process the thermomap camera closes its external shutter and an image of the uniform calibration surface on the reverse side of the shutter is captured thereby enabling dynamic correction for in air system temperature variation essentially the camera correlates its own temperature with the temperature of the back of the shutter that has a known emissivity which in turn provides all the information needed to do the radiometric calibration carried out at the end of each flight line propeller aero surry hills new south wales australia aeropoints fig 3b capable of providing their own accurate latitude longitude positions at locations where they were placed were used as cloud connected ground control points gcps to confirm positional accuracy of the uav s o d a surveys the aeropoints did not show up well on tir images so a 61 cm 24 in diameter aluminum pizza pan was placed next to each aeropoint in the field fig 3b the aluminum pizza pans show up well on both s o d a and thermomap images consequently the s o d a survey having rtk gnss survey grade functionality was used to obtain accurate positional coordinates for the pizza pans thereby allowing the pizza pans to be employed as precision gcps for the thermomap survey through geospatial adjustments based on the pizza pan gcps the positional accuracy of the thermomap imagery was much improved this georeferencing approach for uav tir imagery is detailed by freeland et al 2019 2 2 data processing of uav imagery pix4d sa prilly switzerland software pix4dmapper pro was employed for initial data processing particularly stitching together of the overlapping camera images obtained during a uav survey the end product of this stitching process was a set of vis c and tir georeferenced orthomosaic image maps of the site area over which the uav vis c and tir surveys were flown all the orthomosaic maps generated were based on the nad 83 2011 geodetic reference system orthomosaic maps were post processed using arcmap 10 2 desktop software environmental systems research institute redlands california u s a where annotations were added and the image then saved in a manageable format size further processing was accomplished using the public access gnu image manipulation program gimp 2 10 10 image editor this software allowed for adjustment and enhancement of exposure sharpness image size and resolution the vis c orthomosaic maps are a stitched color image of the site as would be seen from above with the human eye the tir orthomosaic maps were generated in grayscale with lighter shaded features representing higher apparent radiant temperature t rad values i e greater emission of thermal infrared radiation m r for tir imagery obtained with the radiometric thermomap camera pixel brightness represents an absolute temperature based on an emissivity of 1 0 pix4dmapper pro converted this absolute temperature to t rad in celsius using 2 temperature in c pixel brightness value 100 100 consequently with respect to the tir orthomosaic maps presented in this study given emissivity set at 1 0 the grayscale pixel brightness at a location directly specifies t rad at that location in c after being generated the uav tir orthomosaic maps were closely inspected to determine whether there were linear features present indicative of drain lines 2 3 uav survey and field site information from early may 2019 through early november 2019 four agricultural field sites in ohio u s a were visited to evaluate time of day impacts on uav tir drainage system mapping fig 4 these four sites were chosen based on prior uav tir drainage mapping success allred et al 2020 one site in ross county was visited twice during the study for each site visit a set of sunrise to sunset uav tir surveys were conducted one uav vis c survey using the s o d a camera was also carried out along with each set of uav tir surveys and as previously mentioned used specifically for improving the positional accuracy of the tir imagery the uav tir survey set from each site was given a name that corresponded to the ohio county where they were conducted hardin co morrow co ross co a ross co b and seneca co for hardin co there were five uav tir surveys seven surveys for morrow co six surveys of ross co a four surveys for ross co b and six surveys for seneca co for these five sets of uav tir site surveys table 1 provides information regarding on site location latitude and longitude date of uav tir survey set daytime period over which the uav tir surveys were carried out sunrise sunset times area of the agricultural field and approximate total area covered by the uav tir surveys includes orthomosaic map area outside of field boundaries as indicated by table 1 the sets of uav tir surveys for hardin co ross co a and ross co b were all conducted in a single day during a period from near sunrise to near sunset the sets of uav tir surveys for morrow co and seneca co were carried out over two days with respect to morrow co the uav tir surveys started in early afternoon and ended near sunset on the first day while on the second day the surveys began near sunrise and were completed in the early afternoon the seneca co uav tir surveys started in late morning and ended near sunset on the first day while on the second day the surveys began near sunrise and were completed later in the early morning consequently whenever a site was visited in this study whether over one or two days efforts were made to conduct uav tir surveys representative of different times of the day from near sunrise through near sunset soil type surface characteristics and field wetness can potentially impact uav drainage mapping allred et al 2020 table 2 provides site information regarding prior rainfall surface characteristics bare ground weeds tillage crop residue and early crop establishment and soil types photos included in fig 4 offer a representative depiction of the ground surface present during each of the five sets of uav tir surveys subsurface drainage system maps for the four sites are shown in fig 5 the morrow co subsurface drainage system map in fig 5 covers only the east side of the field and the landowner provided recollections of the drainage system in place on the west side of the field land improvement contractors generated the hardin co morrow co and ross co drainage maps while the seneca co drainage map was developed from available uav vis c imagery with the retired drainage contractor landowner confirming the map s accuracy the previously mapped drainage patterns shown in fig 5 were compared to depicted tir imagery linear features to evaluate uav tir drainage mapping success at each site 2 4 process for assessing site meteorological conditions during uav tir surveys meteorological data were needed to assess the daytime impacts of air temperature dew point temperature relative humidity and wind speed on uav tir image quality an approach was developed for estimating site meteorological conditions during the period uav tir surveys were carried out for a particular site measurements were obtained from the two closest national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national weather service nws stations that provided hourly values of air temperature dew point temperature relative humidity and wind speed national centers for environmental information 2020 measurements from the two nws stations were then averaged to better assess site meteorological conditions during the time uav tir surveys were conducted statistical analyses including pearson correlation coefficient calculation excel microsoft corp redmond washington and linear polynomial regression grapher 13 golden software llc golden colorado were employed to evaluate any relationships between site meteorological conditions and uav tir image quality 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall results research results are summarized in table 3 examples of unmanned aerial vehicle uav thermal infrared tir imagery are shown in figs 6 7 and 8 separate uav tir surveys are designated by a combination site location abbreviation capital letters and a sequence number ordered from first to last survey conducted h1 to h5 for hardin co m1 to m7 for morrow co ra1 to ra6 for ross co a rb1 to rb4 for ross co b and s1 to s6 for seneca co again uav tir survey sets at hardin co and ross co a and b were done in one day while the uav tir survey sets at morrow co and seneca co were carried out over two days entries within the first column of table 3 color coded with a gray background are indicative of uav tir surveys where a complete tir orthomosaic map could not be generated this tir orthomosaic processing issue occurred when a large number of individual tir images obtained during the survey over an area were of poor quality hazy or blurred and could not be stitched together via pix4dmapper pro the individual tir images in fig 6 provide an example of this problem the fig 6a image was obtained during the m1 uav tir survey while the fig 6b was obtained during the m4 uav tir survey the fig 6a tir image is far more defined and less blurred than the fig 6b image for the northwest portion of the morrow co uav tir survey area that these images were obtained m1 images could be stitched together but m4 images could not and therefore a complete m4 orthomosaic was unable to be produced all uav tir surveys for which a complete orthomosaic could not be generated occurred when relative humidity was equal or greater than 66 compare the first and fifth columns in table 3 subsection 3 4 provides further discussion of relative humidity impact entries within the last column of table 3 are color coded with red blue and yellow backgrounds to indicate the uav tir survey drainage pipe response red soil surface apparent radiant temperature over drain lines t rad odl is greater than the soil surface apparent radiant temperature between drain lines t rad bdl blue t rad odl is less than t rad bdl and yellow t rad odl equals t rad bdl the tir drainage pipe response with t rad odl greater than t rad bdl occurs most often in the late morning to late afternoon hours the response with t rad odl less than t rad bdl occurred either near sunrise or near sunset and an absence of response due to t rad odl equaling t rad bdl occurred in early morning at the morrow co and seneca co sites compare the second and last columns in table 3 orthomosaic examples of tir drainage pipe responses from morrow co and seneca co are presented in figs 7 and 8 the drainage pipe responses are represented by lighter shaded linear features if t rad odl is greater than t rad bdl figs 7a and 8a darker shaded linear features if t rad odl is less than t rad bdl figs 7b and 8b and no drainage pipe responses depicted if t rad odl equals t rad bdl figs 7c and 8c the more closely spaced north south oriented generally lighter shaded linear features in figs 7 and 8 are due to farm field operations harvest tillage planting etc which can often be confused with features caused by drain lines linear tir drainage pipe responses were more easily differentiated from the farm operation linear features with the uav tir surveys where t rad odl was less than t rad bdl figs 7b and 8b in the cases that t rad odl equaled t rad bdl only the lighter shaded farm field operation linear features were found figs 7c and 8c note nearly all site drain lines in the fig 5 drainage maps were located by individual uav tir surveys in which a complete orthomosaic map was generated and t rad odl t rad bdl 3 2 time of day recommendations for uav tir drainage mapping and the impact of field wetness conditions due to prior rainfall the overall results of this research project indicate that the best time of day to conduct a unmanned aerial vehicle uav thermal infrared tir survey for drainage mapping based strictly on consistency of success is late morning through late afternoon as detailed in subsection 1 3 daytime heating during this period along with spatial variations in soil surface water content cause the soil surface apparent radiant temperature over drain lines t rad odl to be greater than between drain lines t rad bdl with t rad odl greater than trad bdl drainage pipe locations are indicated by lighter shaded linear features within uav tir orthomosaic maps see figs 7a and 8a regardless of the time of day farm field operations also tend to show up usually as lighter shaded linear features on the tir orthomosaic maps accordingly the major issue with the late morning through late afternoon tir orthomosaic maps is distinguishing the lighter shaded linear features due to drain lines from those caused by farm field operations allred et al 2020 addressed this issue by developing guidelines for distinguishing tir drain line responses from tir responses due to farm field operations drain line locations were indicated by darker shaded linear features in some but not all of the orthomosaic maps generated from uav tir surveys conducted near sunrise or sunset see figs 7b and 8b these darker shaded linear feature tir responses result when t rad odl is less than t rad bdl and as described in subsection 1 3 result from factors including air temperature cooling along with soil surface water content and emissivity spatial variations one advantage of the sunrise sunset uav tir surveys in which the drain lines show up as darker shaded linear features is that these drain line responses are easily distinguished from the usually lighter shaded linear feature responses due to farm field operations it was also noticed with many of the sunrise sunset orthomosaic maps that the farm field operation tir response was suppressed again making drain line responses easier to isolate based on these findings recent loosening of u s federal aviation administration rules to allow nighttime uav surveys could benefit tir drainage mapping the major disadvantage of the sunrise sunset or nighttime uav tir surveys is that high relative humidity is during these times of the day can degrade tir image quality and thus prevent production of an orthomosaic map more discussion on relative humidity effects are provided in subsection 3 4 in site cases where the tir drain line response was a lighter shaded linear feature from late morning to late afternoon and that of a darker shaded linear feature near sunrise and or sunset it follows that there were two times of the day when a transition occurred from one tir drain line response to the other when this transition occurs there is essentially no drain line response depicted in the orthomosaic map because t rad odl equals t rad bdl see figs 7c and 8c this study indicates that the transition period when drain lines cannot be detected is most likely to happen in early morning and early evening so these times of the day should be avoided regarding uav tir drainage mapping it is unclear as to why tir drain line responses were not detected with the fall season late morning to late afternoon rb2 rb3 and rb4 uav tir surveys but it is possible the thick corn stubble ground cover present may have played a role the uav tir surveys for this investigation were carried out with at least some bare ground present partial crop residue stubble cover and based on prior rainfall amounts surface moisture conditions ranging from extremely dry to extremely wet table 2 yet at all four sites there was drainage mapping success so for overall site conditions ranging from extremely dry to extremely wet there likely existed at least subtle differences in soil surface water content over the drain lines versus between drain lines thereby allowing uav tir measurement of the soil surface apparent radiant temperature t rad spatial variations that provided determination of drain line locations allred et al 2020 found that prior rainfall and the associated field wetness condition sometimes affected uav tir drainage mapping but oftentimes did not therefore as with allred et al 2020 this study clearly shows that uav tir surveys for drainage mapping are possible under a wider range of site wetness and dryness conditions than originally envisioned thereby making this technology far more attractive due to increased flexibility for deployment 3 3 magnitude of t rad drainage pipe response the sensefly sa thermomap radiometric camera used in this study provided tir imagery spatial resolutions 16 20 cm px and a temperature resolution 0 1 c considered quite good for a uav tir camera because this was a radiometric camera t rad could be obtained for each pixel comprising an orthomosaic map generated from the imagery obtained during a uav tir survey consequently due to the characteristics of this particular camera the orthomosaic maps produced in this research allowed investigation into the magnitude of the tir t rad drainage pipe response fig 9 shows a northwest field portion of the tir orthomosaic map generated from the hardin co h5 survey conducted near sunset 20 30 21 00 on july 1 2019 lighter shaded linear features depict locations of northwest southeast trending drain lines within this field area and the tir response is due to a t rad odl greater than t rad bdl extracted soil surface t rad values from locations over drain lines t rad odl and between drain lines t rad bdl are provided in the fig 9 enlarged inset as indicated by the values displayed the t rad of the soil surface over the drain lines was just 0 2 0 5 c greater than between drain lines fig 10 shows a north central field portion of the tir orthomosaic map generated from the seneca co s4 survey conducted near sunset 20 45 21 15 on june 21 2019 darker shaded linear features depict locations of northeast southwest trending drain lines within this field area and the tir response is due to a t rad odl less than t rad bdl extracted soil surface t rad values from locations over drain lines and between drain lines are provided in the fig 10 enlarged inset as indicated by the values displayed the t rad of the soil surface over the drain lines is just 0 3 0 7 c less than between drain lines results similar to those shown in figs 9 and 10 were found with the other orthomosaic maps produced for this investigation essentially t rad odl versus t rad bdl differences were found to be less than 1 0 c consequently in order to successfully map subsurface drainage systems with uav tir imagery the tir camera employed needs to have a sufficient spatial resolution less than 30 cm px to provide precise drain line demarcation and a temperature resolution no greater than 0 1 c capable of detecting subtle t rad variations across the soil surface these findings are quite remarkable due to the implication that infrastructure buried approximately a meter beneath the ground can potentially be detected via very subtle variations in the t rad measured at the soil surface 3 4 impact of site meteorological conditions on uav tir drainage mapping meteorological conditions can potentially influence the success of uav tir drainage mapping the site meteorological conditions presented in table 3 air temperature dew point relative humidity and wind speed as previously mentioned were based at each location on average values from the two closest national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national weather service nws stations having hourly measurements national centers for environmental information 2020 the two noaa nws stations used to estimate meteorological conditions at a site were in all cases within a 30 50 km distance within a radius of 30 50 km air temperature dew point temperature relative humidity and wind speed conditions in central ohio do not tend to vary greatly the noaa nws stations measure near surface meteorological conditions while the uav tir surveys were flown at heights of 85 107 m however good correspondence is generally expected between meteorological conditions near the surface and those at heights near 100 m consequently this approach was considered reasonable for gauging site meteorological condition impacts on the uav tir surveys for a particular uav tir survey there needs to be an adequate amount of overlap between individual tir images and a sufficient number of keypoint matches between overlapping tir images to properly stitch together enough individual images over all areas of the survey to produce a complete orthomosaic map during processing with the pix4dmapper pro software an image designated as uncalibrated is one that does not have sufficient keypoint matches to allow stitching with overlapping images not having enough keypoint matches is most often the result of poor image quality where individual tir images appear blurred or hazy see fig 6 when processing a set of imagery pix4dmapper pro provides a report indicating the percent of calibrated images this study found that when the percent calibrated tir images is above 65 a complete or nearly complete orthomosaic map was generated if the percent calibrated images was less than 50 large portions or nearly all of the orthomosaic map could not be produced calculated pearson correlation coefficients between the percent calibrated images from a uav tir survey and meteorological conditions at the time of the survey provided insight on the impact of these meteorological conditions air temperature dew point relative humidity and wind speed on the ability to create the orthomosaic maps used for drainage mapping for all the uav tir surveys carried out in this investigation 28 in total the correlation coefficients between percent calibrated images and air temperature or dew point temperature were both very low r 0 14 0 4 p 0 5 and r 0 27 0 1 p 0 2 respectively these low r values and relatively large statistical significance p indicate air temperature and dew point temperature clearly did not impact the ability to produce tir orthomosaic maps for drainage mapping therefore air and dew point temperatures by themselves are not a major concern for conducting uav tir drainage mapping surveys excepting of course extremely high or low air temperatures outside the operating limits of the uav equipment employed the correlation coefficient between percent calibrated images and the relative humidity was 0 63 p 0 001 thereby indicating that high relative humidity can adversely affect to some extent the ability to obtain tir orthomosaic maps for drainage mapping fig 11 provides additional insight regarding the impact of relative humidity on the generation of tir orthomosaic maps in this research for each uav tir survey conducted the percent calibrated images is plotted against relative humidity a linear relationship between percent calibrated images and relative humidity is depicted by the red line in fig 11 and has the equation 3 ci 0 98 rh 143 19 where ci is percent calibrated images and rh is relative humidity percent eq 3 has a coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 40 a 3rd degree polynomial relationship depicted by the green line in fig 11 has the equation 4 ci 0 00047 rh 3 0 0752 rh 2 4 417 rh 184 57 equation 4 has an r2 value of 0 44 therefore a 3rd degree polynomial equation is only slightly better than a linear equation at defining the relationship between percent calibrated images and relative humidity fig 11 shows that the data points for each uav tir survey can be separated into three distinct groups group i is characterized by relative humidity less than 60 and calibrated images greater than 80 there were no data processing problems producing complete tir orthomosaic maps from the group i uav tir surveys group ii is characterized by relative humidity greater than 60 and calibrated images greater than 65 there were no group ii data processing issues generating complete or near complete tir orthomosaic maps group iii had relative humidity values greater than 60 and calibrated images less than 50 there were substantial group iii data processing problems that in all cases prevented production of complete orthomosaic maps consequently if relative humidity was less than 60 fig 11 shows that no data processing problems were encountered and complete othomosaic maps were created from imagery obtained with the uav tir surveys however when relative humidity was greater than 60 data processing issues regarding production of orthomosaic maps sometimes did occur but also sometimes did not at high relative humidity values that are less than 100 water is still able to condense on hygroscopic airborne particles ahrens 1988 this condensed atmospheric water absorbs and re emits tir radiation azosensors 2018 flir systems 2018 jenson 2007 zhang et al 2016 frequently causing uav tir images to be hazy or blurred precisionhawk 2019 high relative humidity conditions will occur throughout a rainy day potentially causing substantial orthomosaic processing difficulties such as the case for the ross co a surveys table 3 for days without rainfall the highest relative humidity found during daylight hours occurs just before sunset through just after sunrise ackerman and knox 2015 ahrens 1988 consequently there is a trade off conducting uav tir drainage mapping surveys near sunrise or sunset where sometimes high relative humidity degrades tir image quality but in other cases a distinct darker shaded linear feature tir drainage pipe response t rad odl t rad bdl is often obtained which is easily be distinguished from the lighter shaded linear feature farm field operation tir response relative humidity is lowest in the middle of the day so at this time there is less chance of tir image quality problems therefore again strictly on a consistency of success basis uav tir drainage mapping is probably best conducted from late morning through late afternoon the pearson correlation coefficient between percent calibrated images and wind speed is 0 57 0 001 p 0 005 but is misleading in the implication that better uav tir imagery is obtained at higher wind speeds in fact the opposite is true at high wind speeds and associated air turbulence longitudinal and lateral overlap between images will be decreased within portions of the survey in turn causing problems stitching some of these images together to generate a complete tir orthomosaic map near surface wind speeds measured by noaa nws stations within 10 m of the ground surface are typically highest from late morning through late afternoon dai and sesser 1999 he et al 2013 the same daytime period when relative humidity tends to be lowest therefore it is the lower relative humidity and not the corresponding higher wind speeds that have a positive impact on obtaining good quality uav tir imagery for producing complete orthomosaic maps used for drainage mapping 4 conclusions there are both economic and environmental reasons for finding viable and nondestructive means for mapping agricultural subsurface drainage systems previous studies indicate that unmanned aerial vehicle uav thermal infrared tir imagery has drainage mapping potential knowing the best times of day to conduct uav tir surveys for drainage mapping is important for the successful employment of this technology within agricultural settings in order to determine the best time of day for carrying out a uav tir drainage mapping survey a set of sunrise to sunset uav tir surveys were carried out at each of four different farm fields in ohio u s a with one of the fields visited twice the key research findings are listed as follows a even under overall surface conditions ranging from extremely dry to extremely wet uav tir surveys were able to measure small apparent radiant temperature t rad differences of less than 1 0 c between the soil surface over drain lines versus the soil surface between drain lines thereby allowing subsurface drainage pipe network patterns to be mapped b high relative humidity 60 can sometimes adversely affect uav tir image quality causing inability to produce a complete orthomosaic map that can be used for drainage mapping high relative humidity is common on rainy days and the hours near sunset through near sunrise c the best time of the day to conduct a uav tir survey for drainage mapping based strictly on consistency of success is late morning through late afternoon when relative humidity is low for uav tir surveys carried out from late morning through late afternoon drainage pipe locations are indicated by lighter shaded linear features within the orthomosaic maps generated from survey imagery these lighter shaded linear features are indicative of the soil surface t rad over the drain line being greater than between drain lines d drain line locations were indicated by darker shaded linear features in some of the orthomosaic maps generated from uav tir surveys conducted near sunrise or sunset this darker shaded linear feature tir response is caused by t rad in the soil surface over drain lines being less than the soil surface t rad between drain lines these darker shaded linear drainage pipe features are easily distinguished from lighter shaded farm field operation linear features and as a consequence sunrise sunset uav tir surveys are sometimes excellent for determining subsurface drainage network patterns however a major disadvantage to sunrise sunset uav tir surveys is the high relative humidity occurring during these times of the day which can degrade the quality of the tir images collected e for site cases during the day in which the tir drain line response changes back and forth between lighter shaded linear features and darker shaded linear features there are transition periods where no tir drain line response is observed i e t rad is the same for the soil surface over drain lines as between drain lines early morning and early evening are the times of day that these transitions are most likely to happen and should be avoided for uav tir drainage mapping consequently the results from this investigation clearly show that uav tir surveys exhibit substantial promise for use in mapping subsurface drainage systems in farm fields future research should focus on developing site condition guidelines for uav tir drainage mapping test plot experiments to better quantify ground surface tir behavior advanced image processing techniques that enhance tir drain line responses and

9924,plant water relation is one of the key focus of ecohydrology and it usually presents specific characteristics varying with climate species and soils based on field studies the large scale plant water relations in the pearl river basin were previously analysed and the hotspot for water and vegetation changes was identified in the cropland dominated region here we focused in this region and analysed how intensive agriculture could have modified or been affected by water resources in response to droughts pearson correlation analysis showed that the monthly vegetation change was more likely subject to energy availability while the annual change was mainly affected by precipitation and water storage this cropland area experienced fairly frequent mild droughts and the trend of a drought index spei showed a clear difference from that in the non agricultural areas particularly in growing seasons further examination showed that spei vegetation parameters and agricultural data had strong positive relationships vegetation parameters and water use varied significantly and positively with the planting structure and intensification of agricultural activities like fertilization and irrigation r 0 6 p 0 05 a positive influence of droughts on crop production was detected i e the mild droughts can promote productivity probably through firstly enhanced photosynthesis induced by enhanced solar exposure and secondly increased supplementary water supply by irrigation under drought this study strengthens our understanding of the agriculture water interactions in the humid subtropical region and has implications for agricultural water management and drought impact mitigations keywords plant water relations water storage drought agriculture intensification water food energy interactions 1 introduction vegetation is an important component of the earth surface which has a tight linkage with climate and hydrology awotwi et al 2019 yang et al 2019 the establishment and growth of vegetation is determined by various hydroclimatic variables such as temperature precipitation and soil water storage ding et al 2021 ge et al 2015 piao et al 2003 wang et al 2019a 2019b meanwhile vegetation participates in the water and energy transfer and carbon cycle processes in the soil plant atmosphere continuum which in turn provides feedbacks to hydroclimatic regimes inaotombi and sarma 2020 therefore understanding the interactions between vegetation and hydroclimate is the key to climate change impact mitigation and water resources management with the intensification of human activities including urban expansion and agricultural activities climate change has been accelerated and caused many severe problems such as droughts floods tree mortality etc adhami et al 2019 the emergence of severe droughts usually results in damage of vegetation cover reduction in soil water retention and decrease in ground net primary productivity shiru et al 2020b spinoni et al 2019 for example shiru et al 2018 reported droughts impact during crop growing seasons of nigeria jasechko and perrone 2020 reported on falling water levels in california the assessment of drought impacts and post drought vegetation recovery are big concerns of agriculture and forestry therefore it is necessary to characterize droughts and examine its relationships with vegetation and hydroclimatic conditions to better mitigate any associated losses for food and ecologic security purposes burke and brown 2010 webb et al 2015 previous studies have developed a variety of indicators to define the characteristics of droughts for instance mckee et al 1993 proposed the standardized precipitation index spi which has been applied worldwide and become the most popular index since then palmer drought severity index pdsi has been used to reveal drying characteristics of northern china in 1951 2004 ma and fu 2006 recently the relative moisture index mi and meteorological drought composite index mci have been proposed and applied in china for drought assessment for its simplicity and applicability chen et al 2018 wang et al 2021 in addition standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei has emerged as a new ideal indicator for drought and has been used for drought crop production relationships assessment and agricultural water management deng et al 2018 liu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c masupha and moeletsi 2017 shiru et al 2020a taking the advantages of both spi and pdsi spei not only considers water balance with the effect of evaporation but also has the advantages of multiple time scales and simple calculations feng and su 2019 vicente serrano et al 2010 wang et al 2015 it shows obvious advantages in drought assessment studies particularly in the growing season compared with other drought indices yao et al 2018 and can be used to analyze regional dry and wet variations under different vegetation covers araneda cabrera et al 2021 masupha and moeletsi 2017 cropland is one of the most important land cover types and agricultural activities have a mutual relationship with local micrometeorology and water resources liu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c it is reported that human activities especially agricultural activities can reduce drought by an average of 20 compared to natural changes yang et al 2020 china s agricultural water use has decreased gradually from 88 in the 1980s to 63 in the 2010s of the total annual water use and the annual decrease rate was 0 1 during 2000 2011 yan et al 2015 yet it is still the largest water user compared to other sectors agriculture has a great water saving potential through advanced irrigation techniques and optimal planting structures zhou et al 2021a 2021b which helps secure food production and make room for other water user at the same time the eco environment of the pearl river basin prb in the south china is sensitive to climate changes chen et al 2017a 2017b qiu et al 2015 and its significance in supporting the social economic development in the pearl river delta has thus initiated extensive climate hydrology and vegetation related studies including drought impact assessments dai et al 2020 in the recent decades the intensity and frequency of drought in the entire prb have been reported increasing and affected the agricultural production liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 drought is projected to be more serious in the future especially in the elevated upper reach of the basin right upstream to agricultural lands wang et al 2018 a previous study investigated the relationship between vegetation growth and hydroclimate conditions in the prb with 0 5 resolution datasets and found that the hotspot of changes in vegetation occurred in the middle reaches along a northeast southwest transect in the cropland dominated region wang et al 2020 however that study failed to zoom in to further investigate the reasons for the significant changes and its interactions with the key agricultural activities although intensification of agriculture was speculated responsible without evidence therefore taking a step further in this study we hypothesize that the outstanding changes in vegetation in the central agricultural area of prb is mainly caused by extra water supply to the crops through agricultural activities such as irrigation and planting structure adjustments in response to droughts we analyzed the relationships between vegetation parameters atmospheric and water storage changes as well as the agricultural data in the area the specific objectives are 1 to determine the decisive factors affecting the vegetation changes in the study area 2 to explore the drought characteristics using spei with different time scales and 3 to examine the connections between agriculture and drought conditions 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the pearl river ranks the second largest chinese river in terms of streamflow with a drainage area of 450 000 km2 fig 1 the climate of the pearl river basin prb is characterized as subtropical mainly influenced by the eastern asian monsoon and typhoons the long term mean annual temperature is 14 22 c and mean annual precipitation is 1200 2200 mm chen et al 2010 primarily falls as rain and concentrates in april september the elevation is as high as 2900 m in the west upland and decreases dramatically to the delta in the southeast the dominant vegetation is evergreen forest 65 3 followed by cropland 18 1 mostly in the central area in guangxi province and grassland 9 3 mostly in the west uplands in this study we focus on the central area of the prb located in the transitional region of high to low terrains in guangxi province along a northeast southwest transect this area concentrates most of the farmlands in the basin fig 1c playing an important part in food security of the entire basin in the recent two decades droughts have been found to occur frequently in the basin and affected water availability and allocation to different municipal areas and industries deng et al 2018 xu et al 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2009 agriculture sector has also been affected and additional water apart from precipitation had to be extracted to assure production and therefore assessment of the impact of water availability and drought on agriculture is of great significance 2 2 data sources and processing to evaluate the relationships between agricultural activities and water resources over the croplands we obtained hydrometeorological data and agricultural data from different sources covering 13 hydrological years from 04 2002 03 2015 table 1 evapotranspiration et reflects the water use by the cultivated lands and was obtained from three sources in this study including modis mod16a2 gldas noah and pml using et data from these sources for temporal analysis either over the entire basin or a single pixel is feasible and the average et from the three products is consistent with and can be preferable to each individual product as it can smooth the extreme values and avoid the effects of outliers total water storage anomaly twsa at 0 25 resolution was obtained from the grace mission release 6 from csr at the university of texas austin based on the mascons solution save et al 2016 gldas noah modelled total water storage was also obtained at 0 25 resolution the average of grace and gldas water storage anomaly was used in the final analysis vegetation data to infer crop growth and production in this study include normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and gross primary production gpp ndvi has been one of most widely used vegetation parameter in studies like vegetation phenology ecosystem services and its linkages with climate and land use change climate change impact assessment etc hwang et al 2018 richardson et al 2010 wang et al 2019a 2019b xiao et al 2019 it was obtained from the gimms global inventory modeling and mapping studies project which is among the most widely used vegetation datasets for vegetation studies cong et al 2013 jeong et al 2011 wang et al 2019a 2019b monthly gpp was obtained from modis mod17a2 vpm and pml running et al 2004 zhang et al 2017 for further analysis we used the mean gpp from multiple datasets to possibly reduce data uncertainty lying in any individual dataset the missing monthly data for the grace mod16 17 and pml were filled via cubic spline interpolation method gridded precipitation and air temperature data were provided by the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center tpdc which has been extensively verified by station based observation data ding and peng 2020 moreover the annual agricultural data including crop yield agricultural gdp fertilizer use and industrial crop rate in the study area were obtained from the water resources bulletin from each county and city within the study area and the statistical yearbook of guangxi province these data were used to analyse the relationships between water drought and agricultural activities the amount of irrigation water was calculated as the fertilizer application amount multiplied by the optimal water fertilizer ratio he et al 2021a 2021b liu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c all gridded data were resampled to 0 25 to match the grace data using the nearest neighbor method and then averaged or aggregated to monthly values before calculating their spatial means for temporal analysis anomalies of the above variables were calculated by subtracting the means over the same baseline period 01 2004 12 2009 to be consistent with grace data 2 3 methods to investigate the interplay between hydroclimatic variables droughts and vegetation dynamics in the cropland area we calculated the spatial means of the relevant variables and then calculated the pearson correlation coefficient r spei was chosen to evaluate drought conditions and calculated based on precipitation and temperature following eqs 1 8 the potential evapotranspiration etp was calculated using the thornthwaite algorithm thornthwaite 1948 based on temperature data and the climate level measure d was defined as the difference between p and etp the logarithmic logical probability distribution function was used to describe and normalize spei the calculation processes are described below 1 d i p i etp i 2 e t p 0 t 0 c 16 n 12 n d m 30 10 t l m 0 t 26 5 c 415 85 32 24 t 0 43 t 2 t 26 5 c where t is the monthly average temperature n is the maximum sunshine duration ndm is the number of days in a month and i is the annual thermal index obtained by summing up the monthly thermal index of 12 months in a year m is a coefficient related to i and calculated in eq 3 3 m 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 79 10 2 i 0 492 then we establish the cumulative sequence of climate and water balance at different time scales 4 d n k i 0 k 1 p n 1 e t p n 1 n k in the formula k is the time scale usually in months and n is the number of calculations log logistic probability density function fitting was used to establish data series 5 f x α β χ γ α β 1 1 χ γ α β 2 where α is a scale factor β is the shape factor γ is a parameter for origin obtained by l torque parameter estimation method therefore the cumulative probability for a given time scale is 6 f x 1 α χ γ β 1 the cumulative probability density is transformed into a standard normal distribution to obtain the corresponding time change sequence of spei 7 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 where w is a parameter as 2 ln pr pr is the probability of exceeding a certain water gain or loss 8 pr 1 f x pr 0 5 1 pr pr 0 5 other constant terms in the formula are c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 and d 3 0 001308 lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 we adopted the drought classification that spei 0 5 indicates no drought 1 spei 0 5 infers mild drought 1 5 spei 1 infers moderate drought 2 spei 1 5 infers severe drought and spei 2 infers extreme drought yao et al 2020 moreover the run theory is widely used to define the characteristics of drought events such as the intensity and duration of drought yevjevich 1967 in this study drought frequency is defined by the number of droughts that occur the mean duration is defined by the mean length of time that spei below 0 5 the average drought intensity is the weighted mean of each drought and the extreme drought intensity was the minimum spei value seen during the study period mann kendall m k non parametric test was used to analyze the trend of spei time series in the study area from 2002 to 2015 m k test method is useful in detecting the trend as well as the abrupt changes of a data sequence wang et al 2011 it has been applied in many studies to examine the variations in hydrological variables déry and wood 2005 zhang et al 2009 calculated by time series order the frontward curve uf is commonly used as mk trend change analysis to indicate the trend change of the series and whether it is significant different from the uf the backward curve ub is a statistic series calculated based on time series reversed and is often used together with uf to detect mutation additionally the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to detect the distribution of drought changing trend in different months between agricultural and non agricultural pixels within the study area the rank sum test is a nonparametric hypothesis testing method which is generally used to detect whether two data sets come from the population with the same distribution meléndez et al 2021 it does not require the two groups of data to contain the same number of elements which is suitable for the difference detection between unpaired data 3 results 3 1 cropland vegetation change and the drivers we showed in fig 2 the trends of annual anomalies of hydroclimate and vegetation variables during 04 2002 03 2015 of the cropland area it was found that the trends of the investigated variables were almost all on the rise except etp and t although only those of et ndvi and gpp were statistically significant from 2002 2004 there was a drying trend in the study area as p and tws decreased obviously after which an overall wetting trend was observed the changes of p and tws over the years were highly consistent because the change of rainfall often causes the change of total water storage alongside the increase in precipitation and water storage the temperature showed a slight decreasing trend 0 04 yr which coincided with a decrease in the potential evapotranspiration 0 42 mm yr at the same time the actual evapotranspiration in this region has increased greatly by 5 4 mm yr p 0 05 the overall interannual variations of ndvi and gpp were consistent while difference occurred in 2009 2011 the possible reason apart from data accuracy is the hysteresis effect that the impact time of drought on vegetation greenness accumulation and biomass accumulation was different zhao et al 2020 leading to inconsistent changes in some years it can be seen in fig 3 that all the variables presented distinct seasonal variations in the multi year mean monthly series and the peaks were concentrated in the summer months precipitation and water storage showed an obvious hysteretic relationship that tws anomaly peaked 88 68 mm month in august around 2 months later than precipitation anomaly 201 50 mm month in june in terms of atmospheric conditions etp anomaly dynamics and the maximum value 159 46 mm month in august synchronized well with temperature 7 24 c in july the range of actual et anomaly change 40 25 to 42 06 mm month was much smaller than that of the potential et 132 13 to 159 46 mm month as to vegetation parameters gpp peaked earlier 85 58 gc m2 in july and had more distinct seasonality than ndvi 0 15 in october gpp varied more closely with t and etp than ndvi ahead of the chage in ndvi putting aside the underlying gpp algorithms pei et al 2020 it may indicate that gpp responded faster to water and atmospheric changes than ndvi to understand the influence of hydroclimatic changes on vegetation the pearson correlation coefficients r were calculated and given in fig 4 at the annual scale the correlation coefficient between ndvi gpp and water condition p tws was on average higher than that of the atmospheric condition etp t therefore the annual vegetation change was mainly affected by precipitation and water storage i e the water supply controls the relatively long term change in vegetation despite the low correlation coefficient between annual vegetation parameters and etp the correlation coefficient between vegetation parameters and actual et was high r 0 85 p 0 05 indicating a positive interlinkage between vegetation growth and actual water consumption in this area it was observed that ndvi was more strongly associated with hydrologic components compared to gpp at the annual scale while the pattern reversed at the monthly scale this reflects that the two vegetation parameters have some intrinsic differences in deferent time scale to infer vegetation phenological changes 3 2 drought characteristics and trend analysis although the annual rainfall is relative abundant in the pearl river basin the spatial and temporal unevenness together with the high evapotranspiration makes drought occurrences possible deng et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 2009 we analyzed the drought evolution characteristics over the study area using spei under different time scales the gridded precipitation and potential et were averaged over the cropland areas and the drought index at the monthly spei 1 seasonal spei 3 and annual spei 12 scales were calculated in fig 5 spei presented seasonal characteristics indicating that these areas experienced frequent alternations between dry and wet episodes the drought events spei 0 5 counted 35 times at the monthly scale and 19 times the seasonal scale during study period most of which were mild droughts 1 spei 0 5 and only a limited number of events were moderate 1 5 spei 1 to severe 2 spei 1 5 in table 2 we calculated drought frequency the average duration of drought events the average drought intensity and the extreme drought intensity at various time scales it shows that with the increase of time scales the fluctuation of spei decreased significantly and the duration of drought increased extreme drought was alleviated while the average drought intensity generally remained the same furthermore the m k statistics was carried out on spei 1 spei 3 and spei 12 sequences of all agricultural pixels in the study area and the results were shown in fig 6 from 06 2003 12 2014 the spei 1 and spei 3 uf curves were below zero which indicates a decreasing trend of the drought index or in other words the drought condition worsened during this period in comparison the uf curves of spei 12 were consistently below zero during the whole period and it exceeded the lower 0 05 significant level from 2003 to 2014 which indicates that drought situation deteriorated continuously at the annual scale during the study period through the analysis of the intersection point of uf and ub curves the mutation in spei 1 and spei 3 occurred between 2013 and 2014 while the mutation in spei 12 occurred between late 2014 and early 2015 which defines a change point in the trend of aridification the average spei 1 in the study area was 0 049 during 04 2002 03 2013 0 343 lower than that during 04 2013 03 2015 meanwhile the average spei 3 was 0 082 during 04 2002 03 2013 about 0 521 lower than that during 04 2013 03 2015 this indicates that drought was obviously alleviated after the mutation point after 2015 the uf curve of spei 1 and spei 3 was above zero but did not reach the upper 0 05 significant level which infers humidification after the mutation point at monthly and seasonal scales though the humidification of the study area was not significant to further compare the difference in drought occurrences on agricultural and non agricultural lands we calculated the linear trends of spei 1 for each calendar month during the 13 hydrologic years fig 7a b we observed that the trends presented seasonal fluctuations regardless of land use types as shown in fig 7a the spei trends on agricultural area rose dramatically from march until june by 0 916 0 524 1 107 0 728 on average respectively this corresponded to the start and evolution of the rainy season in the area which may be the main reason for the wetting in the monsoon season in july through september when the monsoon season precipitation was concentrated spei declined largely 0 542 1 178 and 0 376 respectively due to the increased precipitation and temperatures spei trend turned to be positive again in october 0 905 right after the rainy season and then became negative again in november december january february by 0 289 0 203 0 311 0 533 respectively to sum up summer and winter droughts dominated in the study area at the monthly scale comparison between the variability in the monthly spei trends in agricultural and non agricultural areas fig 7c indicated that droughts were mitigated by agricultural activities we used the wilcoxon rank sum test method to assess the difference in the spei trend in each month between two land cover groups and p values were given in fig 7d the trend of spei in the agricultural areas was smaller than that in the non agricultural areas in april june july september and october among those months statistically significant difference existed in april june and july it is worth noting that the period with both the alleviated droughts and significant differences between two land cover groups coincidently lay within the main growing season in the general concept in the study area we can therefore roughly speculate that the water demand by crops increases during the growing season and when drought occurs it can be largely artificially eased over the croplands through agricultural activities 3 3 interconnections between agriculture and droughts the monthly values of gpp ndvi and spei had obvious periodic changes fig 8 specifically the impact of the changes in spei will be manifested in gpp in about 2 months compared to 4 months later in ndvi table 3 with the significance p value 0 05 for both we observed a time lag between monthly ndvi and gpp series although theoretically they should change synchronically as they both reflect vegetation phenological evolution processes this lag is believed to root in the gpp algorithms pei et al 2020 that is gpp is calculated as a function of atmospheric variables including temperature vapor pressure deficit and photosynthetically active radiation hence because of the well known asynchrony in the atmospheric variables and ndvi piao et al 2006 and fig 3 the gpp and ndvi have some inconsistency in time inevitably which led to different variation patterns of ndvi and gpp with hydroclimate conditions the inconsistency of ndvi and gpp also explains why the lag time between gpp and hydroclimate was shorter than that between ndvi and hydroclimate annual crop data including the agricultural gdp crop yield fertilizer usage representing agriculture intensity and industrial crop area ratio representing planting structure were obtained from the year books of the bureau of statistics of guangxi province and the pearson correlation analysis was applied to assess the interactions between agricultural activities and the vegetation and hydroclimate changes fig 9 shows that agricultural gdp in this region has increased greatly by 8 25 billion per year crop yield increased by 3 93 million tons yr fertilizer application increased by 4 71 tons yr industrial crop rate increased by 0 004 yr the correlation coefficient was higher than 0 7 between ndvi gpp and et and crop yield and it was higher than 0 6 between ndvi gpp et and agricultural output value all of them passed the significance test with p 0 05 supporting that pursuing great crop yield and agricultural product value has stimulated a strong response of the changes in ndvi gpp and water consumption moreover the fertilizer usage amount and ratio of industrial crop area to the total sown area were closely related to ndvi gpp and et implying that vegetation parameters and water consumption have strongly responded to the changes of planting structure and the intensification of agriculture in comparison p and tws were not highly correlated with the examined agricultural data based on the studies of optimal ratio of irrigation to fertilizer usage the effective utilization of irrigation water is considered to increase annually with the fertilizer application he et al 2021 liu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c thus our results in fig 9c may suggest that irrigation exerted a greater impact on annual agricultural productions than natural precipitation and water reserves spei was overall well correlated with agricultural activity data at the annual scale reflecting a positive feedback from drought conditions to agroecosystems 4 discussion 4 1 interactions between agriculture and drought conditions vegetation growth is affected by both water and atmospheric conditions in addition to plant physiological features wang et al 2016 the study area is characterized as monsoon climate where rainfall and high temperature seasons are highly synchronized qian and zhu 2001 which may have the chance to reduce water supply below the critical threshold and results in a decrease in tws during the rainy season mccabe and wolock 2011 additionally the changes of tws over the years are highly linked with p because rainfall is the major source of soil water storage in this subtropical humid area brocca et al 2010 ojha et al 2014 the high values of two commonly used parameters for vegetation change detection gpp and ndvi were distributed in summer and autumn and the low values were in spring and winter consistent with p and tws dynamics overall similar results have been reported elsewhere including the prb guan et al 2015 krause et al 2014 zhou et al 2021a 2021b zhu et al 2018 regarding the response of vegetation to atmospheric changes we used temperature potential and actual et for examination at the annual scale the temperature showed a slight downward trend leading to a decrease in etp in the region cuo et al 2013 however the actual et in this region has increased significantly i e the actual water consumption in the cultivated area has increased this can be a result of increased vegetation coverage or change of crops types which would change relative humidity chattopadhyay and hulme 1997 or rising water resource accessed by plant roots based on fig 2 9 it is most likely a result of the two aspects a previous study in the prb found that the vegetation changes were more profound in the central agricultural region than other areas in the basin wang et al 2020 which originally motivated this study to further investigate what may cause this phenomenon we hypothesized that the agricultural activities have been intensified in this region even under frequent drought conditions in these years due to national and provincial policy reasons the planting area decreased before 2008 and increased slowly thereafter and the correlation between planting area and ndvi and gpp was relatively low since small variation in the sown area do not explain the significant increase in crop yields the increase in the total yields should be mainly attributable to higher productivity per unit area oweis and hachum 2009 fan and pardey 1997 reported that the increase in crop yields can be explained by many factor such as land labor fertilizer and irrigable area we found that fertilizer application was closely related to ndvi and gpp that is the increase in total planting area has increased the demand for fertilizers and water toward an increased crop production meanwhile denser crops could increase the ndvi value produce higher gpp and lead to higher water use amount over this cropland area ndvi and gpp were well correlated with p and tws but better correlated with et fig 4 the increase of vegetation cover usually boosts transpiration enhances rainfall interception and the extended vegetation rooting systems can also increase soil water uptake wu et al 2020 all these changes will increase the actual water consumption yang et al 2014 in contrast p and tws were not significantly correlated with local agricultural data the possible reasons include that the structure of farming represented by industrial crop ratio in fig 9 has been largely changed and irrigation water use efficiency has been increased due to advanced technology to ensure food security and eliminate the gap between food production and demand he et al 2021 he et al 2021 which is likely to increase due to urbanization climate change and other factors haddad et al 2011 yan et al 2015 other studies have found that the trend of crop production is decoupled from that of meteorological drought mondol et al 2021 to illustrate the drought impact on agriculture the difference in the trend of spei change between argicultural area and non agricultural area was evaluated which show that the trend of wetting is more obvious in the growing period of agricultural areas while it is the opposite beyond growing period at the month scale the increase of vegetation greenness and biomass production is often accompanied by the water consumption required by the plant growth and soil ground water supply is deteriorated with drought persistence but supplemented by additional water supply through irrigation in this circumstance it is possible that some extra water supply to crops has mitigated the drought impacts on crop vegetation development during the growing seasons and improved the water and light use efficiency to enhance production dai et al 2008 yang et al 2010 severe droughts can often cause irreversible damage or even mortality to crops farhangfar et al 2015 wilcox et al 2020 xu et al 2019a 2019b when there is no additional water availability other than a limited amount of rainfall in contrast our results suggest that frequent mild droughts can promote crop greenness and productivity in the relatively water abundant subtropical area due mainly to the improved light exposure conditions between frequent rainfall events wang et al 2017 agricultural yield is limited by light and water conditions zuo et al 2021 the prb has sufficient rainfall concentrated in the growing seasons limiting the available radiation to crops chen et al 2017a 2017b dai et al 2020 the high evaporation between rainfall events associated with mild droughts means that light conditions are relatively fair and farmers spontaneously increase irrigation during such a sustained period of clear weather boosting agricultural output the relationship between spei and agricultural data confirmed a positive feedback from droughts to agroecosystems which is probably realized by firstly enhanced photosynthesis induced by increased solar radiation he et al 2013 and secondly increased water supply by irrigation in response to drought barriopedro et al 2012 haddad et al 2011 4 2 limitations the main uncertainty in this study lies in the data we acquired during the study period which is influenced by the interpolation of inadequate observation stations in the study area secondly the spatial accuracy of remote sensing data cannot be ascertained and there are often multiple land use types at the same 0 25 pixel but the minor ones were weighted out during resampling subsequent studies may consider corrections for elevation factors to further improve the data accuracy to eliminate the influence gao et al 2012 other uncertainty may lie in the remote sensing vegetation parameters ndvi and gpp over humid subtropical regions because of the cloud contamination nonetheless the products applied here represent the most widely used ones in vegetation climate hydrology studies and the quantification of data accuracy across different climate zones should be determined but is not the focus of this study in the process of analysis in addition to the influence of water conditions on vegetation the influence of atmospheric conditions on vegetation is attributed to temperature outweighing other factors which may also lead to deviation of the contribution analysis to vegetation change besides uncertainty of anthropogenic influence parameterization will lead to bias in the relationship between vegetation and droughts eisner 2014 liu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c but can only be limited to the currently available agricultural data analysis while the agricultural data maybe not always accurately represent the multifaceted human behaviors in agricultural activities that may affect local water conditions and respond to drought occurrences we also have difficulty in untangling the influence and determining the dominant and decisive role of the nominated agricultural activities however based on the analysis we still clearly see the linkages between water resources availability agriculture intensification and agroecosystem changes and can identify the general positive or negative feedbacks between them at different temporal scales 5 conclusions this study investigated the vegetation water atmosphere interactions over an agricultural area in a humid subtropical river basin and revealed the reasons why vegetation changes are more profound in the cropland areas results show that et ndvi and gpp increased significantly which indicates that the enhanced crop productivity is accompanied by an increased water use the annual vegetation change was more strongly controlled by water supply than atmospheric conditions and the monthly relationships reversed the study area experienced frequent mild to moderate droughts and spei well represented the drought occurrences comparison of the linear trends of spei in each calendar month over the 13 hydrologic years proved significant difference of drought situation between agricultural and non agricultural areas especially in growing seasons further analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between drought index vegetation parameters and agricultural data inferring positive impacts of such droughts on agriculture the underlying mechanisms can be that photosynthetic processes are enhanced due to enhanced solar exposure during extended rain free periods and improved water supply by irrigation in response to droughts the results are informative regarding food security and mitigation of the climate change impacts on agriculture water relations declaration of competing interest the

9924,plant water relation is one of the key focus of ecohydrology and it usually presents specific characteristics varying with climate species and soils based on field studies the large scale plant water relations in the pearl river basin were previously analysed and the hotspot for water and vegetation changes was identified in the cropland dominated region here we focused in this region and analysed how intensive agriculture could have modified or been affected by water resources in response to droughts pearson correlation analysis showed that the monthly vegetation change was more likely subject to energy availability while the annual change was mainly affected by precipitation and water storage this cropland area experienced fairly frequent mild droughts and the trend of a drought index spei showed a clear difference from that in the non agricultural areas particularly in growing seasons further examination showed that spei vegetation parameters and agricultural data had strong positive relationships vegetation parameters and water use varied significantly and positively with the planting structure and intensification of agricultural activities like fertilization and irrigation r 0 6 p 0 05 a positive influence of droughts on crop production was detected i e the mild droughts can promote productivity probably through firstly enhanced photosynthesis induced by enhanced solar exposure and secondly increased supplementary water supply by irrigation under drought this study strengthens our understanding of the agriculture water interactions in the humid subtropical region and has implications for agricultural water management and drought impact mitigations keywords plant water relations water storage drought agriculture intensification water food energy interactions 1 introduction vegetation is an important component of the earth surface which has a tight linkage with climate and hydrology awotwi et al 2019 yang et al 2019 the establishment and growth of vegetation is determined by various hydroclimatic variables such as temperature precipitation and soil water storage ding et al 2021 ge et al 2015 piao et al 2003 wang et al 2019a 2019b meanwhile vegetation participates in the water and energy transfer and carbon cycle processes in the soil plant atmosphere continuum which in turn provides feedbacks to hydroclimatic regimes inaotombi and sarma 2020 therefore understanding the interactions between vegetation and hydroclimate is the key to climate change impact mitigation and water resources management with the intensification of human activities including urban expansion and agricultural activities climate change has been accelerated and caused many severe problems such as droughts floods tree mortality etc adhami et al 2019 the emergence of severe droughts usually results in damage of vegetation cover reduction in soil water retention and decrease in ground net primary productivity shiru et al 2020b spinoni et al 2019 for example shiru et al 2018 reported droughts impact during crop growing seasons of nigeria jasechko and perrone 2020 reported on falling water levels in california the assessment of drought impacts and post drought vegetation recovery are big concerns of agriculture and forestry therefore it is necessary to characterize droughts and examine its relationships with vegetation and hydroclimatic conditions to better mitigate any associated losses for food and ecologic security purposes burke and brown 2010 webb et al 2015 previous studies have developed a variety of indicators to define the characteristics of droughts for instance mckee et al 1993 proposed the standardized precipitation index spi which has been applied worldwide and become the most popular index since then palmer drought severity index pdsi has been used to reveal drying characteristics of northern china in 1951 2004 ma and fu 2006 recently the relative moisture index mi and meteorological drought composite index mci have been proposed and applied in china for drought assessment for its simplicity and applicability chen et al 2018 wang et al 2021 in addition standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei has emerged as a new ideal indicator for drought and has been used for drought crop production relationships assessment and agricultural water management deng et al 2018 liu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c masupha and moeletsi 2017 shiru et al 2020a taking the advantages of both spi and pdsi spei not only considers water balance with the effect of evaporation but also has the advantages of multiple time scales and simple calculations feng and su 2019 vicente serrano et al 2010 wang et al 2015 it shows obvious advantages in drought assessment studies particularly in the growing season compared with other drought indices yao et al 2018 and can be used to analyze regional dry and wet variations under different vegetation covers araneda cabrera et al 2021 masupha and moeletsi 2017 cropland is one of the most important land cover types and agricultural activities have a mutual relationship with local micrometeorology and water resources liu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c it is reported that human activities especially agricultural activities can reduce drought by an average of 20 compared to natural changes yang et al 2020 china s agricultural water use has decreased gradually from 88 in the 1980s to 63 in the 2010s of the total annual water use and the annual decrease rate was 0 1 during 2000 2011 yan et al 2015 yet it is still the largest water user compared to other sectors agriculture has a great water saving potential through advanced irrigation techniques and optimal planting structures zhou et al 2021a 2021b which helps secure food production and make room for other water user at the same time the eco environment of the pearl river basin prb in the south china is sensitive to climate changes chen et al 2017a 2017b qiu et al 2015 and its significance in supporting the social economic development in the pearl river delta has thus initiated extensive climate hydrology and vegetation related studies including drought impact assessments dai et al 2020 in the recent decades the intensity and frequency of drought in the entire prb have been reported increasing and affected the agricultural production liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 drought is projected to be more serious in the future especially in the elevated upper reach of the basin right upstream to agricultural lands wang et al 2018 a previous study investigated the relationship between vegetation growth and hydroclimate conditions in the prb with 0 5 resolution datasets and found that the hotspot of changes in vegetation occurred in the middle reaches along a northeast southwest transect in the cropland dominated region wang et al 2020 however that study failed to zoom in to further investigate the reasons for the significant changes and its interactions with the key agricultural activities although intensification of agriculture was speculated responsible without evidence therefore taking a step further in this study we hypothesize that the outstanding changes in vegetation in the central agricultural area of prb is mainly caused by extra water supply to the crops through agricultural activities such as irrigation and planting structure adjustments in response to droughts we analyzed the relationships between vegetation parameters atmospheric and water storage changes as well as the agricultural data in the area the specific objectives are 1 to determine the decisive factors affecting the vegetation changes in the study area 2 to explore the drought characteristics using spei with different time scales and 3 to examine the connections between agriculture and drought conditions 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the pearl river ranks the second largest chinese river in terms of streamflow with a drainage area of 450 000 km2 fig 1 the climate of the pearl river basin prb is characterized as subtropical mainly influenced by the eastern asian monsoon and typhoons the long term mean annual temperature is 14 22 c and mean annual precipitation is 1200 2200 mm chen et al 2010 primarily falls as rain and concentrates in april september the elevation is as high as 2900 m in the west upland and decreases dramatically to the delta in the southeast the dominant vegetation is evergreen forest 65 3 followed by cropland 18 1 mostly in the central area in guangxi province and grassland 9 3 mostly in the west uplands in this study we focus on the central area of the prb located in the transitional region of high to low terrains in guangxi province along a northeast southwest transect this area concentrates most of the farmlands in the basin fig 1c playing an important part in food security of the entire basin in the recent two decades droughts have been found to occur frequently in the basin and affected water availability and allocation to different municipal areas and industries deng et al 2018 xu et al 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2009 agriculture sector has also been affected and additional water apart from precipitation had to be extracted to assure production and therefore assessment of the impact of water availability and drought on agriculture is of great significance 2 2 data sources and processing to evaluate the relationships between agricultural activities and water resources over the croplands we obtained hydrometeorological data and agricultural data from different sources covering 13 hydrological years from 04 2002 03 2015 table 1 evapotranspiration et reflects the water use by the cultivated lands and was obtained from three sources in this study including modis mod16a2 gldas noah and pml using et data from these sources for temporal analysis either over the entire basin or a single pixel is feasible and the average et from the three products is consistent with and can be preferable to each individual product as it can smooth the extreme values and avoid the effects of outliers total water storage anomaly twsa at 0 25 resolution was obtained from the grace mission release 6 from csr at the university of texas austin based on the mascons solution save et al 2016 gldas noah modelled total water storage was also obtained at 0 25 resolution the average of grace and gldas water storage anomaly was used in the final analysis vegetation data to infer crop growth and production in this study include normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and gross primary production gpp ndvi has been one of most widely used vegetation parameter in studies like vegetation phenology ecosystem services and its linkages with climate and land use change climate change impact assessment etc hwang et al 2018 richardson et al 2010 wang et al 2019a 2019b xiao et al 2019 it was obtained from the gimms global inventory modeling and mapping studies project which is among the most widely used vegetation datasets for vegetation studies cong et al 2013 jeong et al 2011 wang et al 2019a 2019b monthly gpp was obtained from modis mod17a2 vpm and pml running et al 2004 zhang et al 2017 for further analysis we used the mean gpp from multiple datasets to possibly reduce data uncertainty lying in any individual dataset the missing monthly data for the grace mod16 17 and pml were filled via cubic spline interpolation method gridded precipitation and air temperature data were provided by the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center tpdc which has been extensively verified by station based observation data ding and peng 2020 moreover the annual agricultural data including crop yield agricultural gdp fertilizer use and industrial crop rate in the study area were obtained from the water resources bulletin from each county and city within the study area and the statistical yearbook of guangxi province these data were used to analyse the relationships between water drought and agricultural activities the amount of irrigation water was calculated as the fertilizer application amount multiplied by the optimal water fertilizer ratio he et al 2021a 2021b liu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c all gridded data were resampled to 0 25 to match the grace data using the nearest neighbor method and then averaged or aggregated to monthly values before calculating their spatial means for temporal analysis anomalies of the above variables were calculated by subtracting the means over the same baseline period 01 2004 12 2009 to be consistent with grace data 2 3 methods to investigate the interplay between hydroclimatic variables droughts and vegetation dynamics in the cropland area we calculated the spatial means of the relevant variables and then calculated the pearson correlation coefficient r spei was chosen to evaluate drought conditions and calculated based on precipitation and temperature following eqs 1 8 the potential evapotranspiration etp was calculated using the thornthwaite algorithm thornthwaite 1948 based on temperature data and the climate level measure d was defined as the difference between p and etp the logarithmic logical probability distribution function was used to describe and normalize spei the calculation processes are described below 1 d i p i etp i 2 e t p 0 t 0 c 16 n 12 n d m 30 10 t l m 0 t 26 5 c 415 85 32 24 t 0 43 t 2 t 26 5 c where t is the monthly average temperature n is the maximum sunshine duration ndm is the number of days in a month and i is the annual thermal index obtained by summing up the monthly thermal index of 12 months in a year m is a coefficient related to i and calculated in eq 3 3 m 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 79 10 2 i 0 492 then we establish the cumulative sequence of climate and water balance at different time scales 4 d n k i 0 k 1 p n 1 e t p n 1 n k in the formula k is the time scale usually in months and n is the number of calculations log logistic probability density function fitting was used to establish data series 5 f x α β χ γ α β 1 1 χ γ α β 2 where α is a scale factor β is the shape factor γ is a parameter for origin obtained by l torque parameter estimation method therefore the cumulative probability for a given time scale is 6 f x 1 α χ γ β 1 the cumulative probability density is transformed into a standard normal distribution to obtain the corresponding time change sequence of spei 7 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 where w is a parameter as 2 ln pr pr is the probability of exceeding a certain water gain or loss 8 pr 1 f x pr 0 5 1 pr pr 0 5 other constant terms in the formula are c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 and d 3 0 001308 lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 we adopted the drought classification that spei 0 5 indicates no drought 1 spei 0 5 infers mild drought 1 5 spei 1 infers moderate drought 2 spei 1 5 infers severe drought and spei 2 infers extreme drought yao et al 2020 moreover the run theory is widely used to define the characteristics of drought events such as the intensity and duration of drought yevjevich 1967 in this study drought frequency is defined by the number of droughts that occur the mean duration is defined by the mean length of time that spei below 0 5 the average drought intensity is the weighted mean of each drought and the extreme drought intensity was the minimum spei value seen during the study period mann kendall m k non parametric test was used to analyze the trend of spei time series in the study area from 2002 to 2015 m k test method is useful in detecting the trend as well as the abrupt changes of a data sequence wang et al 2011 it has been applied in many studies to examine the variations in hydrological variables déry and wood 2005 zhang et al 2009 calculated by time series order the frontward curve uf is commonly used as mk trend change analysis to indicate the trend change of the series and whether it is significant different from the uf the backward curve ub is a statistic series calculated based on time series reversed and is often used together with uf to detect mutation additionally the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to detect the distribution of drought changing trend in different months between agricultural and non agricultural pixels within the study area the rank sum test is a nonparametric hypothesis testing method which is generally used to detect whether two data sets come from the population with the same distribution meléndez et al 2021 it does not require the two groups of data to contain the same number of elements which is suitable for the difference detection between unpaired data 3 results 3 1 cropland vegetation change and the drivers we showed in fig 2 the trends of annual anomalies of hydroclimate and vegetation variables during 04 2002 03 2015 of the cropland area it was found that the trends of the investigated variables were almost all on the rise except etp and t although only those of et ndvi and gpp were statistically significant from 2002 2004 there was a drying trend in the study area as p and tws decreased obviously after which an overall wetting trend was observed the changes of p and tws over the years were highly consistent because the change of rainfall often causes the change of total water storage alongside the increase in precipitation and water storage the temperature showed a slight decreasing trend 0 04 yr which coincided with a decrease in the potential evapotranspiration 0 42 mm yr at the same time the actual evapotranspiration in this region has increased greatly by 5 4 mm yr p 0 05 the overall interannual variations of ndvi and gpp were consistent while difference occurred in 2009 2011 the possible reason apart from data accuracy is the hysteresis effect that the impact time of drought on vegetation greenness accumulation and biomass accumulation was different zhao et al 2020 leading to inconsistent changes in some years it can be seen in fig 3 that all the variables presented distinct seasonal variations in the multi year mean monthly series and the peaks were concentrated in the summer months precipitation and water storage showed an obvious hysteretic relationship that tws anomaly peaked 88 68 mm month in august around 2 months later than precipitation anomaly 201 50 mm month in june in terms of atmospheric conditions etp anomaly dynamics and the maximum value 159 46 mm month in august synchronized well with temperature 7 24 c in july the range of actual et anomaly change 40 25 to 42 06 mm month was much smaller than that of the potential et 132 13 to 159 46 mm month as to vegetation parameters gpp peaked earlier 85 58 gc m2 in july and had more distinct seasonality than ndvi 0 15 in october gpp varied more closely with t and etp than ndvi ahead of the chage in ndvi putting aside the underlying gpp algorithms pei et al 2020 it may indicate that gpp responded faster to water and atmospheric changes than ndvi to understand the influence of hydroclimatic changes on vegetation the pearson correlation coefficients r were calculated and given in fig 4 at the annual scale the correlation coefficient between ndvi gpp and water condition p tws was on average higher than that of the atmospheric condition etp t therefore the annual vegetation change was mainly affected by precipitation and water storage i e the water supply controls the relatively long term change in vegetation despite the low correlation coefficient between annual vegetation parameters and etp the correlation coefficient between vegetation parameters and actual et was high r 0 85 p 0 05 indicating a positive interlinkage between vegetation growth and actual water consumption in this area it was observed that ndvi was more strongly associated with hydrologic components compared to gpp at the annual scale while the pattern reversed at the monthly scale this reflects that the two vegetation parameters have some intrinsic differences in deferent time scale to infer vegetation phenological changes 3 2 drought characteristics and trend analysis although the annual rainfall is relative abundant in the pearl river basin the spatial and temporal unevenness together with the high evapotranspiration makes drought occurrences possible deng et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 2009 we analyzed the drought evolution characteristics over the study area using spei under different time scales the gridded precipitation and potential et were averaged over the cropland areas and the drought index at the monthly spei 1 seasonal spei 3 and annual spei 12 scales were calculated in fig 5 spei presented seasonal characteristics indicating that these areas experienced frequent alternations between dry and wet episodes the drought events spei 0 5 counted 35 times at the monthly scale and 19 times the seasonal scale during study period most of which were mild droughts 1 spei 0 5 and only a limited number of events were moderate 1 5 spei 1 to severe 2 spei 1 5 in table 2 we calculated drought frequency the average duration of drought events the average drought intensity and the extreme drought intensity at various time scales it shows that with the increase of time scales the fluctuation of spei decreased significantly and the duration of drought increased extreme drought was alleviated while the average drought intensity generally remained the same furthermore the m k statistics was carried out on spei 1 spei 3 and spei 12 sequences of all agricultural pixels in the study area and the results were shown in fig 6 from 06 2003 12 2014 the spei 1 and spei 3 uf curves were below zero which indicates a decreasing trend of the drought index or in other words the drought condition worsened during this period in comparison the uf curves of spei 12 were consistently below zero during the whole period and it exceeded the lower 0 05 significant level from 2003 to 2014 which indicates that drought situation deteriorated continuously at the annual scale during the study period through the analysis of the intersection point of uf and ub curves the mutation in spei 1 and spei 3 occurred between 2013 and 2014 while the mutation in spei 12 occurred between late 2014 and early 2015 which defines a change point in the trend of aridification the average spei 1 in the study area was 0 049 during 04 2002 03 2013 0 343 lower than that during 04 2013 03 2015 meanwhile the average spei 3 was 0 082 during 04 2002 03 2013 about 0 521 lower than that during 04 2013 03 2015 this indicates that drought was obviously alleviated after the mutation point after 2015 the uf curve of spei 1 and spei 3 was above zero but did not reach the upper 0 05 significant level which infers humidification after the mutation point at monthly and seasonal scales though the humidification of the study area was not significant to further compare the difference in drought occurrences on agricultural and non agricultural lands we calculated the linear trends of spei 1 for each calendar month during the 13 hydrologic years fig 7a b we observed that the trends presented seasonal fluctuations regardless of land use types as shown in fig 7a the spei trends on agricultural area rose dramatically from march until june by 0 916 0 524 1 107 0 728 on average respectively this corresponded to the start and evolution of the rainy season in the area which may be the main reason for the wetting in the monsoon season in july through september when the monsoon season precipitation was concentrated spei declined largely 0 542 1 178 and 0 376 respectively due to the increased precipitation and temperatures spei trend turned to be positive again in october 0 905 right after the rainy season and then became negative again in november december january february by 0 289 0 203 0 311 0 533 respectively to sum up summer and winter droughts dominated in the study area at the monthly scale comparison between the variability in the monthly spei trends in agricultural and non agricultural areas fig 7c indicated that droughts were mitigated by agricultural activities we used the wilcoxon rank sum test method to assess the difference in the spei trend in each month between two land cover groups and p values were given in fig 7d the trend of spei in the agricultural areas was smaller than that in the non agricultural areas in april june july september and october among those months statistically significant difference existed in april june and july it is worth noting that the period with both the alleviated droughts and significant differences between two land cover groups coincidently lay within the main growing season in the general concept in the study area we can therefore roughly speculate that the water demand by crops increases during the growing season and when drought occurs it can be largely artificially eased over the croplands through agricultural activities 3 3 interconnections between agriculture and droughts the monthly values of gpp ndvi and spei had obvious periodic changes fig 8 specifically the impact of the changes in spei will be manifested in gpp in about 2 months compared to 4 months later in ndvi table 3 with the significance p value 0 05 for both we observed a time lag between monthly ndvi and gpp series although theoretically they should change synchronically as they both reflect vegetation phenological evolution processes this lag is believed to root in the gpp algorithms pei et al 2020 that is gpp is calculated as a function of atmospheric variables including temperature vapor pressure deficit and photosynthetically active radiation hence because of the well known asynchrony in the atmospheric variables and ndvi piao et al 2006 and fig 3 the gpp and ndvi have some inconsistency in time inevitably which led to different variation patterns of ndvi and gpp with hydroclimate conditions the inconsistency of ndvi and gpp also explains why the lag time between gpp and hydroclimate was shorter than that between ndvi and hydroclimate annual crop data including the agricultural gdp crop yield fertilizer usage representing agriculture intensity and industrial crop area ratio representing planting structure were obtained from the year books of the bureau of statistics of guangxi province and the pearson correlation analysis was applied to assess the interactions between agricultural activities and the vegetation and hydroclimate changes fig 9 shows that agricultural gdp in this region has increased greatly by 8 25 billion per year crop yield increased by 3 93 million tons yr fertilizer application increased by 4 71 tons yr industrial crop rate increased by 0 004 yr the correlation coefficient was higher than 0 7 between ndvi gpp and et and crop yield and it was higher than 0 6 between ndvi gpp et and agricultural output value all of them passed the significance test with p 0 05 supporting that pursuing great crop yield and agricultural product value has stimulated a strong response of the changes in ndvi gpp and water consumption moreover the fertilizer usage amount and ratio of industrial crop area to the total sown area were closely related to ndvi gpp and et implying that vegetation parameters and water consumption have strongly responded to the changes of planting structure and the intensification of agriculture in comparison p and tws were not highly correlated with the examined agricultural data based on the studies of optimal ratio of irrigation to fertilizer usage the effective utilization of irrigation water is considered to increase annually with the fertilizer application he et al 2021 liu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c thus our results in fig 9c may suggest that irrigation exerted a greater impact on annual agricultural productions than natural precipitation and water reserves spei was overall well correlated with agricultural activity data at the annual scale reflecting a positive feedback from drought conditions to agroecosystems 4 discussion 4 1 interactions between agriculture and drought conditions vegetation growth is affected by both water and atmospheric conditions in addition to plant physiological features wang et al 2016 the study area is characterized as monsoon climate where rainfall and high temperature seasons are highly synchronized qian and zhu 2001 which may have the chance to reduce water supply below the critical threshold and results in a decrease in tws during the rainy season mccabe and wolock 2011 additionally the changes of tws over the years are highly linked with p because rainfall is the major source of soil water storage in this subtropical humid area brocca et al 2010 ojha et al 2014 the high values of two commonly used parameters for vegetation change detection gpp and ndvi were distributed in summer and autumn and the low values were in spring and winter consistent with p and tws dynamics overall similar results have been reported elsewhere including the prb guan et al 2015 krause et al 2014 zhou et al 2021a 2021b zhu et al 2018 regarding the response of vegetation to atmospheric changes we used temperature potential and actual et for examination at the annual scale the temperature showed a slight downward trend leading to a decrease in etp in the region cuo et al 2013 however the actual et in this region has increased significantly i e the actual water consumption in the cultivated area has increased this can be a result of increased vegetation coverage or change of crops types which would change relative humidity chattopadhyay and hulme 1997 or rising water resource accessed by plant roots based on fig 2 9 it is most likely a result of the two aspects a previous study in the prb found that the vegetation changes were more profound in the central agricultural region than other areas in the basin wang et al 2020 which originally motivated this study to further investigate what may cause this phenomenon we hypothesized that the agricultural activities have been intensified in this region even under frequent drought conditions in these years due to national and provincial policy reasons the planting area decreased before 2008 and increased slowly thereafter and the correlation between planting area and ndvi and gpp was relatively low since small variation in the sown area do not explain the significant increase in crop yields the increase in the total yields should be mainly attributable to higher productivity per unit area oweis and hachum 2009 fan and pardey 1997 reported that the increase in crop yields can be explained by many factor such as land labor fertilizer and irrigable area we found that fertilizer application was closely related to ndvi and gpp that is the increase in total planting area has increased the demand for fertilizers and water toward an increased crop production meanwhile denser crops could increase the ndvi value produce higher gpp and lead to higher water use amount over this cropland area ndvi and gpp were well correlated with p and tws but better correlated with et fig 4 the increase of vegetation cover usually boosts transpiration enhances rainfall interception and the extended vegetation rooting systems can also increase soil water uptake wu et al 2020 all these changes will increase the actual water consumption yang et al 2014 in contrast p and tws were not significantly correlated with local agricultural data the possible reasons include that the structure of farming represented by industrial crop ratio in fig 9 has been largely changed and irrigation water use efficiency has been increased due to advanced technology to ensure food security and eliminate the gap between food production and demand he et al 2021 he et al 2021 which is likely to increase due to urbanization climate change and other factors haddad et al 2011 yan et al 2015 other studies have found that the trend of crop production is decoupled from that of meteorological drought mondol et al 2021 to illustrate the drought impact on agriculture the difference in the trend of spei change between argicultural area and non agricultural area was evaluated which show that the trend of wetting is more obvious in the growing period of agricultural areas while it is the opposite beyond growing period at the month scale the increase of vegetation greenness and biomass production is often accompanied by the water consumption required by the plant growth and soil ground water supply is deteriorated with drought persistence but supplemented by additional water supply through irrigation in this circumstance it is possible that some extra water supply to crops has mitigated the drought impacts on crop vegetation development during the growing seasons and improved the water and light use efficiency to enhance production dai et al 2008 yang et al 2010 severe droughts can often cause irreversible damage or even mortality to crops farhangfar et al 2015 wilcox et al 2020 xu et al 2019a 2019b when there is no additional water availability other than a limited amount of rainfall in contrast our results suggest that frequent mild droughts can promote crop greenness and productivity in the relatively water abundant subtropical area due mainly to the improved light exposure conditions between frequent rainfall events wang et al 2017 agricultural yield is limited by light and water conditions zuo et al 2021 the prb has sufficient rainfall concentrated in the growing seasons limiting the available radiation to crops chen et al 2017a 2017b dai et al 2020 the high evaporation between rainfall events associated with mild droughts means that light conditions are relatively fair and farmers spontaneously increase irrigation during such a sustained period of clear weather boosting agricultural output the relationship between spei and agricultural data confirmed a positive feedback from droughts to agroecosystems which is probably realized by firstly enhanced photosynthesis induced by increased solar radiation he et al 2013 and secondly increased water supply by irrigation in response to drought barriopedro et al 2012 haddad et al 2011 4 2 limitations the main uncertainty in this study lies in the data we acquired during the study period which is influenced by the interpolation of inadequate observation stations in the study area secondly the spatial accuracy of remote sensing data cannot be ascertained and there are often multiple land use types at the same 0 25 pixel but the minor ones were weighted out during resampling subsequent studies may consider corrections for elevation factors to further improve the data accuracy to eliminate the influence gao et al 2012 other uncertainty may lie in the remote sensing vegetation parameters ndvi and gpp over humid subtropical regions because of the cloud contamination nonetheless the products applied here represent the most widely used ones in vegetation climate hydrology studies and the quantification of data accuracy across different climate zones should be determined but is not the focus of this study in the process of analysis in addition to the influence of water conditions on vegetation the influence of atmospheric conditions on vegetation is attributed to temperature outweighing other factors which may also lead to deviation of the contribution analysis to vegetation change besides uncertainty of anthropogenic influence parameterization will lead to bias in the relationship between vegetation and droughts eisner 2014 liu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c but can only be limited to the currently available agricultural data analysis while the agricultural data maybe not always accurately represent the multifaceted human behaviors in agricultural activities that may affect local water conditions and respond to drought occurrences we also have difficulty in untangling the influence and determining the dominant and decisive role of the nominated agricultural activities however based on the analysis we still clearly see the linkages between water resources availability agriculture intensification and agroecosystem changes and can identify the general positive or negative feedbacks between them at different temporal scales 5 conclusions this study investigated the vegetation water atmosphere interactions over an agricultural area in a humid subtropical river basin and revealed the reasons why vegetation changes are more profound in the cropland areas results show that et ndvi and gpp increased significantly which indicates that the enhanced crop productivity is accompanied by an increased water use the annual vegetation change was more strongly controlled by water supply than atmospheric conditions and the monthly relationships reversed the study area experienced frequent mild to moderate droughts and spei well represented the drought occurrences comparison of the linear trends of spei in each calendar month over the 13 hydrologic years proved significant difference of drought situation between agricultural and non agricultural areas especially in growing seasons further analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between drought index vegetation parameters and agricultural data inferring positive impacts of such droughts on agriculture the underlying mechanisms can be that photosynthetic processes are enhanced due to enhanced solar exposure during extended rain free periods and improved water supply by irrigation in response to droughts the results are informative regarding food security and mitigation of the climate change impacts on agriculture water relations declaration of competing interest the
