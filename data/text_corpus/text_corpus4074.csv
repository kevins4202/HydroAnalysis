20370,in view of many uncertainties in the complex fatigue process of actual structural members fatigue reliability analysis is needed to quantify structural safety assessment compared with thick plates thin plate welded joints are more prone local deformation and global angular deformation which seriously affects stress concentration effect and fatigue performance at welded corners with the increasing importance of lightweight structure both the initial local deformation and the global angular deformation of thin plates should be considered in fatigue reliability analysis the limit state equations of three typical welded joints butt joint t shaped and cross shaped were constructed based on the renewed critical stress amplification factor method to consider the initial deformation of thin plate joints moreover considering the existing experimental data and the tolerance of welding deformations recommended in codes the fatigue reliability was re evaluated by jc method for thin plate welded joints the results show that the reliability indexes of thin plate welded joints are closely related to the plate thickness and the tolerance recommended by the traditional code should be corrected for the plate thickness therefore considering the initial welding deformation this paper quantitatively calculates the lateral deformation limit of typical welded joints and presents the

reliability index λ influence coefficient of boundary 1 introduction in order to improve the eedi in energy saving and environmental protection performance of ships it has become the consensus of the international maritime community to reduce the weight of ships and realize the light weight of ships under the background of intelligent ships and green ships light weight of ships is a new opportunity and challenge for shipbuilding industry to leapfrog development with the introduction of new materials new structures and new processes high strength steel aluminum alloy titanium alloy and other alloy materials have been widely used and thin plate welded structures with plate thickness less than 5 mm have been tried in the main structure of high speed ships and the superstructure of large ships as shown in fig 1 before 1990s the proportion of thin plate in american shipbuilding was less than 10 but it increased to 90 after 2000 according to statistics the thickness of the high strength thin plate used by the aircraft carrier ford can be as low as 3 mm with the rise of high end ships such as yachts and cruise ships the superstructure of yachts has begun to adopt thin plate reinforced structures below 5 mm lillemäe et al 2017 it has become an inevitable trend to use thin steel structures and lightweight alloy materials to improve fuel consumption rate to achieve the purpose of weight reduction and energy saving butt joint t joint and cross joint are the most widely used welded joints in offshore engineering structures qin et al 2019 due to welding heat output welding defects are easy to occur in welded joints for thick plates welding deformations mainly include welding misalignment and welding angular deformation as shown in fig 2 a however due to the low bending stiffness of thin plates besides misalignment and angular deformation it will also cause curvature deformation of welded thin plates themselves which is called welding initial deformation lillemäe et al 2017 shen et al 2019 the initial welding deformation can be quantified by local angular deformation α l as shown in fig 2b the appearance of welding initial deformation significantly changes the effective stress ratio at the welding toe that is increases the stress amplification factor at the welding toe and finally becomes the main influencing factor of notch stress and fatigue evaluation of thin plate welding structures park et al 2012 ottersböck et al 2016 leitner 2017 ottersböck et al 2018 offshore structures are usually vulnerable to fatigue damage accumulated repeatedly with loads which always occurs in welded joints or places with high stress concentration the fatigue resistance in engineering depends on s n curve which is obtained from the test of specific welded joints under constant amplitude cyclic load when the load is variable or random linear miner cumulative damage rule can be adopted however even under constant amplitude load great scatter can be observed in fatigue life and there is considerable uncertainty in the prediction of fatigue life of welded joints for any metal structures this uncertainty is mainly due to the randomness of wave induced load and the dispersion of local structural fatigue resistance meanwhile the cumulative damage value is uncertain and the value fluctuates around 1 folsø et al 2002 in view of many uncertainties in the complex fatigue process of actual structural members it is necessary to analyze the fatigue reliability of marine structures for structural safety check the existing fatigue design rules are mostly empirical and often too conservative xing et al 2017 wirsching and chen 1988 summarized some achievements in fatigue reliability research and demonstrated how to effectively use reliability methods to avoid fatigue failure of marine structural members ang et al 2001 proposed a method of fatigue analysis and anti fatigue design based on reliability method it is assumed in the paper that random load obeys β distribution and fatigue life is characterized by s n relationship then a reliability function based on weibull distribution was proposed to represent fatigue performance of specimens furthermore the proposed method was applied to an lng tanker in service and it is found that the reliability level of the ship without fatigue failure is about 0 85 ang et al 2001 combined linear elastic fracture mechanics method with full plastic failure garbatov and guedes 2004 put forward the fatigue reliability evaluation formula of structural members with misalignment and angular deformation ayala and moan 2007 evaluated a series of fatigue reliability formulas based on s n curve or fracture mechanics method the evaluation results show that the single slope s n curve model is more conservative than the double slope s n curve model feng et al 2012 based on monte carlo method and first order reliability method considered the existence of multiple cracks in stiffeners and plates and their correlation and analyzed the fatigue reliability of stiffened plates under the action of related crack propagation jensen 2015 combined monte carlo simulation and first order reliability method proposed an improved fatigue damage estimation method for nonlinear systems under random load excitation compared with simple monte carlo method and first order reliability method this method was simpler and took less time on the basis of hot spot stress method dong et al 2019 put forward the idea of critical stress amplification factor which is affected by load fatigue resistance and stress concentration if the stress amplification factor of the actual welded joint is greater than the critical stress amplification factor fatigue failure may occur in the welded joint on this basis the limit state function was established according to the relationship between the critical stress amplification factor and the actual stress amplification factor and the fatigue reliability of butt welded joints was evaluated by the first order reliability method by using the reliability analysis method proposed by dong et al 2019 different degrees of welding defects caused by welding can be evaluated based on fatigue reliability and the welding quality can be controlled according to the reliability calculation results so as to obtain good fatigue performance the above mentioned literatures have quantitatively analyzed the common welding misalignment and angular deformation for thick plate welded structures however the influence of welding initial deformation see fig 2b is not considered in the reliability evaluation of thin plate welded structures according to dong s research the welding misalignment tolerance and welding angle deformation tolerance of butt welded specimens are related to the joint thickness when the safety probability is 95 and the welding curve tolerance obtained when the plate thickness is less than 10 mm is far less than the specified value in the specifications dnv gl 2015 vsm 2003 which shows that the welding curve tolerance given in the specification is not suitable for thin plates therefore based on the critical stress amplification factor method proposed by dong et al 2019 and the stress amplification factor calculation formula deduced by shen et al 2019 this paper constructed the limit state equations of thin plate welded joints with initial deformation the fatigue reliability of three typical thin plate welded joints butt joint t shaped joint and cross joint were re evaluated and the corresponding welding defect tolerance values were further obtained 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 for thick plate welded joints in order to consider the influence of welding misalignment and angular deformation on stress concentration at corners the following correction formula was proposed in the traditional welding specifications dnv gl 2015 1 k t σ n o t c h σ n o m k g k w k m where k w k g indicates weld geometry on stress concentration the recommended value is k w k g 1 0 0 5 tan α 0 25 for butt joint default value k w k g 1 5 and k w k g 0 9 0 9 tan α 0 25 for t joint and cruciform joint default value k w k g 1 8 k m is the defined stress magnification factor 2 k m k t e k t α where k t e is the stress amplification factor caused by welding misalignment k t α is the stress amplification factor caused by welding angular deformation it is worth emphasizing that the above formulas are mainly aimed at thick plate welded structures and fail to consider the influence of initial welding deformation for thin plate welded joints for butt joint and cruciform welding specimens as shown in fig 3 dnv gl 2015 and bs 7910 2013 presented the expression of stress concentration factor considering welding misalignment for butt joint 3a k t e 1 3 δ 0 t 1 for cruciform joint 3b k t e 1 c e δ 0 l 1 t 1 l 1 l 2 where δ 0 is the welding misalignment value in fig 3 t is the plate thickness l 1 and l 2 are the lengths of the test piece c e is the coefficient related to boundary conditions according to bs 7910 2013 specification the value of c e is 6 0 for fillet weld specimens with simply supported boundary conditions at both ends while the value of coefficient c e is 6 75 for the fixed boundary conditions at both ends for thick plate welded specimens without initial deformation the expression of stress concentration factor k t α at weld toe caused by welding angular deformation was recommended by the iiw specification hobbacher 2016 4 k t α 1 λ 4 α g l t 1 b

g l t 1 3 σ nom e because the influence of the initial deformation of thin plate welding is not considered the above formula will cause a large error when correcting the notch stress field of thin plate welded specimens shen et al 2019 by introducing the global deformation angle α g and the local welding deformation angle α l after theoretical derivation and numerical verification shen et al 2019 proposed the formulas for calculating the stress amplification factor at the welding toes of butt joints t joints and cross joints of thin plates 2 2 for thin plate welded joints 2 2 1 ktα of butt joint considering initial deformation as shown in fig 4 the bending deformation of the thin plate after welding is quantified by local angular deformation α l considering the influence of welding

international joint committee on safety degree jcss recommended rackwits fiessler method jc method for short huang and wang 1987 jc method mainly put forward an approximate method of replacing non normal variables with normal variables this method requires that the probability density and distribution function values of the replaced normal variables at the checking points x i are equal to those of the original non normal distribution see fig 6 according to these two conditions the mean μ x i and standard deviation s x i of the equivalent normal distribution can be obtained 11 μ x i n x i s x i n φ 1 f x i x i 12 s x i n ϕ φ 1 f x i x i f x i x i where the distribution function of non normal variable x i is f x x i and the probability density is f x x i φ is the cumulative probability density function of standard normal distribution and the equivalent normal distribution of x i is n μ x i n s x i n when the state variables are transformed into normal variables the limit state equation of multi state variables can be obtained by g x g x 1 x 2 x n 0 and the corresponding safety probability can be expressed 13 p s g x f x x d x the above formula is the volume fraction of f x x in safe area g x 0 and f x x is the probability density function of multivariate function jc method assumes that the reliability index is the minimum distance from the limit state equation to the origin that is β d min based on lagrange multiplier method the reliability index can be obtained 14 β g t x g t g 1 2 i 1 n x i g x i s x i i 1 n g x i 2 s x i 2 where g is the gradient on the most likely failure point x 1 x 2 x n g t is the transpose matrix of g x is the coordinate of the possible failure point where the component coordinate is x i a i β 15 a i g x i s x i i 1 n g x i 2 s x i 2 the coordinates of the failure point can be expressed as 16 x i μ x i a i β s x i in addition the coordinates of failure points should satisfy the limit state equation 17 g x 01 x 02 x 0 n 0 when the mean and standard deviation of each state variable are known the reliability index β can be solved by iterative method from formulas 14 to 16 the corresponding failure probability is p f φ β and the safety probability is p s φ β the general flow chart of jc method is shown in fig 7 because jc method needs to be iterated many times when the error between two adjacent calculation results is less than 1 the final calculation result is considered to meet the requirements after the completion of the first calculation the second calculation can only be performed after meeting the judging conditions so the assumption that β 0 0 1 β 1 is introduced in the calculation 3 fatigue reliability assessment 3 1 calculation of kmc based on monte carlo method considering the initial welding deformation of thin plate welded joints the limit state equation of the corresponding typical welded joint can be defined as follows 18 f x x k m c k m where k m c is the critical stress amplification factor which obeys lognormal distribution and can be obtained by monte carlo method k m is the critical stress amplification factor caused by welding misalignment welding angular deformation and welding initial deformation according to the theoretical calculation formula according to formula 18 the key to structural reliability evaluation lies in solving the critical stress amplification factor in the limit state equation of the structure based on the hot spot stress method dong et al 2019 calculated the critical stress amplification factor k m c of butt welded specimens by monte carlo method and evaluated the reliability of butt welded specimens by first order reliability method dong et al 2019 adopted fat 100 curve as a reference when solving the critical stress amplification factor of butt joint but introducing fat curve recommended by iiw to evaluate thin welded structure when evaluating fatigue strength of thin welded joint will lead to too conservative estimation of fatigue life at high load level the main reason is that the slope k 3 of s n curve recommended by iiw is mainly for thick plates and rigid structures sonsino et al 2010 according to the current statistical data lillemäe et al 2012 liinalampi et al 2017 it is recommended to use s n curve with inverse slope of 5 when using notch stress method to evaluate fatigue strength of thin plate welded structure therefore fat 225 curve with k 5 was adopted to evaluate fatigue reliability of welded joints of thin plates in this paper it is assumed that the nominal stress range experienced by the welded structure during its service life follows a two parameter weibull distribution in which the probability density function is 19 f δ σ n o m δ σ n o m q 2 exp δ σ n o m q where q is the scale parameter the life expectancy of ships depends on different sea conditions and different ship types and different routes and ship types correspond to different service lives according to dnv gl specification dnv gl 2015 when the service life is 25 years the total service life of the ship is expected to be 7 884 10 7 cycles the maximum stress range occurring in the service life is defined as the stress range when the reliability exceeds 10 8 20 δ σ n max q ln 10 8 in order to estimate the critical stress amplification factor k m c a large number of simulations are carried out based on monte carlo method and the flow chart of calculation is shown in fig 8 in the k th simulation the possible stress is divided into n σ parts according to the maximum stress range δ σ n max and the interval of each part is δ σ n max n σ generally speaking the larger the value of n σ the more accurate the calculation result of k m c will be but the corresponding calculation time will increase greatly the calculation results of k m c when n σ is 100 200 and 500 are compared in appendix b by comparison it is found that the calculated error of k m c is within 2 under the three assumptions so n σ 100 is taken in this paper according to the total service life n t o t a l and the nominal stress probability density function the possible cycle times n k j in the j th stress range can be obtained based on the notch stress s n curve the possible total cycle times of the structure in a specific stress range can be calculated by the following formula 21 n f k j 10 log a k j m log δ σ n k j k m c k g k w where log a k j is the intercept between the notch stress s n curve and abscissa when fat 225 curve with inverse slope of 5 is adopted it follows n 18 46 0 4 dong et al 2019 k w is the stress amplification factor caused by welding local geometry k g is the stress amplification factor caused by geometry size of welded specimen for butt welded joints k w k g 1 5 and k w k g 1 8 for t joints and cruciform welded joints as shown in fig 8 the cumulative damage degree is taken as the evaluation index of program cycle or output according to miner s rule when the damage degree is greater than 1 the structure fails however many experimental studies show that the critical value of cumulative fatigue damage degree is not always close to 1 but a random variable with a median value close to 1 it is also assumed that the critical value of cumulative fatigue damage degree obeys lognormal distribution with mean value of 1 and coefficient of variation of 0 3 dong et al 2019 once the initial value range of critical stress amplification factor is given the total fatigue damage can be calculated according to miner s rule if the difference between the estimated total damage degree d i and the target damage degree d k is less than or equal to 0 001 the k mc value at this time is output if this condition is not met the upper limit or lower limit of the stress amplification coefficient is updated according to the comparison result between the estimated total damage degree d i and the target damage degree d k thus obtaining a new k mck value assuming that the critical stress amplification factor k m c obeys lognormal distribution as shown in fig 9 it shows the mean and standard deviation corresponding to different q in logarithmic coordinates and the corresponding values are shown in appendix c table c1 with the increase of scale parameter q the maximum stress increases and the corresponding critical stress amplification factor k m c decreases as shown in fig 9a because the stress amplification factor k w k g of t welded joint is larger than that of butt welded joint the corresponding critical stress amplification factor k m c is also smaller than that of butt welded joint 3 2 fatigue reliability evaluation of typical welded joints after the critical stress amplification factor of welded joint is determined the reliability of typical welded joint can be evaluated based on jc method taking the fixed boundary condition as an example when x 0 the limit state equation of butt welded joint can be expressed by substituting eqs 2 3 and 5 into eq 18 22 f x x k m c 1 3 δ 0 t 1 1 3 l 2 t 1 α l e m e m 2 4 α g m e m e m 2 α l α g m 2 where m 2 3 1 μ 2 σ n o m e l t 1 2 for butt welded joints of thin plates combined with the measured values of welding defects given in literature lillemäe et al 2012 the values of corresponding parameters and distribution function types are presented in table 1 taking the scale parameter q 2 as an example the fatigue reliability evaluation process is deduced in detail because the stress amplification factor formula in the limit state equation comprehensively considers the influence of welding dislocation welding angular deformation and welding initial deformation the partial derivatives of each parameter in the complex function need to be deduced in detail when the partial derivatives of each parameter in the limit state equation are solved the corresponding reliability indexes can be obtained according to eq 16 and eq 17 the derivative produced in the limit state equation is expressed as 23 g k m c 1 24 g δ 0 3 t 1 1 3 l 2 t 1 α l e m e m 2 4 α g m e m e m 2 α l α g m 2 25 g α g 1 3 δ 0 t 1 3 l 2 t 1 4 m e m e m 2 m 2 26 g α l 1 3 δ 0 t 1 3 l 2 t 1 e m e m 2 m e m e m 2 m 2 27 g σ 1 3 δ 0 t 1 3 l 2 t 1

distribution function 28a k m c 10 41 α g 0 0094 α l 0 0104 α δ 0 0 13 α σ n o m 4 when the mean and standard deviation of each state variable are known the reliability index β can be solved by iterative method from formulas 14 to 16 each parameter value expressed by the reliability index can be described as 28b k m c 10 343 0 906 β α g 0 0094 0 008 β α l 0 0104 0 009 β α δ 0 0 13 0 059 β α σ n o m 3 32 0 022 β at the end of the first iteration a new set of coordinate values of failure points can be obtained thus starting the next iteration when the error of β value calculated in two adjacent times is small the iteration ends and the last iteration value is taken as the final failure index the iteration process and corresponding results are shown in table 2 when q 2 the final failure index is 4 99 and the corresponding safety probability is p s φ 4 99 1 for t shaped and cruciform welded specimens under the fixed boundary condition considering x 0 the limit state equation can be obtained according to eq 8 as follows 29 f x x k m c 1 3 δ 0 t 1 1 3 l t 2 2 t 1 α l e m e m 2 4 α g m e m e m 2 α l α g m 2 referring to the measured values of welding defects given in literature xing and dong 2016 ottersböck et al 2018 the values of corresponding parameters and distribution function types for t joints and cruciform joints are presented in table 3 as shown in fig 10 the fatigue reliability indexes of butt joints t welded joints and crucifom welded specimens are obtained according to jc method and the modified formula in this paper and the corresponding values are shown in appendix c table c2 the fatigue reliability index obtained by jc method corresponds to the cumulative distribution probability corresponding to the standard normal distribution when the fatigue reliability index is 2 the corresponding safety probability is 97 7 the greater the reliability coefficient the greater the safety probability it can be seen from fig 10 that with the increase of scale parameter q the corresponding critical stress amplification coefficient decreases and the fatigue reliability index of typical welded joints decreases accordingly among the three kinds of specimens the corresponding reliability index for t joints is the largest because the t welded specimen has no welding misalignment and local angular deformation and its overall angular deformation value is the smallest 4 tolerance analysis and discussion 4 1 tolerance analysis based on specification in the design process of welded joints of ship structures it is assumed that the allowable tolerances of axial and angular misalignment given in shipbuilding standards are not exceeded it is also considered that the deviation from ideal structure to fabricated structure should not exceed the tolerance specified in relevant shipbuilding standards eggert et al 2012 the german shipbuilding industry production standard vsm 2003 took the transverse deformation e 0 as the measurement index of the global angular deformation α g as shown in fig 2 e 0 l 2 tan α g 2 and put forward a tolerance limit of 5 l 200 mm depth for the transverse deformation iso 5817 2006 did not specify the limit of transverse deformation but it presented the adhesion tolerance for axial misalignment and angle defects dong et al 2019 considered that the axial misalignment of butt welded joints should not exceed 0 15 times of plate thickness t 1 and the transverse deformation should not exceed 6 mm the tolerance values of welding defects given by different specifications are shown in table 4 in this paper the length of t shaped specimen and cruciform joint is between 160 mm and 210 mm and the transverse deformation limit is calculated to be about 6 mm therefore in order to evaluate the tolerance limits introduced by the code and test its reliability level the tolerance limits shown in table 5 are used to calculate the fatigue reliability indexes of three typical welded joints it is assumed that the distribution of welding misalignment and transverse deformation obeys the standard normal distribution and the corresponding value is taken as half of the recommended value δ 0 n 0 0 15 t 1 2 e 0 n 0 6 2 taking a series of test pieces in literature lillemäe et al 2012 xing and dong 2016 ottersböck et al 2018 as evaluation objects according to the welding misalignment and welding angle deformation limits given in table 5 as measurement indexes the fatigue reliability index of typical welded joints is calculated in fig 11 and the corresponding values are shown in appendix c table c3 by comparison the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the critical stress amplification coefficient obtained by monte carlo method is inversely proportional to the scale coefficient so the reliability index decreases with the increase of the scale coefficient 2 considering that the critical stress amplification factor of butt welded joint is the largest the reliability index will be larger under the same axial misalignment and transverse deformation 3 the thickness of plate has obvious influence on the value of fatigue reliability index of welded specimens taking the butt joint specimen as an example the reliability index of the specimen with 10 mm thickness is about twice that of the specimen with 3 mm thickness under the same size parameters the reliability index of the specimen with 10 mm thickness is about 1 5 times as high as that of the specimen with 5 mm thickness therefore it is unreasonable to take the same transverse deformation limit for specimens with different plate thicknesses and the influence of plate thickness should be taken into account in the selection of transverse deformation limit for welded specimens 4 under the same reliability index the corresponding scale parameters of thin plates are much smaller it is assumed that the reliability index β 2 safety probability p s 97 7 is taken as the measure index of specimen safety for butt joints when the plate thickness is 10 mm and the scale parameter is less than 7 the reliability requirement of β 2 can be met when the plate thickness is 5 mm and the scale parameter is less than 5 it meets the requirement of β 2 however when the plate thickness is equal to 3 mm the requirement of β 2 requires that the scale parameter be less than 3 similar conclusions are reached for t joints and cruciform joints but the transverse deformation limits given by traditional codes do not consider the influence of plate thickness 5 in addition the influence of initial welding deformation is not considered in the traditional code and when the influence of initial welding is considered the fatigue reliability index of the specimen will be further reduced therefore it is necessary to study the transverse deformation limits and the initial deformation limits of thin plate welded specimens according to the fatigue reliability evaluation method 4 2 deformation limit considering welding initial deformation the above evaluation results show that the transverse deformation limit of welded joints should consider the influence of specimen thickness in addition the influence of initial welding deformation should also be considered for thin plate welded specimens considering different angular deformation ratios α g α l with the safety probability of 97 7 as the measurement index the results of the transverse deformation tolerance of three kinds of welded joints when β 2 are re evaluated with reference to the welding misalignment tolerance given in table 5 as shown in figs 12 14 in most cases the transverse deformation limit of thin plate welded joints is less than 6 mm the detailed evaluation values are presented in appendix c tables c4 c6 the results show that the transverse deformation limit is not only related to the thickness of the plate but also with the increase of angular deformation ratio the limit of transverse deformation will decrease by comparison it can be found that 1 because the critical stress amplification factor of t shaped welded joint is the same as that of cruciform joint but welding misalignment is not considered in t shaped welded specimen the transverse deformation limit of t shaped welded joint is larger than that of cruciform welded joint under different angular deformation ratio taking the calculation results with a thickness of 10 mm as an example when the angular deformation ratio is α g α l 1 the transverse deformation limit of t welded joint is about 3 5 mm larger than that of cruciform joint and when the angular deformation ratio is 2 the transverse deformation limit of t welded joint is about 2 5 mm larger than that of cross joint when the angular deformation ratio is 4 the difference of transverse deformation decreases to about 2 mm 2 plate thickness has great influence on the transverse deformation limit and the transverse deformation limit of welded joint is approximately proportional to the plate thickness t 1 when α l α g 1 the transverse deformation limit calculated by butt joint with thickness of 10 mm is basically greater than 6 mm however for the butt joint with a thickness of 3 mm it is calculated that the transverse deformation limit will be less than 6 mm it shows that the limit value of transverse deformation given in the traditional code is not suitable for thin plate welded joints and the method presented in this paper can be used to calculate the limit value of transverse deformation under specific size and thickness 3 the initial deformation also has a great influence on the transverse deformation limit for three typical welded joints the transverse deformation limit of α l α g 2 is about 0 8 times that of α l α g 1 and that of α l α g 4 is only about 0 5 times that of α l α g 4 for thin plates with thickness less than 5 mm when α l α g 1 there are still some points above the straight line of e 0 6 mm as shown in fig 12 but when α l α g 4 the transverse deformation limits are calculated to be less than 6 mm 5 conclusions based on monte carlo method and jc method this paper considers the initial welding deformation of thin plate welded joints and applies the formula of stress amplification factor proposed by shen et al 2019 to the fatigue reliability evaluation of three kinds of thin plate welded joints 1 according to the experimental data of typical welded specimens the reliability index of welded structures is obtained by jc method with the increase of scale parameters the reliability index decreases considering the reliability index β 2 the scale parameter of butt welded joint and cross joint is about 6 while the scale parameter of t welded joint is about 10 the main reason for the large scale coefficient of t welded specimen is that the main board of t welded specimen is continuous small welding misalignment and welding angle deformation cause the corresponding reliability index to be too large 2 the plate thickness has a great influence on the fatigue reliability index of typical welded joints while the limit value of transverse deformation given by traditional codes does not consider the influence of plate thickness according to the welding dislocation and transverse deformation limits recommended by the traditional code the reliability indexes of three kinds of welded joints are calculated it is found that when the plate thickness is 10 mm the fatigue reliability index is 2 safety probability p s 97 7 with the scale parameter q 7 when the plate thickness is 3 mm the required scale parameter is q 3 when the calculated fatigue reliability index is 2 3 the existence of initial deformation will increase the stress concentration coefficient of welded joints thus reducing the reliability index the influence of initial deformation should also be considered when evaluating the fatigue reliability of thin plate welded joints the calculation results show that for three typical welded joints the transverse deformation limit of α l α g 2 is about 0 8 times that of α l α g 1 and that of α l α g 4 is only about 0 5 times that of α l α g 4 4 the proposed method based on notch stress amplification factor can both consider the influence of welding misalignment welding angular deformation welding initial deformation weld geometry and size effect on reliability results in addition the scale parameter of external load distribution and damage value are also the main influencing factors of reliability index therefore it is difficult to quantify the welding defect tolerance by using a unified formula for welded joints with different welding geometry and load conditions but for welded joints with specific dimensions the corresponding welding defect tolerance can be calculated by using the renewed

20370,in view of many uncertainties in the complex fatigue process of actual structural members fatigue reliability analysis is needed to quantify structural safety assessment compared with thick plates thin plate welded joints are more prone local deformation and global angular deformation which seriously affects stress concentration effect and fatigue performance at welded corners with the increasing importance of lightweight structure both the initial local deformation and the global angular deformation of thin plates should be considered in fatigue reliability analysis the limit state equations of three typical welded joints butt joint t shaped and cross shaped were constructed based on the renewed critical stress amplification factor method to consider the initial deformation of thin plate joints moreover considering the existing experimental data and the tolerance of welding deformations recommended in codes the fatigue reliability was re evaluated by jc method for thin plate welded joints the results show that the reliability indexes of thin plate welded joints are closely related to the plate thickness and the tolerance recommended by the traditional code should be corrected for the plate thickness therefore considering the initial welding deformation this paper quantitatively calculates the lateral deformation limit of typical welded joints and presents the results of lateral deformation limit under different reliability indexes keywords fatigue reliability assessment stress amplification factor notch stress welding initial deformation thin plate welded

reliability index λ influence coefficient of boundary 1 introduction in order to improve the eedi in energy saving and environmental protection performance of ships it has become the consensus of the international maritime community to reduce the weight of ships and realize the light weight of ships under the background of intelligent ships and green ships light weight of ships is a new opportunity and challenge for shipbuilding industry to leapfrog development with the introduction of new materials new structures and new processes high strength steel aluminum alloy titanium alloy and other alloy materials have been widely used and thin plate welded structures with plate thickness less than 5 mm have been tried in the main structure of high speed ships and the superstructure of large ships as shown in fig 1 before 1990s the proportion of thin plate in american shipbuilding was less than 10 but it increased to 90 after 2000 according to statistics the thickness of the high strength thin plate used by the aircraft carrier ford can be as low as 3 mm with the rise of high end ships such as yachts and cruise ships the superstructure of yachts has begun to adopt thin plate reinforced structures below 5 mm lillemäe et al 2017 it has become an inevitable trend to use thin steel structures and lightweight alloy materials to improve fuel consumption rate to achieve the purpose of weight reduction and energy saving butt joint t joint and cross joint are the most widely used welded joints in offshore engineering structures qin et al 2019 due to welding heat output welding defects are easy to occur in welded joints for thick plates welding deformations mainly include welding misalignment and welding angular deformation as shown in fig 2 a however due to the low bending stiffness of thin plates besides misalignment and angular deformation it will also cause curvature deformation of welded thin plates themselves which is called welding initial deformation lillemäe et al 2017 shen et al 2019 the initial welding deformation can be quantified by local angular deformation α l as shown in fig 2b the appearance of welding initial deformation significantly changes the effective stress ratio at the welding toe that is increases the stress amplification factor at the welding toe and finally becomes the main influencing factor of notch stress and fatigue evaluation of thin plate welding structures park et al 2012 ottersböck et al 2016 leitner 2017 ottersböck et al 2018 offshore structures are usually vulnerable to fatigue damage accumulated repeatedly with loads which always occurs in welded joints or places with high stress concentration the fatigue resistance in engineering depends on s n curve which is obtained from the test of specific welded joints under constant amplitude cyclic load when the load is variable or random linear miner cumulative damage rule can be adopted however even under constant amplitude load great scatter can be observed in fatigue life and there is considerable uncertainty in the prediction of fatigue life of welded joints for any metal structures this uncertainty is mainly due to the randomness of wave induced load and the dispersion of local structural fatigue resistance meanwhile the cumulative damage value is uncertain and the value fluctuates around 1 folsø et al 2002 in view of many uncertainties in the complex fatigue process of actual structural members it is necessary to analyze the fatigue reliability of marine structures for structural safety check the existing fatigue design rules are mostly empirical and often too conservative xing et al 2017 wirsching and chen 1988 summarized some achievements in fatigue reliability research and demonstrated how to effectively use reliability methods to avoid fatigue failure of marine structural members ang et al 2001 proposed a method of fatigue analysis and anti fatigue design based on reliability method it is assumed in the paper that random load obeys β distribution and fatigue life is characterized by s n relationship then a reliability function based on weibull distribution was proposed to represent fatigue performance of specimens furthermore the proposed method was applied to an lng tanker in service and it is found that the reliability level of the ship without fatigue failure is about 0 85 ang et al 2001 combined linear elastic fracture mechanics method with full plastic failure garbatov and guedes 2004 put forward the fatigue reliability evaluation formula of structural members with misalignment and angular deformation ayala and moan 2007 evaluated a series of fatigue reliability formulas based on s n curve or fracture mechanics method the evaluation results show that the single slope s n curve model is more conservative than the double slope s n curve model feng et al 2012 based on monte carlo method and first order reliability method considered the existence of multiple cracks in stiffeners and plates and their correlation and analyzed the fatigue reliability of stiffened plates under the action of related crack propagation jensen 2015 combined monte carlo simulation and first order reliability method proposed an improved fatigue damage estimation method for nonlinear systems under random load excitation compared with simple monte carlo method and first order reliability method this method was simpler and took less time on the basis of hot spot stress method dong et al 2019 put forward the idea of critical stress amplification factor which is affected by load fatigue resistance and stress concentration if the stress amplification factor of the actual welded joint is greater than the critical stress amplification factor fatigue failure may occur in the welded joint on this basis the limit state function was established according to the relationship between the critical stress amplification factor and the actual stress amplification factor and the fatigue reliability of butt welded joints was evaluated by the first order reliability method by using the reliability analysis method proposed by dong et al 2019 different degrees of welding defects caused by welding can be evaluated based on fatigue reliability and the welding quality can be controlled according to the reliability calculation results so as to obtain good fatigue performance the above mentioned literatures have quantitatively analyzed the common welding misalignment and angular deformation for thick plate welded structures however the influence of welding initial deformation see fig 2b is not considered in the reliability evaluation of thin plate welded structures according to dong s research the welding misalignment tolerance and welding angle deformation tolerance of butt welded specimens are related to the joint thickness when the safety probability is 95 and the welding curve tolerance obtained when the plate thickness is less than 10 mm is far less than the specified value in the specifications dnv gl 2015 vsm 2003 which shows that the welding curve tolerance given in the specification is not suitable for thin plates therefore based on the critical stress amplification factor method proposed by dong et al 2019 and the stress amplification factor calculation formula deduced by shen et al 2019 this paper constructed the limit state equations of thin plate welded joints with initial deformation the fatigue reliability of three typical thin plate welded joints butt joint t shaped joint and cross joint were re evaluated and the corresponding welding defect tolerance values were further obtained 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 for thick plate welded joints in order to consider the influence of welding misalignment and angular deformation on stress concentration at corners the following correction formula was proposed in the traditional welding specifications dnv gl 2015 1 k t σ n o t c h σ n o m k g k w k m where k w k g indicates weld geometry on stress concentration the recommended value is k w k g 1 0 0 5 tan α 0 25 for butt joint default value k w k g 1 5 and k w k g 0 9 0 9 tan α 0 25 for t joint and cruciform joint default value k w k g 1 8 k m is the defined stress magnification factor 2 k m k t e k t α where k t e is the stress amplification factor caused by welding misalignment k t α is the stress amplification factor caused by welding angular deformation it is worth emphasizing that the above formulas are mainly aimed at thick plate welded structures and fail to consider the influence of initial welding deformation for thin plate welded joints for butt joint and cruciform welding specimens as shown in fig 3 dnv gl 2015 and bs 7910 2013 presented the expression of stress concentration factor considering welding misalignment for butt joint 3a k t e 1 3 δ 0 t 1 for cruciform joint 3b k t e 1 c e δ 0 l 1 t 1 l 1 l 2 where δ 0 is the welding misalignment value in fig 3 t is the plate thickness l 1 and l 2 are the lengths of the test piece c e is the coefficient related to boundary conditions according to bs 7910 2013 specification the value of c e is 6 0 for fillet weld specimens with simply supported boundary conditions at both ends while the value of coefficient c e is 6 75 for the fixed boundary conditions at both ends for thick plate welded specimens without initial deformation the expression of stress concentration factor k t α at weld toe caused by welding angular deformation was recommended by the iiw specification hobbacher 2016 4 k t α 1 λ 4 α g l t 1 b

g l t 1 3 σ nom e because the influence of the initial deformation of thin plate welding is not considered the above formula will cause a large error when correcting the notch stress field of thin

international joint committee on safety degree jcss recommended rackwits fiessler method jc method for short huang and wang 1987 jc method mainly put forward an approximate method of replacing non normal variables with normal variables this method requires that the probability density and distribution function values of the replaced normal variables at the checking points x i are equal to those of the original non normal distribution see fig 6 according to these two conditions the mean μ x i and standard deviation s x i of the equivalent normal distribution can be obtained 11 μ x i n x i s x i n φ 1 f x i x i 12 s x i n ϕ φ 1 f x i x i f x i x i where the distribution function of non normal variable x i is f x x i and the probability density is f x x i φ is the cumulative probability density function of standard normal distribution and the equivalent normal distribution of x i is n μ x i n s x i n when the state variables are transformed into normal variables the limit state equation of multi state variables can be obtained by g x g x 1 x 2 x n 0 and the corresponding safety probability can be expressed 13 p s g x f x x d x the above formula is the volume fraction of f x x in safe area g x 0 and f x x is the probability density function of multivariate function jc method assumes that the reliability index is the minimum distance from the limit state equation to the origin that is β d min based on lagrange multiplier method the reliability index can be obtained 14 β g t x g t g 1 2 i 1 n x i g x i s x i i 1 n g x i 2 s x i 2 where g is the gradient on the most likely failure point x 1 x 2 x n g t is the transpose matrix of g x is the coordinate of the possible failure point where the component coordinate is x i a i β 15 a i g x i s x i i 1 n g x i 2 s x i 2 the coordinates of the failure point can be expressed as 16 x i μ x i a i β s x i in addition the coordinates of failure points should satisfy the limit state equation 17 g x 01 x 02 x 0 n 0 when the mean and standard deviation of each state variable are known the reliability index β can be solved by iterative method from formulas 14 to 16 the corresponding failure probability is p f φ β and the safety probability is p s φ β the general flow chart of jc method is shown in fig 7 because jc method needs to be iterated many times when the error between two adjacent calculation results is less than 1 the final calculation result is considered to meet the requirements after the completion of the first calculation the second calculation can only be performed after meeting the judging conditions so the assumption that β 0 0 1 β 1 is introduced in the calculation 3 fatigue reliability assessment 3 1 calculation of kmc based on monte carlo method considering the initial welding deformation of thin plate welded joints the limit state equation of the corresponding typical welded joint can be defined as follows 18 f x x k m c k m where k m c is the critical stress amplification factor which obeys lognormal distribution and can be obtained by monte carlo method k m is the critical stress amplification factor caused by welding misalignment welding angular deformation and welding initial deformation according to the theoretical calculation formula according to formula 18 the key to structural reliability evaluation lies in solving the critical stress amplification factor in the limit state equation of the structure based on the hot spot stress method dong et al 2019 calculated the critical stress amplification factor k m c of butt welded specimens by monte carlo method and evaluated the reliability of butt welded specimens by first order reliability method dong et al 2019 adopted fat 100 curve as a reference when solving the critical stress amplification factor of butt joint but introducing fat curve recommended by iiw to evaluate thin welded structure when evaluating fatigue strength of thin welded joint will lead to too conservative estimation of fatigue life at high load level the main reason is that the slope k 3 of s n curve recommended by iiw is mainly for thick plates and rigid structures sonsino et al 2010 according to the current statistical data lillemäe et al 2012 liinalampi et al 2017 it is recommended to use s n curve with inverse slope of 5 when using notch stress method to evaluate fatigue strength of thin plate welded structure therefore fat 225 curve with k 5 was adopted to evaluate fatigue reliability of welded joints of thin plates in this paper it is assumed that the nominal stress range experienced by the welded structure during its service life follows a two parameter weibull distribution in which the probability density function is 19 f δ σ n o m δ σ n o m q 2 exp δ σ n o m q where q is the scale parameter the life expectancy of ships depends on different sea conditions and different ship types and different routes and ship types correspond to different service lives according to dnv gl specification dnv gl 2015 when the service life is 25 years the total service life of the ship is expected to be 7 884 10 7 cycles the maximum stress range occurring in the service life is defined as the stress range when the reliability exceeds 10 8 20 δ σ n max q ln 10 8 in order to estimate the critical stress amplification factor k m c a large number of simulations are carried out based on monte carlo method and the flow chart of calculation is shown in fig 8 in the k th simulation the possible stress is divided into n σ parts according to the maximum stress range δ σ n max and the interval of each part is δ σ n max n σ generally speaking the larger the value of n σ the more accurate the calculation result of k m c will be but the corresponding calculation time will increase greatly the calculation results of k m c when n σ is 100 200 and 500 are compared in appendix b by comparison it is found that the calculated error of k m c is within 2 under the three assumptions so n σ 100 is taken in this paper according to the total service life n t o t a l and the nominal stress probability density function the possible cycle times n k j in the j th stress range can be obtained based on the notch stress s n curve the possible total cycle times of the structure in a specific stress range can be calculated by the following formula 21 n f k j 10 log a k j m log δ σ n k j k m c k g k w where log a k j is the intercept between the notch stress s n curve and abscissa when fat 225 curve with inverse slope of 5 is adopted it follows n 18 46 0 4 dong et al 2019 k w is the stress amplification factor caused by welding local geometry k g is the stress amplification factor caused by geometry size of welded specimen for butt welded joints k w k g 1 5 and k w k g 1 8 for t joints and cruciform welded joints as shown in fig 8 the cumulative damage degree is taken as the evaluation index of program cycle or output according to miner s rule when the damage degree is greater than 1 the structure fails however many experimental studies show that the critical value of cumulative fatigue damage degree is not always close to 1 but a random variable with a median value close to 1 it is also assumed that the critical value of cumulative fatigue damage degree obeys lognormal distribution with mean value of 1 and coefficient of variation of 0 3 dong et al 2019 once the initial value range of critical stress amplification factor is given the total fatigue damage can be calculated according to miner s rule if the difference between the estimated total damage degree d i and the target damage degree d k is less than or equal to 0 001 the k mc value at this time is output if this condition is not met the upper limit or lower limit of the stress amplification coefficient is updated according to the comparison result between the estimated total damage degree d i and the target damage degree d k thus obtaining a new k mck value assuming that the critical stress amplification factor k m c obeys lognormal distribution as shown in fig 9 it shows the mean and standard deviation corresponding to different q in logarithmic coordinates and the corresponding values are shown in appendix c table c1 with the increase of scale parameter q the maximum stress increases and the corresponding critical stress amplification factor k m c decreases as shown in fig 9a because the stress amplification factor k w k g of t welded joint is larger than that of butt welded joint the corresponding critical stress amplification factor k m c is also smaller than that of butt welded joint 3 2 fatigue reliability evaluation of typical welded joints after the critical stress amplification factor of welded joint is determined the reliability of typical welded joint can be evaluated based on jc method taking the fixed boundary condition as an example when x 0 the limit state equation of butt welded joint can be expressed by substituting eqs 2 3 and 5 into eq 18 22 f x x k m c 1 3 δ 0 t 1 1 3 l 2 t 1 α l e m e m 2 4 α g m e m e m 2 α l α g m 2 where m 2 3 1 μ 2 σ n o m e l t 1 2 for butt welded joints of thin plates combined with the measured values of welding defects given in literature lillemäe et al 2012 the values of corresponding parameters and distribution function types are presented in table 1 taking the scale parameter q 2 as an example the fatigue reliability evaluation process is deduced in detail because the stress amplification factor formula in the limit state equation comprehensively considers the influence of welding dislocation welding angular deformation and welding initial deformation the partial derivatives of each parameter in the complex function need to be deduced in detail when the partial derivatives of each parameter in the limit state equation are solved the corresponding reliability indexes can be obtained according to eq 16 and eq 17 the derivative produced in the limit state equation is expressed as 23 g k m c 1 24 g

σ n o m 3 32 0 022 β at the end of the first iteration a new set of coordinate values of failure points can be obtained thus starting the next iteration when the error of β value calculated in two adjacent times is small the iteration ends and the last iteration value is taken as the final failure index the iteration process and corresponding results are shown in table 2 when q 2 the final failure index is 4 99 and the corresponding safety probability is p s φ 4 99 1 for t shaped and cruciform welded specimens under the fixed boundary condition considering x 0 the limit state equation can be obtained according to eq 8 as follows 29 f x x k m c 1 3 δ 0 t 1 1 3 l t 2 2 t 1 α l e m e m 2 4 α g m e m e m 2 α l α g m 2 referring to the measured values of welding defects given in literature xing and dong 2016 ottersböck et al 2018 the values of corresponding parameters and distribution function types for t joints and cruciform joints are presented in table 3 as shown in fig 10 the fatigue reliability indexes of butt joints t welded joints and crucifom welded specimens are obtained according to jc method and the modified formula in this paper and the corresponding values are shown in appendix c table c2 the fatigue reliability index obtained by jc method corresponds to the cumulative distribution probability corresponding to the standard normal distribution when the fatigue reliability index is 2 the corresponding safety probability is 97 7 the greater the reliability coefficient the greater the safety probability it can be seen from fig 10 that with the increase of scale parameter q the corresponding critical stress amplification coefficient decreases and the fatigue reliability index of typical welded joints decreases accordingly among the three kinds of specimens the corresponding reliability index for t joints is the largest because the t welded specimen has no welding misalignment and local angular deformation and its overall angular deformation value is the smallest 4 tolerance analysis and discussion 4 1 tolerance analysis based on specification in the design process of welded joints of ship structures it is assumed that the allowable tolerances of axial and angular misalignment given in shipbuilding standards are not exceeded it is also considered that the deviation from ideal structure to fabricated structure should not exceed the tolerance specified in relevant shipbuilding standards eggert et al 2012 the german shipbuilding industry production standard vsm 2003 took the transverse deformation e 0 as the measurement index of the global angular deformation α g as shown in fig 2 e 0 l 2 tan α g 2 and put forward a tolerance limit of 5 l 200 mm depth for the transverse deformation iso 5817 2006 did not specify the limit of transverse deformation but it presented the adhesion tolerance for axial misalignment and angle defects dong et al 2019 considered that the axial misalignment of butt welded joints should not exceed 0 15 times of plate thickness t 1 and the transverse deformation should not exceed 6 mm the tolerance values of welding defects given by different specifications are shown in table 4 in this paper the length of t shaped specimen and cruciform joint is between 160 mm and 210 mm and the transverse deformation limit is calculated to be about 6 mm therefore in order to evaluate the tolerance limits introduced by the code and test its reliability level the tolerance limits shown in table 5 are used to calculate the fatigue reliability indexes of three typical welded joints it is assumed that the distribution of welding misalignment and transverse deformation obeys the standard normal distribution and the corresponding value is taken as half of the recommended value δ 0 n 0 0 15 t 1 2 e 0 n 0 6 2 taking a series of test pieces in literature lillemäe et al 2012 xing and dong 2016 ottersböck et al 2018 as evaluation objects according to the welding misalignment and welding angle deformation limits given in table 5 as measurement indexes the fatigue reliability index of typical welded joints is calculated in fig 11 and the corresponding values are shown in appendix c table c3 by comparison the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the critical stress amplification coefficient obtained by monte carlo method is inversely proportional to the scale coefficient so the reliability index decreases with the increase of the scale coefficient 2 considering that the critical stress amplification factor of butt welded joint is the largest the reliability index will be larger under the same axial misalignment and transverse deformation 3 the thickness of plate has obvious influence on the value of fatigue reliability index of welded specimens taking the butt joint specimen as an example the reliability index of the specimen with 10 mm thickness is about twice that of the specimen with 3 mm thickness under the same size parameters the reliability index of the specimen with 10 mm thickness is about 1 5 times as high as that of the specimen with 5 mm thickness therefore it is unreasonable to take the same transverse deformation limit for specimens with different plate thicknesses and the influence of plate thickness should be taken into account in the selection of transverse deformation limit for welded specimens 4 under the same reliability index the corresponding scale parameters of thin plates are much smaller it is assumed that the reliability index β 2 safety probability p s 97 7 is taken as the measure index of specimen safety for butt joints when the plate thickness is 10 mm and the scale parameter is less than 7 the reliability requirement of β 2 can be met when the plate thickness is 5 mm and the scale parameter is less than 5 it meets the requirement of β 2 however when the plate thickness is equal to 3 mm the requirement of β 2 requires that the scale parameter be less than 3 similar conclusions are reached for t joints and cruciform joints but the transverse deformation limits given by traditional codes do not consider the influence of plate thickness 5 in addition the influence of initial welding deformation is not considered in the traditional code and when the influence of initial welding is considered the fatigue reliability index of the specimen will be further reduced therefore it is necessary to study the transverse deformation limits and the initial deformation limits of thin plate welded specimens according to the fatigue reliability evaluation method 4 2 deformation limit considering welding initial deformation the above evaluation results show that the transverse deformation limit of welded joints should consider the influence of specimen thickness in addition the influence of initial welding deformation should also be considered for thin plate welded specimens considering different angular deformation ratios α g α l with the safety probability of 97 7 as the measurement index the results of the transverse deformation tolerance of three kinds of welded joints when β 2 are re evaluated with reference to the welding misalignment tolerance given in table 5 as shown in figs 12 14 in most cases the transverse deformation limit of thin plate welded joints is less than 6 mm the detailed evaluation values are presented in appendix c tables c4 c6 the results show that the transverse deformation limit is not only related to the thickness of the plate but also with the increase of angular deformation ratio the limit of transverse deformation will decrease by comparison it can be found that 1 because the critical stress amplification factor of t shaped welded joint is the same as that of cruciform joint but welding misalignment is not considered in t shaped welded specimen the transverse deformation limit of t shaped welded joint is larger than that of cruciform welded joint under different angular deformation ratio taking the calculation results with a thickness of 10 mm as an example when the angular deformation ratio is α g α l 1 the transverse deformation limit of t welded joint is about 3 5 mm larger than that of cruciform joint and when the angular deformation ratio is 2 the transverse deformation limit of t welded joint is about 2 5 mm larger than that of cross joint when the angular deformation ratio is 4 the difference of transverse deformation decreases to about 2 mm 2 plate thickness has great influence on the transverse deformation limit and the transverse deformation limit of welded joint is approximately proportional to the plate thickness t 1 when α l α g 1 the transverse deformation limit calculated by butt joint with thickness of 10 mm is basically greater than 6 mm however for the butt joint with a thickness of 3 mm it is calculated that the transverse deformation limit will be less than 6 mm it shows that the limit value of transverse deformation given in the traditional code is not suitable for thin plate welded joints and the method presented in this paper can be used to calculate the limit value of transverse deformation under specific size and thickness 3 the initial deformation also has a great influence on the transverse deformation limit for three typical welded joints the transverse deformation limit of α l α g 2 is about 0 8 times that of α l α g 1 and that of α l α g 4 is only about 0 5 times that of α l α g 4 for thin plates with thickness less than 5 mm when α l α g 1 there are still some points above the straight line of e 0 6 mm as shown in fig 12 but when α l α g 4 the transverse deformation limits are calculated to be less than 6 mm 5 conclusions based on monte carlo method and jc method this paper considers the initial welding deformation of thin plate welded joints and applies the formula of stress amplification factor proposed by shen et al 2019 to the fatigue reliability evaluation of three kinds of thin plate welded joints 1 according to the experimental data of typical welded specimens the reliability index of welded structures is obtained by jc method with the increase of scale parameters the reliability index decreases considering the reliability index β 2 the scale parameter of butt welded joint and cross joint is about 6 while the scale parameter of t welded joint is about 10 the main reason for the large scale coefficient of t welded specimen is that the main board of t welded specimen is continuous small welding misalignment and welding angle deformation cause the corresponding reliability index to be too large 2 the plate thickness has a great influence on the fatigue reliability index of typical welded joints while the limit value of transverse deformation given by traditional codes does not consider the influence of plate thickness according to the welding dislocation and transverse deformation limits recommended by the traditional code the reliability indexes of three kinds of welded joints are calculated it is found that when the plate thickness is 10 mm the fatigue reliability index is 2 safety probability p s 97 7 with the scale parameter q 7 when the plate thickness is 3 mm the required scale parameter is q 3 when the calculated fatigue reliability index is 2 3 the existence of initial deformation will increase the stress concentration coefficient of welded joints thus reducing the reliability index the influence of initial deformation should also be considered when evaluating the fatigue reliability of thin plate welded joints the calculation results show that for three typical welded joints the transverse deformation limit of α l α g 2 is about 0 8 times that of α l α g 1 and that of α l α g 4 is only about 0 5 times that of α l α g 4 4 the proposed method based on notch stress amplification factor can both consider the influence of welding misalignment welding angular deformation welding initial deformation weld geometry and size effect on reliability results in addition the scale parameter of external load distribution and damage value are also the main influencing factors of reliability index therefore it is difficult to quantify the welding defect tolerance by using a unified formula for welded joints with different welding geometry and load conditions but for welded joints with specific dimensions the corresponding welding defect tolerance can be calculated by using the renewed

20371,ice breaking processes of an icebreaker are complex and many numerical models are proposed to predict the ice breaking performance under the same polar conditions different prediction models may derive different ice breaking performances hence it is necessary to analyze the influences of different prediction models and their corresponding input factors on the ice breaking performance however there is almost no relevant study on such issues and it is urgent to fill this gap in this study different prediction models of the ice resistance are compared and analyzed subsequently a global sensitivity analysis sa of the ice breaking performance is performed for key input factors including structure control and ice parameters results show that the same input factors have appreciably different influences on the ice breaking performance between different models besides a global sensitivity of the maximized ice breaking performance to structure parameters is analyzed finding that the ship width is the most decisive factor impacts of different prediction models on the maximized ice breaking performance regarding control parameters are also studied results indicate that model selection greatly influences the optimal performance and controls finally an sa based design process for the icebreaker is established which can help perform the design work in a relatively efficient and economical way keywords polar icebreaker global sensitivity analysis ice resistance maximized ice breaking performance 1 introduction currently the developments of the polar scientific expedition the polar resource exploitation and the arctic shipping routes have sparked rising interest in the design optimizations of the polar icebreaker and the corresponding ice breaking performance differing from the open water sailing arctic navigation should inevitably face the ice resistance caused by the ice breaking operation however the ship ice interactions during the ice breaking processes are fairly complex while sailing in the polar ice the icebreaker firstly partially extrudes the ice layer the corresponding local extrusion pressure increases as the icebreaker sails onward and the contact area between the ice and the hull will increase meanwhile during this process the bending stress of the ice layer gradually increases which eventually leads to the bending fracture of the ice layer then the broken ice begins to roll down slides along the hull and eventually reaches positions either on the sides or at the stern as can be analyzed from above ice resistance is fundamentally different compared with the water resistance manifesting in many characteristics including strong discontinuity large amplitude strong nonlinearity etc thus accurate prediction for the ice resistance is very critical for the poler icebreaker to meet the engineering requirements like structural reliability engine power estimation shaft design and ice breaking route planning in the polar navigation two forms of ice layer do usually exist due to the uneven temperature distribution including the level ice and the floe ice and the ice resistance of the icebreaker is influenced greatly by the ice forms due to the complexity of the ship ice interaction between the icebreaker and ice layer while ice breaking an accurate ice resistance is generally challenging to predict especially combined with complex polar environment in the literature a number of prediction models have been proposed for estimating the ice resistance for level ice and floe ice for the level ice ice resistance prediction models include the lindqvist model lindqvist 1989 the keinonen model keinonen 1996 the jeong model jeong et al 2010 etc for the floe ice ice resistance prediction models mainly include the bronnikov model bronnikov 1959 the vance model vance 1980 the kashtelyan model kashtelyan 1968 etc each prediction model of the ice resistance has its own characteristics for example the lindqvist method takes into account the influence of the friction and the hull shape on the ice resistance but the effect of ship speed cannot be accurately described for this reason the lindqvist method cannot scientifically describe the icebreaking process and can only be used for preliminary estimation for the ice resistance during the design stage for the riska method the ship speed is assumed to vary linearly and the prediction results depend only on the principal dimension and the bow angle of the ship so it also cannot detailly explain the ice breaking process but the riska method can be used to estimate main engine power by combining the propeller thrust during the initial design stage of an icebreaker for the buzuev model it can only be applied to meso and micro scale floe ice through analyzing mainly two types of establishing methods are applied to develop the prediction models of the ice resistance namely the model test and the empirical calculation respectively all the prediction models have totally different formulas so it is necessary to explore the differences between various prediction models of the ice resistance in addition accurate performance prediction of the ice breaking operation depends to a great extent on the accuracy flexibility and reliability of the established prediction models each prediction model has its own specific characteristics and input factors and these factors may have different effects on prediction accuracy therefore it is significant to explore the sensitivity of ice breaking performance to control structure and ice parameters sensitivity analysis sa is a technique to qualitatively or quantitatively study how the outputs of a model changes with different changing sources and how a given model changes depending on the changing information input to the model wang et al 2019 through the sa process relevant engineers studying polar ice breaking can gain a deeper understanding of performance prediction and make more reasonable choices from different prediction models sa is helpful to determine the main influencing parameters and improve the informed application select the appropriate prediction model in the complex polar environment and further improve the known prediction models 1 1 performance analysis for icebreaker currently many existing literatures focus on the ice breaking performance of different types of icebreakers long et al 2020 adopted the discrete element method dem to explore the ice breaking performance of the conical structures with respect to the ice thickness the ice velocity the cone diameter the cone angle and the ice breaking length jou et al 2019 also used the bonded dem simulations to predict different failure modes of the interactions between the icebreaker bow and the floe ice with different dimensions and thickness finding that the established bonded dem can accurately capture complex ice fracture phenomena huisman et al 2016 developed a numerical model to predict the interaction between the vessel and the surrounding level ice and validated the accuracy of this numerical simulation using a two dimensional ice breaking model of an elastic beam ding et al 2020 performed a sloshing simulation of the ice breaking lng carrier by considering the union action between ice breaking and liquid sloshing finding that the increase of the internal sloshing force weakens the ice breaking capability of the lng carrier li 2016 proposed a semi empirical numerical method to evaluate the level ice breaking process based on actual ice breaking operation and results showed that the established model can make an acceptable prediction on average resistance and velocity with certain accuracy zhang et al 2019 used a smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method to simulate the ice failure process and performed comparative experiments to certify the reliability and accuracy of the simulation 1 2 sa used in the ice breaking operation sa has been widely adopted for the ice breaking operation to carry out the performance analysis of the icebreaker for example myland and ehlers 2016 investigated the influences of the breaking patterns and geometric bow parameters on the ice breaking resistance finding that the lindqvist model should be refined for some special applications wang et al 2020 carried out an sa on the ice resistance of an exploration ship to the ice conditions including the density and the thickness of ice layer and performed numerical simulation to verify the change trend of the ice resistance theocharis et al 2019 conducted an sa to assess how fuel prices ice breaking fees and reduced speed on ice affect the minimum required freight rate of different sea routes finding that ice breaking fees is the most crucial factor considerably affecting the competitiveness qiao et al 2016 performed an sa of the average ice load in different directions to the ice elasticity modulus the ice thickness and the ship speed finding that the maximum ice loads are proportional to ice thickness and ship speed raza et al 2019 investigated the sensitivity of the performance of the icebreaker to friction and form drag coefficients and confirmed the optimal configuration of the coefficients for the optimal ice breaking performance xiao 2019 carried out a sensitivity study to investigate the impacts on the ice resistance from various parameters of ice and ship hull finding that the ice thickness and ice concentration have the greatest influences on the resistance although the existing literature has carried out many in depth studies on the ice breaking performance of the icebreaker most of the current work is carried out from a qualitative view rather than from a quantitative one and there is also no relevant work currently performing the sensitivity analysis on the optimization processes of the ice breaking performance for an icebreaker understanding the relationships between different prediction models of the ice resistance is helpful to the design and analysis of the icebreaker under complex ice conditions therefore the performance evaluations of the ice breaking operations by different prediction models should be compared and analyzed in addition through global sa the influences of input factors on different prediction models and the maximum ice breaking performance of the icebreaker should be studied to provide a reasonable basis for selecting a suitable model the reminder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses the prediction models of the ice resistance for level ice and floe ice and makes detail analysis and comparison between different prediction models in section 3 the sa on the ice resistance to structure parameters control parameters and ice property parameters are performed for breaking the level ice and the floe ice respectively then the sa on the maximized ice breaking performance is carried out for the level ice and the floe ice in section 4 in section 5 the influences of different prediction models on the maximized ice breaking performance are studied section 6 gives the concluding remarks 2 ice breaking performance prediction models 2 1 ice resistance up to now a number of ice resistance prediction models have been established in the literature for the polar icebreaker most of the proposed ice resistance models are based on the empirical methods which are adequately taken into account the relations between the ice resistance and the relevant parameters including hull structures sea ice properties seawater properties controls ship speed etc on the premise of some indispensable preconditions the empirical equations for estimating the ice resistance can be deduced using regression analysis methods based on the relevant practical or numerical experiments in the polar navigation two ice forms do usually exist due to the uneven temperature distribution including the level ice and the floe ice the ice resistance of the icebreaker is influenced greatly by the ice forms therefore both of the ice forms are studied in this work 2 2 analysis of ice resistance for breaking level ice 2 2 1 ice resistance for breaking level ice for breaking the level ice the resistance encountered by the icebreaker primarily comes from two processes ice crushing and ice displacing respectively su et al 2010 based on these two processes and some other relevant hypotheses a number of ice resistance models for breaking level ice are established in the literature among these models seven are taken into account in this work for sensitivity analysis including the lindqvist model the keinonen model the riska model the jeong model the vance model the lewis model and the edwards model lindqvist model in the lindqvist model the ice resistance is comprised of three parts namely the crushing resistance the ice resistance caused by bending and the submerging resistance lindqvist 1989 studied the influences of the hull form the cruising speed and the physical properties of the level ice on the ice resistance then the theoretical model of the ice resistance was proposed by correcting by relevant experiments the final lindqvist model of the ice resistance can be given as 1 r i l i r c r b 1 1 4 v g h i r s 1 9 4 v g l where r c n is the crushing resistance of the bow r b n is the resistance of the ice bending failure r s n is the water resistance v m s is the ship speed g m s 2 is the acceleration of gravity h i m is ice thickness and l m is the ship length for the level ice the crushing resistance of the bow r c can be obtained as 2 r c 0 5 σ f h i 2 tan ψ cos ψ μ cos ϕ cos ψ μ sin ϕ where σ f pa is the bending strength of the level ice sheet ϕ degree is the stem angle and μ is the friction coefficient between ice and ship hull ψ arctan tan ϕ sin α where α degree is the waterline entrance angle the bending failure is the main failure mode of the level ice the corresponding resistance of the ice bending failure r b is given as 3 r b 27 σ f b h i 1 5 32 e 3 1 υ 2 g ρ w tan ψ μ cos ϕ cos ψ sin α 1 1 cos ψ where e gpa is the young s modulus of the ice sheet b m is the ship width ρ w kg m 3 is the density of the sea water and υ is the poisson s ratio the water resistance r s includes the energy loss and frictional resistance between the hull and the sea ice so it can be described as 4 r s ρ w ρ i g h i b t b t b 2 t μ 0 7 l t tan ϕ b 4 tan α t cos ϕ cos ψ 1 sin ϕ 2 1 tan α 2 where t m is the deep draft and ρ i kg m 3 is the density of the sea ice keinonen model keinonen model takes the principal ship dimensions hull form seawater property hull surface temperature etc into account to describe the ice resistance for the level ice keinonen 1996 when the ice breaking speed of the ship is 1 m s the expression of the keinonen model for the level ice is 5 r i k 1 0 015 f c f s f i 6 f c c s c h b 0 7 l 0 2 t 0 1 7 f s 1 0 0018 90 ψ 1 6 1 0 003 φ 5 1 5 8 f i 1 0 0083 t 30 0 63 0

factor of the sea water and the roughness factor of the hull surface respectively and t c is the air temperature for the situation when the ship speed is larger than 1 m s the keinonen model takes another presentation to predict the ice resistance as follows 9 r i k r o r i δ r i 10 δ r i 0 009 v 1 g l b 1 5 t 0 5 h i c h k 11 k 1 0 0018 90 ψ 1 4 1 0 003 φ 5 1 5 1 0 0083 t 30 where r o n r i n and δ r i n are the resistance in the open water zone the ice resistance at speed v and the augmentation of ice resistance when ship speed is larger than 1 m s respectively riska model riska model to estimate the ice resistance for level ice is improved from the lindqvist model riska et al 1997 the relevant empirical coefficients to correct the riska model are determined by ship experiments at the baltic sea in the riska model the total ice resistance is expressed by two parts the water resistance and the ice resistance respectively the corresponding ice resistance is 12 r i r r o c 1 c 2 v 13 c 1 f 1 b 2 l m h i 2 t b 1 0 021 φ f 2 b h i 2 f 3 l b h i 2 f 4 b l b h i 14 c 2 1 0 063 φ g 1 h i 1 5 g 2 b h i g 3 h i 1 1 2 t b b 2 l where l m m is the length of the parallel middle body of the hull and l b m is the bow length of the hull f i s and g i s are the empirical coefficients and the corresponding values are listed in table 1 jeong model jeong model is an empirical estimation method of the ice resistance for the standard icebreaker model which is established based on the spencer model three components of the ice resistance are included in the jeong model the ice resistance the ice buoyancy and the de icing resistance respectively jeong et al 2010 so the jeong model can be demonstrated as 15 r i j 13 14 v 2 c b ρ w ρ i g h i b t c c f h m ρ i b h i v 2 c b r s n n ρ i b h i v 2 s n v ρ i b σ b h i f h v g h i where c b is the ice buoyancy coefficient c c is the de icing resistance coefficient c b r is the ice resistance coefficient f h is the froude number s n is the intensity factor m is the power index of the froude number and n is the power index of the intensity factor usually the corresponding values of the dimensionless parameters used in jeong model are listed in table 2 vance model vance model is derived from the data extracted from the ice breaking experiments of a full scale icebreaker the corresponding prediction can be formulated as vance 1980 16 r i v 55 8583 ρ w ρ i g b h i 2 0 0188 σ f v b h i g lewis model the lewis model is proposed completely based on the experimental data of four actual ships all of which have different length 39 6 295 7 m and width scales 7 3 45 7 m by assuming the ice layer is isotropic and the ice thickness is constant the lewis model is established based on the experimental data fitting and it can be written as lewis et al 1982 17 r i l e 3 8989 0 0123 σ f ρ w g h i 0 223 v l g b h i ρ w g b h i 2 whereas the experimental data of the ice thickness used to establish the lewis model is mainly concentrated in the region larger than 0 46 m which causes a higher prediction of the lewis model than the reality edwards model edwards model is improved from the previous empirical formulas based on the results of the real ship tests and it can be presented as following edwards et al 1976 18 r i e ρ w g b h i 2 4 24 0 05 σ f ρ w g h i 8 9 f n 2 2 2 analysis of the ice resistance breaking level ice in analysis of the ice resistance breaking level ice in this section the properties of the ice are listed in table 3 and the icebreaker parameters are listed in table 4 fig 1 shows the variations of the ice resistance of the level ice with the increasing ice thickness with respect to different prediction models it is noted that the corresponding ship speed for deducing the results of fig 1 is 2 m s to explore intensively the relations between different ice resistance prediction models the range of the ice thickness is set to be 0 3 m for the full thickness domain of ice the ice resistance predicted by the edwards model takes the maximum value conversely the jeong model predicts the minimum value of the ice resistance for breaking the level ice by analyzing fig 1 it is concluded that the tendencies of these seven models varying with the ice thickness can be classified into two types the high estimated type and the low estimated type respectively for the high estimated type it includes the edwards model the vance model and the lewis model the rest ice resistance prediction models including the lindqvist model the keinonen model the riska model and the jeong model all belong to the low estimated type within the scope of the low estimated type the ranking of the predicted ice resistance from biggest to smallest remains the same with the ice thickness varying namely the keinonen model the riska model the lindqvist model and the jeong model however a different situation happens within the scope of the high estimated type when the ice thickness h i is less than 1 90 m the vance model predicts the smallest ice resistance among the high estimated type when the ice thickness h i is larger than 1 90 m the lewis model predicts the smallest ice resistance by taking a holistic view of fig 1 it is observed that the ranking of the prediction models will be complicated especially when the ice thickness is smaller than 1 25 m the corresponding ranking of the ice resistance predicted by different models can be figured out by careful observation on fig 1 the variations of the ice resistance of the level ice with the increasing ship speed with respect to different prediction models are illustrated in fig 2 similarly the ice resistance of the level ice following the increasing ship speed can also be classified into high estimated type and low estimated type respectively the high estimated type includes the edwards model and the lewis model ranked from large to small the low estimated type includes the vance model the keinonen model the riska model the lindqvist model and the jeong model ranked from large to small from an overall perspective all the prediction models except for vance model preserve the original ordering with the ice thickness varying for the vance model its prediction for the ice resistance increases slowly with the increasing ship speed by combining figs 1 and 2 it is concluded that the edwards model can lead to a more highly stable design than other ice resistance models no matter whether the design process of the icebreaker focuses on the ice thickness ice breaking ability or the ship speed 2 3 analysis of ice resistance for breaking floe ice 2 3 1 ice resistance for breaking floe ice bronnikov model bronnikov model is established based on the model tests of cargo ships to predict the ice resistance of the floe ice it is also a correlating model and can be written as bronnikov 1959 19 r i b r d d s h i h i h c c n d d p l b l b q c b c b r b b 1 b b 1 k where r n is the ice resistance of reference ship d ton is the ship displacement c is the ice concentration d m is the ice floe diameter c b is the ship block coefficient and b 1 is the ice channel width s m n p q r and k are the parametric coefficients depending on the froude number and can be deduced as 20 s 1 m p 3 21 m 0 267 f r 0 67 22 n 0 785 f r 0 493 23 p 1 65 f r 0 42 0 35 24 q 1 93 f r 0 42 0 6 25 r 3 24 f r 2 27 1 25 26 k 0 034 f r 1 31 when the ice thickness is 0 8 m and the ice concentration is 0 8 the ice resistance can be written as 27 r i b 977 f r 1 42 d 10920 s h i 0 8 m c 0 8 n d 7 3 p 6 6 l b q 0 65 c b r 15 b b t k nogid model nogid model is also an empirical expression for ice resistance for broken ice proposed through ship model testing nogid 1959a b it can be cast as 28 r i n ρ w l m b n r k h p d c f h q where coefficients including m n k p and q are the empirical exponents which depend on ice concentration buzuev model buzuev mode is another model testing based resistance prediction model of the floe ice and it can be presented as buzuev and ryvlin 1961 29 r i b c 1 l 0 5 b 0 25 c 2 c 3 f h 1 25 where c 1 c 2 and c 3 are the empirical coefficients related to the ship hull form and the ice floe conditions aboul azm 1989 kashtelyan model kashtelyan model is a semi empirical formula to predict the ice resistance in floe ice kashtelyan 1968 30 r i k σ i r h i b 2 2 k 1 1 2 μ α h l b k 4 μ α w l c b k 2 σ i r h i b μ α h tan α 0 f h k 3 σ i r h i l t tan 2 α 0 f h 2 where r is the ice floe extent σ i is the specific mass of ice α h is the waterplane area coefficient of bow area and α 0 degree is the half of entering angle of the bow part of the ship k 1 k 2 k 3 and k 4 are the empirical coefficients vance model vance model is proposed using full scale ice breaking experiments and the corresponding expressions of ice resistance in floe ice with thicknesses being 0 46 m and 1 22 m respectively are as follows vance 1980 31 r i v 0 1209 ρ w ρ i g b h i 2 0 0622 ρ i v 2 l b 0 35 h i 0 65 32 r i v 4 412 ρ w ρ i g b h i 2 0 0306 ρ i v 2 l b 0 35 h i 0 65 greisman model greisman model is another empirical model to predict the ice resistance for the floe ice greisman 1981 33 r i g 1 23 4 v l g 0 12 1 5 levine model levine model for the ice resistance prediction of the floe ice is proposed based on the model testing of a great lake bulk carrier levine et al 1974 the empirical relationship of the levine model for ice resistance in floe ice is as following 34 r i l 1 29 ρ i g b h i 2 1 365 v 2 ρ i b h i 2 3 2 analysis of the ice resistance breaking floe ice as explained above it is seen that some of the prediction models for breaking floe ice is only valid at certain ice thickness e g 0 46 m and 1 22 m for the vance model and 0 8 m for the bronnikov model therefore variations of the ice resistance breaking floe ice with increasing ship speed are analyzed at three different ice thicknesses including 0 46 m 0 8 m and 1 22 m figs 3 4 and 5 illustrate the variations of the ice resistance with increasing ship speed for breaking 0 46 m 0 80 m and 1 22 m thick floe ice respectively it is seen that all the ice resistance models for breaking floe ice predict the ice resistance to be increasing functions with respect to the increasing ship speed however the increasing rates of different prediction models at these three ice thicknesses are not exactly the same when the floe ice layer is 0 46 m thick the kashtelyan model has the maximum increasing magnitudes within the range of ship speed when the floe ice layer is 0 8 m thick and 1 22 m thick the bronnikov model has the maximum increasing magnitudes compared with other prediction models from figs 3 4 and 5 it is observed that the ranking order of the prediction models from large to small are different with the increasing ship speed whatever the thickness of the floe ice layer is however the maximum predicted resistance with the increasing ship speed in different floe ice thicknesses is almost all determined by the levine model and the nogid model the levine model predicts the maximum ice resistance at low speeds and the nogid model predicts the maximum ice resistance at high speeds specially when the floe ice layer is 0 46 m thick the kashtelyan model exceeds the nogid model and outputs the maximum ice resistance at high ship speeds by comprehensively considering figs 3 4 and 5 the levine model can guarantee a more highly reliable design for the icebreaker at low ship speed and the nogid model can guarantee a more highly reliable design for the icebreaker at high ship speed variations of the ice resistance predicted by different models with increasing thickness of the floe ice are illustrated in fig 6 it should be noted that marks and denote the models being only applicable to certain floe ice thickness including the bronnikov model h i 0 80 m and vance model h i 0 46 m and 1 22 m respectively by analyzing fig 6 all the prediction models can also be classified into three types including the high estimated type the intermediate estimated type and the low estimated type for the high estimated type only the levine model is involved the buzuev model the nogid model and the mellor model belong to the intermediate estimated type the low estimated type includes the greisman model and the kashtelyan model from fig 6 there are many points of intersection between different resistance curves which means that the ranking order of the predicted resistance from large to small are varying with the increasing ice thickness comparatively it is seen that the buzuev model predicts the maximum ice resistance while breaking the relatively thin layer of ice and the levine model predicts the maximum ice resistance while breaking the relatively thick layer of ice in other words if the designed icebreaker is to break relatively thin ice layer the buzuev model can be a better selection for ice resistance prediction if the designed icebreaker is to break relatively thick ice layer the levine model should be better 3 sa of the ice resistance for the icebreaker sa can find out the parameters that have great impacts on the system performance and analyze the stability of the corresponding optimization process especially when the original data is inconsistent or unstable the sa process can clearly guide the next optimization process based on the sa process the most reasonable and critical parameters can be selected for the design optimization under the interaction between different types of parameters in view of the great significance to optimization methods and optimization evaluations many sa methods have been proposed in the literature such as the sobol method sobol 1990 and the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast saltelli and bolado 1998 in this study the sobol method is adopted to perform the sa an overview of the sobol method is provided in section 3 1 3 1 sobol method essentially the sobol sa is a variance based monte carlo method and the detail computational principle is presented as follows suppose a model function has k input variables namely 35 y f x f x 1 x 2 x 3 x k where 0 x i 1 the main idea of the sobol sa method is to decompose the function model f x into a cumulative form of multiple dimensionally increasing functions the cumulative form can be written as 36 f x 1 x k f 0 i 1 k f i x i 1 i j k f i j x i x j f 1 2 k x 1 x k where f 0 is a constant and f i 1 i f x i 1 x i f 1 i 1 i s n is the function of x i 1 i f for each of the above cumulative functions with the corresponding input variables the integral result must be 0 37 0 1 f i 1 i 2 i k x i 1 x i k d x i 1 d x i s 0 1 k s it is certified by sobol sobol 1993 that eq 36 can be transferred to a cumulative decomposition mode and all the corresponding cumulative terms can be obtained using multiple integrals thus the total variance of f x can be described as 38 v ω k f 2 x d x f 0 2 where ω k x 0 x i 1 i 1 2 k the partial variances can be obtained from 36 given by 39 v i 1 i 2 i s 0 1 0 1 f i 1 i 2 i s 2 x i 1 x i k d x i 1 x i k where 1 i 1 i s k and s 1 2 k by squaring and integrating 36 over the entire ω k it is obtained that 40 v i 1 k v i 1 i j k v 1 2 k so the sensitivity s i 1 i 2 i s can be described as 41 s i 1 i 2 i s s i 1 i 2 i s v 1 i 1 i s k s i is the first order sensitivity index of x i that represents the main impact on the output y s i j i j is the second order sensitivity index that represents the cross impact of x i and x j on the output y the total sensitivity index of x i is the sum of all order sensitivity indices liu et al 1986 given by 42 s t i s i j i the sensitivity indices of all the input variables must satisfy the following condition 43 i 1 k s i 1 i j k s i j s 1 2 k 1 so the total sensitivity index of x i can be deduced using the variance v i that is the sum of variances of all input variables except x i homma and saltelli 1996 44 s t i 1 v i v 3 2 upper and lower bounds of input parameters as compared in section 2 many prediction models of the ice resistance are proposed based on different theories and methods e g the experimental methods so different parameters with respect to structure environment and control are emphasized by different prediction models the detail parameter utilizations of different ice resistance prediction models for the level ice and the floe ice are listed in tables 5 and 6 respectively by analyzing the variability of the corresponding parameters in actual ice breaking conditions the final selected parameters for performing the sa in this study are listed in table 7 for the level ice the selected research variables includes nine structure parameters of the icebreaker l w b t ϕ α ψ l m l b and l four environmental parameters sea ice properties σ b h i ρ w and ρ i and one control parameter v for the floe ice the selected research variables includes two structure parameters of the icebreaker l w and b four environmental parameters sea ice properties r h i ρ w and ρ i and one control parameter v on basis of the icebreaker case relevant parameters are listed in table 4 used in this study and the actual polar environment the upper and lower bounds of the parameters with respect to the structure the environment and the control are set as shown in table 7 it should be noted that the upper and lower bounds of the relevant parameters determined in this section are based on the potential design requirements and indeed are empirical values 3 3 sa of the ice resistance 3 3 1 sa of the ice resistance for breaking level ice in this section the number of sample points selected for each input parameter used in the sobol method is 2000 fig 7 illustrates the sobol sensitivity index of the seven different ice resistance prediction models for breaking the level ice to 14 input parameters including l w b t ϕ α ψ l m l b l σ b h i ρ w ρ i and v it is seen that the impacts of different input parameters on the ice resistance change with the selection of the prediction models to some extent for the riska model the lindqvist model the jeong model the lewis model and the edwards model there are three major input factors influencing the ice resistance including b h i and v however under the keinonen model four decisive factors affect the predicted ice resistance namely b ϕ h i and v for the vance model only two input factors play decisive roles including b and h i for this difference it is mainly because all the prediction models are established using different means either relevant tests or vast practical experience which usually have different emphases in addition it is observed that the total order sensitivity index of each input factor is higher than the corresponding first order index which indicates that different parameters used in the prediction models are strongly coupled with each other to influence the ice resistance through comprehensive comparison no matter which prediction model is adopted for estimating ice resistance the most decisive input factor is always the ice thickness h i based on this conclusion it is seen that the ice thickness should be paid the greatest attention while performing the design of the icebreaker for example it is essential to investigate the ice conditions beforehand along the set shipping canal the ship width b is another decisive input factor affecting greatly on the value of the predicted ice resistance of all the models it is observed from fig 7 the ship width b is the second decisive input factor in the riska model the vance model and the lewis model and the third decisive input factor in the lindqvist model the jeong model and the edwards model under the keinonen model the ship width b is the forth decisive input factor affecting the ice resistance prediction thus the ship width should be designed carefully by balancing the available spaces on board and the ice resistance which is related to energy consumption and structural reliability besides ship speed v is also a decisive input factor of the ice resistance models under the lindqvist model the keinonen model the jeong model and the edwards model the ship speed v is the second decisive input factor under the riska model and the lewis model the ship speed v is the third decisive input factor specially the ship speed v performs a relatively non critical role under the vance model besides some other parameters also have some impacts on corresponding prediction models e g t and ψ for the lindqvist model and ϕ for the keinonen model 3 3 2 sa of the ice resistance for breaking floe ice similarly the sample size of each input parameter used in this section for sobol sa is also set to be 2000 the sa results of the ice resistance prediction models for breaking floe ice to seven input factors are illustrated in fig 8 compared with the sa results obtained in section 3 3 1 the sa results of the ice resistance for breaking floe ice show a completely different situation the correspondingly included decisive input factors vary a lot under different ice resistance prediction models for example two decisive input factors are under the greisman model namely l and v respectively however under the kashtelyan model totally five decisive input factors exist including v r b h i and l the sensitivity indexes of which rank from large to small such difference is caused by the different establishing ways of the ice resistance models for breaking floe ice either relevant tests or vast practical experience the same as the ice resistance models for breaking level ice the total order sensitivity index of each input factor is higher than the corresponding first order index meaning that great coupled effects between different parameters also exist in the ice resistance models for breaking floe ice unlike the ice resistance prediction models for breaking level ice there is only one input factor in common for all the ice resistance prediction models for breaking floe ice namely the ship speed v the ship speed v is the most decisive input factor under the nogid model the kashtelyan model and the greisman model and it is the second decisive input factor under the buzuev model however under the levine model the impact of the ship speed v is relatively small compared with other input factors another key parameter is the ice thickness h i which is the most decisive input factor under the levine model and the buzuev model and the second decisive input factor under the nogid model specially the ice thickness h i has no impact on the predicted ice resistance of the greisman model besides these three parameters analyzed above some other parameters also have disproportionate levels of influences on the ice resistance predicted by different models for instance the ice scope r shows greater impacts on the nogid model and the kashtelyan model than the ship width b the ship length l etc from table 6 it is seen that some of the prediction models contain the parameters of the sea ice density and the sea water density nevertheless the sa results of fig 8 show that the sea ice density and the sea water density have little impact on the final predicted resistance that is because the ranges of the actual sea ice density and the sea water density are relatively small which cannot bring about a large change of the ice resistance for breaking floe ice 4 sa on optimal ice breaking performance 4 1 promoted sa for optimization process for the design optimization of the engineering equipment minimization or maximization of the objective function is always set by taking into account the constraints on all aspects therefore it has greatly practical significance to study the sa on the optimization process to the corresponding designable variables e g the structure parameters in this study a promoted sa framework for dealing with the optimization process is established based on the conventional sa method fig 9 shows the differences between the general sa enclosed by the green dotted line and the sa promoted for an optimization process enclosed by the red dotted line in general sa process every generalized sample point of the input factors is calculated and analyzed directly using the pure simulation model or pure formula model however in the promoted sa for optimization process every generalized sample point of the input factors is to modify the process parameters not involved in the iterative optimization and is calculated and analyzed indirectly by the optimization process in other words a complete optimization process is carried out at each iteration of the sa process and the objective function value is served as the analysis object of the sa 4 2 optimization model establishment for maximizing the ice breaking performance in this section the sensitivity of the maximized ice breaking performance of the icebreaker to the relatively decisive structure parameters is studied based on the analysis performed in section 3 3 1 the relatively decisive structure parameters of the ice resistance model for breaking level ice are b t ϕ and ψ respectively during actual ice breaking operation in the polar region the ice conditions are complex and the corresponding thickness of the ice layer is random currently so many ice thickness prediction techniques have been proposed and successfully applied in the actual ice breaking operation then based on the predicted ice conditions the structure parameters of the icebreaker can be initially designed in the early stage of the ship design in order to furthest simulate the actual ice conditions the studied ice layer is assumed to have three different sets of continuous and isotropic ice layer with different thicknesses as illustrated in fig 10 the ice thicknesses from the 1st segment to the 3rd segment h i 1 h i 2 and h i 3 are set to be 0 5 m 1 5 m and 2 5 m respectively the length of every segment l 1 l 2 and l 3 is 1000 m the ice property is listed in table 3 in actual ice breaking process the marine pilot can change the ship speed of the designed icebreaker to adapt to different ice conditions thus the design variables of the optimization process is set to be the ship speeds in different ice segments namely 45 x v 1 v 2 v 3 the range of the design variables are determined based on the historical data and experience namely 0 v i 15 m s for the ice breaking process the icebreaker should complete the planned route rapidly with relatively low energy consumption thus two aspects should be taken into account while establishing the objective function namely the time consumption t b min and the energy consumption e b kwh in order to normalize the objective function and ensure a reasonable search speed of the optimization model a weight coefficient 10 10 is multiplied for the objective function in this study the final objective function established in this section is written as 46 min f x 1 0 10 t b e b i 0 3 l i v i t 0 t f r i v i d t where t 0 is the initial time and t f is the ending time to ensure feasibility and rationality of the design optimization relevant constraints should be given to the structure parameters of the icebreaker based on the ship statics great attentions should be paid to the reasonable proportion between different principal structure parameters of the icebreaker for icebreaker the ratio of l to b should be within the range from 5 to 6 and the ratio of b to t should be within the range from 2 to 3 besides the ice breaking power in each segment p b i kw should also be smaller than the maximum engine power p m kw the icebreaker can provide thus the corresponding constraints can be written as 47 g g 1 l b 6 g 2 5 l b g 3 b t 3 g 4 2 b t g 5 p b 1 4000 g 6 p b 2 4000 g 7 p b 3 4000 the final optimization model for performing the global sa can be cast as follows 48 find x v 1 v 2 v 3 min f x 1 0 10 t b e b s t g g 1 g 2 g 7 t 0 in accordance with the promoted sa for optimization process and the established optimization model the global sa problem can be established 4 3 sa results on maximized ice breaking performance 4 3 1 sa results on maximized ice breaking performance for level ice as mentioned above the structure parameters are usually taken as the design variables in the design optimization of the icebreaker so the sensitivity of the maximized ice breaking performance to the design variables is studied in this section the same to section 3 3 the sobol method is adopted in this section to perform the promoted sa for optimization process and the sample size of each input parameters is 1000 the corresponding ranges of the structure parameters can also be found in table 7 fig 11 illustrates the sa on the maximized ice breaking performance using different ice resistance prediction models for level ice it is observed that the impacts on the maximized ice breaking performing from the structure parameters of different prediction models are almost the same except the lindqvist model for the keinonen model the riska model the jeong model the vance model the lewis model and the edwards model the most decisive structure parameter influencing the maximized ice breaking performance is the ship width b such result is matched by the conclusion obtained from fig 7 namely the ship width b is the most decisive among the structure parameters by comparing figs 11 and 7 it is found that the deep draft t serves as another key parameter influencing the maximized ice breaking performance however the deep draft t has relatively small effects on the pure ice resistance this difference is caused by the change of the study object of the sa process namely from the pure ice resistance model to the maximized ice breaking performance specially when using the lindqvist model for ice breaking performance optimization the influence of input parameters is a bit more complicated than that only used for ice resistance prediction the contributing parameters b t and ψ in fig 7 all serve as the decisive input factors in fig 11 besides ϕ and α also have relevant influences on the maximized ice breaking performance to some extent similarly such difference for the lindqvist model is also caused by the change of the study object of the sa process it is also seen from fig 11 that the total order of the sensitivity index of every structure parameter is always larger than the corresponding first order which means that all the structure parameters are coupled with each other to influence the maximized ice breaking performance by making a global survey of the overall fig 11 it is concluded that the ship width b and the draft t should be paid a great attention while performing the design optimization of the icebreaker mainly used for breaking the level ice intuitively the influences of b and t on the maximized ice breaking performance can be directly perceived through the experience however for some other specific parameters e g ϕ α ψ and l m the intuition and the experience do not show obvious effects for holding the corresponding influences thus sa is indispensable to sorting out the relationships between the input factors and the maximized ice breaking performance of the icebreaker 4 3 2 sa results on the maximized ice breaking performance for floe ice for the sa on the maximized ice breaking performance for floe ice only two designable structure parameters are taken into account including the ship length l and the ship width b by comparing figs 12 and 8 it can be observed that the contributing structure parameter s is are consistent in agreement for no matter predicting the pure ice resistance or finding the maximized ice breaking performance for instance only the structure parameter b has impacts on the ice resistance and the maximized ice breaking performance under the levine model and the structure parameters l and b have influences on the ice resistance and the maximized ice breaking performance under the nogid model however when b and l simultaneously affect the prediction models under the nogid model the kashtelyan model and the buzuev model the corresponding effect levels for the ice resistance and the maximized ice breaking performance are different to some extant it is seen from figs 8 b to 8 d among the structures b is the decisive parameter for predicting the ice resistance nevertheless l is the decisive parameter for finding the maximized ice breaking performance as illustrated in figs 12 b to 12 d similarly such change of the decisive parameter is caused by the change of the study object of the sa process namely from the pure ice resistance model to the maximized ice breaking performance based on the above analysis it is concluded that b and l should be carefully designed and optimized beforehand based on the conditions of the floe ice in the polar region for a better ice breaking performance 5 impacts of different prediction models on the maximized ice breaking performance 5 1 impacts of different prediction models on the maximized ice breaking performance for the level ice for exploring the impacts of different resistance prediction models for the level ice on the ice breaking performance performance optimizations are performed for the icebreaker using seven resistance prediction models including the lindqvist model the keinonen model the riska model the jeong model the vance model the lewis model and the edwards model in this section the control parameters ship speeds are taken into account to undertake the optimization of the ice breaking performance of the icebreaker based on fixed structures as listed in table 4 as analyzed in section 4 2 the corresponding optimization model can be cast as 49 find x v 1 v 2 v 3 min f x 1 0 10 t b e b s t g g 1 p b 1 4000 g 2 p b 2 4000 g 3 p b 3 4000 in this study the series quadratic programming sqp algorithm is used to perform the optimization as the sqp algorithm is a local optimization algorithm so each optimization process of different prediction models is performed for 20 times to ensure that the globally optimal solution can be found by selecting the optimal result from the solution set the final iteration histories of the objective function and the constraint violation of the optimization processes using seven prediction models are illustrated in fig 13 as seen from 13 a the optimization processes using different prediction models gradually converge to the optimal values respectively and the corresponding iterations are different the constraint violations of the optimization processes using different prediction models are all 0 after certain iterations as illustrated in fig 13 b from which it is concluded that all the optimization processes are credible for finding the maximized ice breaking performance table 8 lists the optimization results using different ice resistance models of the level ice by combining fig 13 a it is seen that the optimal values of the objective functions vary a lot with different selections of the prediction models among the results the optimization performed using the jeong model can output the minimum objective value with the minimum time consumption and energy consumption however the optimization performed using the vance model outputs the maximum objective value with the maximum time consumption and energy consumption among all the obtained results for the control parameters of the icebreaker the corresponding ship speed decreases with the ice layer thickening so as to meet the requirements of the engine power limits as observed from table 8 the optimization using the jeong model can predict the largest ship speeds in all the three segments of the ice lane in contrast the optimization using the edwards model predicts comparatively small ship speeds for each segment the reason of this difference is that different models of the ice resistance are predicted based on different means such as model test and empirical calculation which may result in great difference of the predicted values as illustrated in fig 1 based on the above study of the ice breaking performance using different prediction models it is concluded that different prediction models predict different types of tendencies for the icebreaker s performance usually the actual ice conditions in polar region are much more complex than the pre set ice conditions in this study and the optimal results obtained from different ice resistance models will be more different however from the results of the case study established in this section some primary relationships between different ice breaking prediction models can be explored for example when performing the preliminary design for an icebreaker working in the level ice and more attention is paid to the power design the vance model can be the most reliable due to its high estimation on ice breaking power when planning the ship speed for the pending ice breaking operation the edwards model may output the most stable predictions due to its low estimation on the ice breaking speed 5 2 impacts of different prediction models on the maximized ice breaking performance for the floe ice in addition the impacts of different prediction models on the maximized ice breaking performance for the floe ice are also studied in this study based on the analysis performed in section 4 the following optimization model is also established in this section 50 find x v 1 v 2 v 3 min f x 1 0 10 t b e b s t g g 1 p b 1 4000 g 2 p b 2 4000 g 3 p b 3 4000 similarly with section 5 1 the sqp algorithm is also used in this section the final iteration histories of the objective functions and the constraint violations are shown in figs 14 a and 14 b respectively each objective function of the prediction models gradually converges to the optimal value after certain iterations the corresponding constraint violations of relevant models become zero at the early iterations reflecting the credibility of the optimization process the corresponding optimization results are listed in table 9 from which it is found that the levine model predicts the largest optimal objective function and the nogid model predicts the smallest objective function among different models by comparing tables 8 and 9 it is found that all the objective function values predicted for breaking floe ice are overall smaller than that predicted for breaking level ice it is because ice breaking for floe ice needs less energy and time consumption than ice breaking for level ice due to smaller ice resistance for the same reason the breaking speeds predicted for the floe ice are also relatively smaller than that predicted for the level ice in the corresponding ice segments based on the above analysis when performing the design optimization for a icebreaker no matter in preliminary design or post navigation planning the resistance prediction models for breaking level ice should be necessarily selected to use rather than that for breaking floe ice due to the limit of the engine power the optimal ship speed decreases with the ice layer thickness increasing in different ice segments similarly with section 5 1 from the results listed in table 9 some primary relationships between different ice breaking prediction models can also be explored for floe ice when planning the ship speed for the pending ice breaking operation of the floe ice the levine model may output the most stable predictions due to its relatively low estimation on the ice breaking speed 5 3 establishment of the sa based design process for the icebreaker the work performed in this study mainly focuses on the conceptual design stage and will guide the subsequent design processes of the icebreaker including the ice tank tests currently the feasibility of the design for the icebreakers is usually certified through ice tank tests as known the cost of the ice tank tests is relatively high due to some indispensable experiment materials and operations for example it will expend vast amounts of energy for the ice making process especially when performing multiple experiments within a short period of time for the experiment material the accumulated cost of the low temperature steel is higher than that of the ordinary steel materials therefore it is necessary to proceed the cost control of the ice tank tests the work carried out in this study can reliably provide basis for the design of the icebreaker and then efficiently guide the implementation of the ice tank tests which can greatly help determine the reliable size of the key ice breaking structures and reduce the number of unnecessary experiments for detail explanation a flow chart of the sa based design process of an icebreaker is illustrated in fig 15 the detail design process of an icebreaker can be described as follows firstly the specific demands of the icebreaker to be designed should be clearly analyzed emphases of the demands include many aspects e g the reliable speed the sufficient power and the adequate ice breaking ability large ice thickness by combining the results obtained from this study an appropriate prediction model of the ice resistance can be determined for example if more attentions are paid to the reliable speed while breaking level ice the edwards model can be the optimal selection followed by the vance model lewis model etc if the sufficient power is taken as the design emphasis the vance model is the best choice for ice resistance prediction then based on the results obtained from the sa processes of this study the corresponding decisive parameters influencing the ice breaking performance of the icebreaker with respect to different models can be determined at this point the optimization model aiming to realize the maximum ice breaking performance by finding appropriate design variables namely the decisive parameters can be established by adopting the high performance optimization algorithm optimization processes can be driven iteratively during the optimization if the condition of convergence is not met the design variables will be updated and introduced into the next iteration for operation if the condition of convergence is met it means that the optimal results are found and the next design phase can be started namely the ice tank tests based on the optimization results performed at previous stage the ice tank tests can be carried out more reasonably which will save unnecessary costs as mentioned above if the ice tank tests meet the design requirements of the icebreaker the design will go on to the next stage if not the design should go back to the beginning and re execute the design process until the corresponding requirements are met by the results of the ice tank tests by completing the above steps the icebreaker can be designed in a relatively efficient and economical way 6 conclusion in this study different prediction models of the ice resistance are compared and analyzed it is the first time in polar ice breaking field to define and classify the prediction models of the ice resistance to be three types including the high estimated type the intermediate estimated type and the low estimated type for the level ice the high estimated type includes the edwards model the lewis model and the vance model and the low estimated type includes the keinonen model the riska model the jeong model and the lindqvist model for the floe ice the high estimated type only includes the levine model the intermediate estimated type includes the buzuev model the nogid model and the mellor model the low estimated type includes the greisman model and the kashtelyan model the sobol method is used to perform the global sensitivity analysis sa of the ice breaking performance to the control parameters structural parameters and ice property parameters results indicate that the effects of input factors on ice breaking performance vary appreciably while using different prediction models of the ice resistance from the sa on the maximized ice breaking performance of the icebreaker it is found that b and t serve as the decisive structure parameters for breaking level ice and b and l serve as the decisive structure parameters for breaking floe ice to investigate the influences of the choice of the ice resistance prediction models on the maximized ice breaking performance different models are used to optimize the ice breaking performance results indicate that different prediction models predict different ice breaking performance and output partly different control parameters through the research of this study reliable basis can be provided for the engineers to better understand performance predictions of different prediction models and make more reasonable choices from different prediction models as well for example when planning the ship speed for the pending ice breaking operation in the level ice the edwards model may output the most stable predictions based on the work performed in this study an sa based design process of the icebreaker is finally established which can help perform the design

20371,ice breaking processes of an icebreaker are complex and many numerical models are proposed to predict the ice breaking performance under the same polar conditions different prediction models may derive different ice breaking performances hence it is necessary to analyze the influences of different prediction models and their corresponding input factors on the ice breaking performance however there is almost no relevant study on such issues and it is urgent to fill this gap in this study different prediction models of the ice resistance are compared and analyzed subsequently a global sensitivity analysis sa of the ice breaking performance is performed for key input factors including structure control and ice parameters results show that the same input factors have appreciably different influences on the ice breaking performance between different models besides a global sensitivity of the maximized ice breaking performance to structure parameters is analyzed finding that the ship width is the most decisive factor impacts of different prediction models on the maximized ice breaking performance regarding control parameters are also studied results indicate that model selection greatly influences the optimal performance and controls finally an sa based design process for the icebreaker is established which can help perform the design work in a relatively efficient and economical way keywords polar icebreaker global sensitivity analysis ice resistance maximized ice breaking performance 1 introduction currently the developments of the polar scientific expedition the polar resource exploitation and the arctic shipping routes have sparked rising interest in the design optimizations of the polar icebreaker and the corresponding ice breaking performance differing from the open water sailing arctic navigation should inevitably face the ice resistance caused by the ice breaking operation however the ship ice interactions during the ice breaking processes are fairly complex while sailing in the polar ice the icebreaker firstly partially extrudes the ice layer the corresponding local extrusion pressure increases as the icebreaker sails onward and the contact area between the ice and the hull will increase meanwhile during this process the bending stress of the ice layer gradually increases which eventually leads to the bending fracture of the ice layer then the broken ice begins to roll down slides along the hull and eventually reaches positions either on the sides or at the stern as can be analyzed from above ice resistance is fundamentally different compared with the water resistance manifesting in many characteristics including strong discontinuity large amplitude strong nonlinearity etc thus accurate prediction for the ice resistance is very critical for the poler icebreaker to meet the engineering requirements like structural reliability engine power estimation shaft design and ice breaking route planning in the polar navigation two forms of ice layer do usually exist due to the uneven temperature distribution including the level ice and the floe ice and the ice resistance of the icebreaker is influenced greatly by the ice forms due to the complexity of the ship ice interaction between the icebreaker and ice layer while ice breaking an accurate ice resistance is generally challenging to predict especially combined with complex polar environment in the literature a number of prediction models have been proposed for estimating the ice resistance for level ice and floe ice for the level ice ice resistance prediction models include the lindqvist model lindqvist 1989 the keinonen model keinonen 1996 the jeong model jeong et al 2010 etc for the floe ice ice resistance prediction models mainly include the bronnikov model bronnikov 1959 the vance model vance 1980 the kashtelyan model kashtelyan 1968 etc each prediction model of the ice resistance has its own characteristics for example the lindqvist method takes into account the influence of the friction and the hull shape on the ice resistance but the effect of ship speed cannot be accurately described for this reason the lindqvist method cannot scientifically describe the icebreaking process and can only be used for preliminary estimation for the ice resistance during the design stage for the riska method the ship speed is assumed to vary linearly and the prediction results depend only on the principal dimension and the bow angle of the ship so it also cannot detailly explain the ice breaking process but the riska method can be used to estimate main engine power by combining the propeller thrust during the initial design stage of an icebreaker for the buzuev model it can only be applied to meso and micro scale floe ice through analyzing mainly two types of establishing methods are applied to develop the prediction models of the ice resistance namely the model test and the empirical calculation respectively all the prediction models have totally different formulas so it is necessary to explore the differences between various prediction models of the ice resistance in addition accurate performance prediction of the ice breaking operation depends to a great extent on the accuracy flexibility and reliability of the established prediction models each prediction model has its own specific characteristics and input factors and these factors may have different effects on prediction accuracy therefore it is significant to explore the sensitivity of ice breaking performance to control structure and ice parameters sensitivity analysis sa is a technique to qualitatively or quantitatively study how the outputs of a model changes with different changing sources and how a given model changes depending on the changing information input to the model wang et al 2019 through the sa process relevant engineers studying polar ice breaking can gain a deeper understanding of performance prediction and make more reasonable choices from different prediction models sa is helpful to determine the main influencing parameters and improve the informed application select the appropriate prediction model in the complex polar environment and further improve the known prediction models 1 1 performance analysis for icebreaker currently many existing literatures focus on the ice breaking performance of different types of icebreakers long et al 2020 adopted the discrete element method dem to explore the ice breaking performance of the conical structures with respect to the ice thickness the ice velocity the cone diameter the cone angle and the ice breaking length jou et al 2019 also used the bonded dem simulations to predict different failure modes of the interactions between the icebreaker bow and the floe ice with different dimensions and thickness finding that the established bonded dem can accurately capture complex ice fracture phenomena huisman et al 2016 developed a numerical model to predict the interaction between the vessel and the surrounding level ice and validated the accuracy of this numerical simulation using a two dimensional ice breaking model of an elastic beam ding et al 2020 performed a sloshing simulation of the ice breaking lng carrier by considering the union action between ice breaking and liquid sloshing finding that the increase of the internal sloshing force weakens the ice breaking capability of the lng carrier li 2016 proposed a semi empirical numerical method to evaluate the level ice breaking process based on actual ice breaking operation and results showed that the established model can make an acceptable prediction on average resistance and velocity with certain accuracy zhang et al 2019 used a smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method to simulate the ice failure process and performed comparative experiments to certify the reliability and accuracy of the simulation 1 2 sa used in the ice breaking operation sa has been widely adopted for the ice breaking operation to carry out the performance analysis of the icebreaker for example myland and ehlers 2016 investigated the influences of the breaking patterns and geometric bow parameters on the ice breaking resistance finding that the lindqvist model should be refined for some special applications wang et al 2020 carried out an sa on the ice resistance of an exploration ship to the ice conditions including the density and the thickness of ice layer and performed numerical simulation to verify the change trend of the ice resistance theocharis et al 2019 conducted an sa to assess how fuel prices ice breaking fees and reduced speed on ice affect the minimum required freight rate of different sea routes finding that ice breaking fees is the most crucial factor considerably affecting the competitiveness qiao et al 2016 performed an sa of the average ice load in different directions to the ice elasticity modulus the ice thickness and the ship speed finding that the maximum ice loads are proportional to ice thickness and ship speed raza et al 2019 investigated the sensitivity of the performance of the icebreaker to friction and form drag coefficients and confirmed the optimal configuration of the coefficients for the optimal ice breaking performance xiao 2019 carried out a sensitivity study to investigate the impacts on the ice resistance from various parameters of ice and ship hull finding that the ice thickness and ice concentration have the greatest influences on the resistance although the existing literature has carried out many in depth studies on the ice breaking performance of the icebreaker most of the current work is carried out from a qualitative view rather than from a quantitative one and there is also no relevant work currently performing the sensitivity analysis on the optimization processes of the ice breaking performance for an icebreaker understanding the relationships between different prediction models of the ice resistance is helpful to the design and analysis of the icebreaker under complex ice conditions therefore the performance evaluations of the ice breaking operations by different prediction models should be compared and analyzed in addition through global sa the influences of input factors on different prediction models and the maximum ice breaking performance of the icebreaker should be studied to provide a reasonable basis for selecting a suitable model the reminder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses the prediction models of the ice resistance for level ice and floe ice and makes detail analysis and comparison between different prediction models in section 3 the sa on the ice resistance to structure parameters control parameters and ice property parameters are performed for breaking the level ice and the floe ice respectively then the sa on the maximized ice breaking performance is carried out for the level ice and the floe ice in section 4 in section 5 the influences of different prediction models on the maximized ice breaking performance are studied section 6 gives the concluding remarks 2 ice breaking performance prediction models 2 1 ice resistance up to now a number of ice resistance prediction models have been established in the literature for the polar icebreaker most of the proposed ice resistance models are based on the empirical methods which are adequately taken into account the relations between the ice resistance and the relevant parameters including hull structures sea ice properties seawater properties controls ship speed etc on the premise of some indispensable preconditions the empirical equations for estimating the ice resistance can be deduced using regression analysis methods based on the relevant practical or numerical experiments in the polar navigation two ice forms do usually exist due to the uneven temperature distribution including the level ice and the floe ice the ice resistance of the icebreaker is influenced greatly by the ice forms therefore both of the ice forms are studied in this work 2 2 analysis of ice resistance for breaking level ice 2 2 1 ice resistance for breaking level ice for breaking the level ice the resistance encountered by the icebreaker primarily comes from two processes ice crushing and ice displacing respectively su et al 2010 based on these two processes and some other relevant hypotheses a number of ice resistance models for breaking level ice are established in the literature among these models seven are taken into account in this work for sensitivity analysis including the lindqvist model the keinonen model the riska model the jeong model the vance model the lewis model and the edwards model lindqvist model in the lindqvist model the ice resistance is comprised of three parts namely the crushing resistance the ice resistance caused by bending and the submerging resistance lindqvist 1989 studied the influences of the hull form the cruising speed and the physical properties of the level ice on the ice resistance then the theoretical model of the ice resistance was proposed by correcting by relevant experiments the final lindqvist model of the ice resistance can be given as 1 r i l i r c r b 1 1 4 v g h i r s 1 9 4 v g l where r c n is the crushing resistance of the bow r b n is the resistance of the ice bending failure r s n is the water resistance v m s is the ship speed g m s 2 is the acceleration of gravity h i m is ice thickness and l m is the ship length for the level ice the crushing resistance of the bow r c can be obtained as 2 r c 0 5 σ f h i 2 tan ψ cos ψ μ cos ϕ cos ψ μ sin ϕ where σ f pa is the bending strength of the level ice sheet ϕ degree is the stem angle and μ is the friction coefficient between ice and ship hull ψ arctan tan ϕ sin α where α degree is the waterline entrance angle the bending failure is the main failure mode of the level ice the corresponding resistance of the ice bending failure r b is given as 3 r b 27 σ f b h i 1 5 32 e 3 1 υ 2 g ρ w tan ψ μ cos ϕ cos ψ sin α 1 1 cos ψ where e gpa is the young s modulus of the ice sheet b m is the ship width ρ w kg m 3 is the density of the sea water and υ is the poisson s ratio the water resistance r s includes the energy loss and frictional resistance between the hull and the sea ice so it can be described as 4 r s ρ w ρ i g h i b t b t b 2 t μ 0 7 l t tan ϕ b 4 tan α t cos ϕ cos ψ 1 sin ϕ 2 1 tan α 2 where t m is the deep draft and ρ i kg m 3 is the density of the sea ice keinonen model keinonen model takes the principal ship dimensions hull form seawater property hull surface temperature etc into account to describe the ice resistance for the level ice keinonen 1996 when the ice breaking speed of the

factor of the sea water and the roughness factor of the hull surface respectively and t c is the air temperature for the situation when the ship speed is larger than 1 m s the keinonen model takes another presentation to predict the ice resistance as follows 9 r i k r o r i δ r i 10 δ r i 0 009 v 1 g l b 1 5 t 0 5 h i c h k 11 k 1 0 0018 90 ψ 1 4 1 0 003 φ 5 1 5 1 0 0083 t 30 where r o n r i n and δ r i n are the resistance in the open water zone the ice resistance at speed v and the augmentation of ice resistance when ship speed is larger than 1 m s respectively riska model riska model to estimate the ice resistance for level ice is improved from the lindqvist model riska et al 1997 the relevant empirical coefficients to correct the riska model are determined by ship experiments at the baltic sea in the riska model the total ice resistance is expressed by two parts the water resistance and the ice resistance respectively the corresponding ice resistance is 12 r i r r o c 1 c 2 v 13

of the ice resistance for the standard icebreaker model which is established based on the spencer model three components of the ice resistance are included in the jeong model the ice resistance the ice buoyancy and the de icing resistance respectively jeong et al 2010 so the jeong model can be demonstrated as 15 r i j 13 14 v 2 c b ρ w ρ i g h i b t c c f h m ρ i b h i v 2 c b r s n n ρ i b h i

intensity factor m is the power index of the froude number and n is the power index of the intensity factor usually the corresponding values of the dimensionless parameters used in jeong model are listed in table 2 vance model vance model is derived from the data extracted from the ice breaking experiments of a full scale icebreaker the corresponding prediction can be formulated as vance 1980 16 r i v 55 8583 ρ w ρ i g b h i 2 0 0188 σ f v b h i g lewis model the lewis model is proposed completely based on the experimental data of four actual ships all of which have different length 39 6 295 7 m and width scales 7 3 45 7 m by assuming the ice layer is isotropic and the ice thickness is constant the lewis model is established based on the experimental data fitting and it can be written as lewis et al 1982 17 r i l e 3 8989 0 0123 σ f ρ w g h i 0 223 v l g b h i ρ w g b h i 2 whereas the experimental data of the ice thickness used to establish the lewis model is mainly concentrated in the region larger than 0 46 m which causes a higher prediction of the lewis model than the reality edwards model edwards model is improved from the previous empirical formulas based on the results of the real ship tests and it can be presented as following edwards et al 1976 18 r i e ρ w g b h i 2 4 24 0 05 σ f ρ w g h i 8 9 f n 2 2 2 analysis of the ice resistance breaking level ice in analysis of the ice resistance breaking level ice in this section the properties of the ice are listed in table 3 and the icebreaker parameters are listed in table 4 fig 1 shows the variations of the ice resistance of the level ice with the increasing ice thickness with respect to different prediction models it is noted that the corresponding ship speed for deducing the results of fig 1 is 2 m s to explore intensively the relations between different ice resistance prediction models the range of the ice thickness is set to be 0 3 m for the full thickness domain of ice the ice resistance predicted by the edwards model takes the maximum value conversely the jeong model predicts the minimum value of the ice resistance for breaking the level ice by analyzing fig 1 it is concluded that the tendencies of these seven models varying with the ice thickness can be classified into two types the high estimated type and the low estimated type respectively for the high estimated type it includes the edwards model the vance model and the lewis model the rest ice resistance prediction models including the lindqvist model the keinonen model the riska model and the jeong model all belong to the low estimated type within the scope of the low estimated type the ranking of the predicted ice resistance from biggest to smallest remains the same with the ice thickness varying namely the keinonen model the riska model the lindqvist model and the jeong model however a different situation happens within the scope of the high estimated type when the ice thickness h i is less than 1 90 m the vance model predicts the smallest ice resistance among the high estimated type when the ice thickness h i is larger than 1 90 m the lewis model predicts the smallest ice resistance by taking a holistic view of fig 1 it is observed that the ranking of the prediction models will be complicated especially when the ice thickness is smaller than 1 25 m the corresponding ranking of the ice resistance predicted by different models can be figured out by careful observation on fig 1 the variations of the ice resistance of the level ice with the increasing ship speed with respect to different prediction models are illustrated in fig 2 similarly the ice resistance of the level ice following the increasing ship speed can also be classified into high estimated type and low estimated type respectively the high estimated type includes the edwards model and the lewis model ranked from large to small the low estimated type includes the vance model the keinonen model the riska model the lindqvist model and the jeong model ranked from large to small from an overall perspective all the prediction models except for vance model preserve the original ordering with the ice thickness varying for the vance model its prediction for the ice resistance increases slowly with the increasing ship speed by combining figs 1 and 2 it is concluded that the edwards model can lead to a more highly stable design than other ice resistance models no matter whether the design process of the icebreaker focuses on the ice thickness ice breaking ability or the ship speed 2 3 analysis of ice resistance for breaking floe ice 2 3 1 ice resistance for breaking floe ice bronnikov model bronnikov model is established based on the model tests of cargo ships to predict the ice resistance of the floe ice it is also a correlating model and can be written as bronnikov 1959 19 r i b r d d s h i h i h c c n d d p l b l b q c b c b r b b 1 b b 1 k where r n is the ice resistance of reference ship

coefficients depending on the froude number and can be deduced as 20 s 1 m p 3 21 m 0 267 f r 0 67 22 n 0 785 f r 0 493 23 p 1 65 f r 0 42 0 35 24 q 1 93 f r 0 42 0 6 25 r 3 24 f r 2 27 1 25 26 k 0

t k nogid model nogid model is also an empirical expression for ice resistance for broken ice proposed through ship model testing nogid 1959a b it can be cast as 28 r i n ρ w l m b n r k h p d c f h q where coefficients including m n k p and q are the empirical exponents which depend on ice concentration buzuev model buzuev mode is another model testing based resistance prediction model of the floe ice and it can be presented as buzuev and ryvlin 1961 29 r i b c 1 l 0 5 b 0 25 c 2 c 3 f h 1 25 where c 1 c 2 and c 3 are the empirical coefficients related to the ship hull form and the ice floe conditions aboul azm 1989 kashtelyan model kashtelyan model is a semi empirical formula to predict the ice resistance in floe ice kashtelyan 1968 30 r i k σ i r h i b 2 2 k 1 1 2 μ α h l b k 4 μ α w l

is the half of entering angle of the bow part of the ship k 1 k 2 k 3 and k 4 are the empirical coefficients vance model vance model is proposed using full scale ice breaking experiments and the corresponding expressions of ice resistance in floe ice with thicknesses being 0 46 m and 1 22 m respectively are as follows vance 1980 31 r i v 0 1209 ρ w ρ i g b h i 2 0 0622 ρ i v 2 l b 0 35 h i 0

4 v l g 0 12 1 5 levine model levine model for the ice resistance prediction of the floe ice is proposed based on the model testing of a great lake bulk carrier levine et al 1974 the empirical relationship of the levine model for ice resistance in floe ice is as following 34 r i l 1 29 ρ i g b h i 2 1 365 v 2 ρ i b h i 2 3 2 analysis of the ice resistance breaking floe ice as explained above it is seen that some of the prediction models for breaking floe ice is only valid at certain ice thickness e g 0 46 m and 1 22 m for the vance model and 0 8 m for the bronnikov model therefore variations of the ice resistance breaking floe ice with increasing ship speed are analyzed at three different ice thicknesses including 0 46 m 0 8 m and 1 22 m figs 3 4 and 5 illustrate the variations of the ice resistance with increasing ship speed for breaking 0 46 m 0 80 m and 1 22 m thick floe ice respectively it is seen that all the ice resistance models for breaking floe ice predict the ice resistance to be increasing functions with respect to the increasing ship speed however the increasing rates of different prediction models at these three ice thicknesses are not exactly the same when the floe ice layer is 0 46 m thick the kashtelyan model has the maximum increasing magnitudes within the range of ship speed when the floe ice layer is 0 8 m thick and 1 22 m thick the bronnikov model has the maximum increasing magnitudes compared with other prediction models from figs 3 4 and 5 it is observed that the ranking order of the prediction models from large to small are different with the increasing ship speed whatever the thickness of the floe ice layer is however the maximum predicted resistance with the increasing ship speed in different floe ice thicknesses is almost all determined by the levine model and the nogid model the levine model predicts the maximum ice resistance at low speeds and the nogid model predicts the maximum ice resistance at high speeds specially when the floe ice layer is 0 46 m thick the kashtelyan model exceeds the nogid model and outputs the maximum ice resistance at high ship speeds by comprehensively considering figs 3 4 and 5 the levine model can guarantee a more highly reliable design for the icebreaker at low ship speed and the nogid model can guarantee a more highly reliable design for the icebreaker at high ship speed variations of the ice resistance predicted by different models with increasing thickness of the floe ice are illustrated in fig 6 it should be noted that marks and denote the models being only applicable to certain floe ice thickness including the bronnikov model h i 0 80 m and vance model h i 0 46 m and 1 22 m respectively by analyzing fig 6 all the prediction models can also be classified into three types including the high estimated type the intermediate estimated type and the low estimated type for the high estimated type only the levine model is involved the buzuev model the nogid model and the mellor model belong to the intermediate estimated type the low estimated type includes the greisman model and the kashtelyan model from fig 6 there are many points of intersection between different resistance curves which means that the ranking order of the predicted resistance from large to small are varying with the increasing ice thickness comparatively it is seen that the buzuev model predicts the maximum ice resistance while breaking the relatively thin layer of ice and the levine model predicts the maximum ice resistance while breaking the relatively thick layer of ice in other words if the designed icebreaker is to break relatively thin ice layer the buzuev model can be a better selection for ice resistance prediction if the designed icebreaker is to break relatively thick ice layer the levine model should be better 3 sa of the ice resistance for the icebreaker sa can find out the parameters that have great impacts on the system performance and analyze the stability of the corresponding optimization process especially when the original data is inconsistent or unstable the sa process can clearly guide the next optimization process based on the sa process the most reasonable and critical parameters can be selected for the design optimization under the interaction between different types of parameters in view of the great significance to optimization methods and optimization evaluations many sa methods have been proposed in the literature such as the sobol method sobol 1990 and the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast saltelli and bolado 1998 in this study the sobol method is adopted to perform the sa an overview of the sobol method is provided in section 3 1 3 1 sobol method essentially the sobol sa is a variance based monte carlo method and the detail computational principle is presented as follows suppose a model function has k input variables namely 35 y f x f x 1 x 2 x 3 x k where 0 x i 1 the main idea of the sobol sa method is to decompose the function model f x into a cumulative form of multiple dimensionally increasing functions the cumulative form can be written as 36 f x 1 x k f 0 i 1 k f i x i 1 i j k f i j x i x j f 1 2 k x 1 x k where f 0 is a constant and f i 1 i f x i 1 x i f 1 i 1 i s n is the function of x i 1 i f for each of the above cumulative functions with the corresponding input variables the integral result must be 0 37 0 1 f i 1 i 2 i k x i 1 x i k d x i 1 d x i s 0 1 k s it is certified by sobol sobol 1993 that eq 36 can be transferred to a cumulative decomposition mode and all the corresponding cumulative terms can be obtained using multiple integrals thus the total variance of f x can be described as 38 v ω k f 2 x d x f 0 2 where ω k x 0 x i 1 i 1 2 k the partial variances can be obtained from 36 given by 39 v i 1 i 2 i s 0 1 0 1 f i 1 i 2 i s 2 x i 1 x i k d x i 1 x i k where 1 i 1 i s k and s 1 2 k by squaring and integrating 36 over the entire ω k it is obtained that 40 v i 1 k v i 1 i j k v 1 2 k so the sensitivity s i 1 i 2 i s can be described as 41 s i 1 i 2 i s s i 1 i 2 i s v 1 i 1 i s k s i is the first order sensitivity index of x i that represents the main impact on the output y s i j i j is the second order sensitivity index that represents the cross impact of x i and x j on the output y the total sensitivity index of x i is the sum of all order sensitivity indices liu et al 1986 given by 42 s t i s i j i the sensitivity indices of all the input variables must satisfy the following condition 43 i 1 k s i 1 i j k s i j s 1 2 k 1 so the total sensitivity index of x i can be deduced using the variance v i that is the sum of variances of all input variables except x i homma and saltelli 1996 44 s t i 1 v i v 3 2 upper and lower bounds of input parameters as compared in section 2 many prediction models of the ice resistance are proposed based on different theories and methods e g the experimental methods so different parameters with respect to structure environment and control are emphasized by different prediction models the detail parameter utilizations of different ice resistance prediction models for the level ice and the floe ice are listed in tables 5 and 6 respectively by analyzing the variability of the corresponding parameters in actual ice breaking conditions the final selected parameters for performing the sa in this study are listed in table 7 for the level ice the selected research variables includes nine structure parameters of the icebreaker l w b t ϕ α ψ l m l b and l four environmental parameters sea ice properties σ b h i ρ w and ρ i and one control parameter v for the floe ice the selected research variables includes two structure parameters of the icebreaker l w and b four environmental parameters sea ice properties r h i ρ w and ρ i and one control parameter v on basis of the icebreaker case relevant parameters are listed in table 4 used in this study and the actual polar environment the upper and lower bounds of the parameters with respect to the structure the environment and the control are set as shown in table 7 it should be noted that the upper and lower bounds of the relevant parameters determined in this section are based on the potential design requirements and indeed are empirical values 3 3 sa of the ice resistance 3 3 1 sa of the ice resistance for breaking level ice in this section the number of sample points selected for each input parameter used in the sobol method is 2000 fig 7 illustrates the sobol sensitivity index of the seven different ice resistance prediction models for breaking the level ice to 14 input parameters including l w b t ϕ α ψ l m l b l σ b h i ρ w ρ i and v it is seen that the impacts of different input parameters on the ice resistance change with the selection of the prediction models to some extent for the riska model the lindqvist model the jeong model the lewis model and the edwards model there are three major input factors influencing the ice resistance including b h i and v however under the keinonen model four decisive factors affect the predicted ice resistance namely b ϕ h i and v for the vance model only two input factors play decisive roles including b and h i for this difference it is mainly because all the prediction models are established using different means either relevant tests or vast practical experience which usually have different emphases in addition it is observed that the total order sensitivity index of each input factor is higher than the corresponding first order index which indicates that different parameters used in the prediction models are strongly coupled with each other to influence the ice resistance through comprehensive comparison no matter which prediction model is adopted for estimating ice resistance the most decisive input factor is always the ice thickness h i based on this conclusion it is seen that the ice thickness should be paid the greatest attention while performing the design of the icebreaker for example it is essential to investigate the ice conditions beforehand along the set shipping canal the ship width b is another decisive input factor affecting greatly on the value of the predicted ice resistance of all the models it is observed from fig 7 the ship width b is the second decisive input factor in the riska model the vance model and the lewis model and the third decisive input factor in the lindqvist model the jeong model and the edwards model under the keinonen model the ship width b is the forth decisive input factor affecting the ice resistance prediction thus the ship width should be designed carefully by balancing the available spaces on board and the ice resistance which is related to energy consumption and structural reliability besides ship speed v is also a decisive input factor of the ice resistance models under the lindqvist model the keinonen model the jeong model and the edwards model the ship speed v is the second decisive input factor under the riska model and the lewis model the ship speed v is the third decisive input factor specially the ship speed v performs a relatively non critical role under the vance model besides some other parameters also have some impacts on corresponding prediction models e g t and ψ for the lindqvist model and ϕ for the keinonen model 3 3 2 sa of the ice resistance for breaking floe ice similarly the sample size of each input parameter used in this section for sobol sa is also set to be 2000 the sa results of the ice resistance prediction models for breaking floe ice to seven input factors are illustrated in fig 8 compared with the sa results obtained in section 3 3 1 the sa results of the ice resistance for breaking floe ice show a completely different situation the correspondingly included decisive input factors vary a lot under different ice resistance prediction models for example two decisive input factors are under the greisman model namely l and v respectively however under the kashtelyan model totally five decisive input factors exist including v r b h i and l the sensitivity indexes of which rank from large to small such difference is caused by the different establishing ways of the ice resistance models for breaking floe ice either relevant tests or vast practical experience the same as the ice resistance models for breaking level ice the total order sensitivity index of each input factor is higher than the corresponding first order index meaning that great coupled effects between different parameters also exist in the ice resistance models for breaking floe ice unlike the ice resistance prediction models for breaking level ice there is only one input factor in common for all the ice resistance prediction models for breaking floe ice namely the ship speed v the ship speed v is the most decisive input factor under the nogid model the kashtelyan model and the greisman model and it is the second decisive input factor under the buzuev model however under the levine model the impact of the ship speed v is relatively small compared with other input factors another key parameter is the ice thickness h i which is the most decisive input factor under the levine model and the buzuev model and the second decisive input factor under the nogid model specially the ice thickness h i has no impact on the predicted ice resistance of the greisman model besides these three parameters analyzed above some other parameters also have disproportionate levels of influences on the ice resistance predicted by different models for instance the ice scope r shows greater impacts on the nogid model and the kashtelyan model than the ship width b the ship length l etc from table 6 it is seen that some of the prediction models contain the parameters of the sea ice density and the sea water density nevertheless the sa results of fig 8 show that the sea ice density and the sea water density have little impact on the final predicted resistance that is because the ranges of the actual sea ice density and the sea water density are relatively small which cannot bring about a large change of the ice resistance for breaking floe ice 4 sa on optimal ice breaking performance 4 1 promoted sa for optimization process for the design optimization of the engineering equipment minimization or maximization of the objective function is always set by taking into account the constraints on all aspects therefore it has greatly practical significance to study the sa on the optimization process to the corresponding designable variables e g the structure parameters in this study a promoted sa framework for dealing with the optimization process is established based on the conventional sa method fig 9 shows the differences between the general sa enclosed by the green dotted line and the sa promoted for an optimization process enclosed by the red dotted line in general sa process every generalized sample point of the input factors is calculated and analyzed directly using the pure simulation model or pure formula model however in the promoted sa for optimization process every generalized sample point of the input factors is to modify the process parameters not involved in the iterative optimization and is calculated and analyzed indirectly by the optimization process in other words a complete optimization process is carried out at each iteration of the sa process and the objective function value is served as the analysis object of the sa 4 2 optimization model establishment for maximizing the ice breaking performance in this section the sensitivity of the maximized ice breaking performance of the icebreaker to the relatively decisive structure parameters is studied based on the analysis performed in section 3 3 1 the relatively decisive structure parameters of the ice resistance model for breaking level ice are b t ϕ and ψ respectively during actual ice breaking operation in the polar region the ice conditions are complex and the corresponding thickness of the ice layer is random currently so many ice thickness prediction techniques have been proposed and successfully applied in the actual ice breaking operation then based on the predicted ice conditions the structure parameters of the icebreaker can be initially designed in the early stage of the ship design in order to furthest simulate the actual ice conditions the studied ice layer is assumed to have three different sets of continuous and isotropic ice layer with different thicknesses as illustrated in fig 10 the ice thicknesses from the 1st segment to the 3rd segment h i 1 h i 2 and h i 3 are set to be 0 5 m 1 5 m and 2 5 m respectively the length of every segment l 1 l 2 and l 3 is 1000 m the ice property is listed in table 3 in actual ice breaking process the marine pilot can change the ship speed of the designed icebreaker to adapt to different ice conditions thus the design variables of the optimization process is set to be the ship speeds in different ice segments namely 45 x v 1 v 2 v 3 the range of the design variables are determined based on the historical data and experience namely 0 v i 15 m s for the ice breaking process the icebreaker should complete the planned route rapidly with relatively low energy consumption thus two aspects should be taken into account while establishing the objective function namely the time consumption t b min and the energy consumption e b kwh in order to normalize the objective function and ensure a reasonable search speed of the optimization model a weight coefficient 10 10 is multiplied for the objective function in this study the final objective function established in this section is written as 46 min f x 1 0 10 t b e b i 0 3 l i v i t 0 t f r i v i d t where t 0 is the initial time and t f is the ending time to ensure feasibility and rationality of the design optimization relevant constraints should be given to the structure parameters of the icebreaker based on the ship statics great attentions should be paid to the reasonable proportion between different principal structure parameters of the icebreaker for icebreaker the ratio of l to b should be within the range from 5 to 6 and the ratio of b to t should be within the range from 2 to 3 besides the ice breaking power in each segment p b i kw should also be smaller than the maximum engine power p m kw the icebreaker can provide thus the corresponding constraints can be written as 47 g g 1 l b 6 g 2 5 l b g 3 b t 3 g 4 2 b t g 5 p b 1 4000 g 6 p b 2 4000 g 7 p b 3 4000 the final optimization model for performing the global sa can be cast as follows 48 find x v 1 v 2 v 3 min f x 1 0 10 t b e b s t g g 1 g 2 g 7 t 0 in accordance with the promoted sa for optimization process and the established optimization model the global sa problem can be established 4 3 sa results on maximized ice breaking performance 4 3 1 sa results on maximized ice breaking performance for level ice as mentioned above the structure parameters are usually taken as the design variables in the design optimization of the icebreaker so the sensitivity of the maximized ice breaking performance to the design variables is studied in this section the same to section 3 3 the sobol method is adopted in this section to perform the promoted sa for optimization process and the sample size of each input parameters is 1000 the corresponding ranges of the structure parameters can also be found in table 7 fig 11 illustrates the sa on the maximized ice breaking performance using different ice resistance prediction models for level ice it is observed that the impacts on the maximized ice breaking performing from the structure parameters of different prediction models are almost the same except the lindqvist model for the keinonen model the riska model the jeong model the vance model the lewis model and the edwards model the most decisive structure parameter influencing the maximized ice breaking performance is the ship width b such result is matched by the conclusion obtained from fig 7 namely the ship width b is the most decisive among the structure parameters by comparing figs 11 and 7 it is found that the deep draft t serves as another key parameter influencing the maximized ice breaking performance however the deep draft t has relatively small effects on the pure ice resistance this difference is caused by the change of the study object of the sa process namely from the pure ice resistance model to the maximized ice breaking performance specially when using the lindqvist model for ice breaking performance optimization the influence of input parameters is a bit more complicated than that only used for ice resistance prediction the contributing parameters b t and ψ in fig 7 all serve as the decisive input factors in fig 11 besides ϕ and α also have relevant influences on the maximized ice breaking performance to some extent similarly such difference for the lindqvist model is also caused by the change of the study object of the sa process it is also seen from fig 11 that the total order of the sensitivity index of every structure parameter is always larger than the corresponding first order which means that all the structure parameters are coupled with each other to influence the maximized ice breaking performance by making a global survey of the overall fig 11 it is concluded that the ship width b and the draft t should be paid a great attention while performing the design optimization of the icebreaker mainly used for breaking the level ice intuitively the influences of b and t on the maximized ice breaking performance can be directly perceived through the experience however for some other specific parameters e g ϕ α ψ and l m the intuition and the experience do not show obvious effects for holding the corresponding influences thus sa is indispensable to sorting out the relationships between the input factors and the maximized ice breaking performance of the icebreaker 4 3 2 sa results on the maximized ice breaking performance for floe ice for the sa on the maximized ice breaking performance for floe ice only two designable structure parameters are taken into account including the ship length l and the ship width b by comparing figs 12 and 8 it can be observed that the contributing structure parameter s is are consistent in agreement for no matter predicting the pure ice resistance or finding the maximized ice breaking performance for instance only the structure parameter b has impacts on the ice resistance and the maximized ice breaking performance under the levine model and the structure parameters l and b have influences on the ice resistance and the maximized ice breaking performance under the nogid model however when b and l simultaneously affect the prediction models under the nogid model the kashtelyan model and the buzuev model the corresponding effect levels for the ice resistance and the maximized ice breaking performance are different to some extant it is seen from figs 8 b to 8 d among the structures b is the decisive parameter for predicting the ice resistance nevertheless l is the decisive parameter for finding the maximized ice breaking performance as illustrated in figs 12 b to 12 d similarly such change of the decisive parameter is caused by the change of the study object of the sa process namely from the pure ice resistance model to the maximized ice breaking performance based on the above analysis it is concluded that b and l should be carefully designed and optimized beforehand based on the conditions of the floe ice in the polar region for a better ice breaking performance 5 impacts of different prediction models on the maximized ice breaking performance 5 1 impacts of different prediction models on the maximized ice breaking performance for the level ice for exploring the impacts of different resistance prediction models for the level ice on the ice breaking performance performance optimizations are performed for the icebreaker using seven resistance prediction models including the lindqvist model the keinonen model the riska model the jeong model the vance model the lewis model and the edwards model in this section the control parameters ship speeds are taken into account to undertake the optimization of the ice breaking performance of the icebreaker based on fixed structures as listed in table 4 as analyzed in section 4 2 the corresponding optimization model can be cast as 49 find x v 1 v 2 v 3 min f x 1 0 10 t b e b s t g g 1 p b 1 4000 g 2 p b 2 4000 g 3 p b 3 4000 in this study the series quadratic programming sqp algorithm is used to perform the optimization as the sqp algorithm is a local optimization algorithm so each optimization process of different prediction models is performed for 20 times to ensure that the globally optimal solution can be found by selecting the optimal result from the solution set the final iteration histories of the objective function and the constraint violation of the optimization processes using seven prediction models are illustrated in fig 13 as seen from 13 a the optimization processes using different prediction models gradually converge to the optimal values respectively and the corresponding iterations are different the constraint violations of the optimization processes using different prediction models are all 0 after certain iterations as illustrated in fig 13 b from which it is concluded that all the optimization processes are credible for finding the maximized ice breaking performance table 8 lists the optimization results using different ice resistance models of the level ice by combining fig 13 a it is seen that the optimal values of the objective functions vary a lot with different selections of the prediction models among the results the optimization performed using the jeong model can output the minimum objective value with the minimum time consumption and energy consumption however the optimization performed using the vance model outputs the maximum objective value with the maximum time consumption and energy consumption among all the obtained results for the control parameters of the icebreaker the corresponding ship speed decreases with the ice layer thickening so as to meet the requirements of the engine power limits as observed from table 8 the optimization using the jeong model can predict the largest ship speeds in all the three segments of the ice lane in contrast the optimization using the edwards model predicts comparatively small ship speeds for each segment the reason of this difference is that different models of the ice resistance are predicted based on different means such as model test and empirical calculation which may result in great difference of the predicted values as illustrated in fig 1 based on the above study of the ice breaking performance using different prediction models it is concluded that different prediction models predict different types of tendencies for the icebreaker s performance usually the actual ice conditions in polar region are much more complex than the pre set ice conditions in this study and the optimal results obtained from different ice resistance models will be more different however from the results of the case study established in this section some primary relationships between different ice breaking prediction models can be explored for example when performing the preliminary design for an icebreaker working in the level ice and more attention is paid to the power design the vance model can be the most reliable due to its high estimation on ice breaking power when planning the ship speed for the pending ice breaking operation the edwards model may output the most stable predictions due to its low estimation on the ice breaking speed 5 2 impacts of different prediction models on the maximized ice breaking performance for the floe ice in addition the impacts of different prediction models on the maximized ice breaking performance for the floe ice are also studied in this study based on the analysis performed in section 4 the following optimization model is also established in this section 50 find x v 1 v 2 v 3 min f x 1 0 10 t b e b s t g g 1 p b 1 4000 g 2 p b 2 4000 g 3 p b 3 4000 similarly with section 5 1 the sqp algorithm is also used in this section the final iteration histories of the objective functions and the constraint violations are shown in figs 14 a and 14 b respectively each objective function of the prediction models gradually converges to the optimal value after certain iterations the corresponding constraint violations of relevant models become zero at the early iterations reflecting the credibility of the optimization process the corresponding optimization results are listed in table 9 from which it is found that the levine model predicts the largest optimal objective function and the nogid model predicts the smallest objective function among different models by comparing tables 8 and 9 it is found that all the objective function values predicted for breaking floe ice are overall smaller than that predicted for breaking level ice it is because ice breaking for floe ice needs less energy and time consumption than ice breaking for level ice due to smaller ice resistance for the same reason the breaking speeds predicted for the floe ice are also relatively smaller than that predicted for the level ice in the corresponding ice segments based on the above analysis when performing the design optimization for a icebreaker no matter in preliminary design or post navigation planning the resistance prediction models for breaking level ice should be necessarily selected to use rather than that for breaking floe ice due to the limit of the engine power the optimal ship speed decreases with the ice layer thickness increasing in different ice segments similarly with section 5 1 from the results listed in table 9 some primary relationships between different ice breaking prediction models can also be explored for floe ice when planning the ship speed for the pending ice breaking operation of the floe ice the levine model may output the most stable predictions due to its relatively low estimation on the ice breaking speed 5 3 establishment of the sa based design process for the icebreaker the work performed in this study mainly focuses on the conceptual design stage and will guide the subsequent design processes of the icebreaker including the ice tank tests currently the feasibility of the design for the icebreakers is usually certified through ice tank tests as known the cost of the ice tank tests is relatively high due to some indispensable experiment materials and operations for example it will expend vast amounts of energy for the ice making process especially when performing multiple experiments within a short period of time for the experiment material the accumulated cost of the low temperature steel is higher than that of the ordinary steel materials therefore it is necessary to proceed the cost control of the ice tank tests the work carried out in this study can reliably provide basis for the design of the icebreaker and then efficiently guide the implementation of the ice tank tests which can greatly help determine the reliable size of the key ice breaking structures and reduce the number of unnecessary experiments for detail explanation a flow chart of the sa based design process of an icebreaker is illustrated in fig 15 the detail design process of an icebreaker can be described as follows firstly the specific demands of the icebreaker to be designed should be clearly analyzed emphases of the demands include many aspects e g the reliable speed the sufficient power and the adequate ice breaking ability large ice thickness by combining the results obtained from this study an appropriate prediction model of the ice resistance can be determined for example if more attentions are paid to the reliable speed while breaking level ice the edwards model can be the optimal selection followed by the vance model lewis model etc if the sufficient power is taken as the design emphasis the vance model is the best choice for ice resistance prediction then based on the results obtained from the sa processes of this study the corresponding decisive parameters influencing the ice breaking performance of the icebreaker with respect to different models can be determined at this point the optimization model aiming to realize the maximum ice breaking performance by finding appropriate design variables namely the decisive parameters can be established by adopting the high performance optimization algorithm optimization processes can be driven iteratively during the optimization if the condition of convergence is not met the design variables will be updated and introduced into the next iteration for operation if the condition of convergence is met it means that the optimal results are found and the next design phase can be started namely the ice tank tests based on the optimization results performed at previous stage the ice tank tests can be carried out more reasonably which will save unnecessary costs as mentioned above if the ice tank tests meet the design requirements of the icebreaker the design will go on to the next stage if not the design should go back to the beginning and re execute the design process until the corresponding requirements are met by the results of the ice tank tests by completing the above steps the icebreaker can be designed in a relatively efficient and economical way 6 conclusion in this study different prediction models of the ice resistance are compared and analyzed it is the first time in polar ice breaking field to define and classify the prediction models of the ice resistance to be three types including the high estimated type the intermediate estimated type and the low estimated type for the level ice the high estimated type includes the edwards model the lewis model and the vance model and the low estimated type includes the keinonen model the riska model the jeong model and the lindqvist model for the floe ice the high estimated type only includes the levine model the intermediate estimated type includes the buzuev model the nogid model and the mellor model the low estimated type includes the greisman model and the kashtelyan model the sobol method is used to perform the global sensitivity analysis sa of the ice breaking performance to the control parameters structural parameters and ice property parameters results indicate that the effects of input factors on ice breaking performance vary appreciably while using different prediction models of the ice resistance from the sa on the maximized ice breaking performance of the icebreaker it is found that b and t serve as the decisive structure parameters for breaking level ice and b and l serve as the decisive structure parameters for breaking floe ice to investigate the influences of the choice of the ice resistance prediction models on the maximized ice breaking performance different models are used to optimize the ice breaking performance results indicate that different prediction models predict different ice breaking performance and output partly different control parameters through the research of this study reliable basis can be provided for the engineers to better understand performance predictions of different prediction models and make more reasonable choices from different prediction models as well for example when planning the ship speed for the pending ice breaking operation in the level ice the edwards model may output the most stable predictions based on the work performed in this study an sa based design process of the icebreaker is finally established which can help perform the design

20372,we present a new set of experiments in local scour due to confined twin propeller jets aiming to include propeller driving characteristics to the analysis of the scouring action during in port manoeuvres the maximum scour depth is studied as a function of the bed clearance the wall clearance and the efflux velocity of the jet aiming to reproduce more realistic manoeuvres both forward and backward rotation of the propellers are analysed showing a different behaviour the obtained results are used to propose two different empirical models one for each regime of rotation a new non dimensional parameter obtained from the buckingham π analysis proposed as wall froude number is used to find a clear threshold triggering the scouring mechanism the experimental results show that the distance to the vertical wall is the main contributor to the higher scour depths rather than the propeller speed of rotation or the bed clearance keywords propeller induced scour physical model harbour management sediment transport 1 introduction the use of marine propellers causes any vessel navigating or manoeuvring in a harbour to induce erosion over the seabed when the bed clearance is not large enough the high speed wash coming out of the propeller eventually reaches the seabed either due to its free expansion or the interaction with a port structure such as a berthing quay later the sediment is resuspended and transported thus leading to a scour hole the magnitude of the scour hole can be important and therefore cause several problems if not noticed and managed in due time structural stability of the marine structures and accumulation of sediment in navigable channels therefore reducing its operational draught are two of the main problems arisen due to ship propellers induced scour of this well documented problem are found in several bedside books in this topic such as gaythwaite and drive 2004 hoffmans and verheij 2021 sumer and fredsoe 2002 whitehouse 1997 the study of the propeller induced erosion has been traditionally performed experimentally in physical models the propeller jet properties and their effects over the sediment bed have been of importance during the past and recent years lam et al 2011 published a literature review on the experimental studies on propeller jets during the last decades showing the different empirical and semi empirical expressions developed to characterize the propeller jet mostly focused on local scour studies they collected the different methods to obtain the efflux velocity u 0 parameter the decay in the axial velocity with the axial distance or the velocity at the seabed as a function of the efflux velocity more recently wei et al 2020 published an exhaustive review of the propeller induced scour recent and past research including both the local scour research performed at physical models and recent studies in flow behaviour during the scour process performed by piv they distinguish two main research lines existing in propeller induced local scour unconfined conditions and confined conditions the former assumes the free expanding of the propeller jet flow while the latter considers the interaction of the jet flow with port structures closed or open quays between them research in scour due to confined propeller jets have received much less attention and not many articles are found in literature about the topic in case of confinement by a closed quay wall only hamill et al 1999 and cui et al 2020a proposed an expression to determine the expected scour depth due to single and twin propeller jets respectively besides the experimental research in physical models several studies have been performed in situ to validate all the empirical or semi empirical equations coming out from the laboratory the applicability of the laboratory expressions is discussed for instance in roubos et al 2014 in llull et al 2020 and in mujal colilles et al 2017 bathymetries of the harbour basin are used to validate some of the equations existing in guidelines using real vessel and manoeuvre data as input to the models blokland and smedes 1996 proposed one of the most used methods to analytically estimate the propeller induced velocity at seabed from field tests too abramowicz gerigk et al 2018 studied the bow thrusters induced currents by large ships and successfully test the expressions proposed in pianc 2015 for the most common ferry type vessels at gdynia port the last years have witnessed the growing trend in numerical studies in all branches of fluid mechanics and sediment transport several numerical studies have been performed in propeller jet modelling over the last two decades the earlier references are included in carlton 2012 although a considerable number of more recent articles mostly focused on propeller design noise reduction cavitation etc have been published in this field ahmed et al 2020 sun et al 2018 usta and korkut 2018 focusing on the flow evolution of a twin propeller cui et al 2020b recently published a combination of numerical and experimental research on the axial evolution of the twin propeller jet velocity and turbulence intensity more recently guarnieri et al 2021 studied the erosion effects of the large commercial vessels over the sediment of the port of genoa through a numerical study considering the propellers position as a moving and orientable flow and studying the effects over the sediment with the hydrodynamics and mud transport models mike 3 fm in reality multiple types of propellers and ships are found meaning that it is difficult to generalise when analysing the effects of the propeller jets however some types of ships are commonly associated with a specific propeller type for instance ferry and ro ro ships are commonly associated with stern twin propellers combined with one or two bow thrusters to manoeuvre these are one of the most common ships transiting mediterranean ports marzano et al 2020 and are object of the present paper depending on the port the characteristics of the sediment can differ in orders of magnitude sediment has been traditionally a problem in scaled physical models because of the impossibility to scale sediment if the geometrical scale is too large the use of several sediment sizes usually permits to account for a wide range of sediment types although there is a need to validate any expression obtained at laboratory in field cases to study its applicability since the magnitude of the scale effects are uncertain the present paper presents an experimental study at a laboratory with a twin propeller model in confined condition i e near a vertical boundary typical ro ro and ferry ships propellers are modelled in the presented set of experiments aiming at studying their effects near the harbour structures where they operate with daily basis mujal colilles et al 2018 presented the initial set of experiments and the present contribution increases the scenarios in pitch ratio and more importantly improving the measuring area by reaching to up to 0 05m to the vertical wall allowing the analysis of the local scour at the closest locations to the vertical wall with the obtained results we present a new empirical relationship between manoeuvring conditions and scouring action therefore the present work is divided into the following sections the case study and experimental set up are presented in sections 2 and 3 in section 4 the main results are shown the experimental results are shown in section 4 1 the existing empirical formulae is tested in section 4 2 and an empirical model for the time dependent scour near quay walls due to twin propeller jets is proposed in section 4 3 from the experimental results a non dimensional parameter named the wall froude number f 0 wall in the present article is proposed to be directly related with the scour depth in confined scenarios as explained in section 4 3 discussion over all the aforementioned topics is found in section 5 at the end of the manuscript an acronyms section is included as an aid in the reading process supplementary material is also provided including complementary figures 2 case study the present model is scaled from typical ro ro and ro pax vessels with twin propellers diameter up to d p 6m and a range of propeller speeds of rotation between 90 and 140 rpm these kind of ships usually operate with daily basis in most of the spanish mediterranean ports with short sea shipping industry castells sanabra et al 2020 marzano et al 2020 the twin propeller system combined with transverse thrusters allows these vessels to manoeuvre by their own means i e with no need of tug assistance in small harbour basins with low under keel clearance ukc defined as the 30 or less of the static draught of a ship according to imo 1993 and short distances to closed berthing quays the nature of their commercial activity makes these ships to perform the same manoeuvres every day at the same basins thus having an accumulative effect over the sediment bed these manoeuvres have a total duration of around 25 min manoeuvre with an accumulated time of 600 manoeuvres per year to fulfil the similarity requirements the froude number fr is used to scale the dynamic effects eq 1 considering also the reynolds self similarity theory by ensuring high enough reynolds number re 105 of the flow eq 2 and the propeller eq 3 4 to neglect scale effects due to viscosity according to verhey 1983 these effects can be avoided if the flow and propeller reynolds number are greater than 3 103 and 7 104 respectively moreover the range of densimetric froude numbers f 0 d eq 5 covered by the presented experiments is higher than in many of the existing laboratory studies in propeller induced scour where a considerably lower range 5 f 0 d 15 is usually found cui et al 2019 2020c hamill 1988 hong et al 2013 tan and yüksel 2018 however scale effects due to the sediment size must be expected since the densimetric froude number at prototype situation may reach f 0 d 170 in case of big ships over fine sand sediment mujal colilles et al 2017 table 1 summarizes the range of non dimensional parameter

experimental setup 3 1 physical model experiments with a twin propeller model over a mobile sand bed were conducted in the marine engineering laboratory at the upc barcelona tech university in a medium scale water tank named labassa each propeller is connected to a triphasic motor 1 5 kw 50hz through a transmission chain at the same time each individual motor is connected to a variable frequency drive that is controlled from the laboratory computer allowing to set the desired propeller speed of rotation detailed information and a 3d sketch of the tank characteristics are found in mujal colilles et al 2017 and mujal colilles et al 2018 in the present experiments the twin propeller model was located in a position close enough to the vertical quay wall in advance front wall fw to ensure a confined flow condition aiming at studying the effects of a confined twin propeller jet over the sand bed near a vertical boundary the sketch in fig 1 shows the dimensions of the basin the sand bed and the measuring area including the different test conditions distance from the fw or wall clearance x w and distance from the propeller axis to the sand bed or bed clearance c h the dashed lines show a characteristic ship according to the geometric scale used in these experiments λ 1 25 if the main twin propellers system is scaled the grey structure in the upstream part of the propellers was covered by a solid steel plate trying to reproduce the effects of a ship hull with a large block coefficient such as ro ro or ro pax ships in the present experiments scour due to both forward fwd and backward bwd rotation of the twin propeller is studied by conducting two different sets of experiments in the same conditions forward fwd and back forth b f fwd experiments are performed with consecutive runs of forward rotation while b f experiments combine alternatively forward and backward rotation the experiments are explained in detail in subsection 3 2 of the present article the main characteristics of the twin propeller model and the sediment used in the present experiments are summarized in table 1 3 2 set of experiments the efflux velocity u 0 is one of the most important parameters to account for in order to characterize the propeller jet hamill et al 2004 and it is thus an important value to consider in the study of its induced scour however there is still no agreement in the scientific community to properly define this parameter for the purpose of propeller induced scour studies one can safely consider the u 0 as the maximum velocity taken from the time averaged measurements of the propeller axial induced velocities along the contraction plane of the jet ryan 2002 to analytically obtain this magnitude several equations grouped under a clear review in lam et al 2011 have been proposed in the past years by different authors to avoid uncertainty due to the efflux velocity calculation in the present work a set of measurements on the axial velocity distribution close to the propeller at x 0 5dp at two different speeds of rotation 250 rpm and 300 rpm were performed previous to the local scour experiments the measurements were made across a point by point grid using a pitot static probe coupled to a differential pressure sensor omega engineering with a sampling rate of 100hz the time averaged velocity distribution close to the propeller plane was used to obtain a value of u 0 for each speed of rotation the obtained u 0 permitted to obtain an experimental coefficient of thrust kt 0 65 0 02 with the commonly used expression eq 6 derived from the momentum theory the thrust coefficient is assumed constant in the range of speeds of rotation in the present work this statement has been proven several times in literature lam et al 2012 van velzen et al 2016 therefore the u0 is assumed linearly dependent on the speed of rotation in the experiments presented here 6 u 0 1 59 n d p k t to study the scouring effects of the twin propellers nearby a vertical wall a set of 24 experiments in confined scour is presented as summarized in table 2 the total time for each experiment was set to 30 min 1800s with bed scanning every 5 min to observe the evolution of the mobile sand bed some experiments were extended up to 60 min 3600s to observe the further evolution of the scour profiles in different scenarios to allow the bed scanning the propellers were stopped and started at each time interval according to hamill 1987 and hong et al 2013 the effect on the overall scour due to switching the propeller on and off can be neglected moreover it is considered that this is a comparable behaviour to real manoeuvres where the vessels depart and arrive in time intervals of hours the scanning was performed by 2 ultralab uws1m echo sounders with accuracy of 1 the echosounders were mounted on a moving bridge over the sediment bed a total of 38 longitudinal profiles separated by 7 5 cm were obtained at 40hz sampling rate containing the bed elevation measurements of longitudinal and transverse distance from the moving bridge to a reference point were obtained simultaneously with two photoelectric sensors efector200 o1d100 these measurements allowed to locate every single measure of the echosounder and generate a 3d surface of the measuring area the surface was interpolated to the scattered data in the input vectors by surface linear fitting over a grid with longitudinal and transverse resolution of 1 cm the regime column in table 3 states for the forward fwd or back forth b f rotation as mentioned in sub section 3 1 in fwd regime the propellers counterrotate inward rotation and the induced flow is directed towards the fw during the total duration of the experiment in b f regime the propellers rotation changes intermittently every 5 min following the froude similarity scaling of each manoeuvre at prototype from backward bwd to forward fwd rotation and the induced flow is directed first towards the unconfined part of the tank bwd rotation where the propeller supporting structure is located and after to the front wall fwd rotation the intention behind the b f experiments is to compare the results from the traditional experiments with steady fwd rotation with the results obtained by combining bwd and fwd rotation the last set up is closer to the reality of a ship near the wall which berths and unberths by combining backward and forward propeller rotation guarnieri et al 2021 llull et al 2020 wei et al 2020 4 results propeller induced scour is a three dimensional process of sediment resuspension and transport that happens over a mobile sediment bed in response to the forcing by a single or multiple propeller jet the time dependent scour process is described in this sub section for the case of a confined twin propeller system to show the more important characteristics of the scour hole with special attention to the maximum depth particularly the twin propeller confined scour process is described with contour plots focusing on the eroded areas and their evolution with time in twin propeller systems jets are originated separately from each propeller and they are not initially influenced by one another however at a certain distance which depends mainly on the distance between propeller axes and the propeller speed of rotation both jets merge into a unique jet jiang et al 2019 mujal colilles et al 2017 the merged jet impinges the seabed and causes a developing scour hole in advance hbh hole since it develops far from the front wall in the harbour basin this local scour hole is enlarged along the axial flow direction while expands symmetrically from its maximum depth longitudinal profile until it reaches the equilibrium when rotating in the fwd direction the influence of the front wall contributes to an important scouring action at its toe downstream of the hbh hole this second hole in advance fwh hole grows radially in the xy plane from the twin propeller central axis wall plane intersection both scour holes eventually merge if equilibrium is not reached before becoming a single main hole the described process can be observed at 10 min time intervals in the contour plots showed in fig 2 a b in these cases the mid speed of rotation scenario 350 rpm is chosen as the most representative of all the experiments the contour plots corresponding to the whole set of experiments at 5 min time intervals are included in the supplementary material of this article figs s1 s8 one of the most relevant features of all the experiments performed is that c h m i n cases induce a deeper hbh hole than c h m a x ones while contrarily the latter yields a deeper scour hole near the front wall the same phaenomena is observed in mujal colilles et al 2018 the larger the propeller bed clearance the lower is the influence of the horizontal boundary and therefore a more energetic jet reaches the vertical structure thus inducing a deeper fwh hole the wall clearance is related to both the depth of the fwh hole and the merging of the hbh and fwh hole this effect is clearly visible in fig 2a b where the two paradigmatic scenarios i e propeller located close to the bed and far from the wall or far from the bed and close to the wall are shown the condition of merged or no merged holes is related to the development of the scour hole and is analysed in detail in subsection 4 1 as previously explained b f scenarios fig 3 a b aim to be more realistic in terms of reproducing arrival and departure ship manoeuvres where the propellers are used mostly in backward and forward regimes respectively in these experiments a new scour hole is formed upstream of the propellers plane hba harbour basin area due to the backward bwd rotation in advance this scour hole will be referred as hbhbwd hole the structure nearby the propellers simulating the ship hull deflects the jet flow and causes the scour hole to be closer in this regime than the hole at the harbour basin area due to forward rotation in advance hbhfwd hole the behaviour of the backward flow is obviously not comparable to a free developing jet and neither is the scour hole created the hbhbwd hole although of considerable depth in some of the experiments 1 5dp does never reach to merge with the fwh hole and a very clear separation always exist between them it is thus considered that they must be object of an independent analysis since the present work focuses on the near quay holes that may affect the structure stability the hbhbwd holes are not analysed in detail in the rest of the article the hba area downstream of the propeller plane where the hbhfwd hole is located is not highly eroded in the b f experiments a different behaviour is observed in the downstream holes compared to the fwd experiments the suction of the propellers when rotating backward and the accretion area in the surroundings of the hbhbwd hole may be of importance contributing to an erosion refilling process that keeps the morphology in the hbhfwd less affected in comparison with its analogue hbh hole in fwd experiments in figs s7b c of the supplementary material for instance it is observed that the hbhfwd hole is reduced at t 15min respect to t 10min and the same happens at t 25min respect to t 20min at t 15min and t 25min the backward rotation just finished while at t 10min and t 20min the forward rotation just did 4 1 maximum depth profile the evolution of the maximum depth profile is key to obtain the position of the maximum expected depth as it is a geometric characteristic of the entire scouring hole together with its maximum length and maximum width penna et al 2019 in the present article due to the distance between the twin propellers a p a single scour hole is observed in the mobile bed evolution as seen above figs 2 and 3 and thus a single profile is used as the maximum depth profile the centre line profile located between the twin propeller axes is considered to be the longitudinal axis from which the scour hole expands symmetrically fig 4 a b shows the transversal profiles at the location of the maximum depth of every scour hole both fwd and b f experiments are considered the maximum depth at every x position along the whole measurement grid with δx 0 01m is compared with its corresponding centre line depth measured at the same x coordinate for depths higher than 0 1m the agreement in fig 4c indicates that a negligible error is committed if the maximum depth profile is assumed to be in the centre line thus the following analysis of maximum scour depth in this article is focused on the centre line profile the centre line profiles evolve differently depending on the experimental conditions in every profile the separation between the fwh hole and the hbh hole is found by locating the local maximum between the fwa area and the hba area fig 5 a1 a4 show that this maximum is found in some of the experiments although not in all of them due to the merging of the two holes since differences in the shape of the different profiles depend not only on the experiment but also on the time central profiles are categorised as follows no merged transition to merge and merged profiles in no merged profiles the fwa and hba area are clearly observable by distinguishing the two holes see fig 5a4 in merged profiles a single hole is observed between the front wall and the propeller plane as seen in fig 5a1 from t 15min transition to merge profiles are included to define the cases where two holes are still distinguishable but with a very eroded downstream boundary in the hbh hole becoming very asymmetric on its xz plane fig 5a1 from t 5min to t 10min fig 5a clearly shows that in fwd experiments x w m i n scenarios sub figures a1 and a3 tend to yield a merged profile while x w m a x experiments sub figures a2 and a4 preserve the initial two hole shape the fwh maximum depth grows linearly in all the cases showing no tendency to the equilibrium except in case of x w m i n c h m a x fig 5b1 once the profile is merged in case of no merged profiles the hbh grows rapidly at the first 5 min interval showing a decay in the growing rate after that up to a maximum depth of 1dp in case of c h m i n sub figures b3 and b4 this depth remains in equilibrium until the profile becomes merged fig 5b3 between t 25 min and t 30 min or until the end of the experiment fig 5b4 b f experiments are categorised into no merged and merged profiles according to the same criteria explained for fwd experiments in these experiments the main hbh hole appears due to the backwards rotation hbhbwd hole while the hbhfwd and fwh holes are the ones that may merge or keep the two hole shape in fig 6 merged profiles are observable in the c h m a x x w m i n cases sub figure a1 while the no merged are observable in the c h m i n x w m a x cases sub figure a4 the time series of the experiments in fig 6 show an intermittent growing every 5 min corresponding to the bwd fwd regime iteration no significant differences are observed with the change in the seabed clearance in this set of experiments mostly for x w m a x scenarios in which the curves increase simultaneously up to t 30 min in case of mid or low speed of rotation 350 rpm and 300 rpm the behaviour observed in the scour profiles does not change substantially in general the scour depth is reduced and the merging if exists is delayed with the lower speed of rotation the longitudinal profiles and the scour depth evolution in case of mid and low speed of rotation scenarios are shown in the supplementary material of this article from fig s9 to fig s12 the time series at fwh hole are plotted together in fig 7 including the long series mentioned in table 2 in fig 7 the reference time of b f series is modified to fit the forward rotation time for the sake of good comparability with fwd scenarios b f series arriving to t 30min 1800s in fig 7 correspond to long series i e experiments of 60 min run iterating backward and forward rotation as summarized in table 2 also the time series of 400 rpm x w m i n fig 7a run to 60 min 3600s in all cases c h m i n experiments red lines in b f regime solid lines yielded higher scour depths near the front wall than their corresponding fwd experiment while in c h m a x cases fwd and b f results show a similar evolution moreover the differences in the scour depth evolution between the c h m i n and c h m a x scenarios are remarkable in case of fwd experiments mostly at x w m i n in case of b f experiments the evolution of the scour depth is similar for both bed clearance scenarios interestingly the time series of c h m i n x w m i n fwd fig 7a show a tendency to the stabilization from t 1800s when the profile become merged see fig 5a the same pattern is observed in c h m i n x w m i n b f and c h m a x x w m i n fwd fig 7a from t 900s 15 min of forward rotation in wei 2018 this behaviour is known as the stabilization phase of the scour profile previous to the equilibrium stage in hong et al 2013 temporal similarity of the maximum scour depth profiles is found in the case of unconfined scour holes in the present experiments similarity of the fwh hole is observed in all the fwd and b f experiments if analysed separately according to the merged no merged condition of each one only the profiles obtained at t 15 min of experimental time are considered to avoid higher scatter of the data at the initial stages of the developing scour holes the length of the fwh hole l fwh is taken as the distance between the front wall and the first local maximum in the central scour profile as shown previously in this sub section fig 5a1 a4 and fig 6a1 a4 non dimensional fwh profiles in fig 8 are obtained when l fwh is used as the maximum length together with the measured maximum depth d fwh in this range therefore the non dimensional coordinates x ˆ and y ˆ are obtained as x ˆ x l f w h and y ˆ y d f w h as shown in fig 8a c all the non dimensional profiles generally collapse for any time and experiment this is particularly true in case of no merged profiles a polynomial fitting function is applied to the non dimensional profiles yielding the best fit to minimize rmse fig 8b d shows that no merged profiles are fitted by a 3rd degree polynomial function while merged profiles are fitted by a 5th degree one transition profiles are not included in these results since they cannot become an equilibrium profile due to their transitory nature the variability on the position of the maximum depth due to the change in u 0 x w c h and t is analysed by finding the maximum depth at hba and fwa areas in every single profile in fig 9 the positions of the maximum depth over the whole grid are observed grouped by its corresponding experimental conditions fig 9a and clustered by hole type fig 9b the k means clustering algorithm locates 5 different data clusters to minimize the distance euclidian distance between each object and the cluster centroid the centroid is assumed to be a representative position of the maximum depth location of every characteristic scour hole within every cluster a unique value of x w is present clearly meaning that nor c h u 0 and time are relevant in the location of the scour hole interestingly the distance to the maximum depth position of the hbhfwd hole barely changes although the wall clearance changes considerably 4 2 validation of literature equations this section aims to validate the existing equations published so far by comparing them with the results obtained in the presented experiments the obtained experimental results show the evolution of the scour depth near the vertical wall with time since the equilibrium condition is not found in all cases the expressions in literature focused on the calculation of the equilibrium depth are not comparable to the obtained results directly however the existing models to obtain the time dependent scour depth may be applied cui et al 2020a proposed an empirical model for inwards rotating twin propellers in confined scenarios following the previous study of unconfined twin propeller scour in cui et al 2019 where a temporal model for the prediction of the induced scour due to twin propeller jets is shown cui et al 2020a proposed eq 14 to simply obtain the maximum scour due to a confined twin propeller jet from eq 11 13 in cui et al 2019 focused on the time evolution of the maximum scour depth in case of unconfined twin propeller induced erosion when applying the proposed equations the efflux velocity u 0 values are obtained according to eq 6 as explained in sub section 3 2 11 s u n c o n f ω ln t γ 12 ω 0 2526

obtained at t 30 min as in cui et al 2019 are used only fwd experiments are included for the sake of good comparison although in cui et al 2020a only experiments with the lower bed clearance are performed 0 5dp from the propeller tip i e c h m i n scenarios in the present article cui et al 2019 included a more extensive range of seabed clearance distances considering the influence of this variable on the final scour profile the range of bed clearance in cui et al 2019 is coincident with the one in the present work in fig 10 the predicted scour depth values yielded by eq 11 14 are plotted against the measured scour depths near the front wall significant disagreements are found between the experimental results and the proposed models the results are coloured by x w and c h showing that the proposed model clusters the data according to the clearance distance since this variable is not included in the model moreover the results of the present study do not fit the model neither in case of c h m i n nor c h m a x 4 3 temporal model of maximum scour depth at fw since the existing models do not fit the results obtained in the laboratory a new empirical non linear model for time dependent scour due to confined twin propeller jets is proposed regardless of the unconfined scour profile the time dependent scour depth near the front wall s can be expressed as a function of the following dimensional parameters 15 s f u 0 x w c h d 50 g ρ w ρ s t μ a p d p in the present set of data important parameters clearly conditioning the scour process d 50 a p d p are unique due to experimental limitations the other important parameters involved in the propeller induced scour u 0 x w c h cover a realistic range of values in cases of ro ro ships manoeuvring in shallow waters i e with low ukc since they are scaled from the study case vessel type as explained in section 2 using the buckingham π theorem if constant parameters and viscosity are not considered and ρ s x w and u 0 are used as fundamental variables the following non dimensional parameters are obtained π 1 s x w π 2 c h x w π 3 u 0 g x w π 4 t x w u 0 16 π 1 f 2 π 2 π 3 π 4 the confinement situation is considered to be the most important characteristic of the scour near quay walls and consequently the wall clearance x w is chosen as fundamental parameter thus π3 a froude number the characteristic length of which is not the jet or propeller diameter but the wall clearance is obtained this parameter is referred in advance as wall froude number f 0 wall the f 0 wall increases linearly with the efflux velocity and decreases with the square root of the distance to the wall meaning that the relation between the initial velocity of the jet and the distance from the jet to the quay wall is of main importance in the confined scour process time is dimensionless with the time scale which in this model is proposed to be x w u 0 an optimization of the general non linear model in eq 17 is performed to get the best coefficient of determination and different constants and powers k 1 a b c are proposed to obtain the best fit 17 π 1 k 1 π 2 a π 3 b ln π 4 c fig 11 shows the linear agreement between the predicted and measured scour depth to the wall clearance π1 in case of fwd experiments sub figure a and b f experiments sub figure b the merging condition is chosen as the grouping variable yielding a clear gradient from no merged to merged scenarios as the maximum depth wall clearance ratio increases in both cases the transition between no merged and merged is located around π1 0 15 the different fitted logarithmic curves and the measured data coloured depending on the experimental setup in the legend are plotted and included in the supplementary material of this article fig s13 in case of fwd experiment the data corresponding to the experiments with n 350 rpm mid speed of rotation are not shown to avoid overlapping data points a different model is fitted for each gear scenario fwd and b f experiments eq 18 and eq 19 show the non linear models for each one of them that yielded coefficients of determination r2 0 971 and r2 0 952 respectively for fwd experiments the temporal dependent scour depth increases with the f 0 wall to the power of 2 being this parameter much more influent than the bed clearance c h in case of b f experiments the bed clearance does not even appear in the equation thus the scour depth depends on f 0 wall and time it must be mentioned that the time variable in b f experiments is referred only to the forward rotation time in the experiments 18 s x w 2 539 10 4 c h x w 1 2 u 0 g x w 2 l n t u 0 x w 4 425 19 s x w 2 531 10 3 u 0 g x w 2 67 l n t u 0 x w 3 19 at any time both for fwd and b f scenarios a linear agreement is found between f 0 wall and π1 yielding a coincident threshold value of f 0 wall above which erosion near the quay wall is present the threshold value of sediment scour at fw is found to lay between 0 25 and 0 3 thus no significative scour should be found if f 0wall 0 25 fig 12 shows the scour depth values at fw relative to the wall clearance and their linear relation with the wall froude number at every case 5 discussion in the present article the scouring action produced by twin propellers nearby quay walls is studied through a set of laboratory experiments over a mobile sand bed the scouring action of this particular propulsion system although very common in a wide range of ships has been barely studied so far compared to the scour due to single propeller jets the maximum scour depth is a measure of the potential damage and it is a needed parameter in marine structures design in pianc 2015 it is recommended to account for the over costs due to either a deeper construction according to the predicted maximum scour depth or due to scour protection if the former is not considered the maximum scour depth is found in the equilibrium profile of any scour hole most of the laboratory experiments in propeller scour are thus focused on finding the equilibrium profile and characterising the maximum scour depth as a function of the experimental setup however experiments at laboratory are limited and it is time consuming to account for all the parameters involved in the scour phaenomena summing up the intrinsic effects that the scale may have in any laboratory study scale effects due to gravity or sediment size for instance still the major part of the scientific literature in propeller scour in the past years comes from physical models several examples are mentioned in the introductory section of this work the limits of the scouring areas named fwa and hba areas following mujal colilles et al 2018 terminology have been defined in this paper by finding the boundaries of the scour holes which expand from its maximum depth position located either near the fw downstream the propellers in the hb or upstream the propellers below the ship hull as detailed in sub section 4 1 although it is not expected to find such clearly distinguishable areas in situ due to the ship movement differences may be observable if scour holes are found in the hb or near the fw thus knowing that a fwh hole or a hbh hole is present in castells et al 2017 and mujal colilles et al 2017 for instance the scour holes near the quay walls and far from them at the harbour basin are observable and analysed through the bathymetric studies performed by the port authorities during several years the merging of the fwh and hbh hole must be also considered since it is pretty clear that short distances to the front wall have a great influence on the development of a bigger scour hole both in terms of area and depth section 4 3 shows that the more harmful scenarios correspond to the lower wall clearances regardless of the change in flow velocities the affected area is not analysed in detail in this article although it is a variable of interest and must be studied in future works in roubos et al 2014 the authors point out that the effects of the twin jets compared to the effects of a single jet are related to a larger scour area although not necessarily a deeper hole it is considered that mainly the a p d p and the x w d p ratios play an important role in the widening and deepening of the scour hole and thus both terms must be considered in confined twin propeller induced scour studies for a unique distance to the quay wall a higher a p d p is expected to enlarge the width of the scour hole while decrease its depth in the experiments presented in this article the distance between the propeller axes is not included as a variable and the results obtained must be considered in case the a p d p is coincident or similar to the one in this work the effects of the seabed clearance have been analysed in this article showing an opposite effect over the hba and the fwa areas while at hba area the bed clearance has an inverse relation with the scour depth the farther the propeller is located the less scour is found the effects over the fwa area are found to follow direct relation with the bed clearance two different distances are studied in the present experiments both being in the range of the low ukc therefore the obtained relation between c h and s must be expected in low bed clearance situations at higher clearance distances the effect of the propeller jet in the fwh hole is expected to be reduced and eventually become negligible as it is in the case of the wall clearance further experiments must be focused in finding this threshold that may have direct practical applicability at field the position of the maximum depth over the x axis at hbh holes referred to the propeller plane does not change regardless of the change in x w c h or time in all the scenarios at any time the maximum depth at hbh hole or hbhfwd hole in case of b f experiments is located at 3 5dp from the propeller plane these results are in good agreement with cui et al 2020a for their experiments at x w 7d p although it is not explicitly analysed in their article the lack of change with the increasing x w can be explained if the wall clearance does not have any effect in the expansion angle of the propeller jet at the present range of wall clearance wei and chiew 2019 analysed the effects of the vertical wall close to the propeller jet in case of single propeller and showed that the expansion angle of the jet may decrease with the increasing wall clearance up to x w 4d p no effects are expected at further distance contrarily the lack of change in the position of the maximum depth at the hbh hole may be related with the presence of a horizontal boundary as studied in johnston et al 2013 for bed clearance up to at least 2d p an increase of the expansion angle must be expected with the increasing clearance from a minimum value of 8 the increase in the expansion angle due to the increase in the bed clearance in the present experiments would yield a similar distance to the jet impingement point thus yielding a similar location of the maximum scour depth as previously explained the non dimensional parameter π1 is linearly dependent on the f 0 wall at each experimental time yielding a threshold value below which scour is not found this threshold is found at f 0 wall 0 25 in the same line cui et al 2020a reported no scour near the quay wall in the test experiments at x w 9d p although with wall clearance of x w 7d p scour was visible therefore considering a no scour threshold at x w 7d p in their experiments performed over a sandy bed of d 50 0 2 mm and with a twin propeller of d p 55 mm rotating at 500 rpm the obtained wall froude number is f 0 w 0 24 this result is slightly below the threshold obtained in this article probably due to the slightly lesser sediment diameter used by cui et al 2020a in comparison with the present study this difference points to a partial agreement and to the need to consider different sediment diameters to obtain a clear threshold of the wall froude number to prevent scour over non protected beds in case of confined twin propeller jets the proposed empirical models to predict the maximum scour depth evolution are expected to work for the range of the non dimensional parameters in this article due to the experimental limitations the sediment size is kept constant in this work therefore this model shall be tested over different seabed compositions to study their performance in other scenarios however the range of densimetric froude number f 0 d covered by the present experiments 20 f 0 d 30 is closer to the real situations than most of the works found in literature as stated in section 2 which make the results obtained more realistic to the analysis of the local scour phaenomena in addition both d p and a p are constant in the present set of experiments these are considered highly relevant parameters conditioning the scour process due to twin propeller jets and must be included in future work even with these limitations the interesting relationships that the models yielded between the different parameters are considered to be useful for future experimental designs and to practical applications both in fwd and b f experiments the most harmful experimental set up for the fw area is the combination between higher speed of rotation and shorter wall clearance regardless of the seabed clearance in case of b f and combined with the higher seabed clearance in case of fwd the next two scenarios sorting by maximum depth of scour are by far the 400 rpm x w m i n and the 350 rpm x w m i n meaning that a significant change in the flow velocity is not of importance if the wall clearance is not increased the same behaviour is observed at lower speeds of rotation low speed close to the wall is more harmful than mid speed far from the wall according to the experimental results a clear relation is observed between the merging condition of every profile and the scour depth three different categories have been assigned to any profile for any scenario at any time no merged transition or merged profile in both fwd and b f scenarios the transition area location points to a relation between the scour depth near the front wall and the preservation of the two hole morphology with a threshold around the 15 of the wall clearance according to the obtained results in fig 5 an interesting behaviour is observed regarding to the merging condition in c h m i n cases the hbh hole is quickly developed reaching the approximate depth of 1dp after 5 min run both for x w m i n and x w m a x scenarios at x w m i n no growing is observed until t 25 min being the observed behaviour assimilable to the equilibrium profile during all this time the depth at hbh hole is not growing further but the downstream boundary of the hbh hole is being eroded until it reaches the same maximum depth 1dp the two holes profile is therefore merged at this point the clear linearly growing trend that the fwh hole followed so far roughly decays and the whole merged profile tend to the stabilization as seen in the long series fig 7 at x w m a x the same behaviour is expected the maximum hbh hole depth thus cannot go further 1dp as it was the case in the experiments performed by mujal colilles et al 2016 at labassa comparing confined and unconfined scenarios with a similar twin propeller model 6 conclusions a new set of experiments on twin propeller induced scour near quay walls is presented in this work a total of 24 experiments on confined local scour are performed with different experimental conditions aiming to analyse the influence of important parameters such as the bed clearance c h the wall clearance x w and the efflux velocity of the propeller u 0 in the scour depth two different regimes of propeller rotation are analysed in this work fwd and b f rotation b f rotation aims to analyse the scour evolution by iterating between backward and forward rotation a behaviour that is found in real ships when iterating berthing and unberthing manoeuvres differences are observed between the results obtained with the steady fwd rotation and the b f iterations being the results for the latter scenarios only dependent on the wall clearance and the time but with no differences due to the bed clearance fwd experiments allowed comparison with most of the empirical relations found in literature two empirical models are proposed in this paper to obtain the time dependent scour depth due to twin propellers in confined condition the use of the proposed models must be restricted to the range of non dimensional parameters used in the experiments new experimental work is needed to evaluate the twin propeller induced scour over different sediment sizes also including different separations between the propeller axes the threshold to scour is found to be dependent on the f 0 wall at each time considered a linear relation between the scour depth and the wall froude number is found agreeing all of them in a common threshold around f 0 wall 0 25 below which erosion is not found new studies will help to obtain a clear threshold probably including the sediment size as an independent variable a clear relation between the category of the profile merged transition to merge and no merged and the scour depth is found a transition scour depth around the 15 of the wall clearance is observed in the present experiments showing a threshold below which the scour profile maintains a two hole morphology funding this

20372,we present a new set of experiments in local scour due to confined twin propeller jets aiming to include propeller driving characteristics to the analysis of the scouring action during in port manoeuvres the maximum scour depth is studied as a function of the bed clearance the wall clearance and the efflux velocity of the jet aiming to reproduce more realistic manoeuvres both forward and backward rotation of the propellers are analysed showing a different behaviour the obtained results are used to propose two different empirical models one for each regime of rotation a new non dimensional parameter obtained from the buckingham π analysis proposed as wall froude number is used to find a clear threshold triggering the scouring mechanism the experimental results show that the distance to the vertical wall is the main contributor to the higher scour depths rather than the propeller speed of rotation or the bed clearance keywords propeller induced scour physical model harbour management sediment transport 1 introduction the use of marine propellers causes any vessel navigating or manoeuvring in a harbour to induce erosion over the seabed when the bed clearance is not large enough the high speed wash coming out of the propeller eventually reaches the seabed either due to its free expansion or the interaction with a port structure such as a berthing quay later the sediment is resuspended and transported thus leading to a scour hole the magnitude of the scour hole can be important and therefore cause several problems if not noticed and managed in due time structural stability of the marine structures and accumulation of sediment in navigable channels therefore reducing its operational draught are two of the main problems arisen due to ship propellers induced scour of this well documented problem are found in several bedside books in this topic such as gaythwaite and drive 2004 hoffmans and verheij 2021 sumer and fredsoe 2002 whitehouse 1997 the study of the propeller induced erosion has been traditionally performed experimentally in physical models the propeller jet properties and their effects over the sediment bed have been of importance during the past and recent years lam et al 2011 published a literature review on the experimental studies on propeller jets during the last decades showing the different empirical and semi empirical expressions developed to characterize the propeller jet mostly focused on local scour studies they collected the different methods to obtain the efflux velocity u 0 parameter the decay in the axial velocity with the axial distance or the velocity at the seabed as a function of the efflux velocity more recently wei et al 2020 published an exhaustive review of the propeller induced scour recent and past research including both the local scour research performed at physical models and recent studies in flow behaviour during the scour process performed by piv they distinguish two main research lines existing in propeller induced local scour unconfined conditions and confined conditions the former assumes the free expanding of the propeller jet flow while the latter considers the interaction of the jet flow with port structures closed or open quays between them research in scour due to confined propeller jets have received much less attention and not many articles are found in literature about the topic in case of confinement by a closed quay wall only hamill et al 1999 and cui et al 2020a proposed an expression to determine the expected scour depth due to single and twin propeller jets respectively besides the experimental research in physical models several studies have been performed in situ to validate all the empirical or semi empirical equations coming out from the laboratory the applicability of the laboratory expressions is discussed for instance in roubos et al 2014 in llull et al 2020 and in mujal colilles et al 2017 bathymetries of the harbour basin are used to validate some of the equations existing in guidelines using real vessel and manoeuvre data as input to the models blokland and smedes 1996 proposed one of the most used methods to analytically estimate the propeller induced velocity at seabed from field tests too abramowicz gerigk et al 2018 studied the bow thrusters induced currents by large ships and successfully test the expressions proposed in pianc 2015 for the most common ferry type vessels at gdynia port the last years have witnessed the growing trend in numerical studies in all branches of fluid mechanics and sediment transport several numerical studies have been performed in propeller jet modelling over the last two decades the earlier references are included in carlton 2012 although a considerable number of more recent articles mostly focused on propeller design noise reduction cavitation etc have been published in this field ahmed et al 2020 sun et al 2018 usta and korkut 2018 focusing on the flow evolution of a twin propeller cui et al 2020b recently published a combination of numerical and experimental research on the axial evolution of the twin propeller jet velocity and turbulence intensity more recently guarnieri et al 2021 studied the erosion effects of the large commercial vessels over the sediment of the port of genoa through a numerical study considering the propellers position as a moving and orientable flow and studying the effects over the sediment with the hydrodynamics and mud transport models mike 3 fm in reality multiple types of propellers and ships are found meaning that it is difficult to generalise when analysing the effects of the propeller jets however some types of ships are commonly associated with a specific propeller type for instance ferry and ro ro ships are commonly associated with stern twin propellers combined with one or two bow thrusters to manoeuvre these are one of the most common ships transiting mediterranean ports marzano et al 2020 and are object of the present paper depending on the port the characteristics of the sediment can differ in orders of magnitude sediment has been traditionally a problem in scaled physical models because of the impossibility to scale sediment if the geometrical scale is too large the use of several sediment sizes usually permits to account for a wide range of sediment types although there is a need to validate any expression obtained at laboratory in field cases to study its applicability since the magnitude of the scale effects are uncertain the present paper presents an experimental study at a laboratory with a twin propeller model in confined condition i e near a vertical boundary typical ro ro and ferry ships propellers are modelled in the presented set of experiments aiming at studying their effects near the harbour structures where they operate with daily basis mujal colilles et al 2018 presented the initial set of experiments and the present contribution increases the scenarios in pitch ratio and more importantly improving the measuring area by reaching to up to 0 05m to the vertical wall allowing the analysis of the local scour at the closest locations to the vertical wall with the obtained results we present a new empirical relationship between manoeuvring conditions and scouring action therefore the present work is divided into the following sections the case study and experimental set up are presented in sections 2 and 3 in section 4 the main results are shown the experimental results are shown in section 4 1 the existing empirical formulae is tested in section 4 2 and an empirical model for the time dependent scour near quay walls due to twin propeller jets is proposed in section 4 3 from the experimental results a non dimensional parameter named the wall froude number f 0 wall in the present article is proposed to be directly related with the scour depth in confined scenarios as explained in section 4 3 discussion over all the aforementioned topics is found in section 5 at the end of the manuscript an acronyms section is included as an aid in the reading process supplementary material is also provided including complementary figures 2 case study the present model is scaled from typical ro ro and ro pax vessels with twin propellers diameter up to d p 6m and a range of propeller speeds of rotation between 90 and 140 rpm these kind of ships usually operate with daily basis in most of the spanish mediterranean ports with short sea shipping industry castells sanabra et al 2020 marzano et al 2020 the twin propeller system combined with transverse thrusters allows these vessels to manoeuvre by their own means i e with no need of tug assistance in small harbour basins with low under keel clearance ukc defined as the 30 or less of the static draught of a ship according to imo 1993 and short distances to closed berthing quays the nature of their commercial activity makes these ships to perform the same manoeuvres every day at the same basins thus having an accumulative effect over the sediment bed these manoeuvres have a total duration of around 25 min manoeuvre with an accumulated time of 600 manoeuvres per year to fulfil the similarity requirements the froude number fr is used to scale the dynamic effects eq 1 considering also the reynolds self similarity theory by ensuring high enough reynolds number re 105 of the flow eq 2 and the propeller eq 3 4 to neglect scale effects due to viscosity according to verhey 1983 these effects can be avoided if the flow and propeller reynolds number are greater than 3 103 and 7 104 respectively moreover the range of densimetric froude numbers f 0 d eq 5 covered by the presented experiments is higher than in many of the existing laboratory studies in propeller induced scour where a considerably lower range 5 f 0 d 15 is usually found cui et al 2019 2020c hamill 1988 hong et al 2013 tan and yüksel 2018 however scale effects due to the sediment size must be expected since the densimetric froude number at prototype situation may reach f 0 d 170 in case of big ships over fine sand sediment mujal colilles et al 2017 table 1 summarizes the range of non dimensional parameter

medium scale water tank named labassa each propeller is connected to a triphasic motor 1 5 kw 50hz through a transmission chain at the same time each individual motor is connected to a variable frequency drive that is controlled from the laboratory computer allowing to set the desired propeller speed of rotation detailed information and a 3d sketch of the tank characteristics are found in mujal colilles et al 2017 and mujal colilles et al 2018 in the present experiments the twin propeller model was located in a position close enough to the vertical quay wall in advance front wall fw to ensure a confined flow condition aiming at studying the effects of a confined twin propeller jet over the sand bed near a vertical boundary the sketch in fig 1 shows the dimensions of the basin the sand bed and the measuring area including the different test conditions distance from the fw or wall clearance x w and distance from the propeller axis to the sand bed or bed clearance c h the dashed lines show a characteristic ship according to the geometric scale used in these experiments λ 1 25 if the main twin propellers system is scaled the grey structure in the upstream part of the propellers was covered by a solid steel plate trying to reproduce the effects of a ship hull with a large block coefficient such as ro ro or ro pax ships in the present experiments scour due to both forward fwd and backward bwd rotation of the twin propeller is studied by conducting two different sets of experiments in the same conditions forward fwd and back forth b f fwd experiments are performed with consecutive runs of forward rotation while b f experiments combine alternatively forward and backward rotation the experiments are explained in detail in subsection 3 2 of the present article the main characteristics of the twin propeller model and the sediment used in the present experiments are summarized in table 1 3 2 set of experiments the efflux velocity u 0 is one of the most important parameters to account for in order to characterize the propeller jet hamill et al 2004 and it is thus an important value to consider in the study of its induced scour however there is still no agreement in the scientific community to properly define this parameter for the purpose of propeller induced scour studies one can safely consider the u 0 as the maximum velocity taken from the time averaged measurements of the propeller axial induced velocities along the contraction plane of the jet ryan 2002 to analytically obtain this magnitude several equations grouped under a clear review in lam et al 2011 have been proposed in the past years by different authors to avoid uncertainty due to the efflux velocity calculation in the present work a set of measurements on the axial velocity distribution close to the propeller at x 0 5dp at two different speeds of rotation 250 rpm and 300 rpm were performed previous to the local scour experiments the measurements were made across a point by point grid using a pitot static probe coupled to a differential pressure sensor omega engineering with a sampling rate of 100hz the time averaged velocity distribution close to the propeller plane was used to obtain a value of u 0 for each speed of rotation the obtained u 0 permitted to obtain an experimental coefficient of thrust kt 0 65 0 02 with the commonly used expression eq 6 derived from the momentum theory the thrust coefficient is assumed constant in the range of speeds of rotation in the present work this statement has been proven several times in literature lam et al 2012 van velzen et al 2016 therefore the u0 is assumed linearly dependent on the speed of rotation in the experiments presented here 6 u 0 1 59 n d p k t to study the scouring effects of the twin propellers nearby a vertical wall a set of 24 experiments in confined scour is presented as summarized in table 2 the total time for each experiment was set to 30 min 1800s with bed scanning every 5 min to observe the evolution of the mobile sand bed some experiments were extended up to 60 min 3600s to observe the further evolution of the scour profiles in different scenarios to allow the bed scanning the propellers were stopped and started at each time interval according to hamill 1987 and hong et al 2013 the effect on the overall scour due to switching the propeller on and off can be neglected moreover it is considered that this is a comparable behaviour to real manoeuvres where the vessels depart and arrive in time intervals of hours the scanning was performed by 2 ultralab uws1m echo sounders with accuracy of 1 the echosounders were mounted on a moving bridge over the sediment bed a total of 38 longitudinal profiles separated by 7 5 cm were obtained at 40hz sampling rate containing the bed elevation measurements of longitudinal and transverse distance from the moving bridge to a reference point were obtained simultaneously with two photoelectric sensors efector200 o1d100 these measurements allowed to locate every single measure of the echosounder and generate a 3d surface of the measuring area the surface was interpolated to the scattered data in the input vectors by surface linear fitting over a grid with longitudinal and transverse resolution of 1 cm the regime column in table 3 states for the forward fwd or back forth b f rotation as mentioned in sub section 3 1 in fwd regime the propellers counterrotate inward rotation and the induced flow is directed towards the fw during the total duration of the experiment in b f regime the propellers rotation changes intermittently every 5 min following the froude similarity scaling of each manoeuvre at prototype from backward bwd to forward fwd rotation and the induced flow is directed first towards the unconfined part of the tank bwd rotation where the propeller supporting structure is located and after to the front wall fwd rotation the intention behind the b f experiments is to compare the results from the traditional experiments with steady fwd rotation with the results obtained by combining bwd and fwd rotation the last set up is closer to the reality of a ship near the wall which berths and unberths by combining backward and forward propeller rotation guarnieri et al 2021 llull et al 2020 wei et al 2020 4 results propeller induced scour is a three dimensional process of sediment resuspension and transport that happens over a mobile sediment bed in response to the forcing by a single or multiple propeller jet the time dependent scour process is described in this sub section for the case of a confined twin propeller system to show the more important characteristics of the scour hole with special attention to the maximum depth particularly the twin propeller confined scour process is described with contour plots focusing on the eroded areas and their evolution with time in twin propeller systems jets are originated separately from each propeller and they are not initially influenced by one another however at a certain distance which depends mainly on the distance between propeller axes and the propeller speed of rotation both jets merge into a unique jet jiang et al 2019 mujal colilles et al 2017 the merged jet impinges the seabed and causes a developing scour hole in advance hbh hole since it develops far from the front wall in the harbour basin this local scour hole is enlarged along the axial flow direction while expands symmetrically from its maximum depth longitudinal profile until it reaches the equilibrium when rotating in the fwd direction the influence of the front wall contributes to an important scouring action at its toe downstream of the hbh hole this second hole in advance fwh hole grows radially in the xy plane from the twin propeller central axis wall plane intersection both scour holes eventually merge if equilibrium is not reached before becoming a single main hole the described process can be observed at 10 min time intervals in the contour plots showed in fig 2 a b in these cases the mid speed of rotation scenario 350 rpm is chosen as the most representative of all the experiments the contour plots corresponding to the whole set of experiments at 5 min time intervals are included in the supplementary material of this article figs s1 s8 one of the most relevant features of all the experiments performed is that c h m i n cases induce a deeper hbh hole than c h m a x ones while contrarily the latter yields a deeper scour hole near the front wall the same phaenomena is observed in mujal colilles et al 2018 the larger the propeller bed clearance the lower is the influence of the horizontal boundary and therefore a more energetic jet reaches the vertical structure thus inducing a deeper fwh hole the wall clearance is related to both the depth of the fwh hole and the merging of the hbh and fwh hole this effect is clearly visible in fig 2a b where the two paradigmatic scenarios i e propeller located close to the bed and far from the wall or far from the bed and close to the wall are shown the condition of merged or no merged holes is related to the development of the scour hole and is analysed in detail in subsection 4 1 as previously explained b f scenarios fig 3 a b aim to be more realistic in terms of reproducing arrival and departure ship manoeuvres where the propellers are used mostly in backward and forward regimes respectively in these experiments a new scour hole is formed upstream of the propellers plane hba harbour basin area due to the backward bwd rotation in advance this scour hole will be referred as hbhbwd hole the structure nearby the propellers simulating the ship hull deflects the jet flow and causes the scour hole to be closer in this regime than the hole at the harbour basin area due to forward rotation in advance hbhfwd hole the behaviour of the backward flow is obviously not comparable to a free developing jet and neither is the scour hole created the hbhbwd hole although of considerable depth in some of the experiments 1 5dp does never reach to merge with the fwh hole and a very clear separation always exist between them it is thus considered that they must be object of an independent analysis since the present work focuses on the near quay holes that may affect the structure stability the hbhbwd holes are not analysed in detail in the rest of the article the hba area downstream of the propeller plane where the hbhfwd hole is located is not highly eroded in the b f experiments a different behaviour is observed in the downstream holes compared to the fwd experiments the suction of the propellers when rotating backward and the accretion area in the surroundings of the hbhbwd hole may be of importance contributing to an erosion refilling process that keeps the morphology in the hbhfwd less affected in comparison with its analogue hbh hole in fwd experiments in figs s7b c of the supplementary material for instance it is observed that the hbhfwd hole is reduced at t 15min respect to t 10min and the same happens at t 25min respect to t 20min at t 15min and t 25min the backward rotation just finished while at t 10min and t 20min the forward rotation just did 4 1 maximum depth profile the evolution of the maximum depth profile is key to obtain the position of the maximum expected depth as it is a geometric characteristic of the entire scouring hole together with its maximum length and maximum width penna et al 2019 in the present article due to the distance between the twin propellers a p a single scour hole is observed in the mobile bed evolution as seen above figs 2 and 3 and thus a single profile is used as the maximum depth profile the centre line profile located between the twin propeller axes is considered to be the longitudinal axis from which the scour hole expands symmetrically fig 4 a b shows the transversal profiles at the location of the maximum depth of every scour hole both fwd and b f experiments are considered the maximum depth at every x position along the whole measurement grid with δx 0 01m is compared with its corresponding centre line depth measured at the same x coordinate for depths higher than 0 1m the agreement in fig 4c indicates that a negligible error is committed if the maximum depth profile is assumed to be in the centre line thus the following analysis of maximum scour depth in this article is focused on the centre line profile the centre line profiles evolve differently depending on the experimental conditions in every profile the separation between the fwh hole and the hbh hole is found by locating the local maximum between the fwa area and the hba area fig 5 a1 a4 show that this maximum is found in some of the experiments although not in all of them due to the merging of the two holes since differences in the shape of the different profiles depend not only on the experiment but also on the time central profiles are categorised as follows no merged transition to merge and merged profiles in no merged profiles the fwa and hba area are clearly observable by distinguishing the two holes see fig 5a4 in merged profiles a single hole is observed between the front wall and the propeller plane as seen in fig 5a1 from t 15min transition to merge profiles are included to define the cases where two holes are still distinguishable but with a very eroded downstream boundary in the hbh hole becoming very asymmetric on its xz plane fig 5a1 from t 5min to t 10min fig 5a clearly shows that in fwd experiments x w m i n scenarios sub figures a1 and a3 tend to yield a merged profile while x w m a x experiments sub figures a2 and a4 preserve the initial two hole shape the fwh maximum depth grows linearly in all the cases showing no tendency to the equilibrium except in case of x w m i n c h m a x fig 5b1 once the profile is merged in case of no merged profiles the hbh grows rapidly at the first 5 min interval showing a decay in the growing rate after that up to a maximum depth of 1dp in case of c h m i n sub figures b3 and b4 this depth remains in equilibrium until the profile becomes merged fig 5b3 between t 25 min and t 30 min or until the end of the experiment fig 5b4 b f experiments are categorised into no merged and merged profiles according to the same criteria explained for fwd experiments in these experiments the main hbh hole appears due to the backwards rotation hbhbwd hole while the hbhfwd and fwh holes are the ones that may merge or keep the two hole shape in fig 6 merged profiles are observable in the c h m a x x w m i n cases sub figure a1 while the no merged are observable in the c h m i n x w m a x cases sub figure a4 the time series of the experiments in fig 6 show an intermittent growing every 5 min corresponding to the bwd fwd regime iteration no significant differences are observed with the change in the seabed clearance in this set of experiments mostly for x w m a x scenarios in which the curves increase simultaneously up to t 30 min in case of mid or low speed of rotation 350 rpm and 300 rpm the behaviour observed in the scour profiles does not change substantially in general the scour depth is reduced and the merging if exists is delayed with the lower speed of rotation the longitudinal profiles and the scour depth evolution in case of mid and low speed of rotation scenarios are shown in the supplementary material of this article from fig s9 to fig s12 the time series at fwh hole are plotted together in fig 7 including the long series mentioned in table 2 in fig 7 the reference time of b f series is modified to fit the forward rotation time for the sake of good comparability with fwd scenarios b f series arriving to t 30min 1800s in fig 7 correspond to long series i e experiments of 60 min run iterating backward and forward rotation as summarized in table 2 also the time series of 400 rpm x w m i n fig 7a run to 60 min 3600s in all cases c h m i n experiments red lines in b f regime solid lines yielded higher scour depths near the front wall than their corresponding fwd experiment while in c h m a x cases fwd and b f results show a similar evolution moreover the differences in the scour depth evolution between the c h m i n and c h m a x scenarios are remarkable in case of fwd experiments mostly at x w m i n in case of b f experiments the evolution of the scour depth is similar for both bed clearance scenarios interestingly the time series of c h m i n x w m i n fwd fig 7a show a tendency to the stabilization from t 1800s when the profile become merged see fig 5a the same pattern is observed in c h m i n x w m i n b f and c h m a x x w m i n fwd fig 7a from t 900s 15 min of forward rotation in wei 2018 this behaviour is known as the stabilization phase of the scour profile previous to the equilibrium stage in hong et al 2013 temporal similarity of the maximum scour depth profiles is found in the case of unconfined scour holes in the present experiments similarity of the fwh hole is observed in all the fwd and b f experiments if analysed separately according to the merged no merged condition of each one only the profiles obtained at t 15 min of experimental time are considered to avoid higher scatter of the data at the initial stages of the developing scour holes the length of the fwh hole l fwh is taken as the distance between the front wall and the first local maximum in the central scour profile as shown previously in this sub section fig 5a1 a4 and fig 6a1 a4 non dimensional fwh profiles in fig 8 are obtained when l fwh is used as the maximum length together with the measured maximum depth d fwh in this range therefore the non dimensional coordinates x ˆ and y ˆ are obtained as x ˆ x l f w h and y ˆ y d f w h as shown in fig 8a c all the non dimensional profiles generally collapse for any time and experiment this is particularly true in case of no merged profiles a polynomial fitting function is applied to the non dimensional profiles yielding the best fit to minimize rmse fig 8b d shows that no merged profiles are fitted by a 3rd degree polynomial function while merged profiles are fitted by a 5th degree one transition profiles are not included in these results since they cannot become an equilibrium profile due to their transitory nature the variability on the position of the maximum depth due to the change in u 0 x w c h and t is analysed by finding the maximum depth at hba and fwa areas in every single profile in fig 9 the positions of the maximum depth over the whole grid are observed grouped by its corresponding experimental conditions fig 9a and clustered by hole type fig 9b the k means clustering algorithm locates 5 different data clusters to minimize the distance euclidian distance between each object and the cluster centroid the centroid is assumed to be a representative position of the maximum depth location of every characteristic scour hole within every cluster a unique value of x w is present clearly meaning that nor c h u 0 and time are relevant in the location of the scour hole interestingly the distance to the maximum depth position of the hbhfwd hole barely changes although the wall clearance changes considerably 4 2 validation of literature equations this section aims to validate the existing equations published so far by comparing them with the results obtained in the presented experiments the obtained experimental results show the evolution of the scour depth near the vertical wall with time since the equilibrium condition is not found in all cases the expressions in literature focused on the calculation of the equilibrium depth are not comparable to the obtained results directly however the existing models to obtain the time dependent scour depth may be applied cui et al 2020a proposed an empirical model for inwards rotating twin propellers in confined scenarios following the previous study of unconfined twin propeller scour in cui et al 2019 where a temporal model for the prediction of the induced scour due to twin propeller jets is shown cui et al 2020a proposed eq 14 to simply obtain the maximum scour due to a confined twin propeller jet from eq 11 13 in cui et al 2019 focused on the time evolution of the maximum scour depth in case of unconfined twin propeller induced erosion when applying the proposed equations the efflux velocity u 0 values are obtained according to eq 6 as explained in sub section 3 2 11 s u n c o n f ω ln t γ 12 ω 0 2526 a p d 50 0 859 c d 50 4 63 d p d 50 3 58 f 0 d 4 535 13 γ 1 389 a p d 50 0 1571 c d 50 0 742 d p d 50 0 522 f 0 d 0 682 14 s c o n f s u n c o n f 3 5 x w d p 0 4 in this case the experimental values obtained at t 30 min as in cui et al 2019 are used only fwd experiments are included for the sake of good comparison although in cui et al 2020a only experiments with the lower bed clearance are performed 0 5dp from the propeller tip i e c h m i n scenarios in the present article cui et al 2019 included a more extensive range of seabed clearance distances considering the influence of this variable on the final scour profile the range of bed clearance in cui et al 2019 is coincident with the one in the present work in fig 10 the predicted scour depth values yielded by eq 11 14 are plotted against the measured scour depths near the front wall significant disagreements are found between the experimental results and the proposed models the results are coloured by x w and c h showing that the proposed model clusters the data according to the clearance distance since this variable is not included in the model moreover the results of the present study do not fit the model neither in case of c h m i n nor c h m a x 4 3 temporal model of maximum scour depth at fw since the existing models do not fit the results obtained in the laboratory a new empirical non linear model for time dependent scour due to confined twin propeller jets is proposed regardless of the unconfined scour profile the time dependent scour depth near the front wall s can be expressed as a function of the following dimensional parameters 15 s f u 0 x w c h d 50 g ρ w ρ s t μ a p d p in the present set of data important parameters clearly conditioning the scour process d 50 a p d p are unique due to experimental limitations the other important parameters involved in the propeller induced scour u 0 x w c h cover a realistic range of values in cases of ro ro ships manoeuvring in shallow waters i e with low ukc since they are scaled from the study case vessel type as explained in section 2 using the buckingham π theorem if constant parameters and viscosity are not considered and ρ s x w and u 0 are used as fundamental variables the following non dimensional parameters are obtained π 1 s x w π 2 c h x w π 3 u 0 g x w π 4 t x w u 0 16 π 1 f 2 π 2 π 3 π 4 the confinement situation is considered to be the most important characteristic of the scour near quay walls and consequently the wall clearance x w is chosen as fundamental parameter thus π3 a froude number the characteristic length of which is not the jet or propeller diameter but the wall clearance is obtained this parameter is referred in advance as wall froude number f 0 wall the f 0 wall increases linearly with the efflux velocity and decreases with the square root of the distance to the wall meaning that the relation between the initial velocity of the jet and the distance from the jet to the quay wall is of main importance in the confined scour process time is dimensionless with the time scale which in this model is proposed to be x w u 0 an optimization of the general non linear model in eq 17 is performed to get the best coefficient of determination and different constants and powers k 1 a b c are proposed to obtain the best fit 17 π 1 k 1 π 2 a π 3 b ln π 4 c fig 11 shows the linear agreement between the predicted and measured scour depth to the wall clearance π1 in case of fwd experiments sub figure a and b f experiments sub figure b the merging condition is chosen as the grouping variable yielding a clear gradient from no merged to merged scenarios as the maximum depth wall clearance ratio increases in both cases the transition between no merged and merged is located around π1 0 15 the different fitted logarithmic curves and the measured data coloured depending on the experimental setup in the legend are plotted and included in the supplementary material of this article fig s13 in case of fwd experiment the data corresponding to the experiments with n 350 rpm mid speed of rotation are not shown to avoid overlapping data points a different model is fitted for each gear scenario fwd and b f experiments eq 18 and eq 19 show the non linear models for each one of them that yielded coefficients of determination r2 0 971 and r2 0 952 respectively for fwd experiments the temporal dependent scour depth increases with the f 0 wall to the power of 2 being this parameter much more influent than the bed clearance c h in case of b f experiments the bed clearance does not even appear in the equation thus the scour depth depends on f 0 wall and time it must be mentioned that the time variable in b f experiments is referred only to the forward rotation time in the experiments 18 s x w 2 539 10 4 c h x w 1 2 u 0 g x w 2 l n t u 0 x w 4 425 19 s x w 2 531 10 3 u 0 g x w 2 67 l n t u 0 x w 3 19 at any time both for fwd and b f scenarios a linear agreement is found between f 0 wall and π1 yielding a coincident threshold value of f 0 wall above which erosion near the quay wall is present the threshold value of sediment scour at fw is found to lay between 0 25 and 0 3 thus no significative scour should be found if f 0wall 0 25 fig 12 shows the scour depth values at fw relative to the wall clearance and their linear relation with the wall froude number at every case 5 discussion in the present article the scouring action produced by twin propellers nearby quay walls is studied through a set of laboratory experiments over a mobile sand bed the scouring action of this particular propulsion system although very common in a wide range of ships has been barely studied so far compared to the scour due to single propeller jets the maximum scour depth is a measure of the potential damage and it is a needed parameter in marine structures design in pianc 2015 it is recommended to account for the over costs due to either a deeper construction according to the predicted maximum scour depth or due to scour protection if the former is not considered the maximum scour depth is found in the equilibrium profile of any scour hole most of the laboratory experiments in propeller scour are thus focused on finding the equilibrium profile and characterising the maximum scour depth as a function of the experimental setup however experiments at laboratory are limited and it is time consuming to account for all the parameters involved in the scour phaenomena summing up the intrinsic effects that the scale may have in any laboratory study scale effects due to gravity or sediment size for instance still the major part of the scientific literature in propeller scour in the past years comes from physical models several examples are mentioned in the introductory section of this work the limits of the scouring areas named fwa and hba areas following mujal colilles et al 2018 terminology have been defined in this paper by finding the boundaries of the scour holes which expand from its maximum depth position located either near the fw downstream the propellers in the hb or upstream the propellers below the ship hull as detailed in sub section 4 1 although it is not expected to find such clearly distinguishable areas in situ due to the ship movement differences may be observable if scour holes are found in the hb or near the fw thus knowing that a fwh hole or a hbh hole is present in castells et al 2017 and mujal colilles et al 2017 for instance the scour holes near the quay walls and far from them at the harbour basin are observable and analysed through the bathymetric studies performed by the port authorities during several years the merging of the fwh and hbh hole must be also considered since it is pretty clear that short distances to the front wall have a great influence on the development of a bigger scour hole both in terms of area and depth section 4 3 shows that the more harmful scenarios correspond to the lower wall clearances regardless of the change in flow velocities the affected area is not analysed in detail in this article although it is a variable of interest and must be studied in future works in roubos et al 2014 the authors point out that the effects of the twin jets compared to the effects of a single jet are related to a larger scour area although not necessarily a deeper hole it is considered that mainly the a p d p and the x w d p ratios play an important role in the widening and deepening of the scour hole and thus both terms must be considered in confined twin propeller induced scour studies for a unique distance to the quay wall a higher a p d p is expected to enlarge the width of the scour hole while decrease its depth in the experiments presented in this article the distance between the propeller axes is not included as a variable and the results obtained must be considered in case the a p d p is coincident or similar to the one in this work the effects of the seabed clearance have been analysed in this article showing an opposite effect over the hba and the fwa areas while at hba area the bed clearance has an inverse relation with the scour depth the farther the propeller is located the less scour is found the effects over the fwa area are found to follow direct relation with the bed clearance two different distances are studied in the present experiments both being in the range of the low ukc therefore the obtained relation between c h and s must be expected in low bed clearance situations at higher clearance distances the effect of the propeller jet in the fwh hole is expected to be reduced and eventually become negligible as it is in the case of the wall clearance further experiments must be focused in finding this threshold that may have direct practical applicability at field the position of the maximum depth over the x axis at hbh holes referred to the propeller plane does not change regardless of the change in x w c h or time in all the scenarios at any time the maximum depth at hbh hole or hbhfwd hole in case of b f experiments is located at 3 5dp from the propeller plane these results are in good agreement with cui et al 2020a for their experiments at x w 7d p although it is not explicitly analysed in their article the lack of change with the increasing x w can be explained if the wall clearance does not have any effect in the expansion angle of the propeller jet at the present range of wall clearance wei and chiew 2019 analysed the effects of the vertical wall close to the propeller jet in case of single propeller and showed that the expansion angle of the jet may decrease with the increasing wall clearance up to x w 4d p no effects are expected at further distance contrarily the lack of change in the position of the maximum depth at the hbh hole may be related with the presence of a horizontal boundary as studied in johnston et al 2013 for bed clearance up to at least 2d p an increase of the expansion angle must be expected with the increasing clearance from a minimum value of 8 the increase in the expansion angle due to the increase in the bed clearance in the present experiments would yield a similar distance to the jet impingement point thus yielding a similar location of the maximum scour depth as previously explained the non dimensional parameter π1 is linearly dependent on the f 0 wall at each experimental time yielding a threshold value below which scour is not found this threshold is found at f 0 wall 0 25 in the same line cui et al 2020a reported no scour near the quay wall in the test experiments at x w 9d p although with wall clearance of x w 7d p scour was visible therefore considering a no scour threshold at x w 7d p in their experiments performed over a sandy bed of d 50 0 2 mm and with a twin propeller of d p 55 mm rotating at 500 rpm the obtained wall froude number is f 0 w 0 24 this result is slightly below the threshold obtained in this article probably due to the slightly lesser sediment diameter used by cui et al 2020a in comparison with the present study this difference points to a partial agreement and to the need to consider different sediment diameters to obtain a clear threshold of the wall froude number to prevent scour over non protected beds in case of confined twin propeller jets the proposed empirical models to predict the maximum scour depth evolution are expected to work for the range of the non dimensional parameters in this article due to the experimental limitations the sediment size is kept constant in this work therefore this model shall be tested over different seabed compositions to study their performance in other scenarios however the range of densimetric froude number f 0 d covered by the present experiments 20 f 0 d 30 is closer to the real situations than most of the works found in literature as stated in section 2 which make the results obtained more realistic to the analysis of the local scour phaenomena in addition both d p and a p are constant in the present set of experiments these are considered highly relevant parameters conditioning the scour process due to twin propeller jets and must be included in future work even with these limitations the interesting relationships that the models yielded between the different parameters are considered to be useful for future experimental designs and to practical applications both in fwd and b f experiments the most harmful experimental set up for the fw area is the combination between higher speed of rotation and shorter wall clearance regardless of the seabed clearance in case of b f and combined with the higher seabed clearance in case of fwd the next two scenarios sorting by maximum depth of scour are by far the 400 rpm x w m i n and the 350 rpm x w m i n meaning that a significant change in the flow velocity is not of importance if the wall clearance is not increased the same behaviour is observed at lower speeds of rotation low speed close to the wall is more harmful than mid speed far from the wall according to the experimental results a clear relation is observed between the merging condition of every profile and the scour depth three different categories have been assigned to any profile for any scenario at any time no merged transition or merged profile in both fwd and b f scenarios the transition area location points to a relation between the scour depth near the front wall and the preservation of the two hole morphology with a threshold around the 15 of the wall clearance according to the obtained results in fig 5 an interesting behaviour is observed regarding to the merging condition in c h m i n cases the hbh hole is quickly developed reaching the approximate depth of 1dp after 5 min run both for x w m i n and x w m a x scenarios at x w m i n no growing is observed until t 25 min being the observed behaviour assimilable to the equilibrium profile during all this time the depth at hbh hole is not growing further but the downstream boundary of the hbh hole is being eroded until it reaches the same maximum depth 1dp the two holes profile is therefore merged at this point the clear linearly growing trend that the fwh hole followed so far roughly decays and the whole merged profile tend to the stabilization as seen in the long series fig 7 at x w m a x the same behaviour is expected the maximum hbh hole depth thus cannot go further 1dp as it was the case in the experiments performed by mujal colilles et al 2016 at labassa comparing confined and unconfined scenarios with a similar twin propeller model 6 conclusions a new set of experiments on twin propeller induced scour near quay walls is presented in this work a total of 24 experiments on confined local scour are performed with different experimental conditions aiming to analyse the influence of important parameters such as the bed clearance c h the wall clearance x w and the efflux velocity of the propeller u 0 in the scour depth two different regimes of propeller rotation are analysed in this work fwd and b f rotation b f rotation aims to analyse the scour evolution by iterating between backward and forward rotation a behaviour that is found in real ships when iterating berthing and unberthing manoeuvres differences are observed between the results obtained with the steady fwd rotation and the b f iterations being the results for the latter scenarios only dependent on the wall clearance and the time but with no differences due to the bed clearance fwd experiments allowed comparison with most of the empirical relations found in literature two empirical models are proposed in this paper to obtain the time dependent scour depth due to twin propellers in confined condition the use of the proposed models must be restricted to the range of non dimensional parameters used in the experiments new experimental work is needed to evaluate the twin propeller induced scour over different sediment sizes also including different separations between the propeller axes the threshold to scour is found to be dependent on the f 0 wall at each time considered a linear relation between the scour depth and the wall froude number is found agreeing all of them in a common threshold around f 0 wall 0 25 below which erosion is not found new studies will help to obtain a clear threshold probably including the sediment size as an independent variable a clear relation between the category of the profile merged transition to merge and no merged and the scour depth is found a transition scour depth around the 15 of the wall clearance is observed in the present experiments showing a threshold below which the scour profile maintains a two hole morphology funding this

20373,the design and engineering of ships and platforms that operate in the ocean environment requires understanding of a nonlinear dynamical system that responds according to complex interaction with a wide range of sea and wind conditions time domain observation of nonlinear marine dynamics with either experiments or high fidelity numerical simulation tools is costly due to the random nature of the ocean and the full range of environmental and loading conditions that are experienced in the lifetime of a ship or platform in this paper a data driven method is presented to predict the complex

engineering for systems that operate in the ocean environment is challenging due to the wide range of conditions that oceans exhibit and the complex dynamical interaction of fluids and structures ships offshore platforms and renewable energy devices are examples of engineering systems that must be designed for optimal performance in typical conditions and engineered to operate safely and reliably in all conditions including the most extreme a great challenge to designers is the need to consider a wide range of environmental conditions such as wave current and wind the ocean environment is random and dynamical responses must be described statistically diez et al 2018 guo et al 2016 furthermore the dynamical response of marine systems is inherently nonlinear especially for operation in the most severe seastates traditional engineering practice employs simplified or linearized hydrodynamical methods or experiments to predict ship or platform responses in typical

experiments or cfd due to the expense and specialized methods must be used to extrapolate statistics belenky et al 2012 campbell et al 2016 or predict the worst case environment choi and jensen 2019 recent activity in data science has generated new algorithms and ideas towards developing data driven models for complex systems and in this paper a data driven method based on long short term memory neural networks is presented for the representation of nonlinear marine dynamical systems cfd is used to generate training data and the machine learning model is used to recreate the cfd predictions for new wave fields at a small fraction of the cost of cfd data driven models usually require a certain quantity of data to produce a model of the desired accuracy for simple systems whose dynamics can be described by their state space equations such as through ordinary differential equations ode evaluation of the response under prescribed loading environments is often fast however for complex systems where high fidelity simulations are often involved evaluating the response is usually expensive for example solving the response of a ship in waves via cfd can take days on a parallel computer for a simulation time window of minutes niklas and pruszko 2019 shen et al 2015 tezdogan et al 2015 hence the preparation of simulation data with different environments for model training becomes unaffordable on the other hand high fidelity simulations are valuable because modeling extreme events of nonlinear systems requires accurate information about the response therefore for complex systems building models that approximate their dynamical behavior is valuable as long as the approximation properly represents the nonlinearity in the extreme state and the data requirement to train the model is affordable moreover it helps to better understand the statistical behavior of the system by running long time simulations using the faster running model rather than being limited to the quantity of data that is affordable with expensive simulation building models for complex systems is often challenging reduced order models are often achieved by leveraging many assumptions to simplify the complex dynamical behavior of the system for example quasi static or linear assumptions are often used when the studied response is small so that the higher order terms are negligible due to the strong assumptions leading to simplified equations closed form conclusions are sometimes available for highly nonlinear systems such assumptions might fail to present important nonlinear behaviors including but not limited to the dependency of initial conditions and chaos hence more advanced mathematical models like nonlinear odes are often selected cercos pita et al 2016 and numerical simulations of mathematical models are used to explore the response however there exists many real world examples where mathematical models are often unaccessible and only observation of the system response is possible successful characterization of the system based on observation becomes crucial to system analysis and design a data driven model can also be helpful when the existing method is computationally expensive and the user is only interested in partial results from the simulation as an example when the user would like to know the ship response under various wave environments a cfd simulation is often used to calculate the whole flow field including the pressure and velocity for all discretized fluid cells to predict its response however if the user is only interested in the ship motion most of the computation is unused a more efficient approach is to directly map the wave environments to the ship response without calculation of the entire fluid domain the process to characterize the system given its inputs and outputs is called system identification si the objective of si is to build a model that can be used to predict the system outputs under new inputs fig 1 shows the flowchart for a si problem many studies have been developed in nearly all engineering fields including the marine domain ariza ramirez et al 2018 casado and ferreiro 2005 rajesh and bhattacharyya 2008 semi experimental models combine parameters and existing knowledge about the system the model parameters are estimated based on the observed inputs and outputs and determined by solving an optimization problem models built from si have been successfully applied to real world systems for decades however many models require user intuition domain knowledge and intrinsic familiarity about the system a new family of models that utilize deep learning has recently emerged to accomplish this task since their powerful and efficient model architectures outperform other existing methods in solving the si problems moreover new methods are so general that users need much less information about the systems to build the model in this paper a long short term memory lstm model is introduced to solve the si problem once the model is built it can be used as an alternative to the original system for simulation usage the cost of conducting simulations with the new model is found to be much less than compared to the original system the remainder of the paper is organized as follows first details about the proposed method are discussed including problem formulation data preparation model architecture training and inference then the data driven model is tested on two problems the propagation of a nonlinear water wave and the nonlinear roll motion of a ship section 2 methodology in this section the methodology to create a data driven model for marine dynamics is described the regression problem and the way that the data is prepared is described details of the model architecture are presented and the model training and evaluation are provided 2 1 regression model the objective of the data driven model is to predict the system output given the system input examples of input output pairs are wave elevation at different locations or wave elevation near the ship and the motion of the ship for a causal system the current output depends only on the input up to and including the current timestamp similar to a discrete state space representation let x t and y t be the input and output signals at time index t respectively a simple general equation that governs a discrete dynamical system is 1 s t f s t 1 s t 2 x t x t 1 2 y t g s t s t 1 s t 2 where f and g are nonlinear mappings and s is the state variable the state variable for a 1 dof simple spring mass damper system can be position and velocity however a more general example can be a ship with 6 dof motion in waves possible states may include input and response history and any function of the history polynomial sinusoidal etc it is the task of the machine learning model to learn which quantities to include in s how to transfer s from time t 1 to t and the best nonlinear mappings f and g hence the machine learning algorithm takes in the input series x 1 x t and the output series y 1 y t and produces the trained mappings f g and s once the model training is finished it can predict the system output series based on given new input series even with time length different from that used in the training time series predicting output time series in the form of a real number sequence y 1 y t is a regression problem the model parameters are learned to minimize the difference between the ground truth sequence y 1 y t and the sequence prediction y ˆ 1 y ˆ t 2 2 data preparation to train the model both input and corresponding output in the format of discrete time series are prepared it is suggested to have the training data in a similar sea state with the validation data here validation data is used to indicate data that is previously unseen by the model and used to validate the accuracy of the model otherwise response behavior under one loading condition might be different from another loading condition as a result the given output in the training dataset provides limited and less information about the dynamical behavior under the validation condition simulations or experiments are conducted to collect the input output pairs of time series the input matrix and the output matrix therefore have the shape of m t where m is the number of collected time series and t is the number of time steps in the discrete time series the length of the time record is t l for many cases the input and output signals are stationary time series which makes data normalization easier let μ x and σ x be the mean and standard deviation for the input series and let μ y and σ y be the mean and standard deviation for the output series after standardizing each time series using the respective μ and σ the training dataset consisting of the input matrix x and the output matrix y is formed as 3 x x 11 x 12 x 1 t x 21 x 22 x 2 t x m 1 x m 2 x m t 4 y y 11 y 12 y 1 t y 21 y 22 y 2 t y m 1 y m 2 y m t as a general reference table 1 lists the dimensions of x and y for the example cases used in this paper all time series are discretized uniformly with constant sampling frequency the record length is labeled by t l the collected dataset is split into training 80 and validation 20 datasets the model is then trained using the training dataset and the model performance is evaluated on the validation dataset 2 3 model architecture a family of neural networks called recurrent neural networks rnn hopfield 1982 rumelhart et al 1986 is found effective to learn the complex mapping from the system input to the system output fig 2 shows two equivalent representations of the rnn structure in the diagram the output prediction y ˆ 1 y ˆ 2 y ˆ t y ˆ t is calculated by the rnn given the input sequence x 1 x 2 x t x t where t is the total number of discrete time steps at each time step the output y ˆ t is calculated based on the current input x t and the current state that is stored inside the rnn the state is also updated based on the previous stored value and the current input x t the specific functions that are used to calculate the output and update the states are usually parameterized the parameters of functions then are optimized or learned by minimizing the difference between the predictions and the given ground truths note that in the forward propagation or predicting or inference stage the model parameters are unchanged from t to t 1 while the state value of the rnn does change from t to t 1 there are different concrete implementations of rnn architecture a well known design called long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 olah 2015 is widely used in sequence learning tasks including but not limited to machine translation speech recognition natural language processing fig 3 shows how a lstm cell calculates the cell output h t and updates its cell state c t given the cell input x t the previous output h t 1 and the previous state value c t 1 with concrete mathematical equations as follows 5 f t σ w f h t 1 x t concatenate b f 6 i t σ w i h t 1 x t concatenate b i 7 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t concatenate b c 8 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 9 o t σ w o h t 1 x t concatenate b o 10 h t o t tanh c t where σ is the sigmoid function is the elementwise multiplication w f b f w i b i w c b c w o and b o are the lstm parameters to learn from the data though h t can be directly used as the prediction of the system response multiple layers of rnn so called deep rnn can increase the model capability to recognize more complex relations between the input and the output in the provided dataset as an example fig 4 shows a network consisting of five lstm layers in an unfolded view each lstm layer takes the output sequence from the previous lstm layer or the input layer as the input sequence a dense layer with linear activation functions takes the output from the last lstm layer as the input and generates the final output of the design here dense layer means that each node in the layer connects with all the nodes in the previous layer table 2 lists the output shape after each layer where h is the number of hidden state units none in the output shape allows an arbitrary number of time steps in the time series a typical number of hidden units h is from 20 to 100 and h 50 is used for all examples discussed herein the n y in the final dense layer indicates the design can generate sequence predictions for a vector consisting of n y elements 2 4 model training model training is an optimization problem which means finding the model parameters that minimize the loss or cost function between the prediction and the ground truth reference since each element in the output sequence y is real valued the loss function for this regression task can be the mean squared error averaged over all time steps 11 l y ˆ y 1 t t 1 t y ˆ t y t 2 where y ˆ is the prediction of the output sequence and y is the ground truth sequence therefore the training process consists of the following steps to update the parameters of the model 1 forward propagation the model computes from the input layer towards the output layer for a batch of time series based on the current parameters 2 compute loss the outputs from the model are compared to the provided ground truth sequences and the loss for the batch is calculated 3 backward propagation the model computes the loss derivative with respect to each parameter of the model this computation is from the output layer to the input layer 4 update parameters the model updates its parameters based on the loss derivatives calculated above the parameters are updated in form of gradient descent 12 w w α f w l w 13 b b α f b l b where w and b are weights and biases parameters respectively l w and l b are the derivatives of the loss with respect to the parameters and α is the learning rate specific forms of f w and f b depends on the optimizer and in this work the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 is used since the number of time series in the training dataset m is relatively small from 10 to 100 the batch size is selected to be m which is also called batch gradient descent with batch size m the number of epochs equals to the number of iterations during training for all current examples 1000 iterations with the learning rate α 0 001 are typically enough for the loss to converge 2 5 model inference once the model is trained it can predict the output sequence given any new input sequence following the same procedure from the forward propagation the prediction and the ground truth output sequences are compared and error is computed the model performance is then evaluated based on the error for both the training dataset and the validation dataset 3 example second order nonlinear wave the first example shows applying the lstm network to characterize a 2d nonlinear second order irregular wave as a surrogate problem two wave probes are placed a distance apart to record the wave elevation time series the upstream wave elevation is regarded as the system input and the downstream wave elevation is regarded as the system output the linear elevation profile is calculated by 14 η 1 n 1 n a n cos k n x ω n t ϕ n where k n is the wave number for the n th fourier component and the wave numbers and their corresponding frequencies are related by the dispersion relation 15 ω n 2 g k n tanh k n d where d is the water depth and g is the gravitational constant forristall 2000 gives the second order correction η 2 to the irregular wave elevation by considering the interactions between different fourier frequencies the final nonlinear elevation is evaluated as η η 1 η 2 table 3 lists the wave environment specifications due to the interaction among different fourier components the resultant wave elevation for the nonlinear wave is non gaussian the distance between two probes is 2 λ max 565 m by uniformly and identically sampling the phase angle ϕ i from π to π 100 wave scenarios are simulated and 100 input output pairs of time series are collected each time series has time window length of 240 s and is sampled by period of 0 6 s the input dataset x and output dataset y has the shape of 100 400 both input and output elevation series are normalized by the mean and standard deviation and then are split into a training dataset x train y train and a validation dataset x val y val the model has two lstm layers each containing 50 cells followed by a dense layer the data driven model is implemented by using keras chollet et al 2015 which is a high level application programming interface api for tensorflow abadi et al 2015 the model is built using 500 training steps fig 5 shows the loss on the training data decreases during the training process the performance of the trained model is evaluated for both training and validation datasets fig 6 compares predictions of 3 training outputs and their ground truth fig 7 compares predictions of 3 validation outputs and their ground truth generally speaking the prediction of the output is close to the ground truth after t 50 s the mismatch between the prediction and the ground truth before 50 s is due to propagation time for information to travel between the two probes the propagation time for information to travel downstream is relative to the phase velocity which can be estimated by x f c p min 46 7 s for the slowest phase velocity to travel the distance between the probes to further understand the data requirement for the development of the model the training is performed on smaller datasets of 20 40 and 60 samples the training and validation errors are shown in fig 8 the rms error for each time series of the training data are shown in black triangles and the error for each validation time series is shown with a blue triangle as the number of training samples increases the validation error decreases because the model is more robust due to being trained on more data note that the training error increases slightly with an increase in training dataset size this is because as the training dataset broadens the optimizer finds the best set of model parameters to match predictions over a larger dataset the general matching between the prediction and the ground truth validates that the nonlinear wave propagation is successfully identified 4 example nonlinear roll of a ship section in irregular waves 4 1 training data generation with cfd a second example is to model the nonlinear roll of a ship section training data is generated with cfd of the two dimensional 2 d midship section of the office of naval research tumblehome onrt geometry bishop et al 2005 shown in fig 9 the bilge keels and unique tumblehome sectional shape create a nonlinear dynamical response of the ship section due to wave excitation the ship geometry and fluid properties are summarized in table 4 the mass and loading condition are derived from bishop et al 2005 and the resulting vertical center of gravity k g corresponds to a metacentric height g m t of 1 5 m the ship is free to heave and roll and is constrained in the sway degree of freedom the input signal is the wave elevation at a location 185 m from the ship centerline the beam is 18 8 m the output is the heave and roll angle the ship is subjected to random waves in a sea state 7 jonswap γ 3 3 spectrum with a significant wave height h s 7 5 m and a peak modal period t p 15 s 150 cfd realizations are generated with different random seeds for the wave phase vector ϕ n in eq 14 and each simulation is 360 s 15 hr total simulation time to avoid repeat of the wave elevation 150 fourier components are utilized the total computational cost for the 150 cfd realizations is 6600 cpu hours 4 2 data driven model architecture training and performance a model to predict the ship motion heave and roll based on the single input of wave elevation 185 m from the ship the model has two lstm layers each containing 50 cells followed by a dense layer the data driven model is implemented by using keras chollet et al 2015 the cfd dataset has different units and scales and is best to nondimensionalize and rescale the data for the model training each data signal is rescaled with the mean and variance x σ μ also the cfd data is generated for non constant timestep size to ensure that each column of data has the same number of elements each time history is interpolated with a sampling period of 0 25 s there are a total 150 realizations and with the uniform step size of 0 25 s each realization has 1440 data points to validate our machine learning model the datasets are split into a training dataset and a validation dataset with 0 8 0 2 ratio therefore 120 realizations are seen by the model during training and the remaining 30 are unseen by the model and only used for validation the model is trained using 10 000 epochs and the training loss is shown in fig 10 using a gpu the training of the model takes about 17 min to run 10 000 epochs although the model is mostly trained after 2000 epochs once the deep lstm model is trained the trained model is used to predict the heave and roll motion given the wave elevation in the validation dataset two error measures l 2 more precisely root mean squared error and l are used to evaluate the performance on each validation time history 16 l 2 y y ˆ 1 t i 1 t y i y ˆ i 2 17 l y y ˆ max i 1 t y i y ˆ i where y y 1 y t is the ground truth y ˆ y ˆ 1 y ˆ t is the corresponding prediction and t is the total number of discrete points in the time series the heave prediction error is normalized by the beam length and the roll prediction error is represented in degrees fig 11 shows the l 2 left and l for both degrees of freedom heave x axis and roll y axis in each subplot the 120 training errors and the 30 validation errors are labeled in different colors as shown inf both subplots the validation errors are generally larger than the training errors this is expected since the validation dataset is previously unseen by the model which is optimized for the training data to further examine the model performance in the validation dataset time domain samples are shown since two error measures l 2 and l and two degrees of freedom heave and roll are used in the experiment prediction results can be sorted by different orders specifically the sorting order can be based on the l 2 error in heave the l 2 error in roll the l error in heave and the l error in roll in each of the 4 sorting orders the best 4 predictions and the worst 4 predictions are shown below see figs 12 19 as the figures shown the model can effectively predict the heave and roll motions given the wave elevations the error l 2 and l is small even for the worst predicted cases most of the error comes from the prediction at the initial transient phase which is also seen in the nonlinear wave propagation example this error can also be explained by the wave propagation distance between the wave probe location and the ship body location 5 conclusions in this paper a data driven model for nonlinear marine dynamics is presented the model architecture uses recurrent neural nets to learn the input output relationship between different wave probes or the wave elevation and body motion the long short term memory neural net is built using the keras toolbox training and validation data are generated with second order wave theory and fully nonlinear computational dynamics the results for both problems shows that the nonlinear dynamics can be successfully learned with a purely data driven technique for the ship roll problem the rms error for unseen validation data was typically around 1 degree of roll and less than 1 the ship beam for heave the data cost is reasonable with 150 time histories each of length 360 s is used for both training and validation the deep neural net is trained in 10 000 epochs which requires only 17 mins on a gpu although both example problems are two dimensional their is no fundamental reason why the data driven architecture cannot be applied to one or three dimensional problems the important aspects for building the model are to provide sufficient data in training so that the model can learn about the important relationship between the input and output this means that if the wave conditions are significantly different a new dataset should be provided so that any new nonlinearities can be exposed in the training data and learned by the

is found to be much less than compared to the original system the remainder of the paper is organized as follows first details about the proposed method are discussed including problem formulation data preparation model architecture training and inference then the data driven model is tested on two problems the propagation of a nonlinear water wave and the nonlinear roll motion of a ship section 2 methodology in this section the methodology to create a data driven model for marine dynamics is described the regression problem and the way that the data is prepared is described details of the model architecture are presented and the model training and evaluation are provided 2 1 regression model the objective of the data driven model is to predict the system output given the system input examples of input output pairs are wave elevation at different locations or wave elevation near the ship and the motion of the ship for a causal system the current output depends only on the input up to and including the current timestamp similar to a discrete state space representation let x t and y t be the input and output signals at time index t respectively a simple general equation that governs a discrete dynamical system is 1 s t f s t 1 s t 2 x t x t 1 2 y t g s t s t 1 s t 2 where f and g are nonlinear mappings and s is the state variable the state variable for a 1 dof simple spring mass damper system can be position and velocity however a more general example can be a ship with 6 dof motion in waves possible states may include input and response history and any function of the history polynomial sinusoidal etc it is the task of the machine learning model to learn which quantities to include in s how to transfer s from time t 1 to t and the best nonlinear mappings f and g hence the machine learning algorithm takes in the input series x 1 x t and the output series y 1 y t and produces the trained mappings f g and s once the model training is finished it can predict the system output series based on given new input series even with time length different from that used in the training time series predicting output time series in the form of a real number sequence y 1 y t is a regression problem the model parameters are learned to minimize the difference between the ground truth sequence y 1 y t and the sequence prediction y ˆ 1 y ˆ t 2 2 data preparation to train the model both input and corresponding output in the format of discrete time series are prepared it is suggested to have the training data in a similar sea state with the validation data here validation data is used to indicate data that is previously unseen by the model and used to validate the accuracy of the model otherwise response behavior under one loading condition might be different from another loading condition as a result the given output in the training dataset provides limited and less information about the dynamical behavior under the validation condition simulations or experiments are conducted to collect the input output pairs of time series the input matrix and the output matrix therefore have the shape of m t where m is the number of collected time series and t is the number of time steps in the discrete time series the length of the time record is t l for many cases the input and output signals are stationary time series which makes data normalization easier let μ x and σ x be the mean and standard deviation for the input series and let μ y and σ y be the mean and standard deviation for the output series after standardizing each time series using the respective μ and σ the training dataset consisting of the input matrix x and the output matrix y is formed as 3 x x 11 x 12 x 1 t x 21 x 22 x 2 t x m 1 x m 2 x m t 4 y y 11 y 12 y 1 t y 21 y 22 y 2 t y m 1 y m 2 y m t as a general reference table 1 lists the dimensions of x and y for the example cases used in this paper all time series are discretized uniformly with constant sampling frequency the record length is labeled by t l the collected dataset is split into training 80 and validation 20 datasets the model is then trained using the training dataset and the model performance is evaluated on the validation dataset 2 3 model architecture a family of neural networks called recurrent neural networks rnn hopfield 1982 rumelhart et al 1986 is found effective to learn the complex mapping from the system input to the system output fig 2 shows two equivalent representations of the rnn structure in the diagram the output prediction y ˆ 1 y ˆ 2 y ˆ t y ˆ t is calculated by the rnn given the input sequence x 1 x 2 x t x t where t is the total number of discrete time steps at each time step the output y ˆ t is calculated based on the current input x t and the current state that is stored inside the rnn the state is also updated based on the previous stored value and the current input x t the specific functions that are used to calculate the output and update the states are usually parameterized the parameters of functions then are optimized or learned by minimizing the difference between the predictions and the given ground truths note that in the forward propagation or predicting or inference stage the model parameters are unchanged from t to t 1 while the state value of the rnn does change from t to t 1 there are different concrete implementations of rnn architecture a well known design called long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 olah 2015 is widely used in sequence learning tasks including but not limited to machine translation speech recognition natural language processing fig 3 shows how a lstm cell calculates the cell output h t and updates its cell state c t given the cell input x t the previous output h t 1 and the previous state value c t 1 with concrete mathematical equations as follows 5 f t σ w f h t 1 x t concatenate b f 6 i t σ w i h t 1 x t concatenate b i 7 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t concatenate b c 8 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 9 o t σ w o h t 1 x t concatenate b o 10 h t o t tanh c t where σ is the sigmoid function is the elementwise multiplication w f b f w i b i w c b c w o and b o are the lstm parameters to learn from the data though h t can be directly used as the prediction of the system response multiple layers of rnn so called deep rnn can increase the model capability to recognize more complex relations between the input and the output in the provided dataset as an example fig 4 shows a network consisting of five lstm layers in an unfolded view each lstm layer takes the output sequence from the previous lstm layer or the input layer as the input sequence a dense layer with linear activation functions takes the output from the last lstm layer as the input and generates the final output of the design here dense layer means that each node in the layer connects with all the nodes in the previous layer table 2 lists the output shape after each layer where h is the number of hidden state units none in the output shape allows an arbitrary number of time steps in the time series a typical number of hidden units h is from 20 to 100 and h 50 is used for all examples discussed herein the n y in the final dense layer indicates the design can generate sequence predictions for a vector consisting of n y elements 2 4 model training model training is an optimization problem which means finding the model parameters that minimize the loss or cost function between the prediction and the ground truth reference since each element in the output sequence y is real valued the loss function for this regression task can be the mean squared error averaged over all time steps 11 l y ˆ y 1 t t 1 t y ˆ t y t 2 where y ˆ is the prediction of the output sequence and y is the ground truth sequence therefore the training process consists of the following steps to update the parameters of the model 1 forward propagation the model computes from the input layer towards the output layer for a batch of time series based on the current parameters 2 compute loss the outputs from the model are compared to the provided ground truth sequences and the loss for the batch is calculated 3 backward propagation the model computes the loss derivative with respect to each parameter of the model this computation is from the output layer to the input layer 4 update parameters the model updates its parameters based on the loss derivatives calculated above the parameters are updated in form of gradient descent 12 w w α f w l w 13 b b α f b l b where w and b are weights and biases parameters respectively l w and l b are the derivatives of the loss with respect to the parameters and α is the learning rate specific forms of f w and f b depends on the optimizer and in this work the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 is used since the number of time series in the training dataset m is relatively small from 10 to 100 the batch size is selected to be m which is also called batch gradient descent with batch size m the number of epochs equals to the number of iterations during training for all current examples 1000 iterations with the learning rate α 0 001 are typically enough for the loss to converge 2 5 model inference once the model is trained it can predict the output sequence given any new input sequence following the same procedure from the forward propagation the prediction and the ground truth output sequences are compared and error is computed the model performance is then evaluated based on the error for both the training dataset and the validation dataset 3 example second order nonlinear wave the first example shows applying the lstm network to characterize a 2d nonlinear second order irregular wave as a surrogate problem two wave probes are placed a distance apart to record the wave elevation time series the upstream wave elevation is regarded as the system input and the downstream wave elevation is regarded as the system output the linear elevation profile is calculated by 14 η 1 n 1 n a n cos k n x ω n t ϕ n where k n is the wave number for the n th fourier component and the wave numbers and their corresponding frequencies are related by the dispersion relation 15 ω n 2 g k n tanh k n d where d is the water depth and g is the gravitational constant forristall 2000 gives the second order correction η 2 to the irregular wave elevation by considering the interactions between different fourier frequencies the final nonlinear elevation is evaluated as η η 1 η 2 table 3 lists the wave environment specifications due to the interaction among different fourier components the resultant wave elevation for the nonlinear wave is non gaussian the distance between two probes is 2 λ max 565 m by uniformly and identically sampling the phase angle ϕ i from π to π 100 wave scenarios are simulated and 100 input output pairs of time series are collected each time series has time window length of 240 s and is sampled by period of 0 6 s the input dataset x and output dataset y has the shape of 100 400 both input and output elevation series are normalized by the mean and standard deviation and then are split into a training dataset x train y train and a validation dataset x val y val the model has two lstm layers each containing 50 cells followed by a dense layer the data driven model is implemented by using keras chollet et al 2015 which is a high level application programming interface api for tensorflow abadi et al 2015 the model is built using 500 training steps fig 5 shows the loss on the training data decreases during the training process the performance of the trained model is evaluated for both training and validation datasets fig 6 compares predictions of 3 training outputs and their ground truth fig 7 compares predictions of 3 validation outputs and their ground truth generally speaking the prediction of the output is close to the ground truth after t 50 s the mismatch between the prediction and the ground truth before 50 s is due to propagation time for information to travel between the two probes the propagation time for information to travel downstream is relative to the phase velocity which can be estimated by x f c p min 46 7 s for the slowest phase velocity to travel the distance between the probes to further understand the data requirement for the development of the model the training is performed on smaller datasets of 20 40 and 60 samples the training and validation errors are shown in fig 8 the rms error for each time series of the training data are shown in black triangles and the error for each validation time series is shown with a blue triangle as the number of training samples increases the validation error decreases because the model is more robust due to being trained on more data note that the training error increases slightly with an increase in training dataset size this is because as the training dataset broadens the optimizer finds the best set of model parameters to match predictions over a larger dataset the general matching between the prediction and the ground truth validates that the nonlinear wave propagation is successfully identified 4 example nonlinear roll of a ship section in irregular waves 4 1 training data generation with cfd a second example is to model the nonlinear roll of a ship section training data is generated with cfd of the two dimensional 2 d midship section of the office of naval research tumblehome onrt geometry bishop et al 2005 shown in fig 9 the bilge keels and unique tumblehome sectional shape create a nonlinear dynamical response of the ship section due to wave excitation the ship geometry and fluid properties are summarized in table 4 the mass and loading condition are derived from bishop et al 2005 and the resulting vertical center of gravity k g corresponds to a metacentric height g m t of 1 5 m the ship is free to heave and roll and is constrained in the sway degree of freedom the input signal is the wave elevation at a location 185 m from the ship centerline the beam is 18 8 m the output is the heave and roll angle the ship is subjected to random waves in a sea state 7 jonswap γ 3 3 spectrum with a significant wave height h s 7 5 m and a peak modal period t p 15 s 150 cfd realizations are generated with different random seeds for the wave phase vector ϕ n in eq 14 and each simulation is 360 s 15 hr total simulation time to avoid repeat of the wave elevation 150 fourier components are utilized the total computational cost for the 150 cfd realizations is 6600 cpu hours 4 2 data driven model architecture training and performance a model to predict the ship motion heave and roll based on the single input of wave elevation 185 m from the ship the model has two lstm layers each containing 50 cells followed by a dense layer the data driven model is implemented by using keras chollet et al 2015 the cfd dataset has different units and scales and is best to nondimensionalize and rescale the data for the model training each data signal is rescaled with the mean and variance x σ μ also the cfd data is generated for non constant timestep size to ensure that each column of data has the same number of elements each time history is interpolated with a sampling period of 0 25 s there are a total 150 realizations and with the uniform step size of 0 25 s each realization has 1440 data points to validate our machine learning model the datasets are split into a training dataset and a validation dataset with 0 8 0 2 ratio therefore 120 realizations are seen by the model during training and the remaining 30 are unseen by the model and only used for validation the model is trained using 10 000 epochs and the training loss is shown in fig 10 using a gpu the training of the model takes about 17 min to run 10 000 epochs although the model is mostly trained after 2000 epochs once the deep lstm model is trained the trained model is used to predict the heave and roll motion given the wave elevation in the validation dataset two error measures l 2 more precisely root mean squared error and l are used to evaluate the performance on each validation time history 16 l 2 y y ˆ 1 t i 1 t y i y ˆ i 2 17 l y y ˆ max i 1 t y i y ˆ i where y y 1 y t is the ground truth y ˆ y ˆ 1 y ˆ t is the corresponding prediction and t is the total number of discrete points in the time series the heave prediction error is normalized by the beam length and the roll prediction error is represented in degrees fig 11 shows the l 2 left and l for both degrees of freedom heave x axis and roll y axis in each subplot the 120 training errors and the 30 validation errors are labeled in different colors as shown inf both subplots the validation errors are generally larger than the training errors this is expected since the validation dataset is previously unseen by the model which is optimized for the training data to further examine the model performance in the validation dataset time domain samples are shown since two error measures l 2 and l and two degrees of freedom heave and roll are used in the experiment prediction results can be sorted by different orders specifically the sorting order can be based on the l 2 error in heave the l 2 error in roll the l error in heave and the l error in roll in each of the 4 sorting orders the best 4 predictions and the worst 4 predictions are shown below see figs 12 19 as the figures shown the model can effectively predict the heave and roll motions given the wave elevations the error l 2 and l is small even for the worst predicted cases most of the error comes from the prediction at the initial transient phase which is also seen in the nonlinear wave propagation example this error can also be explained by the wave propagation distance between the wave probe location and the ship body location 5 conclusions in this paper a data driven model for nonlinear marine dynamics is presented the model architecture uses recurrent neural nets to learn the input output relationship between different wave probes or the wave elevation and body motion the long short term memory neural net is built using the keras toolbox training and validation data are generated with second order wave theory and fully nonlinear computational dynamics the results for both problems shows that the nonlinear dynamics can be successfully learned with a purely data driven technique for the ship roll problem the rms error for unseen validation data was typically around 1 degree of roll and less than 1 the ship beam for heave the data cost is reasonable with 150 time histories each of length 360 s is used for both training and validation the deep neural net is trained in 10 000 epochs which requires only 17 mins on a gpu although both example problems are two dimensional their is no fundamental reason why the data driven architecture cannot be applied to one or three dimensional problems the important aspects for building the model are to provide sufficient data in training so that the model can learn about the important relationship between the input and output this means that if the wave conditions are significantly different a new dataset should be provided so that any new nonlinearities can be exposed in the training data and learned by the

20374,this paper applies the method of statistical quadratization to investigate the first and second order responses of a floating offshore wind turbine platform due to forces from a catenary mooring system and wave current coupled interaction the hydrodynamics are based on the generalized morison s equation while the catenary mooring system is based on a quasi static approach the method of statistical quadratization replaces the nonlinearities using equivalent linear and quadratic terms by minimizing the difference between the nonlinear model and the approximated model in a mean square sense in this regard an iterative scheme is applied in which the equivalent polynomial coefficients are calculated based on the non gaussian distribution generated by means of gram charlier expansions the dynamics are solved using the volterra theory and described in terms of transfer functions which can be directly integrated into the central moments of the distribution the results demonstrate an excellent agreement with nonlinear time domain simulations in terms of spectral response and probability distribution sensitivity studies are performed to show the contribution of the second order motion over several environmental conditions despite the excellent accuracy the main advantage of the statistical quadratization is the low computational cost which is approximately two orders of

and environmentally friendly characteristics leung and yang 2012 jonkman et al 2009 furthermore offshore wind offers a number of advantages over onshore wind at offshore locations the wind resources are more consistent stronger and less turbulent than onshore manwell et al 2010 owts are not restricted in size by road or rail constraints and the increase in size of wind turbines can lead to economic and power capture benefits also owts have less visual impact annoyance from noise and do not occupy valuable land karimirad 2014 pao and johnson 2011 presently fixed offshore wind turbines are in a mature stage of development with many farms installed across the globe however fixed owts are limited to shallow to transitional waters usually up to 60 m due to the rapid increase in the cost with the water depth as most of the offshore wind potential is located in deep waters the wind industry is moving towards floating structures despite clear advantages of harvesting wind in deep water locations the complexity in the design of floating offshore wind turbines fowts is significant compared to fixed structures butterfield et al 2007 pao and johnson 2011 jonkman 2007 2009 in addition the dynamics of fowts are highly nonlinear and the correct prediction of the loads and motions are required to reduce the levelized cost of energy lcoe and avoid the fatigue of the components and failure of the system roddier et al 2010 in most offshore platforms high levels of vibration are generally undesirable in order to extend the life of the system hence offshore structures are often designed to have natural frequencies outside the excitation spectrum range sea spectrum unlike wave energy converters that generally operate in resonance silva et al 2020 offshore platforms are likely to be subjected to severe environmental loads such as wind wave current earthquake and ice loading van der tempel et al 2011 an initial procedure during the design of offshore wind turbines is to translate environmental loads especially from wind and wave to design loads and analyze the vibration response of the structure van der tempel et al 2011 however avoiding excitation at natural frequencies is a nontrivial task most of the environmental loads have a random character with energy content spread over a broad range of frequencies a major complication occurs for nonlinear dynamic systems it is well known that nonlinearities cause vibrations outside the excitation frequency range which may lead to a significant vibration response as a result the nonlinear dynamics must be accounted for when designing offshore wind systems robertson et al 2013 the dynamics of fowts are characterized by nonlinear forces random excitation and a relatively small hydrodynamic damping in some degrees of freedom these characteristics can lead the structure to vibrate outside the excitation frequency range as a result second order loads are important to consider when analyzing different floating concepts such as spars semi submersibles and tension leg platforms tlp as shown in robertson et al 2013 second order forces generate low frequency loads given by the difference between the frequency components as well as high frequency loads given by the sum of the frequency components in general each floating concept has its own dynamic properties and different sources of second order loads might be significant depending on the system especially when the force matches the structure s natural frequencies typically low frequency components are especially important for surge pitch and yaw motions of catenary moored structures such as spars and semi submersibles due to their large inertia and low stiffness while the sum frequency forces may also excite the tower bending modes duarte et al 2014 jonkman et al 2009 for vertically moored platforms such as tlps the structures tend to have a natural frequency in the vertical plane higher than the dominant wave frequency hence sum frequencies can excite the natural frequency in pitch and heave donley and spanos 2012 robertson et al 2013 considering the case of wind turbines mounted on semi submersible platforms the second order motions can be of the same order of magnitude as first order ones robertson et al 2013 resulting in large horizontal excursions at lower frequencies among the nonlinear forces that might result in relevant second order loads the current wave interaction applied to fowt remains insufficiently investigated the current wave interaction can have a significant influence on the responses of fowts during operational and severe sea states which can lead to the fatigue of its components e g mooring system and tower qu et al 2020 chen and basu 2019 2018 sarkar et al 2020 in addition the presence of current velocity and wind loads changes the operation point of the mooring system which can lead to a nonlinear restoring force and consequently slightly alter the apparent natural frequency note that currents can also lead to flow induced motions of the platform chen et al 2018 carlson and modarres sadeghi 2018 gonçalves et al 2020 in this general context methods of predicting the vibration response are extremely important one of the most useful versatile and efficient analytical methods to estimate the response of nonlinear systems under stochastic loads spanos 1981 is statistical linearization sl kazakov 1954 booton 1953 1954 caughey 1963 the method allows researchers to obtain an approximated response of the system when exact solutions are unavailable in contrast to the perturbation technique the sl does not require the assumption of smallness of the parameters and unlike monte carlo simulations sl does not demand extensive computational cost roberts and spanos 2003 however even though sl usually provides a reasonable estimate of the mean and mean square response the results using sl only span the range of the primary excitation spectrum moreover the equivalent linear solution leads to a gaussian distribution whilst in practice the response may be characterized by a non gaussian one therefore linear models might lose the salient features of the actual dynamics for a survey on the sl method the reader is encouraged to consult the roberts and spanos 2003 socha 2008 2005a b to circumvent the limitations of the sl method the nonlinear function may be replaced by an equivalent nonlinear one in a polynomial form via the statistical nonlinearization method donley and spanos 2012 spanos and donley 1991 tognarelli et al 1997a b the method can be seen as an extension of the sl with high order volterra series to approximate the response of the nonlinear system donley and spanos 2012 based on a stochastic analysis the polynomial coefficients of the expansion can be found by minimizing the difference between the nonlinear and the equivalent polynomial function in a mean square sense which requires the knowledge of the probability distribution for fixed structures obtaining the probability distribution is straight forward however if the structure is allowed to move as in the case of floating structures the probability distribution of the variables must be found iteratively since the statistics are not known a priori in this regard the volterra series approach can be described in terms of transfer functions and be directly integrated into the process to yield the psd and cumulants or central moments of the non gaussian response bedrosian and rice 1971 the probability density function pdf can be constructed from the central moments via direct integration in frequency domain fd and the probability distribution estimated using gram charlier expansion donley and spanos 2012 therefore the application of statistical nonlinearization can be an effective tool to estimate and understand the high order responses of fowts in general polynomials up to second or third order are sufficient to represent the nonlinear behavior which is also known as statistical quadratization sq donley and spanos 2012 and statistical cubicization method respectively tognarelli et al 1997a the following work investigates the second order effect caused by the current wave interaction and catenary mooring system using sq and applies the methodology to the oc3 hywind spar wind turbine jonkman 2010 illustrated in fig 1 the paper is structured as follows first the modeling of the current and waves interaction is described then the nonlinear dynamics of the wind turbine platform and its equivalent linear and quadratic terms are derived the sq method is performed and compared against nonlinear time domain td simulations and with sl and fd models to demonstrate the capability and limitations of each model parametric studies are performed to demonstrate the sensitivity of the environmental conditions on the second order response finally a discussion of some important aspects of the method such as computational cost limitations and importance of the loads are highlighted and the conclusion section summarizes the main results 2 ocean currents ocean currents are the continuous movement of ocean water that are generated by a number of driving forces large currents are created mainly by the effects of earth s rotation coriolis effect gravity wind stress temperature and salinity differences density gradients while meso scale currents are also driven by tides river discharges and pressure gradients haas et al 2013 typical ocean current speeds have a mean velocity of around 0 2 to 0 6 m s and a maximum speed around 1 1 to 2 7 m s depending on the location fratantoni 2001 like wind speed current velocity varies in time and space however the timescale and length of the variations are much larger than the wind therefore ocean currents may be represented by a constant velocity in time and as a function of the vertical coordinate z van der tempel et al 2011 the representation of the ocean current profile u c used in this paper follows the power law profile like the wind shear profile where the input parameter is the current velocity at the water surface u c 0 u c 0 considering the coordinate reference described in fig 2 the current velocity can be expressed as vugts 2013 1 u c z u c 0 z h h 1 7 with h z 0 where h denotes the water depth as ocean currents might be driven from different sources such as wind tidal forces or density differences ismail 1984 alternative equations can be used to improve the representativeness of the specific current profile 3 ocean waves within the context of the linear theory ocean waves can be described using the well known airy wave theory newman 2018 the linear representation allows the superposition of elementary results wave elevations and velocities which are essential for the representation of real sea states in a spectral representation hence the wave surface elevation can be written as a sum of n ω frequency components 2 ζ t j 1 n ω re η a j e i ω j t ϕ j where η a j is the complex amplitude of the wave elevation that depends on the wave frequency ω j and ϕ j is a random phase angle which is assumed to be evenly distributed from 0 to 2 π once the current velocity is present the traditional linear wave theory expressions are modified to consider the wave current interaction on the wave particle velocity wavenumber wavelength etc huang et al 1972 the interaction between wave particle velocities and current can be solved analytically for uniform and linear current profile in this regard eq 1 is linearized around the mean submerged length which has shown excellent agreement for the conditions proposed platform and water depth therefore the wave particle velocity in the horizontal direction considering the linearized profile can be calculated as silva et al 2016 3 u z t j 1 n ω re η a j ω j k j u c 0 cosh k j h z sinh k j h e i ω j t ϕ j j 1 n ω re η a j h u j e i ω j t ϕ j where h u is the transfer function between the wave velocity and the wave surface elevation at a specified vertical position and k is the wavenumber the wavenumber is obtained based on the linear dispersion relation which considers the current interaction and can be written as silva et al 2016 4 ω j k j u c 0 2 g k j ω j k j u c 0 d u c d z tanh k j h where g denotes the gravitational acceleration note that once the ocean waves interact with the current velocity the wavelength increases and the wave elevation reduces when waves and current propagate in the same direction and the wavelength reduces and the wave elevation increases when the current propagate in the opposite direction 4 dynamic model of the platform using statistical quadratization for the proposed formulation the fowt platform moored using a catenary configuration illustrated in fig 2 is considered the coordinate reference system is located at the sea waterline and coincides with the platform location for the undisturbed conditions the following analysis concerns the effect of the mooring wave and current interaction hence the mooring system force is described by a nonlinear function of the platform displacement the hydrodynamic force is represented as a nonlinear function which depends on the platform velocity and wave and current interaction and the wind turbine thrust force is simply expressed as a constant force note that a first order approximation for the wind turbine aerodynamics using sl can be included as shown in da silva et al 2021 in this work only the surge direction is analyzed due to the possible large excursions of the platform on the horizontal plane and more pronounced effect of the nonlinear mooring and wave current interaction based on these considerations the response of the platform in the surge direction can be modeled as 5 m x f t f c x f h x x u u u c where m denotes the mass of the entire fowt including ballast x denotes the surge displacement and denote the first and second time derivative f t f c and f h refer to the thrust mooring and hydrodynamic forces respectively the mooring force is expressed as the sum of a linear and nonlinear component 6 f c k 0 x f c nl x where k 0 is the linear stiffness around the undisturbed position and f c nl is the nonlinear component of the mooring force due to the catenary configuration the hydrodynamic force is described as 7 f h f h l x u f h nl x u u c b x where the first two terms in the rhs are the linear inertial force and nonlinear viscous drag terms in the morison s equation and an additional damping b is included as recommended by statoil for the hydrodynamics of the oc3 hywind spar to match with the free decay responses jonkman 2010 the linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic forces based on morison s equation morison et al 1950 are discretized into n s segments along the submerged length due to the differences on the horizontal components of the wave particle velocities and current these forces can be written as 8 f h l q 1 n s

and c a denotes the drag and added mass coefficients respectively the discretized force is integrated over the entire length of the spar l note that the wave velocity is considered at the cylinder s center line assuming that the structure does not affect the wave velocity field considering the mass of the structure equal to the mass of the displaced volume and considering the added mass and drag coefficients the same for the entire spar eq 5 can be manipulated and rewritten as 11 c m m x b x k 0 x c m q 1 n s ρ v q u q f h nl f c nl where c m is the inertia coefficient c m 1 c a and v q is the volume of each section v q d l q π d q 2 4 the aerodynamic thrust force and the current incidence lead to a mean displacement also the viscous drag becomes non symmetric with respect to x which results in a mean force hence the stationary response can be written as 12 x t μ x x ˆ t where 13 μ x f t f c nl f h nl k 0 where denotes the mathematical expectation μ x is the mean displacement and denotes a stationary and zero mean process which is non gaussian the mean response can be subtracted from the governing equation eq 11 and the nonlinear terms can be approximated by an equivalent

stiffness terms x ˆ rel denotes the relative velocity between the fluid and the structure x ˆ rel u x ˆ the equivalent linear and quadratic hydrodynamic terms of each section are represented by b lin q and b quad q the linear and quadratic coefficients are calculated by minimizing the mean square difference between the original nonlinearity and its equivalent linear and nonlinear one in a

between the displacement and relative velocity over the entire length as negligible the minimization can be split into two components one for the terms dependent on the displacement and one for the relative velocity this assumption is considered valid when the damping of the system is relatively small and the linear force contribution which is dominant is a function of the wave acceleration based on the assumptions above and defining x ˆ t x ˆ x ˆ 2 x ˆ 2 the resulting equivalent polynomial coefficients for the stiffness can be calculated as 17 x ˆ x ˆ t k f c nl x ˆ where 18 x ˆ x ˆ t μ

the hydrodynamic coefficients are minimized for each section and they can be described as a damping and excitation force terms da silva et al 2020 therefore eq 11 can be rewritten based on the

ρ v q u ˆ q b lin q u ˆ q where the subscript eq refers to the equivalent linear terms which accounts for the linear terms and statistically linearized terms note that the equivalent linear force is frequency dependent due to the wave velocity and acceleration following the derivations in donley and spanos 2012 the solution of eq 21 can be represented as an infinite volterra series as 23 x ˆ t p 1 λ p x ˆ p t where terms up to p 2 must be accounted for in the sq and λ is a scalar coefficient equal to one that is introduced for bookkeeping reasons substituting eq 23 into 21 and equating terms with same power of λ the response can be expressed by two linear systems as 24 c m m x ˆ 1 b eq x ˆ 1 k eq x ˆ 1 f eq 1 25 c m m x ˆ 2 b eq x ˆ 2 k eq x ˆ 2 k quad x ˆ 1 2 x ˆ 1 2 q 1 n s b quad q x ˆ rel q 1 2 x ˆ rel q 1 2 note that the same differential operator is used for both linear systems also the two equations are intertwined since eq 25 depends on the response in eq 24 and the equivalent linear and quadratic terms depend on the response of both equations the response of the system can be written as 26 c m m x ˆ b eq x ˆ k eq x ˆ f ˆ f ˆ 0 f ˆ 1 f ˆ 2 the rhs of eq 26 can be described as a volterra series with the linear wave elevation η as the input 27 f t f ˆ 0 h f 1 τ 1 η t τ 1 d τ 1 h f 2 τ 1 τ 2 η t τ 1 η t τ 2 d τ 1 d τ 2 where h f 1 τ 1 and h f 2 τ 1 τ 2 are the linear and quadratic volterra kernels for force and their corresponding transfer function can be described by h f ˆ 1 and h f ˆ 2 respectively as 28 h f ˆ 1 ω f eq ω and 29 h f ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 2 k quad h x ˆ 1 ω 1 h x ˆ 1 ω 2 q 1 n s b quad q h x rel q 1 ω 1 h x rel q 1 ω 2 where the transfer function of the relative velocity can be obtained for each section as 30 h x ˆ rel q 1 ω h u ˆ q h x ˆ 1 ω and the spar velocity is obtained through the displacement transfer function as 31 h x ˆ 1 ω i ω h x ˆ 1 ω the operator in eq 26 is linear hence the response can be described in a similar form as 32 x ˆ t x ˆ 0 x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 x ˆ 0 h x ˆ 1 τ 1 η t τ 1 d τ 1 h x ˆ 2 τ 1 τ 2 η t τ 1 η t τ 2 d τ 1 d τ 2 where the linear and quadratic volterra kernels for displacement h x ˆ 1 τ 1 and h x ˆ 2 τ 1 τ 2 can be described respectively using transfer functions as 33 h x ˆ 1 ω h ω h f ˆ 1 ω and 34 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 2 h ω 1 ω 2 h f ˆ 2 ω where 35 h ω ω 2 c m m i ω b eq k eq 1 note that according to the formulation provided the zero order response x ˆ 0 in eq 32 is the expected value of x ˆ 2 with negative sign hence x ˆ t 0 4 1 probability distribution and central moments although the excitation force is gaussian the response probability deviates from the gaussian one for the proposed formulation this occurs because the quadratic response is a quadratic transformation of the gaussian process the exact response distribution is unknown however since part of the distribution is already gaussian it is possible to approximate the distribution by using a gram charlier expansion of the gaussian distribution johnson and kotz 1972 the nonlinearities described in this work depend on the displacement and relative velocity which can be calculated using the gram charlier expansion as donley and spanos 2012 36 p x ˆ 1 1 6 μ x ˆ 3 3 x ˆ 3 1 2 π μ x ˆ 2 exp x ˆ 2 μ x ˆ 2 and 37 p x ˆ rel q 1 1 6 μ x ˆ rel q 3 3 x ˆ rel q 3 1 2 π μ x ˆ rel q 2 exp x ˆ rel q 2 μ x ˆ rel q 2 where the relative velocity distribution is calculated for each section of the spar platform the probability distributions in eqs 36 and 37 are estimated using the second and third order central moments based on the symmetry relations of the quadratic transfer functions qtfs the central moments of the displacement can be obtained as 38 μ x ˆ 2 h x ˆ 1 ω 2 s η η ω d ω 2 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 2 2 s η η ω 1 s η η ω 2 d ω 1 d ω 2 and

the wave spectrum the central moments of the relative velocity can be calculated in a similar way as 40 μ x ˆ rel q 2 h x ˆ rel q 1 ω 2 s η η ω d ω 2 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 2 2 s η η ω 1 s η η ω 2 d ω 1 d ω 2 and 41 μ x ˆ rel q 3 6 h x ˆ rel q 1 ω 1 h x ˆ rel q 1 ω 2 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 2 s η η ω 1 s η η ω 2 d ω 1 d ω 2 8 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 2 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 3 h x ˆ 2 ω 2 ω 3 s η η ω 1 s η η ω 2 s η η ω 3 d ω 1 d ω 2 d ω 3 note that the second order transfer functions in eqs 39 and 41 possess only the negative component of the structure velocity hence the triple integral in eq 41 is the same for all q sections this reduces the computational cost of estimating the hydrodynamic coefficients for each section the probability distributions for the displacement and relative velocity use central moments up to third order however fourth order terms are needed to calculate the quadratization coefficients as shown in eqs 17 and 19 assuming that the fourth order central moments can be approximated to the ones for a gaussian distribution the following relationships can be used 42 μ x ˆ 4 3 μ x ˆ 2 2 43 μ x ˆ rel q 4 3 μ x ˆ rel q 2 2 4 2 statistical quadratization procedure the sq consists of replacing the nonlinear function by equivalent polynomial coefficients where the difference between the original nonlinearity and its equivalent one is minimized in a mean square sense the determination of the equivalent linear and quadratic coefficients requires the prior knowledge of the response distribution since there is no analytic solution for such a problem an iterative procedure is applied where the locally linearized dynamics namely the fd model is used as an initial guess and the response is used in the next iteration until predetermined criteria is achieved the step by step procedure in fig 3 5 simulation as a study case this work investigates the wind turbine platform concept called oc3 hywind spar which is based on the platform designed by statoil in norway and documented in the oc3 phase iv jonkman 2010 the main properties of the simulations are described in table 1 and the mooring system is composed of three catenary with the equivalent nonlinear force presented in jonkman 2010 and illustrated in fig 4 for the undisturbed condition the natural period of the structure in surge is approximately 125 s ω n 0 05 rad s however slight deviations on the apparent natural period are expected once the platform oscillates in the nonlinear range of the mooring system due to the current and constant thrust force the incident wave field is assumed to be described by pierson moskowitz spectrum which is constructed from 100 frequency components while 200 frequencies are used for the double sided spectrum in the sq formulation note that it is essential to maintain a suitable number of frequency components to capture the effect of the sum and difference frequency components on the response the range of frequencies investigated varied from 0 to 1 5 rad s the current velocity is assumed to be positive in the direction of the wave propagation the effectiveness of the sq procedure is assessed by comparing the results with those obtained using nonlinear td simulations which were calculated using a simulink model in matlab due to the low natural period of the platform longer simulations time are necessary to characterize the spectral response and guarantee the assumption of ergodicity hence the td data is acquired over 10 000 s at a sampling frequency of 40 hz which captures around 80 cycles at the natural frequency while providing a good sampling for the high frequency range furthermore the second order response is quite sensitive to the set of random phases used in td simulations so consequently 30 simulations using different sets of random phases angle to generate the wave spectrum were used to estimate the mean td results fig 5 a shows an interval of 1 000 s of the platform displacement for a environmental condition that will be taken as a reference h s 4 0 m t p 10 5 s and u c 0 0 25 m s note that the current velocity selected is representative of the mean velocity at several locations fratantoni 2001 for the environmental condition simulated the mean position of the structure is around 15 5 m and the mooring system behaves non linearly see in fig 4 it is possible to observe low frequency components coexisting with higher frequencies coming from the first order motion depending on the sets of random phase angle the low frequency motion is either more or less pronounced the influence of the random phase can be a source of uncertainty in the numerical simulations even when simulating the same condition robertson et al 2017 the spectral response of the system using td simulations in particular the second order effects are highly dependent on the random phase used to model the incident wave elevation to illustrate the sensitivity of the random phase angle on the response spectrum of the system 30 td simulations using different sets of random phase are shown in fig 5 b and compared with the corresponding one sided spectrum using sq the spectral response in surge of nonlinear td simulations were calculated using the pwelch function in matlab while for the sq is calculated as 44 s x ˆ x ˆ ω h x ˆ 1 ω 2 s η η ω 2 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω ω 1 2 s η η ω 1 s η η ω ω 1 d ω 1 as observed in fig 5 b the second order response using td simulations varied from a negligible response to magnitudes four times higher than the sq result while no drastic variation is observed for the first order response fig 6 a shows the mean value of the 30 td simulations of the previous figure and the results using sq sl and fd the sl and fd models demonstrate their limitations compared to the sq note that the fd results represents the linearized system around its equilibrium which is used as an initial guess in the sq and sl technique this nomenclature will be used throughout the work for the sl method only the equivalent linear term is included in the minimization procedure in eq 16 as expected discrepancies occurred between the nonlinear and the linear models the spectrum from linear models fd and sl are virtually identical to the quadratization and td for the first order response the main difference occurs for the responses outside the frequency of the excitation in which only the sq and td are able to accurately estimate the response the sq result achieved an excellent agreement with the nonlinear td simulation however it is important to highlight that the computational cost of the sq is two orders of magnitude less than the td the presence of the second order response leads to a non gaussian distribution of the displacement because of the quadratic transformation applied to the gaussian process fig 6 b shows the 30 td data that represents the entire simulation with different sets of angles and the pdf estimated using sq sl and fd again the sl and fd results demonstrate their limitations in estimating the distribution as these models only represent gaussian distributions on the other hand the sq results for the probability distribution uses gram charlier expansion up to third order hence it can represent non gaussian distributions the distribution using sq recovers the results obtained from td data with an excellent agreement preserving the standard deviation and a slight skewness of the distribution a good agreement between the real distributions and the pdf are essential once the sq relies on the probability distributions to calculate the equivalent linear and quadratic coefficients in the minimization procedure it is important to mention that negative distributions at the tails can be obtained mathematically in the gram charlier expansion which is clearly physically impossible despite this the non gaussian distribution obtained from sq is a substantial improvement of the distribution over the linear case for the mean displacement the results were nearly the same for all methods even though the velocity of the platform is relatively small compared to the wave velocity it is important to consider its contribution in the relative velocity fig 7 shows the spectral velocity of the structure in surge the wave velocity and the relative velocity for the first section of the spar q 1 the colored solid line refers to the mean value of td simulations while the dotted line refers to their respective sq results an accurate representation of the velocities are required to estimate the probability distribution and their respective equivalent linear and quadratic terms for all sections the undisturbed wave velocity is calculated at the center of each spar segment the results show that even small velocities of the body result in a reduction in the relative velocity due to the phase difference between the components the effect of the body velocity on the relative velocity was also observed for the other sections at the bottom of the structure the body velocity is higher than the wave velocity however the inclusion of the relative velocity is important over the entire length of the spar the second order velocity became negligible because the displacement occurs at a very low frequency and has a narrow band width a possible simplification for this specific case is the assumption of a gaussian distribution of the velocity and relative velocity and in doing so this would to speed up the calculation of the equivalent hydrodynamic terms however this approximation would be erroneous for other systems such as tlps the probability of the displacement and relative velocity are used to calculate the equivalent linear and quadratic coefficients for the mooring and hydrodynamic forces depending on the magnitude and asymmetry of the nonlinearity the equivalent coefficients can be more or less pronounced fig 8 shows the psd of the quadratic forces from the mooring hydrodynamic and total it is possible to observe that for this condition the quadratic stiffness term slightly reduces the total second order force f 2 for low frequency forces and increases for high frequencies for the condition simulated the hydrodynamic quadratic term is dominant and the mooring system behaves almost linearly however the equivalent quadratic term of the mooring may increase its contribution once the device starts to have larger oscillations for a single dof system the first and second order force spectrum can be calculated as 45 s f ˆ f ˆ ω h f ˆ 1 ω 2 s η η ω 2 h f ˆ 2 ω 1 ω ω 1 2 s η η ω 1 s η η ω ω 1 d ω 1 where the first term on the rhs is associated with the linear force while the second is associated with the quadratic force the second order force can also be used to calculate the spectral response of the displacement as 46 s x ˆ x ˆ ω h ω 2 s f ˆ f ˆ ω even though the quadratic force contribution is several orders of magnitudes lower than the linear one its contribution produces surge motions of the same order of magnitude due to the dynamic amplification at resonance therefore for this system only the low frequency peak occurs due to the quadratic force and the higher frequency components of the quadratic force do not affect the response in surge however as mentioned previously the sum frequency can excite the natural frequency of tlps and cause the vibrations of tower jonkman et al 2009 for the reference environmental condition the magnitude of the platform surge motion is small hence the contribution of the quadratic force from the mooring is almost negligible however once the aerodynamics of the wind turbine and the wind speed fluctuations are considered the quadratic force of the mooring might become important to show its importance for higher displacements a severe sea state given in jonkman 2010 is analyzed fig 9 a shows the spectral response in surge for a sea state with h s 15 4 m t p 17 0 s and u c 0 0 5 m s and fig 9 b shows its respective second order forces mooring hydrodynamic and total the gray lines are the 30 td simulations with different sets of random phases which reinforces the sensitivity of the second order motion due to the random phases as shown previously in fig 5 b even though the second order motion for higher period is small compared to the first order one it is possible to identify the contribution coming from the mooring system as illustrated in fig 9 b the presence of the mooring system causes a reduction in the magnitude of the total quadratic forces for low frequencies while it increases for higher frequencies as mentioned previously instead of higher motions generated by severe sea states the aerodynamic loads and wind speed fluctuations could be the driven mechanism that leads to large displacements of the platform hence the significance of mooring quadratic forces from the catenary system might be important when considering the dynamics of the entire system 6 sensitivity study of the environmental condition even though the system is described by a single dof the nonlinear forces are quite complex and understanding the behavior of the platform can be a difficult task first the hydrodynamic force is discretized in several sections where the nonlinearity depends on the relative velocity and the current velocity the current and wave velocity decrease with depth and the skewness of the distribution to calculate the equivalent quadratic coefficients changes with each section the mooring line can produce an equivalent second order force which reduces the magnitude of the total quadratic force the second order effect depends on the asymmetry magnitude and frequency distribution of the forces as it generates forces in the sum and difference of the frequencies i e higher and lower frequency forces due to the aforementioned complexity parametric investigations were conducted to provide an insight of the second order response and its sensitivity to the environmental conditions the parametric investigation was performed based on the reference environmental condition in which the significant wave height wave period and mean current velocity were varied systematically the range of the environmental conditions simulated is shown in table 2 in this section only sq results were shown however comparisons with td simulations were performed for some environmental conditions and excellent agreement between td and sq were observed over all conditions in terms of psd and probability distribution for the first parameter the wave height was varied from 1 to 7 m which have high probabilities of occurrence and is based on the sea states in babarit et al 2011 and the wave period and current speed were fixed t p 10 5 s u c 0 0 25 m s fig 10 a shows the spectral response and b its respective pdf of the stationary and zero mean random displacement for several wave heights as expected the results show an increase of the second order response with increasing wave height note that the second order response did not increase linearly nor quadratically because the magnitude of the quadratic coefficient depends on the magnitude of the response and nonlinearity and the asymmetry of the nonlinearity the skewness remained nearly constant over the entire distribution the quadratic mooring force at higher displacements reduced the magnitude of the total quadratic force while at lower displacements remained unimportant for the next parametric investigation the wave period was varied from 7 to 14 s which have high probabilities of occurrence and is based on the sea states in babarit et al 2011 and the wave height and current speed were fixed h s 4 0 m u c 0 0 25 m s fig 11 a shows the spectral response in surge and b shows its respective pdf of the stationary and zero mean random displacement for several wave periods for the conditions simulated the second order response remained nearly constant over the wave periods a possible reason is that at short wave periods the relative velocity is mainly due to the wave velocity due to the low motion of the platform in contrast longer period waves excite the structure as it is closer to the natural frequency and thus the body velocity increases its contribution in the relative velocity over the entire spar length also the nonlinear hydrodynamic force is important when the wave period is short which leads to higher velocities of the fluid however for short period waves the wave velocity decays quickly with the depth on the other hand longer wave periods have a lower velocity which decays more slowly with the depth due to the ratio of the second and first order response the skewness of the distribution was higher at lower periods due to their smaller first order response finally the current velocity at the sea level was varied from 0 1 to 0 9 m s and the wave height and wave period were fixed h s 4 0 m t p 10 5 s fig 12 a shows the spectral response in surge and b shows its respective pdf of the stationary and zero mean random displacement for several current velocities the influence of the quadratic hydrodynamic term is reduced for higher current velocity this can be caused due to the reduction of asymmetry in the hydrodynamic force at higher current velocities for this platform and wave condition the maximum second order response occurred around the reference case it is important to notice that the magnitude of the current velocity used here is similar to the mean velocity at several locations fratantoni 2001 hence second order motions due to the wave and current interaction might occur continuously during operational conditions note that for different environmental conditions the maximum second order response might occur at different current velocities for the extreme values of the current simulated the sq results approximated to the linear solution sl and fd for null current velocity the sq is not capable of capturing the second order effect due to symmetry and the solution reduces to the sl this parametric study investigated the current in the same direction as the wind thrust force however note the results are not symmetric in respect to the current velocity in case of adverse currents for several reasons the wavenumber and the transfer function that relates the wave spectrum and the wave velocity are not symmetrical in addition if the wind and current are in opposite direction the mean displacement of the platform will be different and the nonlinear mooring force will lead to different linear and quadratic forces this can also lead to a higher mean pitch angle which was not investigated in this work 7 discussion as illustrated in previous sections the sq is capable of estimating the second order response of the system in terms of spectral response and its probability distribution the second order effects were caused by the nonlinearities in the system that generates forces at the sum and difference frequencies besides the excellent agreement with td simulations a clear advantage of the sq over td simulations is the low computational cost table 3 shows the mean simulation clock time for the reference environmental condition using fd sl sq and td the simulations were performed using a standard desktop pc with intel core i7 processor 2 4 ghz and 16 gb ram for the environmental conditions and simulations parameters investigated the sq converged rapidly and required between 4 7 iterations to achieve a relative error of 0 1 with the equivalent coefficients of previous iteration step the sl procedure required only a single iteration due to its almost linear behavior of the first order response hence fd and sl had a comparable time even though the td simulations required around 33 s they are sensitive to the random phase angle used and several sets of angles simulations are necessary to have a proper estimation of the response therefore it may be concluded that the sq is two orders of magnitude faster than td simulations which was also observed in donley and spanos 2012 note that the number of frequency components directly affects the simulation clock time especially to calculate the third order moments triple integrals a good discretization of the spectrum is important to estimate the difference and sum frequencies accurately this work used the extended morison s equation to describe the hydrodynamic forces acting on the structure which can include the effects of the current and wave interaction wave number and velocity given in eqs 3 and 4 respectively however the linear hydrodynamics could be obtained using boundary element method bem software such as wamit lee 1995 nemoh babarit 2014 or aqwa ansys 2013 the bem generates frequency dependent terms which increases the computational cost in td simulations since it involves the application of cummins equation cummins 1962 convolution integral or its approximation using prony s method prony 1795 or state space representation yu and falnes 1995 while the other methods fd sl and sq have similar computational time if the hydrodynamic loads are implemented based on cummings equation the viscous drag nonlinear term based on morison s equation can be incorporated as described in this work regarding the capabilities of the sq method the quadratic term is able to capture only non symmetric nonlinearities the significance of the quadratic forces is dependent on the frequency distribution of the first order response and the degree of non symmetry of the nonlinearity it is important to note that if the system is externally excited leading to a nonzero mean position even a symmetric nonlinearity around a particular reference point becomes non symmetric for example the symmetry in the nonlinear force of the mooring system becomes non symmetric once the structure has a mean non zero displacement and its effect can be captured with the quadratic term similarly the viscous drag in the morison s equation is symmetric only for the case of null current velocity the quadratic term in the sq is zero for symmetric nonlinearities and the sq reduces to the sl for the condition without current and zero mean force the second order effect can be captured using statistical cubicization technique tognarelli et al 1997a b however the second order motion contribution due to the viscous drag without current had a lower magnitude compared to the conditions simulated nonlinearities can play an important role and must be accounted for in the dynamics of the system as it can generate forces outside the range of the wave spectrum even though the magnitude of the quadratic forces are relatively small compared to the linear ones the response associated is amplified once it excites the structure natural frequency for most offshore structures the natural frequency is set to be outside the excitation range of frequencies therefore only quadratic or higher order approximations are able to estimate the response properly note that the frequency of resonance peak may also exhibit a small shift due to the changes of equivalent linear stiffness from the catenary mooring the method of sq was applied only to the surge motion of the platform however it can be extended do multiple degrees of freedom and other sources of nonlinearities by making the appropriate modifications donley and spanos 2012 8 conclusion this work successfully estimated the nonlinear stationary response of the oc3 wind turbine spar platform under current and wave interaction using sq wherein the sources of nonlinearities come from the mooring line and hydrodynamic forces viscous term the method can be interpreted as an extension of sl in which the nonlinear system is described by an equivalent polynomial of quadratic order the equivalent polynomial coefficients are estimated iteratively using expectations of the original nonlinear system using gram charlier expansions up to third order and the polynomial representation allows the representation by means of the volterra series method fd and sl results are also compared to demonstrate their limitations note that the same procedure can be extended to the analysis of different fowts and offshore platforms in general in addition the sq method can be used to investigate other sources of nonlinearities for the proposed environmental conditions and parameters of the structure the sq obtained an excellent agreement with td simulations in terms of spectral response and its equivalent probability distribution preserving the standard deviation and skewness of the distribution on the other hand fd and sl were not able to estimate the second order motion that occurs due to excitation outside the excitation frequency range and are limited to gaussian distributions the contribution of the quadratic terms showed to be dependent on the frequency distribution and the non symmetry of the nonlinear terms for the cases of symmetric nonlinearity the sq reduces to the sl e g hydrodynamic forces without current and mooring force without mean displacement the second order force from the hydrodynamic nonlinearity was dominant in the second order response while the mooring line reduced the magnitude of the total quadratic force for low frequencies and increased for higher frequencies the response of the second order motion exhibited the same order of magnitude as for the first order motion due to the amplification at the natural frequency from the parametric study the second order response was found to be important over several environmental conditions the main advantage of sq is the low computational cost which is around two orders of magnitude faster than td simulations while producing accurate estimates of the response therefore sq can be a useful tool delivering rapid and reliable estimation of complex nonlinear platform response credit authorship contribution statement l s p silva conceptualization

20374,this paper applies the method of statistical quadratization to investigate the first and second order responses of a floating offshore wind turbine platform due to forces from a catenary mooring system and wave current coupled interaction the hydrodynamics are based on the generalized morison s equation while the catenary mooring system is based on a quasi static approach the method of statistical quadratization replaces the nonlinearities using equivalent linear and quadratic terms by minimizing the difference between the nonlinear model and the approximated model in a mean square sense in this regard an iterative scheme is applied in which the equivalent polynomial coefficients are calculated based on the non gaussian distribution generated by means of gram charlier expansions the dynamics are solved using the volterra theory and described in terms of transfer functions which can be directly integrated into the central moments of the distribution the results demonstrate an excellent agreement with nonlinear time domain simulations in terms of spectral response and probability distribution sensitivity studies are performed to show the contribution of the second order motion over several environmental conditions despite the excellent accuracy the main advantage of the statistical quadratization is the low computational cost which is approximately two orders of

and environmentally friendly characteristics leung and yang 2012 jonkman et al 2009 furthermore offshore wind offers a number of advantages over onshore wind at offshore locations the wind resources are more consistent stronger and less turbulent than onshore manwell et al 2010 owts are not restricted in size by road or rail constraints and the increase in size of wind turbines can lead to economic and power capture benefits also owts have less visual impact annoyance from noise and do not occupy valuable land karimirad 2014 pao and johnson 2011 presently fixed offshore wind turbines are in a mature stage of development with many farms installed across the globe however fixed owts are limited to shallow to transitional waters usually up to 60 m due to the rapid increase in the cost with the water depth as most of the offshore wind potential is located in deep waters the wind industry is moving towards floating structures despite clear advantages of harvesting wind in deep water locations the complexity in the design of floating offshore wind turbines fowts is significant compared to fixed structures butterfield et al 2007 pao and johnson 2011 jonkman 2007 2009 in addition the dynamics of fowts are highly nonlinear and the correct prediction of the loads and motions are required to reduce the levelized cost of energy lcoe and avoid the fatigue of the components and failure of the system roddier et al 2010 in most offshore platforms high levels of vibration are generally undesirable in order to extend the life of the system hence offshore structures are often designed to have natural frequencies outside the excitation spectrum range sea spectrum unlike wave energy converters that generally operate in resonance silva et al 2020 offshore platforms are likely to be subjected to severe environmental loads such as wind wave current earthquake and ice loading van der tempel et al 2011 an initial procedure during the design of offshore wind turbines is to translate environmental loads especially from wind and wave to design loads and analyze the vibration response of the structure van der tempel et al 2011 however avoiding excitation at natural frequencies is a nontrivial task most of the environmental loads have a random character with energy content spread over a broad range of frequencies a major complication occurs for nonlinear dynamic systems it is well known that nonlinearities cause vibrations outside the excitation frequency range which may lead to a significant vibration response as a result the nonlinear dynamics must be accounted for when designing offshore wind systems robertson et al 2013 the dynamics of fowts are characterized by nonlinear forces random excitation and a relatively small hydrodynamic damping in some degrees of freedom these characteristics can lead the structure to vibrate outside the excitation frequency range as a result second order loads are important to consider when analyzing different floating concepts such as spars semi submersibles and tension leg platforms tlp as shown in robertson et al 2013 second order forces generate low frequency loads given by the difference between the frequency components as well as high frequency loads given by the sum of the frequency components in general each floating concept has its own dynamic properties and different sources of second order loads might be significant depending on the system especially when the force matches the structure s natural frequencies typically low frequency components are especially important for surge pitch and yaw motions of catenary moored structures such as spars and semi submersibles due to their large inertia and low stiffness while the sum frequency forces may also excite the tower bending modes duarte et al 2014 jonkman et al 2009 for vertically moored platforms such as tlps the structures tend to have a natural frequency in the vertical plane higher than the dominant wave frequency hence sum frequencies can excite the natural frequency in pitch and heave donley and spanos 2012 robertson et al 2013 considering the case of wind turbines mounted on semi submersible platforms the second order motions can be of the same order of magnitude as first order ones robertson et al 2013 resulting in large horizontal excursions at lower frequencies among the nonlinear forces that might result in relevant second order loads the current wave interaction applied to fowt remains insufficiently investigated the current wave interaction can have a significant influence on the responses of fowts during operational and severe sea states which can lead to the fatigue of its components e g mooring system and tower qu et al 2020 chen and basu 2019 2018 sarkar et al 2020 in addition the presence of current velocity and wind loads changes the operation point of the mooring system which can lead to a nonlinear restoring force and consequently slightly alter the apparent natural frequency note that currents can also lead to flow induced motions of the platform chen et al 2018 carlson and modarres sadeghi 2018 gonçalves et al 2020 in this general context methods of predicting the vibration response are extremely important one of the most useful versatile and efficient analytical methods to estimate the response of nonlinear systems under stochastic loads spanos 1981 is statistical linearization sl kazakov 1954 booton 1953 1954 caughey 1963 the method allows researchers to obtain an approximated response of the system when exact solutions are unavailable in contrast to the perturbation technique the sl does not require the assumption of smallness of the parameters and unlike monte carlo simulations sl does not demand extensive computational cost roberts and spanos 2003 however even though sl usually provides a reasonable estimate of the mean and mean square response the results using sl only span the range of the primary excitation spectrum moreover the equivalent linear solution leads to a gaussian distribution whilst in practice the response may be characterized by a non gaussian one therefore linear models might lose the salient features of the actual dynamics for a survey on the sl method the reader is encouraged to consult the roberts and spanos 2003 socha 2008 2005a b to circumvent the limitations of the sl method the nonlinear function may be replaced by an equivalent nonlinear one in a polynomial form via the statistical nonlinearization method donley and spanos 2012 spanos and donley 1991 tognarelli et al 1997a b the method can be seen as an extension of the sl with high order volterra series to approximate the response of the nonlinear system donley and spanos 2012 based on a stochastic analysis the polynomial coefficients of the expansion can be found by minimizing the difference between the nonlinear and the equivalent polynomial function in a mean square sense which requires the knowledge of the probability distribution for fixed structures obtaining the probability distribution is straight forward however if the structure is allowed to move as in the case of floating structures the probability distribution of the variables must be found iteratively since the statistics are not known a priori in this regard the volterra series approach can be described in terms of transfer functions and be directly integrated into the process to yield the psd and cumulants or central moments of the non gaussian response bedrosian and rice 1971 the probability density function pdf can be constructed from the central moments via direct integration in frequency domain fd and the probability distribution estimated using gram charlier expansion donley and spanos 2012 therefore the application of statistical nonlinearization can be an effective tool to estimate and understand the high order responses of fowts in general polynomials up to second or third order are sufficient to represent the nonlinear behavior which is also known as statistical quadratization sq donley and spanos 2012 and statistical cubicization method respectively tognarelli et al 1997a the following work investigates the second order effect caused by the current wave interaction and catenary mooring system using sq and applies the methodology to the oc3 hywind spar wind turbine jonkman 2010 illustrated in fig 1 the paper is structured as follows first the modeling of the current and waves interaction is described then the nonlinear dynamics of the wind turbine platform and its equivalent linear and quadratic terms are derived the sq method is performed and compared against nonlinear time domain td simulations and with sl and fd models to demonstrate the capability and limitations of each model parametric studies are performed to demonstrate the sensitivity of the environmental conditions on the second order response finally a discussion of some important aspects of the method such as computational cost limitations and importance of the loads are highlighted and the conclusion section summarizes the main results 2 ocean currents ocean currents are the continuous movement of ocean water that are generated by a number of driving forces large currents are created mainly by the effects of earth s rotation coriolis effect gravity wind stress temperature and salinity differences density gradients while meso scale currents are also driven by tides river discharges and pressure gradients haas et al 2013 typical ocean current speeds have a mean velocity of around 0 2 to 0 6 m s and a maximum speed around 1 1 to 2 7 m s depending on the location fratantoni 2001 like wind speed current velocity varies in time and space however the timescale and length of the variations are much larger than the wind therefore ocean currents may be represented by a constant velocity in time and as a function of the vertical coordinate z van der tempel et al 2011 the representation of the ocean current profile u c used in this paper follows the power law profile like the wind shear profile where the input parameter is the current velocity at the water surface u c 0 u c 0 considering the coordinate reference described in fig 2 the current velocity can be expressed as vugts 2013 1 u c z u c 0 z h h 1 7 with h z 0 where h denotes the water depth as ocean currents might be driven from different sources such as wind tidal forces or density differences ismail 1984 alternative equations can be used to improve the representativeness of the specific current profile 3 ocean waves within the context of the linear theory ocean waves can be described using the well known airy wave theory newman 2018 the linear representation allows the superposition of elementary results wave elevations and velocities which are essential for the representation of real sea states in a spectral representation hence the wave surface elevation can be written as a sum of n ω frequency components 2 ζ t j 1 n ω re η a j e i ω j t ϕ j where η a j is the complex amplitude of the wave elevation that depends on the wave frequency ω j and ϕ j is a random phase angle which is assumed to be evenly distributed from 0 to 2 π once the current velocity is present the traditional linear wave theory expressions are modified to consider the wave current interaction on the wave particle velocity wavenumber wavelength etc huang et al 1972 the interaction between wave particle velocities and current can be solved analytically for uniform and linear current profile in this regard eq 1 is linearized around the mean submerged length which has shown excellent agreement for the conditions proposed platform and water depth therefore the wave particle velocity in the horizontal direction considering the linearized profile can be calculated as silva et al 2016 3 u z t j 1 n ω re η a j ω j k j u c 0 cosh k j h z sinh k j h e i ω j t ϕ j j 1 n ω re η a j h u j e i ω j t ϕ j where h u is the transfer function between the wave velocity and the wave surface elevation at a specified vertical position and k is the wavenumber the wavenumber is obtained based on the linear dispersion relation which considers the current interaction and can be written as silva et al 2016 4 ω j k j u c 0 2 g k j ω j k j u c 0 d u c d z tanh k j h where g denotes the gravitational acceleration note that once the ocean waves interact with the current velocity the wavelength increases and the wave elevation reduces when waves and current propagate in the same direction and the wavelength reduces and the wave elevation increases when the current propagate in the opposite direction 4 dynamic model of the platform using statistical quadratization for the proposed formulation the fowt platform moored using a catenary configuration illustrated in fig 2 is considered the coordinate reference system is located at the sea waterline and coincides with the platform location for the undisturbed conditions the following analysis concerns the effect of the mooring wave and current interaction hence the mooring system force is described by a nonlinear function of the platform displacement the hydrodynamic force is represented as a nonlinear function which depends on the platform velocity and wave and current interaction and the wind turbine thrust force is simply expressed as a constant force note that a first order approximation for the wind turbine aerodynamics using sl can be included as shown in da silva et al 2021 in this work only the surge direction is analyzed due to the possible large excursions of the platform on the horizontal plane and more pronounced effect of the nonlinear mooring and wave current interaction based on these considerations the response of the platform in the surge direction can be modeled as 5 m x f t f c x f h x x u u u c where m denotes the mass of the entire fowt including ballast x denotes the surge displacement and denote the first and second time derivative f t f c and f h refer to the thrust mooring and hydrodynamic forces respectively the mooring force is expressed as the sum of a linear and nonlinear component 6 f c k 0 x f c nl x where k 0 is the linear stiffness around the undisturbed position and f c nl is the nonlinear component of the mooring force due to the catenary configuration the hydrodynamic force is described as 7 f h f h l x u f h nl x u u c b x where the first two terms in the rhs are the linear inertial force and nonlinear viscous drag terms in the morison s equation and an additional damping b is included as recommended by statoil for the hydrodynamics of the oc3 hywind spar to match with the free decay responses jonkman 2010 the linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic forces based on morison s equation morison et al 1950 are discretized into n s segments along the submerged length due to the differences on the horizontal components of the wave particle velocities and current these forces can be written as 8 f h l q 1 n s d f h l q x u q d l q f h nl q 1 n s d f h nl q x u q u c q d l q with the forces per unit of length given as 9 d f h l q x u q 1 c a ρ π d q 2 4 u q c a ρ π d q 2 4 x 10 d f h nl q x u q u c q 1 2 c d ρ d q u c q u q x u c q u q x where d l is the length of each segment the subscript q refers to the property at the q th section d is the diameter of the spar structure ρ is the water density c d and c a denotes the drag and added mass coefficients respectively the discretized force is integrated over the entire length of the spar l note that the wave velocity is considered at the cylinder s center line assuming that the structure does not affect the wave velocity field considering the mass of the structure equal to the mass of the displaced volume and considering the added mass and drag coefficients the same for the entire spar eq 5 can be manipulated and rewritten as 11 c m m x b x k 0 x c m q 1 n s ρ v q u q f h nl f c nl where c m is the inertia coefficient c m 1 c a and v q is the volume of each section v q d l q π d q 2 4 the aerodynamic thrust force and the current incidence lead to a mean displacement also the viscous drag becomes non symmetric with respect to x which results in a mean force hence the stationary response can be written as 12 x t μ x x ˆ t where 13 μ x f t f c nl f h nl k 0 where denotes the mathematical expectation μ x is the mean displacement and denotes a stationary and zero mean process which is non gaussian the mean response can be subtracted from the governing equation eq 11 and the nonlinear terms can be approximated by an equivalent quadratic system of the form 14 f c nl f h nl k lin x ˆ k quad x ˆ 2 x ˆ 2 q 1 n s b lin q x ˆ rel q q 1 n s b quad q x ˆ rel q 2 x ˆ rel q 2 where k lin and k quad are the linear and quadratic stiffness terms x ˆ rel denotes the relative velocity between the fluid and the structure x ˆ rel u x ˆ the equivalent linear and quadratic hydrodynamic terms of each section are represented by b lin q and b quad q the linear and quadratic coefficients are calculated by minimizing the mean square difference between the original nonlinearity and its equivalent linear and nonlinear one in a polynomial form as 15 min ε 2 where 16 ε f t f c nl μ x x ˆ f h nl k 0 μ x k lin x ˆ k quad x ˆ 2 x ˆ 2 q 1 n s b lin q x ˆ rel q q 1 n s b quad q x ˆ rel q 2 x ˆ rel q 2 assuming the correlation between the displacement and relative velocity over the entire length as negligible the minimization can be split into two components one for the terms dependent on the displacement and one for the relative velocity this assumption is considered valid when the damping of the system is relatively small and the linear force contribution which is dominant is a function of the wave acceleration based on the assumptions above and defining x ˆ t x ˆ x ˆ 2 x ˆ 2 the resulting equivalent polynomial coefficients for the stiffness can be calculated as 17 x ˆ x ˆ t k f c nl x ˆ where 18 x ˆ x ˆ t μ x ˆ 2 μ x ˆ 3 μ x ˆ 3 μ x ˆ 4 μ x ˆ 2 2 k k lin k quad f c nl x ˆ q f c nl x ˆ f c nl x ˆ 2 f c nl μ x ˆ 2 where the superscript t denotes the matrix transpose note that the expectation of the nonlinear mooring force f c nl occurs around the mean position using the same process for the stiffness coefficients by defining x ˆ rel q t x ˆ rel q x ˆ rel q 2 x ˆ rel q 2 the minimization to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients can be obtained as 19 x ˆ rel q x ˆ rel q t b q d f h nl q l q x ˆ rel q where 20 x ˆ rel q x ˆ rel q t μ x ˆ rel q 2 μ x ˆ rel q 3 μ x ˆ rel q 3 μ x ˆ rel q 4 μ x

the hydrodynamic coefficients are minimized for each section and they can be described as a damping and excitation force terms da silva et al 2020 therefore eq 11 can be rewritten based on the nonlinear equivalent quadratic system as 21 c m m x ˆ b eq x ˆ k eq x ˆ f eq k quad x ˆ 2 x ˆ 2 q 1 n l b quad q x ˆ rel q 2 x ˆ rel q 2 with 22 k eq k 0 k lin b eq b q 1 n s b lin q f eq q 1 n s c m ρ v q u ˆ q b lin q u ˆ q where the subscript eq refers to the equivalent linear terms which accounts for the linear terms and statistically linearized terms note that the equivalent linear force is frequency dependent due to the wave velocity and acceleration following the derivations in donley and spanos 2012 the solution of eq 21 can be represented as an infinite volterra series as 23 x ˆ t p 1 λ p x ˆ p t where terms up to p 2 must be accounted for in the sq and λ is a scalar coefficient equal to one that is introduced for bookkeeping reasons substituting eq 23 into 21 and equating terms with same power of λ the response can be expressed by two linear systems as 24 c m m x ˆ 1 b eq x ˆ 1 k eq x ˆ 1 f eq 1 25 c m m x ˆ 2 b eq x ˆ 2 k eq x ˆ 2 k quad x ˆ 1 2 x ˆ 1 2 q 1 n s b quad q x ˆ rel q 1 2 x ˆ rel q 1 2 note that the same differential operator is used for both linear systems also the two equations are intertwined since eq 25 depends on the response in eq 24 and the equivalent linear and quadratic terms depend on the response of both equations the response of the system can be written as 26 c m m x ˆ b eq x ˆ k eq x ˆ f ˆ f ˆ 0 f ˆ 1 f ˆ 2 the rhs of eq 26 can be described as a volterra series with the linear wave elevation η as the input 27 f t f ˆ 0 h f 1 τ 1 η t τ 1 d τ 1 h f 2 τ 1 τ 2 η t τ 1 η t τ 2 d τ 1 d τ 2 where h f 1 τ 1 and h f 2 τ 1 τ 2 are the linear and quadratic volterra kernels for force and their corresponding transfer function can be described by h f ˆ 1 and h f ˆ 2 respectively as 28 h f ˆ 1 ω f eq ω and 29 h f ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 2 k quad h x ˆ 1 ω 1 h x ˆ 1 ω 2 q 1 n s b quad q h x rel q 1 ω 1 h x rel q 1 ω 2 where the transfer function of the relative velocity can be obtained for each section as 30 h x ˆ rel q 1 ω h u ˆ q h x ˆ 1 ω and the spar velocity is obtained through the displacement transfer function as 31 h x ˆ 1 ω i ω h x ˆ 1 ω the operator in eq 26 is linear hence the response can be described in a similar form as 32 x ˆ t x ˆ 0 x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 x ˆ 0 h x ˆ 1 τ 1 η t τ 1 d τ 1 h x ˆ 2 τ 1 τ 2 η t τ 1 η t τ 2 d τ 1 d τ 2 where the linear and quadratic volterra kernels for displacement h x ˆ 1 τ 1 and h x ˆ 2 τ 1 τ 2 can be described respectively using transfer functions as 33 h x ˆ 1 ω h ω h f ˆ 1 ω and 34 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 2 h ω 1 ω 2 h f ˆ 2 ω where 35 h ω ω 2 c m m i ω b eq k eq 1 note that according to the formulation provided the zero order response x ˆ 0 in eq 32 is the expected value of x ˆ 2 with negative sign hence x ˆ t 0 4 1 probability distribution and central moments although the excitation force is gaussian the response probability deviates from the gaussian one for the proposed formulation this occurs because the quadratic response is a quadratic transformation of the gaussian process the exact response distribution is unknown however since part of the distribution is already gaussian it is possible to approximate the distribution by using a gram charlier expansion of the gaussian distribution johnson and kotz 1972 the nonlinearities described in this work depend on the displacement and relative velocity which can be calculated using the gram charlier expansion as donley and spanos 2012 36 p x ˆ 1 1 6 μ x ˆ 3 3 x ˆ 3 1 2 π μ x ˆ 2 exp x ˆ 2 μ x ˆ 2 and 37 p x ˆ rel q 1 1 6 μ x ˆ rel q 3 3 x ˆ rel q 3 1 2 π μ x ˆ rel q 2 exp x ˆ rel q 2 μ x ˆ rel q 2 where the relative velocity distribution is calculated for each section of the spar platform the probability distributions in eqs 36 and 37 are estimated using the second and third order central moments based on the symmetry relations of the quadratic transfer functions qtfs the central moments of the displacement can be obtained as 38 μ x ˆ 2 h x ˆ 1 ω 2 s η η ω d ω 2 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 2 2 s η η ω 1 s η η ω 2 d ω 1 d ω 2 and 39 μ x ˆ 3 6 h x ˆ 1 ω 1 h x ˆ 1 ω 2 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 2 s η η ω 1 s η η ω 2 d ω 1 d ω 2 8 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 2 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 3 h x ˆ 2 ω 2 ω 3 s η η ω 1 s η η ω 2 s η η ω 3 d ω 1 d ω 2 d ω 3 where s η η ω is the wave spectrum the central moments of the relative velocity can be calculated in a similar way as 40 μ x ˆ rel q 2 h x ˆ rel q 1 ω 2 s η η ω d ω 2 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 2 2 s η η ω 1 s η η ω 2 d ω 1 d ω 2 and 41 μ x ˆ rel q 3 6 h x ˆ rel q 1 ω 1 h x ˆ rel q 1 ω 2 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 2 s η η ω 1 s η η ω 2 d ω 1 d ω 2 8 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 2 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω 3 h x ˆ 2 ω 2 ω 3 s η η ω 1 s η η ω 2 s η η ω 3 d ω 1 d ω 2 d ω 3 note that the second order transfer functions in eqs 39 and 41 possess only the negative component of the structure velocity hence the triple integral in eq 41 is the same for all q sections this reduces the computational cost of estimating the hydrodynamic coefficients for each section the probability distributions for the displacement and relative velocity use central moments up to third order however fourth order terms are needed to calculate the quadratization coefficients as shown in eqs 17 and 19 assuming that the fourth order central moments can be approximated to the ones for a gaussian distribution the following relationships can be used 42 μ x ˆ 4 3 μ x ˆ 2 2 43 μ x ˆ rel q 4 3 μ x ˆ rel q 2 2 4 2 statistical quadratization procedure the sq consists of replacing the nonlinear function by equivalent polynomial coefficients where the difference between the original nonlinearity and its equivalent one is minimized in a mean square sense the determination of the equivalent linear and quadratic coefficients requires the prior knowledge of the response distribution since there is no analytic solution for such a problem an iterative procedure is applied where the locally linearized dynamics namely the fd model is used as an initial guess and the response is used in the next iteration until predetermined criteria is achieved the step by step procedure in fig 3 5 simulation as a study case this work investigates the wind turbine platform concept called oc3 hywind spar which is based on the platform designed by statoil in norway and documented in the oc3 phase iv jonkman 2010 the main properties of the simulations are described in table 1 and the mooring system is composed of three catenary with the equivalent nonlinear force presented in jonkman 2010 and illustrated in fig 4 for the undisturbed condition the natural period of the structure in surge is approximately 125 s ω n 0 05 rad s however slight deviations on the apparent natural period are expected once the platform oscillates in the nonlinear range of the mooring system due to the current and constant thrust force the incident wave field is assumed to be described by pierson moskowitz spectrum which is constructed from 100 frequency components while 200 frequencies are used for the double sided spectrum in the sq formulation note that it is essential to maintain a suitable number of frequency components to capture the effect of the sum and difference frequency components on the response the range of frequencies investigated varied from 0 to 1 5 rad s the current velocity is assumed to be positive in the direction of the wave propagation the effectiveness of the sq procedure is assessed by comparing the results with those obtained using nonlinear td simulations which were calculated using a simulink model in matlab due to the low natural period of the platform longer simulations time are necessary to characterize the spectral response and guarantee the assumption of ergodicity hence the td data is acquired over 10 000 s at a sampling frequency of 40 hz which captures around 80 cycles at the natural frequency while providing a good sampling for the high frequency range furthermore the second order response is quite sensitive to the set of random phases used in td simulations so consequently 30 simulations using different sets of random phases angle to generate the wave spectrum were used to estimate the mean td results fig 5 a shows an interval of 1 000 s of the platform displacement for a environmental condition that will be taken as a reference h s 4 0 m t p 10 5 s and u c 0 0 25 m s note that the current velocity selected is representative of the mean velocity at several locations fratantoni 2001 for the environmental condition simulated the mean position of the structure is around 15 5 m and the mooring system behaves non linearly see in fig 4 it is possible to observe low frequency components coexisting with higher frequencies coming from the first order motion depending on the sets of random phase angle the low frequency motion is either more or less pronounced the influence of the random phase can be a source of uncertainty in the numerical simulations even when simulating the same condition robertson et al 2017 the spectral response of the system using td simulations in particular the second order effects are highly dependent on the random phase used to model the incident wave elevation to illustrate the sensitivity of the random phase angle on the response spectrum of the system 30 td simulations using different sets of random phase are shown in fig 5 b and compared with the corresponding one sided spectrum using sq the spectral response in surge of nonlinear td simulations were calculated using the pwelch function in matlab while for the sq is calculated as 44 s x ˆ x ˆ ω h x ˆ 1 ω 2 s η η ω 2 h x ˆ 2 ω 1 ω ω 1 2 s η η ω 1 s η η ω ω 1 d ω 1 as observed in fig 5 b the second order response using td simulations varied from a negligible response to magnitudes four times higher than the sq result while no drastic variation is observed for the first order response fig 6 a shows the mean value of the 30 td simulations of the previous figure and the results using sq sl and fd the sl and fd models demonstrate their limitations compared to the sq note that the fd results represents the linearized system around its equilibrium which is used as an initial guess in the sq and sl technique this nomenclature will be used throughout the work for the sl method only the equivalent linear term is included in the minimization procedure in eq 16 as expected discrepancies occurred between the nonlinear and the linear models the spectrum from linear models fd and sl are virtually identical to the quadratization and td for the first order response the main difference occurs for the responses outside the frequency of the excitation in which only the sq and td are able to accurately estimate the response the sq result achieved an excellent agreement with the nonlinear td simulation however it is important to highlight that the computational cost of the sq is two orders of magnitude less than the td the presence of the second order response leads to a non gaussian distribution of the displacement because of the quadratic transformation applied to the gaussian process fig 6 b shows the 30 td data that represents the entire simulation with different sets of angles and the pdf estimated using sq sl and fd again the sl and fd results demonstrate their limitations in estimating the distribution as these models only represent gaussian distributions on the other hand the sq results for the probability distribution uses gram charlier expansion up to third order hence it can represent non gaussian distributions the distribution using sq recovers the results obtained from td data with an excellent agreement preserving the standard deviation and a slight skewness of the distribution a good agreement between the real distributions and the pdf are essential once the sq relies on the probability distributions to calculate the equivalent linear and quadratic coefficients in the minimization procedure it is important to mention that negative distributions at the tails can be obtained mathematically in the gram charlier expansion which is clearly physically impossible despite this the non gaussian distribution obtained from sq is a substantial improvement of the distribution over the linear case for the mean displacement the results were nearly the same for all methods even though the velocity of the platform is relatively small compared to the wave velocity it is important to consider its contribution in the relative velocity fig 7 shows the spectral velocity of the structure in surge the wave velocity and the relative velocity for the first section of the spar q 1 the colored solid line refers to the mean value of td simulations while the dotted line refers to their respective sq results an accurate representation of the velocities are required to estimate the probability distribution and their respective equivalent linear and quadratic terms for all sections the undisturbed wave velocity is calculated at the center of each spar segment the results show that even small velocities of the body result in a reduction in the relative velocity due to the phase difference between the components the effect of the body velocity on the relative velocity was also observed for the other sections at the bottom of the structure the body velocity is higher than the wave velocity however the inclusion of the relative velocity is important over the entire length of the spar the second order velocity became negligible because the displacement occurs at a very low frequency and has a narrow band width a possible simplification for this specific case is the assumption of a gaussian distribution of the velocity and relative velocity and in doing so this would to speed up the calculation of the equivalent hydrodynamic terms however this approximation would be erroneous for other systems such as tlps the probability of the displacement and relative velocity are used to calculate the equivalent linear and quadratic coefficients for the mooring and hydrodynamic forces depending on the magnitude and asymmetry of the nonlinearity the equivalent coefficients can be more or less pronounced fig 8 shows the psd of the quadratic forces from the mooring hydrodynamic and total it is possible to observe that for this condition the quadratic stiffness term slightly reduces the total second order force f 2 for low frequency forces and increases for high frequencies for the condition simulated the hydrodynamic quadratic term is dominant and the mooring system behaves almost linearly however the equivalent quadratic term of the mooring may increase its contribution once the device starts to have larger oscillations for a single dof system the first and second order force spectrum can be calculated as 45 s f ˆ f ˆ ω h f ˆ 1 ω 2 s η η ω 2 h f ˆ 2 ω 1 ω ω 1 2 s η η ω 1 s η η ω ω 1 d ω 1 where the first term on the rhs is associated with the linear force while the second is associated with the quadratic force the second order force can also be used to calculate the spectral response of the displacement as 46 s x ˆ x ˆ ω h ω 2 s f ˆ f ˆ ω even though the quadratic force contribution is several orders of magnitudes lower than the linear one its contribution produces surge motions of the same order of magnitude due to the dynamic amplification at resonance therefore for this system only the low frequency peak occurs due to the quadratic force and the higher frequency components of the quadratic force do not affect the response in surge however as mentioned previously the sum frequency can excite the natural frequency of tlps and cause the vibrations of tower jonkman et al 2009 for the reference environmental condition the magnitude of the platform surge motion is small hence the contribution of the quadratic force from the mooring is almost negligible however once the aerodynamics of the wind turbine and the wind speed fluctuations are considered the quadratic force of the mooring might become important to show its importance for higher displacements a severe sea state given in jonkman 2010 is analyzed fig 9 a shows the spectral response in surge for a sea state with h s 15 4 m t p 17 0 s and u c 0 0 5 m s and fig 9 b shows its respective second order forces mooring hydrodynamic and total the gray lines are the 30 td simulations with different sets of random phases which reinforces the sensitivity of the second order motion due to the random phases as shown previously in fig 5 b even though the second order motion for higher period is small compared to the first order one it is possible to identify the contribution coming from the mooring system as illustrated in fig 9 b the presence of the mooring system causes a reduction in the magnitude of the total quadratic forces for low frequencies while it increases for higher frequencies as mentioned previously instead of higher motions generated by severe sea states the aerodynamic loads and wind speed fluctuations could be the driven mechanism that leads to large displacements of the platform hence the significance of mooring quadratic forces from the catenary system might be important when considering the dynamics of the entire system 6 sensitivity study of the environmental condition even though the system is described by a single dof the nonlinear forces are quite complex and understanding the behavior of the platform can be a difficult task first the hydrodynamic force is discretized in several sections where the nonlinearity depends on the relative velocity and the current velocity the current and wave velocity decrease with depth and the skewness of the distribution to calculate the equivalent quadratic coefficients changes with each section the mooring line can produce an equivalent second order force which reduces the magnitude of the total quadratic force the second order effect depends on the asymmetry magnitude and frequency distribution of the forces as it generates forces in the sum and difference of the frequencies i e higher and lower frequency forces due to the aforementioned complexity parametric investigations were conducted to provide an insight of the second order response and its sensitivity to the environmental conditions the parametric investigation was performed based on the reference environmental condition in which the significant wave height wave period and mean current velocity were varied systematically the range of the environmental conditions simulated is shown in table 2 in this section only sq results were shown however comparisons with td simulations were performed for some environmental conditions and excellent agreement between td and sq were observed over all conditions in terms of psd and probability distribution for the first parameter the wave height was varied from 1 to 7 m which have high probabilities of occurrence and is based on the sea states in babarit et al 2011 and the wave period and current speed were fixed t p 10 5 s u c 0 0 25 m s fig 10 a shows the spectral response and b its respective pdf of the stationary and zero mean random displacement for several wave heights as expected the results show an increase of the second order response with increasing wave height note that the second order response did not increase linearly nor quadratically because the magnitude of the quadratic coefficient depends on the magnitude of the response and nonlinearity and the asymmetry of the nonlinearity the skewness remained nearly constant over the entire distribution the quadratic mooring force at higher displacements reduced the magnitude of the total quadratic force while at lower displacements remained unimportant for the next parametric investigation the wave period was varied from 7 to 14 s which have high probabilities of occurrence and is based on the sea states in babarit et al 2011 and the wave height and current speed were fixed h s 4 0 m u c 0 0 25 m s fig 11 a shows the spectral response in surge and b shows its respective pdf of the stationary and zero mean random displacement for several wave periods for the conditions simulated the second order response remained nearly constant over the wave periods a possible reason is that at short wave periods the relative velocity is mainly due to the wave velocity due to the low motion of the platform in contrast longer period waves excite the structure as it is closer to the natural frequency and thus the body velocity increases its contribution in the relative velocity over the entire spar length also the nonlinear hydrodynamic force is important when the wave period is short which leads to higher velocities of the fluid however for short period waves the wave velocity decays quickly with the depth on the other hand longer wave periods have a lower velocity which decays more slowly with the depth due to the ratio of the second and first order response the skewness of the distribution was higher at lower periods due to their smaller first order response finally the current velocity at the sea level was varied from 0 1 to 0 9 m s and the wave height and wave period were fixed h s 4 0 m t p 10 5 s fig 12 a shows the spectral response in surge and b shows its respective pdf of the stationary and zero mean random displacement for several current velocities the influence of the quadratic hydrodynamic term is reduced for higher current velocity this can be caused due to the reduction of asymmetry in the hydrodynamic force at higher current velocities for this platform and wave condition the maximum second order response occurred around the reference case it is important to notice that the magnitude of the current velocity used here is similar to the mean velocity at several locations fratantoni 2001 hence second order motions due to the wave and current interaction might occur continuously during operational conditions note that for different environmental conditions the maximum second order response might occur at different current velocities for the extreme values of the current simulated the sq results approximated to the linear solution sl and fd for null current velocity the sq is not capable of capturing the second order effect due to symmetry and the solution reduces to the sl this parametric study investigated the current in the same direction as the wind thrust force however note the results are not symmetric in respect to the current velocity in case of adverse currents for several reasons the wavenumber and the transfer function that relates the wave spectrum and the wave velocity are not symmetrical in addition if the wind and current are in opposite direction the mean displacement of the platform will be different and the nonlinear mooring force will lead to different linear and quadratic forces this can also lead to a higher mean pitch angle which was not investigated in this work 7 discussion as illustrated in previous sections the sq is capable of estimating the second order response of the system in terms of spectral response and its probability distribution the second order effects were caused by the nonlinearities in the system that generates forces at the sum and difference frequencies besides the excellent agreement with td simulations a clear advantage of the sq over td simulations is the low computational cost table 3 shows the mean simulation clock time for the reference environmental condition using fd sl sq and td the simulations were performed using a standard desktop pc with intel core i7 processor 2 4 ghz and 16 gb ram for the environmental conditions and simulations parameters investigated the sq converged rapidly and required between 4 7 iterations to achieve a relative error of 0 1 with the equivalent coefficients of previous iteration step the sl procedure required only a single iteration due to its almost linear behavior of the first order response hence fd and sl had a comparable time even though the td simulations required around 33 s they are sensitive to the random phase angle used and several sets of angles simulations are necessary to have a proper estimation of the response therefore it may be concluded that the sq is two orders of magnitude faster than td simulations which was also observed in donley and spanos 2012 note that the number of frequency components directly affects the simulation clock time especially to calculate the third order moments triple integrals a good discretization of the spectrum is important to estimate the difference and sum frequencies accurately this work used the extended morison s equation to describe the hydrodynamic forces acting on the structure which can include the effects of the current and wave interaction wave number and velocity given in eqs 3 and 4 respectively however the linear hydrodynamics could be obtained using boundary element method bem software such as wamit lee 1995 nemoh babarit 2014 or aqwa ansys 2013 the bem generates frequency dependent terms which increases the computational cost in td simulations since it involves the application of cummins equation cummins 1962 convolution integral or its approximation using prony s method prony 1795 or state space representation yu and falnes 1995 while the other methods fd sl and sq have similar computational time if the hydrodynamic loads are implemented based on cummings equation the viscous drag nonlinear term based on morison s equation can be incorporated as described in this work regarding the capabilities of the sq method the quadratic term is able to capture only non symmetric nonlinearities the significance of the quadratic forces is dependent on the frequency distribution of the first order response and the degree of non symmetry of the nonlinearity it is important to note that if the system is externally excited leading to a nonzero mean position even a symmetric nonlinearity around a particular reference point becomes non symmetric for example the symmetry in the nonlinear force of the mooring system becomes non symmetric once the structure has a mean non zero displacement and its effect can be captured with the quadratic term similarly the viscous drag in the morison s equation is symmetric only for the case of null current velocity the quadratic term in the sq is zero for symmetric nonlinearities and the sq reduces to the sl for the condition without current and zero mean force the second order effect can be captured using statistical cubicization technique tognarelli et al 1997a b however the second order motion contribution due to the viscous drag without current had a lower magnitude compared to the conditions simulated nonlinearities can play an important role and must be accounted for in the dynamics of the system as it can generate forces outside the range of the wave spectrum even though the magnitude of the quadratic forces are relatively small compared to the linear ones the response associated is amplified once it excites the structure natural frequency for most offshore structures the natural frequency is set to be outside the excitation range of frequencies therefore only quadratic or higher order approximations are able to estimate the response properly note that the frequency of resonance peak may also exhibit a small shift due to the changes of equivalent linear stiffness from the catenary mooring the method of sq was applied only to the surge motion of the platform however it can be extended do multiple degrees of freedom and other sources of nonlinearities by making the appropriate modifications donley and spanos 2012 8 conclusion this work successfully estimated the nonlinear stationary response of the oc3 wind turbine spar platform under current and wave interaction using sq wherein the sources of nonlinearities come from the mooring line and hydrodynamic forces viscous term the method can be interpreted as an extension of sl in which the nonlinear system is described by an equivalent polynomial of quadratic order the equivalent polynomial coefficients are estimated iteratively using expectations of the original nonlinear system using gram charlier expansions up to third order and the polynomial representation allows the representation by means of the volterra series method fd and sl results are also compared to demonstrate their limitations note that the same procedure can be extended to the analysis of different fowts and offshore platforms in general in addition the sq method can be used to investigate other sources of nonlinearities for the proposed environmental conditions and parameters of the structure the sq obtained an excellent agreement with td simulations in terms of spectral response and its equivalent probability distribution preserving the standard deviation and skewness of the distribution on the other hand fd and sl were not able to estimate the second order motion that occurs due to excitation outside the excitation frequency range and are limited to gaussian distributions the contribution of the quadratic terms showed to be dependent on the frequency distribution and the non symmetry of the nonlinear terms for the cases of symmetric nonlinearity the sq reduces to the sl e g hydrodynamic forces without current and mooring force without mean displacement the second order force from the hydrodynamic nonlinearity was dominant in the second order response while the mooring line reduced the magnitude of the total quadratic force for low frequencies and increased for higher frequencies the response of the second order motion exhibited the same order of magnitude as for the first order motion due to the amplification at the natural frequency from the parametric study the second order response was found to be important over several environmental conditions the main advantage of sq is the low computational cost which is around two orders of magnitude faster than td simulations while producing accurate estimates of the response therefore sq can be a useful tool delivering rapid and reliable estimation of complex nonlinear platform response credit authorship contribution statement l s p silva conceptualization
