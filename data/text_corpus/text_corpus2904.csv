14520,our aim was to systematically investigate the influence of anions hpo4 2 cations ca2 mg2 and neutral h4sio4 on fe flocculation and as iii removal in the complex natural water matrix for this purpose three different anaerobic groundwaters were selected and manipulated by dosing of ca2 mg2 hpo4 2 or by their removal by cation and anion exchange the change in fe floc volume and of dissolved fe and as were followed in aerated jar experiments fe floc growth was improved by addition of ca2 or mg2 and hindered by their removal this hindered floc growth was more severe for groundwaters with higher p fe ratios where fe flocs carry a larger net negative surface charge and rely stronger on ca2 or mg2 for charge neutralisation when expressing the charge balance of the different groundwaters as the molar ratio ca2 mg2 p a linear relationship was found with the cumulative fe floc volume with a plateau at molar ratios 500 at environmentally relevant concentrations h4sio4 was found more likely to compete with as iii for adsorption capacity than hpo4 2 as iii removal was strongly related to fe removal independent of ca2 or mg2 presence indicating that as iii is primarily adsorbed at an early stage in the flocculation process keywords iron floc growth arsenite adsorption natural groundwater 1 introduction the removal of iron as fe2 from groundwater is one of the traditional treatment goals and is often achieved by aeration and sand filtration introduction of dissolved oxygen to the anaerobic groundwater allows fe2 to oxidize to fe3 and form solid fe flocs followed by fe floc removal by rapid sand filtration at ps eindhoven brabant water groundwater is collected from various wells with considerable differences in groundwater composition although the concentrations of fe in the treated water were within company specifications 15 μg fe l at all times it was found that retention of iron flocs in the rapid sand filters was affected by the selection of wells that were in use it is hypothesised that differences in water quality especially the ratio of concentrations phosphate hpo4 2 silicate h4sio4 calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 control fe floc growth as a consequence removal of the fe flocs in the rapid sand filter is expected to improve when larger fe flocs are formed it is therefore the aim of this study to gain understanding of the effect of water composition on fe floc growth in addition arsenic as as iii h3aso3 at groundwater relevant ph is of increasing concern for water supply companies in the netherlands particularly in the lower concentration ranges 20 μg l therefore co removal of as iii with fe in existing aeration filtration systems is included in this research by investigating how as iii adsorption is affected by differences in fe floc growth fe flocs are a well known adsorbent for as iii with the unique property that this adsorbent is being assembled while adsorption is occurring changes in floc growth could potentially affect the accessibility of adsorption sites for as iii the rate of fe oxidation and flocculation are affected by the design of the treatment plant e g intensity of aeration use of chemical oxidants and groundwater characteristics 1 the oxidation rate of fe2 strongly depends on ph and increases at higher ph values in the ph range 5 8 2 besides the oxidation rate of fe2 the floc formation of the oxidized fe3 is dependent on ph as well fe3 hydrolyses into fe oh 2 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 or fe oh 4 ordered from low to high ph 3 4 when fe3 species are strongly charged both at high and low ph flocculation is hindered while a net zero charge is reached within a range of 7 8 5 binding of anions such as hpo4 2 and h4sio4 with fe oxides can result in a net negative charge of the floc and hinder flocculation 6 7 inclusion of hpo4 2 within an fe floc changes the floc structure shifting from a lepidocrocite structure to an amorphous fe iii hpo4 2 structure at dissolved p fe ratios over 0 55 8 guan et al 7 found that at ph 6 the addition of 1 mg l p had limited influence on fe removal but fe removal was reduced to only 5 8 at ph 7 this can be related to a larger net negative charge at ph 7 since hpo4 2 and neutral fe species are prominent at ph 7 while h2po4 and positively charged fe species are prominent at ph 6 neutral silicic acid starts to dissociate to the si anion only at high ph values with a pka of 9 8 9 several authors found that fe removal in the presence of si decreased at ph 8 but was relatively unaffected at lower ph values 10 12 which could support that h4sio4 mainly hinders fe flocculation when it can induce charge repulsion the adsorptive removal of as during fe flocculation is known to be hindered by the presence of hpo4 2 and h4sio4 either due to adsorption competition and or due to hindered fe flocculation evidence of adsorption competition with arsenic follows from studies where pre formed fe oxides were used for example hpo4 2 competes with as v and as iii for adsorption on goethite over a wide ph range 13 16 when h4sio4 is dosed as sodium silicate or meta silicic acid it mainly seems to hinder the adsorption of as v at ph 7 while the adsorption of as iii is hindered over the entire ph range 10 16 17 this could indicate that as v adsorption is mainly hindered by charge repulsion while as iii is hindered by competition for adsorption sites addition of ca2 improved as adsorption and fe flocculation in the presence of hpo4 2 h4sio4 12 15 18 19 or at high ph values when fe species carry a negative surface charge 20 22 besides charge neutralisation ca2 can also remove hpo4 2 by precipitating as hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh 23 although this reaction is considered to be slow especially in the presence of mg2 23 25 simultaneous presence of ca2 h4sio4 hpo4 2 and fe has been found to result in formation of different fe floc structures depending on the ratio p fe and si fe 25 in the presented study experiments were conducted on site with natural groundwater the use of natural groundwater was preferred over using synthetic water since it closer represents the full scale process three groundwaters were selected with different initial water composition to enable comparison of fe floc growth and as iii adsorption between the different groundwaters fe2 and as iii were dosed to the raw groundwater the aerated jar test experiments were conducted with a raw groundwater b after increasing the concentrations of hpo4 2 ca2 mg2 or c after decreasing the concentrations with either anion or cation exchange resin 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and stock solutions fe2so4 7h2o nahco3 cacl2 2h2o mgcl2 naaso2 na2hpo4 were obtained from sigma aldrich all stock solutions were prepared in demineralized water the stock solution for fe2 was acidified to ph 2 naoh and hcl were used for ph correction 2 2 water analyses particle size quantity analysis was carried out with a particle counter based on laser obscuration hiac royco model 9703 pacific scientific for this analysis 50 ml of solution was poured in a beaker and measured undiluted mixing rates in the particle counter were set to approach the mixing rate during the jar test the particle counter measured the number of particles for specific particle diameters the lower analysis limit of the particle counter was 2 μm and data was used untill a particle diameter of 50 μm water samples were acidified with 1 v v nitric acid and as fe ca mg si p s were analysed by icp ms plasmaquant analytik jena in the analysis method an ar flow of 7 5 l min was used for the plasma with an auxillary flow of 1 1 l min and nebulizer flow of 1 05 l min the r f was set to 1 3 kw as and fe were measured with an additional dose of 80 ml min h2 while mg was measured with an additional dose of 120 ml min he before aeration hco3 was determined by titration 702 sm titrino metrohm using 0 01 m hcl until an endpoint of ph 4 3 was reached doc analyses were carried out by aqualab zuid 2 3 jar tests jar tests were executed on a jlt6 flocculation tester velp scientifica using 1 l of solution in baffled jars a mixing rate of 80 rpm was maintained and experiments were carried out at 15 16 c all experiments were performed in duplicate the chemical additions were done in anaerobic groundwater and in the first 30 s of the jar test the samples were aerated intensively where an o2 concentration of 9 7 mg l was reached water samples were collected before aeration and after 1 5 15 30 and 60 min for elemental analysis doc was measured before aeration and after 60 min and particle size quantity analysis was done only after 60 min 2 4 groundwater preparation for this study natural groundwater was collected at ps eindhoven brabant water the netherlands from three different wellfields aalsterweg middeldiep amd aalsterweg ap and klotputten kg these wellfields were selected for the considerable differences in groundwater composition table 1 in order to facilitate the comparison of as removal and fe flocculation between these groundwaters the fe concentration was increased to 5 mg l as fe2 and the as concentration to 20 25 μg l as as3 groundwater was sampled in 2 l sampling bottles the bottles were completely filled and allowed to overflow during sampling to collect anaerobic samples the experiment was conducted on the same day as sampling besides fe and as further additions were either 40 mg l 1 mmol l ca2 24 3 mg l 1 mmol l mg2 1 mg l hpo4 2 10 mg l hpo4 2 ca2 and mg2 were dosed in equimolar concentrations groundwaters were also pre treated by aniex resin amberlite ira 400 cl sigma aldrich or catiex resin amberlite ir120 na sigma aldrich by adding 70 g resin to a completely filled 2 l sampling bottle and stirring anaerobically for 30 min after catiex treatment groundwater was used directly after aniex treatment 150 mg l hco3 was added as buffer and the ph was adjusted to 7 an overview of the experimental conditions is shown in fig 1 and the corresponding initial water quality data can be found in appendix a in supplementary data 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline baseline experiments were carried out with the original raw groundwaters after fe and as addition table 1 the development of fe flocs was followed by periodically taking samples from the jar and determining the amount of fe removed after 0 45 μm filtration fig 2 left additionally particle size and quantities were measured at the end of the 60 min jar test and are shown in fig 2 right the initial rate of fe removal is highest in kg water followed by amd and ap water fig 2 left graph this can be related to the ph values of these natural groundwaters which is 7 31 7 01 and 6 83 for kg amd and ap water respectively higher ph values increase the oxidation rate of fe2 after 60 min fe removal after 0 45 μm filtrationfor both kg and ap is similar and higher for amd since this groundwater had a higher initial fe concentration nevertheless the particle size distribution and quantities are rather similar for amd and kg water fig 2 right this could indicate that denser fe flocs were formed in amd water and or that a part of the fe flocs in amd water have not grown to a size 2 μm which is the lower analysis limit of the particle counter while findings of kaegi et al 18 suggest that the higher h4sio4 concentration of amd water can contribute to formation of smaller particles this seems to contradict that h4sio4 only started to affect fe flocculation at higher ph 10 12 possibly the slower oxidation rate of fe2 in amd water prevented part of the fe flocs to grow beyond 2 μm this effect is even more pronounced for ap water where the floc quantities are much lower as compared to kg and amd after 60 min as removal after 0 45 μm filtration generally follows the same trend as fe removal fig 3 as removal in amd water is relatively limited given the higher amount of fe removed in this water as compared to kg water this could indicate that arsenic suffers from stronger adsorption competition while hpo4 2 is a known competitor its concentration is lowest for amd water it is more likely that h4sio4 is responsible for the decreased arsenic adsorption in amd water laky and licsko 26 reach a similar conclusion when investigating the influence of hpo4 2 and h4sio4 on arsenic removal where all solutes were dosed at environmentally relevant concentration levels 3 2 influence ca2 and mg2 the influence of the presence of major cations ca2 and mg2 on fe floc formation is shown in fig 4 where the particle size distribution and quantities after 60 min are depicted after addition of 40 mg l 1 mmol l ca2 or 24 mg l 1 mmol l mg2 or after removal of cations with iex the measured concentrations of fe as ca mg si p s hco3 the ph and the calculated ionic strength at the start of these experiments are reported in appendix a in supplementary data addition of ca2 or mg2 led to larger fe flocs in all groundwaters in kg and ap water both ca2 and mg2 increased the floc sizes to a similar extend indicating that both cations can be equally effective for charge neutralisation in ap water floc growth was stimulated considerably by addition of ca2 or mg2 when compared to the baseline while this was less pronounced in kg water ap water has a lower initial concentration of ca2 and mg2 and a higher concentration of hpo4 2 than kg water table 1 as a consequence it is expected that iron flocs in ap water have a larger negative charge than in kg water and benefit more from charge neutralisation in amd water dosing ca2 and mg2 not only led to the formation of a larger fe flocs as compared to ap and kg water but also considerable larger flocs were formed in the presence of ca2 as compared to mg2 possibly the addition of ca2 in amd water led to precipitation of hydroxyapatite theoretically hydroxyapatite could precipitate since it is slightly supersaturated saturation index 0 68 appendix b in supplementary data while the saturation index is higher in kg water 0 84 appendix b in supplementary data the concentration of mg2 which can hinder hydroxyapatite precipitation is higher in kg water as well after cation exchange floc growth is severely limited in all groundwaters in amd water fe removal after 0 45 μm filtrationwas still similar to the baseline study but it decreased to 40 for kg water and only 13 for ap water appendix c in supplementary data this is inversely proportional to their p fe ratios 0 04 0 07 and 0 12 for amd kg and ap respectively flocs with higher p fe ratio may carry a higher negative charge and would rely more on the bivalent cations to neutralize this charge as iii removal after cation exchange is highest for amd water followed by kg and ap water fig 5 which matches the fe removal despite the increase in floc growth after dosing ca2 or mg2 in amd and kg waters no considerable change is observed in as removal this could indicate that the adsorption sites for as are still readily accessible in the larger flocs that are formed after ca2 or mg2 dosing or alternatively that adsorption occurs in an early stage of flocculation in ap water however adsorption of as slightly decreased after dosing ca2 or mg2 3 3 influence hpo4 2 to investigate the influence of hpo4 2 either 1 mg l or 10 mg l hpo4 2 was dosed and anion exchange was applied to remove amongst others anions hpo4 2 since anion exchange also removed hco3 buffer 150 mg l hco3 was dosed after anion exchange and the ph was corrected to 7 the measured concentrations of fe as ca mg si p s hco3 the ph and the calculated ionic strength at the start of these experiments are reported in appendix a in supplementary data h4sio4 was not removed during anion exchange indicating that it was uncharged during our experiments when hpo4 2 was dosed to the baseline it decreased the fe floc sizes for kg and ap waters fig 6 for amd water the opposite was observed and a considerable increase in floc size was measured for increasing concentrations of hpo4 2 similar to the discussion in 3 2 precipitation of hydroxyapatite could be more prominent in the ca rich and mg poor amd water as compared to kg and ap water see appendix b in supplementary data for saturation indices after anion exchange floc sizes increased in all groundwaters this can be the combined effect of lower charge repulsion due to the removal of hpo4 2 and increased charge shielding since the additional dosing of hco3 increased the ionic strength for amd water this implies that both removal and addition of hpo4 2 stimulated floc growth this may indicate that different flocculation mechanisms possibly occur in the presence of hpo4 2 the polymerisation of fe is hindered and only small oligomers exist but in the presence of sufficient ca2 these can aggregate via ca o p links 27 in the absence of hpo4 2 the polymerisation of fe is not hindered and can be the main mechanism for aggregation while addition of hpo4 2 decreased floc sizes in kg and ap water there was still 80 removal of fe after 0 45 μm filtration appendix d in supplementary data the adsorption of as iii however decreases to 10 in all groundwater after dosing 10 mg l hpo4 2 fig 7 this would indicates that hpo4 2 hinders as iii removal mainly directly via adsorption competition rather than indirectly via hindered fe flocculation 3 4 integrated influence on floc growth since charge repulsion and neutralisation are widely considered to be important processes that explain fe flocculation it was investigated if the molar ratio of ca2 mg2 p can predict floc size a higher ca2 mg2 p ratio implies that a negative surface charge imposed by the hpo4 2 anion can be more readily compensated by bivalent cations ca2 and mg2 h4sio4 was excluded from this ratio since it would have been neutral at the ph values in the experiments floc size is represented as the cumulative floc volume inbetween 2 50 μm and normalized for the fe concentration the data of all experiments is included in fig 8 a reasonably linear trend is found between the ca2 mg2 p ratio and the cumulative floc volume after 60 min with a close overlap of the trends found for kg and ap waters outliers were found for amd water where the observed floc volume was higher than expected based on the ca2 mg2 p ratio this can possibly be explained by formation of more voluminous fe flocs and or hydroxyapatite precipitation at the relatively high concentrations of ca2 and h4sio4 in amd water a plateau seems to have been reached at a ca2 mg2 p ratio of 500 possible explanations for a plateau value can be that i all available fe has been flocculated to particles 2 μm and the maximum floc volume is reached and or ii the quantity of ca2 and mg2 is sufficient to completely neutralize the influence of hpo4 2 3 5 adsorption competition versus hindered floc growth in order to separate the influence of adsorption competition from the influence of reduced fe flocculation on as iii removal a comparison is made between the removal of fe and the removal of as both after 0 45 μm filtration fig 9 the data of the different time intervals during the jar test was included in general it was observed that as removal and fe removal were closely related and that the capacity for fe to adsorb as i e δas δfe seems relatively independent of the water quality adsorption competition was only evident after dosing 10 mg l hpo4 2 it reduced as removal to below 3 μg l for all groundwaters when 1 mg l hpo4 2 was dosed the adsorption capacity was relatively similar to that of the baseline although consistently lower when the baselines of amd kg and ap waters are compared it is observed that the adsorption capacity δas δfe for as is systematically about factor 2 lower for amd water as discussed in 3 1 it is likely that h4sio4 is competing with as for adsorption onto the fe oxide as the h4sio4 concentrations in amd water are roughly factor 2 higher than in kg and ap water table 1 when comparing adsorption capacities δas δfe of iron flocs in these different groundwaters against the native h4sio4 and hpo4 2 concentration an inverse correlation between the adsorption capacity and the h4sio4 concentration is found but this is not observed for hpo4 2 fig 10 at environmentally relevant concentration levels our data suggests that h4sio4 would be a stronger competitor for arsenic adsorption onto fe flocs than hpo4 2 4 conclusions in aerated grondwaters as iii removal can be affected both indirectly by hindered fe floc formation as directly by adsorption competition with hpo4 2 and h4sio4 as iii removal was closely related to fe2 removal and relatively independent of the differences in water matrix this indicates that as adsorbs onto fe particles at an early stage in the flocculation process at the natural groundwater concentrations h4sio4 is more likely to be responsible for adsorption competition than hpo4 2 as the adsorption capacity of fe for arsenic δas δfe was inversely related to the h4sio4 concentration while this was not observed for hpo4 2 addition of ca2 or mg2 improved fe floc growth as expressed by an increase in the total fe volume 2 μm and an increase in the amount of larger particles removal of ca2 and mg2 by cation exchange hindered floc growth this was more severe for aerated groundwaters with higher p fe ratios where fe flocs carry a larger net negative surface charge and rely stronger on ca2 or mg2 for charge neutralisation when expressing the charge balance of the different aerated groundwaters as the molar ratio ca2 mg2 p a linear relationship was found with the cumulative fe floc volume 2 μm indicating the importance of ca2 and mg2 for charge neutralisation although deviations from this trend were

14520,our aim was to systematically investigate the influence of anions hpo4 2 cations ca2 mg2 and neutral h4sio4 on fe flocculation and as iii removal in the complex natural water matrix for this purpose three different anaerobic groundwaters were selected and manipulated by dosing of ca2 mg2 hpo4 2 or by their removal by cation and anion exchange the change in fe floc volume and of dissolved fe and as were followed in aerated jar experiments fe floc growth was improved by addition of ca2 or mg2 and hindered by their removal this hindered floc growth was more severe for groundwaters with higher p fe ratios where fe flocs carry a larger net negative surface charge and rely stronger on ca2 or mg2 for charge neutralisation when expressing the charge balance of the different groundwaters as the molar ratio ca2 mg2 p a linear relationship was found with the cumulative fe floc volume with a plateau at molar ratios 500 at environmentally relevant concentrations h4sio4 was found more likely to compete with as iii for adsorption capacity than hpo4 2 as iii removal was strongly related to fe removal independent of ca2 or mg2 presence indicating that as iii is primarily adsorbed at an early stage in the flocculation process keywords iron floc growth arsenite adsorption natural groundwater 1 introduction the removal of iron as fe2 from groundwater is one of the traditional treatment goals and is often achieved by aeration and sand filtration introduction of dissolved oxygen to the anaerobic groundwater allows fe2 to oxidize to fe3 and form solid fe flocs followed by fe floc removal by rapid sand filtration at ps eindhoven brabant water groundwater is collected from various wells with considerable differences in groundwater composition although the concentrations of fe in the treated water were within company specifications 15 μg fe l at all times it was found that retention of iron flocs in the rapid sand filters was affected by the selection of wells that were in use it is hypothesised that differences in water quality especially the ratio of concentrations phosphate hpo4 2 silicate h4sio4 calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 control fe floc growth as a consequence removal of the fe flocs in the rapid sand filter is expected to improve when larger fe flocs are formed it is therefore the aim of this study to gain understanding of the effect of water composition on fe floc growth in addition arsenic as as iii h3aso3 at groundwater relevant ph is of increasing concern for water supply companies in the netherlands particularly in the lower concentration ranges 20 μg l therefore co removal of as iii with fe in existing aeration filtration systems is included in this research by investigating how as iii adsorption is affected by differences in fe floc growth fe flocs are a well known adsorbent for as iii with the unique property that this adsorbent is being assembled while adsorption is occurring changes in floc growth could potentially affect the accessibility of adsorption sites for as iii the rate of fe oxidation and flocculation are affected by the design of the treatment plant e g intensity of aeration use of chemical oxidants and groundwater characteristics 1 the oxidation rate of fe2 strongly depends on ph and increases at higher ph values in the ph range 5 8 2 besides the oxidation rate of fe2 the floc formation of the oxidized fe3 is dependent on ph as well fe3 hydrolyses into fe oh 2 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 or fe oh 4 ordered from low to high ph 3 4 when fe3 species are strongly charged both at high and low ph flocculation is hindered while a net zero charge is reached within a range of 7 8 5 binding of anions such as hpo4 2 and h4sio4 with fe oxides can result in a net negative charge of the floc and hinder flocculation 6 7 inclusion of hpo4 2 within an fe floc changes the floc structure shifting from a lepidocrocite structure to an amorphous fe iii hpo4 2 structure at dissolved p fe ratios over 0 55 8 guan et al 7 found that at ph 6 the addition of 1 mg l p had limited influence on fe removal but fe removal was reduced to only 5 8 at ph 7 this can be related to a larger net negative charge at ph 7 since hpo4 2 and neutral fe species are prominent at ph 7 while h2po4 and positively charged fe species are prominent at ph 6 neutral silicic acid starts to dissociate to the si anion only at high ph values with a pka of 9 8 9 several authors found that fe removal in the presence of si decreased at ph 8 but was relatively unaffected at lower ph values 10 12 which could support that h4sio4 mainly hinders fe flocculation when it can induce charge repulsion the adsorptive removal of as during fe flocculation is known to be hindered by the presence of hpo4 2 and h4sio4 either due to adsorption competition and or due to hindered fe flocculation evidence of adsorption competition with arsenic follows from studies where pre formed fe oxides were used for example hpo4 2 competes with as v and as iii for adsorption on goethite over a wide ph range 13 16 when h4sio4 is dosed as sodium silicate or meta silicic acid it mainly seems to hinder the adsorption of as v at ph 7 while the adsorption of as iii is hindered over the entire ph range 10 16 17 this could indicate that as v adsorption is mainly hindered by charge repulsion while as iii is hindered by competition for adsorption sites addition of ca2 improved as adsorption and fe flocculation in the presence of hpo4 2 h4sio4 12 15 18 19 or at high ph values when fe species carry a negative surface charge 20 22 besides charge neutralisation ca2 can also remove hpo4 2 by precipitating as hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh 23 although this reaction is considered to be slow especially in the presence of mg2 23 25 simultaneous presence of ca2 h4sio4 hpo4 2 and fe has been found to result in formation of different fe floc structures depending on the ratio p fe and si fe 25 in the presented study experiments were conducted on site with natural groundwater the use of natural groundwater was preferred over using synthetic water since it closer represents the full scale process three groundwaters were selected with different initial water composition to enable comparison of fe floc growth and as iii adsorption between the different groundwaters fe2 and as iii were dosed to the raw groundwater the aerated

obscuration hiac royco model 9703 pacific scientific for this analysis 50 ml of solution was poured in a beaker and measured undiluted mixing rates in the particle counter were set to approach the

carried out by aqualab zuid 2 3 jar tests jar tests were executed on a jlt6 flocculation tester velp scientifica using 1 l of solution in baffled jars a mixing rate of 80 rpm was maintained and experiments were carried out at 15 16 c all experiments were performed in duplicate the chemical additions were done in anaerobic groundwater and in the first 30 s of the jar test the samples were aerated intensively where an o2 concentration of 9 7 mg l was reached water samples were collected before aeration and after 1 5 15 30 and 60 min for elemental analysis doc was measured before aeration and after 60 min and particle size quantity analysis was done only after 60 min 2 4 groundwater preparation for this study natural groundwater was collected at ps eindhoven brabant water the netherlands from three different wellfields aalsterweg middeldiep amd aalsterweg ap and klotputten kg these wellfields were selected for the considerable differences in groundwater composition table 1 in order to facilitate the comparison of as removal and fe flocculation between these groundwaters the fe concentration was increased to 5 mg l as fe2 and the as concentration to 20 25 μg l as as3 groundwater was sampled in 2 l sampling bottles the bottles were completely filled and allowed to overflow during sampling to collect anaerobic samples the experiment was conducted on the same day as sampling besides fe and as further additions were either 40 mg l 1 mmol l ca2 24 3 mg l 1 mmol l mg2 1 mg l hpo4 2 10 mg l hpo4 2 ca2 and mg2 were dosed in equimolar concentrations groundwaters were also pre treated by aniex resin amberlite ira 400 cl sigma aldrich or catiex resin amberlite ir120 na sigma aldrich by adding 70 g resin to a completely filled 2 l sampling bottle and stirring anaerobically for 30 min after catiex treatment groundwater was used directly after aniex treatment 150 mg l hco3 was added as buffer and the ph was adjusted to 7 an overview of the experimental conditions is shown in fig 1 and the corresponding initial water quality data can be found in appendix a in supplementary data 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline baseline experiments were carried out with the original raw groundwaters after fe and as addition table 1 the development of fe flocs was followed by periodically taking samples from the jar and determining the amount of fe removed after 0 45 μm filtration fig 2 left additionally particle size and quantities were measured at the end of the 60 min jar test and are shown in fig 2 right the initial rate of fe removal is highest in kg water followed by amd and ap water fig 2 left graph this can be related to the ph values of these natural groundwaters which is 7 31 7 01 and 6 83 for kg amd and ap water respectively higher ph values increase the oxidation rate of fe2 after 60 min fe removal after 0 45 μm filtrationfor both kg and ap is similar and higher for amd since this groundwater had a higher initial fe concentration nevertheless the particle size distribution and quantities are rather similar for amd and kg water fig 2 right this could indicate that denser fe flocs were formed in amd water and or that a part of the fe flocs in amd water have not grown to a size 2 μm which is the lower analysis limit of the particle counter while findings of kaegi et al 18 suggest that the higher h4sio4 concentration of amd water can contribute to formation of smaller particles this seems to contradict that h4sio4 only started to affect fe flocculation at higher ph 10 12 possibly the slower oxidation rate of fe2 in amd water prevented part of the fe flocs to grow beyond 2 μm this effect is even more pronounced for ap water where the floc quantities are much lower as compared to kg and amd after 60 min as removal after 0 45 μm filtration generally follows the same trend as fe removal fig 3 as removal in amd water is relatively limited given the higher amount of fe removed in this water as compared to kg water this could indicate that arsenic suffers from stronger adsorption competition while hpo4 2 is a known competitor its concentration is lowest for amd water it is more likely that h4sio4 is responsible for the decreased arsenic adsorption in amd water laky and licsko 26 reach a similar conclusion when investigating the influence of hpo4 2 and h4sio4 on arsenic removal where all solutes were dosed at environmentally relevant concentration levels 3 2 influence ca2 and mg2 the influence of the presence of major cations ca2 and mg2 on fe floc formation is shown in fig 4 where the particle size distribution and quantities after 60 min are depicted after addition of 40 mg l 1 mmol l ca2 or 24 mg l 1 mmol l mg2 or after removal of cations with iex the measured concentrations of fe as ca mg si p s hco3 the ph and the calculated ionic strength at the start of these experiments are reported in appendix a in supplementary data addition of ca2 or mg2 led to larger fe flocs in all groundwaters in kg and ap water both ca2 and mg2 increased the floc sizes to a similar extend indicating that both cations can be equally effective for charge neutralisation in ap water floc growth was stimulated considerably by addition of ca2 or mg2 when compared to the baseline while this was less pronounced in kg water ap water has a lower initial concentration of ca2 and mg2 and a higher concentration of hpo4 2 than kg water table 1 as a consequence it is expected that iron flocs in ap water have a larger negative charge than in kg water and benefit more from charge neutralisation in amd water dosing ca2 and mg2 not only led to the formation of a larger fe flocs as compared to ap and kg water but also considerable larger flocs were formed in the presence of ca2 as compared to mg2 possibly the addition of ca2 in amd water led to precipitation of hydroxyapatite theoretically hydroxyapatite could precipitate since it is slightly supersaturated saturation index 0 68 appendix b in supplementary data while the saturation index is higher in kg water 0 84 appendix b in supplementary data the concentration of mg2 which can hinder hydroxyapatite precipitation is higher in kg water as well after cation exchange floc growth is severely limited in all groundwaters in amd water fe removal after 0 45 μm filtrationwas still similar to the baseline study but it decreased to 40 for kg water and only 13 for ap water appendix c in supplementary data this is inversely proportional to their p fe ratios 0 04 0 07 and 0 12 for amd kg and ap respectively flocs with higher p fe ratio may carry a higher negative charge and would rely more on the bivalent cations to neutralize this charge as iii removal after cation exchange is highest for amd water followed by kg and ap water fig 5 which matches the fe removal despite the increase in floc growth after dosing ca2 or mg2 in amd and kg waters no considerable change is observed in as removal this could indicate that the adsorption sites for as are still readily accessible in the larger flocs that are formed after ca2 or mg2 dosing or alternatively that adsorption occurs in an early stage of flocculation in ap water however adsorption of as slightly decreased after dosing ca2 or mg2 3 3 influence hpo4 2 to investigate the influence of hpo4 2 either 1 mg l or 10 mg l hpo4 2 was dosed and anion exchange was applied to remove amongst others anions hpo4 2 since anion exchange also removed hco3 buffer 150 mg l hco3 was dosed after anion exchange and the ph was corrected to 7 the measured concentrations of fe as ca mg si p s hco3 the ph and the calculated ionic strength at the start of these experiments are reported in appendix a in supplementary data h4sio4 was not removed during anion exchange indicating that it was uncharged during our experiments when hpo4 2 was dosed to the baseline it decreased the fe floc sizes for kg and ap waters fig 6 for amd water the opposite was observed and a considerable increase in floc size was measured for increasing concentrations of hpo4 2 similar to the discussion in 3 2 precipitation of hydroxyapatite could be more prominent in the ca rich and mg poor amd water as compared to kg and ap water see appendix b in supplementary data for saturation indices after anion exchange floc sizes increased in all groundwaters this can be the combined effect of lower charge repulsion due to the removal of hpo4 2 and increased charge shielding since the additional dosing of hco3 increased the ionic strength for amd water this implies that both removal and addition of hpo4 2 stimulated floc growth this may indicate that different flocculation mechanisms possibly occur in the presence of hpo4 2 the polymerisation of fe is hindered and only small oligomers exist but in the presence of sufficient ca2 these can aggregate via ca o p links 27 in the absence of hpo4 2 the polymerisation of fe is not hindered and can be the main mechanism for aggregation while addition of hpo4 2 decreased floc sizes in kg and ap water there was still 80 removal of fe after 0 45 μm filtration appendix d in supplementary data the adsorption of as iii however decreases to 10 in all groundwater after dosing 10 mg l hpo4 2 fig 7 this would indicates that hpo4 2 hinders as iii removal mainly directly via adsorption competition rather than indirectly via hindered fe flocculation 3 4 integrated influence on floc growth since charge repulsion and neutralisation are widely considered to be important processes that explain fe flocculation it was investigated if the molar ratio of ca2 mg2 p can predict floc size a higher ca2 mg2 p ratio implies that a negative surface charge imposed by the hpo4 2 anion can be more readily compensated by bivalent cations ca2 and mg2 h4sio4 was excluded from this ratio since it would have been neutral at the ph values in the experiments floc size is represented as the cumulative floc volume inbetween 2 50 μm and normalized for the fe concentration the data of all experiments is included in fig 8 a reasonably linear trend is found between the ca2 mg2 p ratio and the cumulative floc volume after 60 min with a close overlap of the trends found for kg and ap waters outliers were found for amd water where the observed floc volume was higher than expected based on the ca2 mg2 p ratio this can possibly be explained by formation of more voluminous fe flocs and or hydroxyapatite precipitation at the relatively high concentrations of ca2 and h4sio4 in amd water a plateau seems to have been reached at a ca2 mg2 p ratio of 500 possible explanations for a plateau value can be that i all available fe has been flocculated to particles 2 μm and the maximum floc volume is reached and or ii the quantity of ca2 and mg2 is sufficient to completely neutralize the influence of hpo4 2 3 5 adsorption competition versus hindered floc growth in order to separate the influence of adsorption competition from the influence of reduced fe flocculation on as iii removal a comparison is made between the removal of fe and the removal of as both after 0 45 μm filtration fig 9 the data of the different time intervals during the jar test was included in general it was observed that as removal and fe removal were closely related and that the capacity for fe to adsorb as i e δas δfe seems relatively independent of the water quality adsorption competition was only evident after dosing 10 mg l hpo4 2 it reduced as removal to below 3 μg l for all groundwaters when 1 mg l hpo4 2 was dosed the adsorption capacity was relatively similar to that of the baseline although consistently lower when the baselines of amd kg and ap waters are compared it is observed that the adsorption capacity δas δfe for as is systematically about factor 2 lower for amd water as discussed in 3 1 it is likely that h4sio4 is competing with as for adsorption onto the fe oxide as the h4sio4 concentrations in amd water are roughly factor 2 higher than in kg and ap water table 1 when comparing adsorption capacities δas δfe of iron flocs in these different groundwaters against the native h4sio4 and hpo4 2 concentration an inverse correlation between the adsorption capacity and the h4sio4 concentration is found but this is not observed for hpo4 2 fig 10 at environmentally relevant concentration levels our data suggests that h4sio4 would be a stronger competitor for arsenic adsorption onto fe flocs than hpo4 2 4 conclusions in aerated grondwaters as iii removal can be affected both indirectly by hindered fe floc formation as directly by adsorption competition with hpo4 2 and h4sio4 as iii removal was closely related to fe2 removal and relatively independent of the differences in water matrix this indicates that as adsorbs onto fe particles at an early stage in the flocculation process at the natural groundwater concentrations h4sio4 is more likely to be responsible for adsorption competition than hpo4 2 as the adsorption capacity of fe for arsenic δas δfe was inversely related to the h4sio4 concentration while this was not observed for hpo4 2 addition of ca2 or mg2 improved fe floc growth as expressed by an increase in the total fe volume 2 μm and an increase in the amount of larger particles removal of ca2 and mg2 by cation exchange hindered floc growth this was more severe for aerated groundwaters with higher p fe ratios where fe flocs carry a larger net negative surface charge and rely stronger on ca2 or mg2 for charge neutralisation when expressing the charge balance of the different aerated groundwaters as the molar ratio ca2 mg2 p a linear relationship was found with the cumulative fe floc volume 2 μm indicating the importance of ca2 and mg2 for charge neutralisation although deviations from this trend were

14521,the present study investigates the effect of a viscous and a non viscous solvent mixture on the shape of the nanoparticles synthesized in it and applies them for the degradation of an herbicide alachlor here we have used glycerol water mixed solvent to synthesize zero valent iron nanoparticles under aerobic condition and tested its reductive ability the microstructural analysis reveals the presence of single flower like pattern formed from petal like structures clustered at the center while the xrd analysis points out to the presence of single phase particles having negligible oxide impurities this refers to the excellent sheathing ability of the viscous solvent during the growth of the nanoparticles different experimental conditions and parameters were involved to check the efficiency of the nanoparticles towards alachlor degradation within 2 h almost 90 of alachlor was degraded when the reaction was carried out by ultrasonic agitation under anaerobic condition the ph variational studies suggested an optimum value of ph 5 at which the highest removal was achieved results also emphasized that anaerobic conditions during the reaction lead to higher removal efficacy hence the results predict that nanoscale zero valent synthesized in glycerol medium is a prospective applicant to pesticide remediation keywords nanoscale zero valent irom solvent viscocity glycerol aerobically stable n zvi alachlor degradation gas chromatography 1 introduction a wide category of pesticides are used by the agricultural sector to protect valuable crops from the attack of pests by abolishing suppressing or changing their life cycle 1 herbicides being used to control the growth of small plants and weeds alachlor 2 chloro n 2 6 diethylphenyl n methoxymethylacetamide is an herbicide belonging to the chloroacetanilide family which is used extensively as a pre emergent agent to control annual grasses and broad leaved weeds especially for maize cotton brassicas sugarcane etc 2 3 the use of pesticide is beneficial for agricultural purpose but it negatively impacts the human beings and other living organisms by disturbing their life processes 4 they generally affect the human beings by two routes either by direct exposure or by indirect exposure farmers along with the people exposed to eating pesticide contaminated food or inhale pesticide contaminated air at risk of direct exposure 5 application of pesticides to crops leads to their residue being left on the fields which percolate down ultimately ending up in groundwater 6 people drinking such contaminated groundwater are at risk of indirect exposure 4 the level of contamination of the groundwater depends on the solubility of the compound in water alachlor is highly soluble in water 242 mg l at 25 c although it may dissipate from the soil through volatilization photodegradation and biodegradation it has a half life of 7 38 days in the soil 7 the degradation pathway of alachlor depicts the formation of some intermediates which are very reactive to the humic substances in the soil causing bio accumulation 8 alachlor molecule contains an aniline moiety attached to a carbonyl group having an allylic chlorine group 9 it is a b2 carcinogen and its intermediate products such as 2 6 diethylphenyl methoxymethyl amino oxoacetic acid i e oxanilic acid and 2 2 6 diethylphenyl methoxy methylamino 2 oxoethanesulfonic acid i e sulfonic acid are more polar than alachlor and are all potent carcinogens 10 12 though alachlor has relatively low acute toxicity repeated exposure has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity degeneration and tumor formation in some animals 13 the probable oral lethal dose in humans is 0 5 5 g kg of the body weight 12 several techniques have been instigated to degrade alachlor to less toxic species and to restrict its entry to drinking water sources which include membrane filtration 14 photocatalysis 15 16 adsorption 17 19 advanced oxidation 20 21 etc several heterogeneous and photocatalysts used by different researchers for the degradation of alachlor such as bismuth vanadate titanium oxide anodic and photo fenton s reagent etc have shown promising outcome 15 22 24 among the various methods of degradation the method which has caught our attention is the use of zero valent iron nanoparticles n zvi as a reductant and an adsorbent of the reduced product s from the reaction medium different organic compounds including pesticides have been degraded by the action of n zvi particles but very limited studies have been performed on the degradation of alachlor 23 25 26 the major advantages of using n zvi for contaminant degradation include high availability of raw material source relative nontoxicity of the ferrous and ferric ions released as a result of the reduction of zero valent iron and kinetically fast reactions 27 furthermore the minuscule size of n zvi allow them to easily pass through aqueous layers and promote the surface reactions to take place due to their high available surface area 28 29 bezbaruah et al synthesized n zvi having sizes 90 nm and used them to degrade solutions of alachlor and atrazine 30 their results showed 92 96 degradation of alachlor within 72 h of reaction time n zvi particles degrade halogenated pesticides by adsorbing them on its surface then it ruptures the carbon halogen bond thereby reducing them according to eq 2 and thus converts the pesticides into harmless organics 31 meanwhile due to reduction the zero valent iron eq 1 is converted to ferrous ions and finally to ferric oxides and hydroxides fe2o3 feooh fe3o4 etc which again adsorb the organics produced in the medium due to dechlorination on their surface providing complete removal from aqueous media 32 1 fe 0 fe 2 2e 2 r cl 2e h r h cl there are several methods which are already established for the synthesis of nanoparticles based on the preferred characteristics morphology properties applications etc 33 but in the case of synthesis of n zvi the major challenge which is faced with its usage and handling is the chances of it getting oxidized during filtration storage and application the agglomeration of these nanoparticles is another problem which occurs due to their intensive magnetic nature in this context the preferred technique is to prepare and preserve the pristine n zvi under inert conditions and perform the degradation studies under anoxic condition but the application of the degradation study under such conditions will incur additional expenditure in order to reduce this additional expenditure we have tried to synthesize the n zvi particles in a mixed solvent medium which includes a viscous solvent glycerol and water a viscous medium will sheath the nanoparticles during the time of synthesis which would reduce the intensity of the nanoparticles to get oxidized and would also reduce agglomeration to some extent till date limited work has been performed on the preparation of n zvi in viscous solvents 34 38 and the effect on the morphological evolution of the particles due to such solvents has also not been studied much which is a clear gap in this field in recent years the method of ultrasonication which involves the use of high frequency sound waves to agitate a recation medium 39 41 has gained a lot of importance the sound waves helps to disintegrate the agglomerated nanoparticles and hence the effective surface area of the nanoparticles increase thereby leading to an increase in the rate of the reaction previous researchers have also used this method to accelerate many reactions 42 ultrasonication along with the use of n zvi is regarded as a green technology as it does not generate secondary pollutants and is carried out in the absence of chemical agents 41 the amount of the dissolved oxygen present in the reaction medium also plays a key role as iron in its zero valent state is corroded very quickly by aerobic or dissolved oxygen 43 also when any reaction medium is ultrasonicated the water present in the medium is broken down to hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl radicals while dissolved oxygen is transformed into atomic oxygen due to the generation of the intense heat in the medium 44 hence we have studied the effect of the presence and absence of dissolved oxygen in the reaction medium on reaction efficiency of the nanoparticles in our present work we have synthesized n zvi in the presence of a viscous and a non viscous solvent mixture and studied the ability of the as synthesized nanoparticles to successfully degrade alachlor which has not yet been carried out by other research groups the effect of the morphological variation of the nanoparticles due to synthesis in a viscous solvent has been employed here to degrade alachlor solutions under different experimental conditions which include variation in the presence and absence of dissolved oxygen in the reaction medium mode of mixing the reactants ph etc and we have shown that synthesis of nanoscale zero valent iron in glycerol water medium enhances the shelf life of n zvi and reduces its oxidative ability 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals required alachlor c14h20no2cl 99 90 pure hplc grade was bought from sigma aldrich different properties of alachlor have been summarized in si table 1 anhydrous ferric chloride fecl3 96 sodium borohydride nabh4 98 ethanol c2h5oh 99 99 glycerol 99 9 acs grade and hexane hplc grade were bought from merck india sodium hydroxide naoh 95 and hydrochloric acid hcl 37 emsure required for adjusting the ph of the reactions were also bought from merck india stock solutions of alachlor were prepared by dissolving the required weight of it in deionized water deionized millipore milli q water was used to prepare all the experimental solutions all the chemicals were used as received without further purification 2 2 synthesis of the nanoparticles n zvi was prepared by modifying the wet synthesis method 35 45 46 briefly a solution of ferric chloride of total volume 100 ml was prepared by dissolving 0 73 g of anhydrous ferric chloride in a mixture of glycerol and water in the ratio of 3 2 this solution was taken in a 500 ml conical flask and was stirred by employing a mechanical stirrer at a speed of 500 rpm approx to this already agitated precursor solution 250 ml solution of sodium borohydride having a strength of 0 25 m was added drop wise which caused the appearance of black colored particles the reaction was complete when the total solution turned black due to the formation of zero valent iron nanoparticles sodium borohydride solution was added in excess to ensure the entire iron to persist in pure metallic phase this was also done to ensure complete reduction as h2 gas is generated as a by product of the medium which increases the reducing character of the medium 47 after the reaction was over the synthesized nanoparticles were filtered dried under vacuum conditions and stored in glass vials which were flushed with nitrogen to generate an inert atmosphere the vials were stored under vacuum conditions till further usage it is worth mentioning here that the synthesis was performed in the absence of any inert gas medium 2 3 particle characterization the synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by x ray diffraction analysis panalytical x pert pro xrd unit to acquire knowledge on their crystallinity and crystal phase purity the x ray diffraction analysis was carried out at an operating voltage of 40 kv utilizing cu kα radiation wavelength of 1 54å in the scan range of 20 to 70 the morphology of the particles was determined by fe sem zeiss sigma analysis while their size was shown by tem tecnai tf20g2st images operating at a voltage of 200 kv the elemental composition of the particles was carried out by edax analysis of the nanoparticles which was attached with the fe sem instrument specific surface area of the synthesized particles was analyzed by performing bet measurements by n2 gas adsorption using micromeritics asap 2020 surface analyzer at a 77 k ft ir analysis was done by nicolet is10 thermo ft ir spectrometer ranging from 4000 cm 1 to 400 cm 1 2 4 batch experimental studies alachlor removal studies were performed in batches under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in 250 ml conical flasks fitted with silicone septum seal 100 ml aqueous solutions of alachlor having a strength of 20 mg l were added to the flasks for the conduction of experiments under anaerobic conditions the reaction vessels containing the pesticide solutions were pre purged with n2 gas for about 30 min prior to the initiation of the reaction ph of the reaction medium was kept unchanged and was not varied until the reactions involving ph were carried out the reaction medium was perturbed by two means mechanical stirring and ultrasonication for the mechanical stirring purpose sealed reaction vessels were rotated end over end by a custom made mechanical stirrer at 450 rpm at room temperature similar experiments were performed employing an ultrasonic bath of 1 5 l capacity 50w 230v 50hz the experimental conditions can be broadly categorized into four groups group 1 consisted of reactions which were performed under aerobic condition by mechanical stirring group 2 was performed under aerobic condition in an ultrasonic bath reactions under group 3 were performed by mechanical stirring under anaerobic conditions and group 4 consisted of reactions performed under anaerobic condition and agitated by means of an ultrasonic bath fig 1 has been provided for better understanding of various experimental conditions parallel experiments conducted consisted of only alachlor solutions in the absence of nanoparticles these served as reference c0 solutions samples were withdrawn from the reaction medium at predetermined time intervals they were filtered by a syringe filter fitted with a membrane filter of pore size 0 22 μm pall corporation all the reactions were performed in triplicate for each experiment and values were averaged subsequently the concentrations of alachlor in the samples were analyzed by gas chromatography 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of the synthesized nanoparticles 3 1 1 tem and fe sem analysis the morphological properties of the formed n zvi nanoparticles were characterized by tem and fe sem analysis fig 2 and si fig 1 from the tem figure a large particle having a flower like pattern can be seen which may be a collection of many particles or a single particle inset an eye guide has been provided to see the flower like pattern one interesting observation for this type of nanoparticle is the absence of chain like dendrites as reported in other papers 46 48 it may be due to the effect of using glycerol that the shape of the nanoparticle is obtained as such whether it be a single nanoparticle or a collection of them but the size is large 130 nm this can be explained by the fact that the ability of precursor ions to react among themselves is dependent upon the movement of the ions which is largely controlled by the solvent viscosity glycerol being highly viscous solvent viscosity 1 412 pa s restricts the movement of the ferric ions and provides a passivating layer on the nanoparticles 49 with an increase in the number of the hydroxyl group the solvent polarity also increases dielectric constant of glycerol being 42 5 and the ion dipole interactions between the solvent and the precursor ions also increase which causes the formation of bigger sized aggregate 50 the fe sem images of the nanoparticles illustrate that the particles have a spherical shape joined to each other by magnetic as well as other types of interactions the particles seem to vary in their sizes but their shape is almost spherical for all 3 1 2 xrd analysis information on the crystallinity and phase purity of the as prepared nanoparticles were obtained from the x ray diffraction studies carried out at 40 kv utilizing cu kα radiation wavelength of 1 54å in the range of 20 to 70 the variation in the xrd plots of the raw and spent catalyst is shown in fig 3 it can be seen that inspite of the aerobic exposure during the process of synthesis there is a negligible presence of any iron oxide resulting from oxidation of the nanoparticles the results of the xrd of the spent catalyst shows the presence of sharp peaks of fe3o4 at 36 5 311 55 7 422 58 2 511 and 63 7 440 refer icsd card no 029129 while for the freshly made zero valent iron nanoparticles pristine peak at 44 5 011 refer icsd card no code 98 002 1567 can be seen this peak seems to be broad in nature suggesting the amorphous nature of the particles 3 1 3 ft ir spectroscopy fig 4 shows the ft ir of freshly prepared and spent n zvi treated at ph 9 ph 7 and ph 5 respectively from the plot it is visible that for n zvi particles a broad peak appears in the range of 3500 3050 cm 1and at 1626 cm 1 due to the presence of the oh group of the alcohol and water molecules adhered to the nanoparticle surface during the process of washing it may also be due to the oh stretching vibration of feooh formed due to aerobic exposure during analysis peaks at 2923 and 2856 cm 1 appear due to the ch stretching 51 a small broad peak at 600 cm 1 and a small sharp peak at 480 cm 1 occur due to the feo stretching owing to surface oxidation of the nanoparticles resulting in the formation of a coating of γ fe2o3 maghemite 52 there is also a broad peak at 1089 cm 1 whose presence is assigned to the formation of γ feooh lepidocrocite 51 no peak for glycerol appears in the spectra for fresh and treated nanoparticles suggesting that the polyhydroxy alcohol forms a protective layer on the nanoparticle surface till the time it is being filtered and washed with water and ethanol so there arises no question of it participating as a reductant to reduce alachlor as confirmed by the spectra a broad absorbance in the region of 570 590 cm 1 is noticed due to the formation of mixed iron oxides in the reaction medium which increases with the increase in the ph value 53 from the analysis it comes clear that the presence of impurities or iron oxides is very less and is mainly due to the process of pellet preparation and the phase purity of the prepared nanoparticles is further certified 3 2 degradation of alachlor primary experiments exhibited the ability of n zvi synthesized in mixed solvent medium to degrade alachlor under various experimental conditions among the preliminary degradation experiment one representative set of chromatographs has been presented in si fig 4 the chromatographic analysis showed that the intensity of alachlor reduced with time the alachlor solution of concentration 20 mg l 1 was almost degraded by n zvi within 120 min of reaction time under ambient temperature and pressure the removal of alachlor and its intermediates by the fe0 h2o system is favored by the accumulation of iron oxides formed due to corrosion of fe0 nanoparticles 54 the batch study of the degradation process was conducted as per the experimental protocol presented in fig 1 the major parameters chosen to see the effect on alachlor degradation were nanoparticle dose initial ph of the reaction and reaction time these three factors were varied for all the four experimental conditions as per fig 1 to assess the overall optimum condition of the degradation system the catalyst dose was varied from 0 4 to 1 8 g l and from 0 4 to 1 6 g l for aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively at an unchanged ph of 6 6 the reaction ph was varied from 3 to 11 for a catalyst dose of 1 g l the reactions were studied for a time span of 120 min for all the cases the reaction medium was perturbed by mechanical stirring and ultrasonic agitation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in order to find out the effect of the mode of mixing of the reactants as well as the effect of the presence or absence of dissolved oxygen many works have been conducted on alachlor degradation to increase removal efficiency for a wide variety of materials including n zvi and modified n zvi see si table 2 various complex interfacial reactions may occur simultaneously or successively on the nanoparticle surface during the alachlor degradation process thus in addition to the intrinsic properties of the nanoparticles some experimental parameters including ph dissolved oxygen do nanoparticle dosage and manner of agitation may also influence these reactions and can ultimately affect the degradation process 55 corresponding degradation parameters have been listed in si table 2 3 3 effect of nanoparticle dosage the degradation of the selected herbicide by different doses of nanoparticles under different experimental conditions has been shown in fig 5 a e the influence of nanoparticle dose at different time intervals was assessed and it has been inferred that a significant percentage of degradation can be achieved within 2 h the effect of time and nanoparticle dose has a synergistic effect on the degradation of alachlor as higher reaction time would amount to higher degradation for different doses fig 5 a d has been plotted for the four experimental conditions described earlier the nature of the degradation kinetics is similar for all four conditions the removal efficiency obtained by varying dose for 2 h of reaction time is presented in fig 5e maximum degradation was achieved under anaerobic environment when solutions were agitated by ultrasonic irradiation the degradation in the aerobic environment obtained by mechanically agitating the reaction medium was found to be lowest the degradation conducted at the highest reaction time of 2 h showed maximum removal for different doses whereas during the initial phase of the reaction the removal obtained was found to be independent of the dose variation in heterogeneous reactions three steps are simultaneously followed which include 1 diffusion of the reactant to the surface of the adsorbent from the reaction medium followed by its adsorption 2 reaction on the surface of the adsorbent and 3 desorption of the products and their diffusion into the solution the effective surface area of the adsorbent is an essential parameter to influence the reaction rate the available surface of the nanoparticles increases with increasing dose thereby increasing the number of unsaturated sites for the adsorption hence higher numbers of pesticide molecules are adsorbed onto the active sites which increase the degradation efficiency iron nanoparticles act as the reducing agent which binds the pesticide on its surface and then reduces it by cleaving the ccl bond converting it to a ch bond 56 57 3 4 effect of ph on the removal ph of a reaction medium has an important role in determining both the reaction pathway and the rate of the reaction zero valent iron having a standard reduction potential of 0 44v acts as a mild reducing agent 33 it has the potential to degrade alkyl halides rx having reduction potential in the range of 0 5 to 1 5 v at ph 7 31 according to the following reaction 3 fe 0 rx h fe 2 rh x the above equation shows the importance of the presence of h ions in the reaction medium batch experiments were conducted in the ph range of 3 11 and the degradation with respect to time at different ph has been presented in fig 6 a e under all the four experimental conditions as mentioned earlier in fig 1 the removal was maximum under anaerobic condition by ultra sonication and minimum for aerobic condition by mechanical stirring it was found that the best removal efficiency was achieved at ph 5 for all the four cases too low or too high ph values seem to have an adverse effect on the reaction rate this can be ascribed to the fact that at low ph iron corrosion accelerates and the passive oxide layers on the metallic iron surface dissolve out however lowering solution ph to high acidic condition 4 might diminish the performance of iron nanoparticles as it could cause a fast loss of iron nanoparticles through iron dissolution and or lead to an excessive accumulation of hydrogen bubbles on the nanoparticle surface which may decrease the available reactive surface area for contaminants removal while at a high ph the performance of n zvi reduce due to additional mineral precipitation which inhibits mass transfer 58 59 the ft ir analysis of the spent nanoparticles at different ph values fig 4 reveals that the peak intensity of γ fe2o3 at 570 cm 1 increases with an increase in the ph value indicating increased oxide formation at higher ph a prominent peak was noticed at 3420 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 for the spent material at ph 5 representing mainly the stretching vibration for the oh bond of γ feooh whose presence can be identified by the sharp peak at 1020 cm 1 similar peaks with lesser intensity were also identified for the spent catalyst at other ph values this indicates that the major iron species formed by degradation at ph 5 is γ feooh degradation is also confirmed by the negligible absorbance for ccl stretching from the graph approving the fission of the carbon halogen bond so it can be concluded from the above analysis that the synthesized nanoparticles are effective in degrading the pesticides 3 5 effect of reaction condition on the removal of the selected pesticide the experimental conditions have an important role in determining the degradation pathway as well as the reaction rate of the reaction the batch degradation study with the variation in dose and ph for various experimental conditions have been shown in figs 5d and 6d respectively it can be seen that ultrasonication is the more efficient method for agitation providing higher removal efficiency the efficiency of ultrasonication lies in the cavitation which initiates with the nucleation of a bubble due to the decrease in the pressure of the liquid being reduced below the vapor pressure of the liquid at the current temperature the bubbles grow and implode resulting in very high pressures and temperatures which provide the activation energy required for the bond cleavage 60 64 as mentioned previously ultrasonication in aqueous medium generate oh radicals but these reactive oxygenated species does not help to break the alachlor molecules much as can be seen from si fig 6 another reason that ultrasonication enhances the speed of the reaction is the iron oxide layers and other debris are removed from the metal surface hence allowing an increment in the number of active sites 55 due to ultarsonication the water molecules split in to h and oh radicals and in presenec of ferrous ion this rection may enhance the influence of presence and absence of the dissolved oxygen in the reaction medium is represented in figs 5e and 6e under anaerobic conditions the removal efficiency is higher as compared to the removal efficiency under aerobic conditions this can be attributed to the fact that dissolved oxygen present in the reaction medium is the competing oxidant which leads to the dissolution of metallic iron and the formation of ferrous ions these may affect the reduction process while themselves getting converted to ferric oxides hydroxides which precipitate on the iron surface thereby constraining further iron dissolution and also increase the ph of the medium 31 this leads to the lesser availability of active sites for contaminant binding and reduction process to take place 4 o2 2h2o fe 0 fe 2 4oh whereas under anaerobic conditions the main oxidant is water leading to the lesser release of hydroxyl ions which decelerates the formation and precipitation of iron hydroxides on the zero valent iron surface 5 fe 0 h2o fe 2 h2 oh 4 conclusion in the present study the effect of solvent viscosity on the structural modification of the nanoparticles and their ability towards alachlor degradation under various experimental conditions has been assessed x ray diffraction study of the as synthesized material revealed the presence of a minimal amount of oxide impurity attributed to the surface exposure at the time of characterization the data obtained from the ft ir studies support the above point further though the viscosity of the solvent helps to maintain phase purity the size of the nanoparticles becomes larger with reduced magnetic interactions as confirmed by the fe sem and tem analysis the distinct flower like pattern and well dispersed nature when synthesized in glycerol is an added feature besides the increased oxidative stability bet analysis shows that the nanoparticles have high effective surface area these nanoparticles have a good potential towards pesticide degradation due to their oxidative stability batch studies showed rapid degradation of alachlor within two hours of reaction time these results support that the experimental conditions strongly influence the rate of alachlor degradation the effect of the nanoparticle dose and ph value on the degrading ability of the nanoparticles has been clearly demonstrated

14521,the present study investigates the effect of a viscous and a non viscous solvent mixture on the shape of the nanoparticles synthesized in it and applies them for the degradation of an herbicide alachlor here we have used glycerol water mixed solvent to synthesize zero valent iron nanoparticles under aerobic condition and tested its reductive ability the microstructural analysis reveals the presence of single flower like pattern formed from petal like structures clustered at the center while the xrd analysis points out to the presence of single phase particles having negligible oxide impurities this refers to the excellent sheathing ability of the viscous solvent during the growth of the nanoparticles different experimental conditions and parameters were involved to check the efficiency of the nanoparticles towards alachlor degradation within 2 h almost 90 of alachlor was degraded when the reaction was carried out by ultrasonic agitation under anaerobic condition the ph variational studies suggested an optimum value of ph 5 at which the highest removal was achieved results also emphasized that anaerobic conditions during the reaction lead to higher removal efficacy hence the results predict that nanoscale zero valent synthesized in glycerol medium is a prospective applicant to pesticide remediation keywords nanoscale zero valent irom solvent viscocity glycerol aerobically stable n zvi alachlor degradation gas chromatography 1 introduction a wide category of pesticides are used by the agricultural sector to protect valuable crops from the attack of pests by abolishing suppressing or changing their life cycle 1 herbicides being used to control the growth of small plants and weeds alachlor 2 chloro n 2 6 diethylphenyl n methoxymethylacetamide is an herbicide belonging to the chloroacetanilide family which is used extensively as a pre emergent agent to control annual grasses and broad leaved weeds especially for maize cotton brassicas sugarcane etc 2 3 the use of pesticide is beneficial for agricultural purpose but it negatively impacts the human beings and other living organisms by disturbing their life processes 4 they generally affect the human beings by two routes either by direct exposure or by indirect exposure farmers along with the people exposed to eating pesticide contaminated food or inhale pesticide contaminated air at risk of direct exposure 5 application of pesticides to crops leads to their residue being left on the fields which percolate down ultimately ending up in groundwater 6 people drinking such contaminated groundwater are at risk of indirect exposure 4 the level of contamination of the groundwater depends on the solubility of the compound in water alachlor is highly soluble in water 242 mg l at 25 c although it may dissipate from the soil through volatilization photodegradation and biodegradation it has a half life of 7 38 days in the soil 7 the degradation pathway of alachlor depicts the formation of some intermediates which are very reactive to the humic substances in the soil causing bio accumulation 8 alachlor molecule contains an aniline moiety attached to a carbonyl group having an allylic chlorine group 9 it is a b2 carcinogen and its intermediate products such as 2 6 diethylphenyl methoxymethyl amino oxoacetic acid i e oxanilic acid and 2 2 6 diethylphenyl methoxy methylamino 2 oxoethanesulfonic acid i e sulfonic acid are more polar than alachlor and are all potent carcinogens 10 12 though alachlor has relatively low acute toxicity repeated exposure has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity degeneration and tumor formation in some animals 13 the probable oral lethal dose in humans is 0 5 5 g kg of the body weight 12 several techniques have been instigated to degrade alachlor to less toxic species and to restrict its entry to drinking water sources which include membrane filtration 14 photocatalysis 15 16 adsorption 17 19 advanced oxidation 20 21 etc several heterogeneous and photocatalysts used by different researchers for the degradation of alachlor such as bismuth vanadate titanium oxide anodic and photo fenton s reagent etc have shown promising outcome 15 22 24 among the various methods of degradation the method which has caught our attention is the use of zero valent iron nanoparticles n zvi as a reductant and an adsorbent of the reduced product s from the reaction medium different organic compounds including pesticides have been degraded by the action of n zvi particles but very limited studies have been performed on the degradation of alachlor 23 25 26 the major advantages of using n zvi for contaminant degradation include high availability of raw material source relative nontoxicity of the ferrous and ferric ions released as a result of the reduction of zero valent iron and kinetically fast reactions 27 furthermore the minuscule size of n zvi allow them to easily pass through aqueous layers and promote the surface reactions to take place due to their high available surface area 28 29 bezbaruah et al synthesized n zvi having sizes 90 nm and used them to degrade solutions of alachlor and atrazine 30 their results showed 92 96 degradation of alachlor within 72 h of reaction time n zvi particles degrade halogenated pesticides by adsorbing them on its surface then it ruptures the carbon halogen bond thereby reducing them according to eq 2 and thus converts the pesticides into harmless organics 31 meanwhile due to reduction the zero valent iron eq 1 is converted to ferrous ions and finally to ferric oxides and hydroxides fe2o3 feooh fe3o4 etc which again adsorb the organics produced in the medium due to dechlorination on their surface providing complete removal from aqueous media 32 1 fe 0 fe 2 2e 2 r cl 2e h r h cl there are several methods which are already established for the synthesis of nanoparticles based on the preferred characteristics morphology properties applications etc 33 but in the case of synthesis of n zvi the major challenge which is faced with its usage and handling is the chances of it getting oxidized during filtration storage and application the agglomeration of these nanoparticles is another problem which occurs due to their intensive magnetic nature in this context the preferred technique is to prepare and preserve the pristine n zvi under inert conditions and perform the degradation studies under anoxic condition but the application of the degradation study under such conditions will incur additional expenditure in order to reduce this additional expenditure we have tried to synthesize the n zvi particles in a mixed solvent medium which includes a viscous solvent glycerol and water a viscous medium will sheath the nanoparticles during the time of synthesis which would reduce the intensity of the nanoparticles to get oxidized and would also reduce agglomeration to some extent till date limited work has been performed on the preparation of n zvi in viscous solvents 34 38 and the effect on the morphological evolution of the particles due to such solvents has also not been studied much which is a clear gap in this field in recent years the method of ultrasonication which involves the use of high frequency sound waves to agitate a recation medium 39 41 has gained a lot of importance the sound waves helps to disintegrate the agglomerated nanoparticles and hence the effective surface area of the nanoparticles increase thereby leading to an increase in the rate of the reaction previous researchers have also used this method to accelerate many reactions 42 ultrasonication along with the use of n zvi is regarded as a green technology as it does not generate secondary pollutants and is carried out in the absence of chemical agents 41 the amount of the dissolved oxygen present in the reaction medium also plays a key role as iron in its zero valent state is corroded very quickly by aerobic or dissolved oxygen 43 also when any reaction medium is ultrasonicated the water present in the medium is broken down to hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl radicals while dissolved oxygen is transformed into atomic oxygen due to the generation of the intense heat in the medium 44 hence we have studied the effect of the presence and absence of dissolved oxygen in the reaction medium on reaction efficiency of the nanoparticles in our present work we have synthesized n zvi in the presence of a viscous and a non viscous solvent mixture and studied the ability of the as synthesized nanoparticles to successfully degrade alachlor which has not yet been carried out by other research groups the effect of the morphological variation of the nanoparticles due to synthesis in a viscous solvent has been employed here to degrade alachlor solutions under different experimental conditions which include variation in the presence and absence of dissolved oxygen in the reaction medium mode of mixing the reactants ph etc and we have shown that synthesis of nanoscale zero valent iron in glycerol water medium enhances the shelf life of n zvi and reduces its oxidative ability 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals required alachlor c14h20no2cl 99 90 pure hplc grade was bought from sigma aldrich different properties of alachlor have been summarized in si table 1 anhydrous ferric chloride fecl3 96 sodium borohydride nabh4 98 ethanol c2h5oh 99 99 glycerol 99 9 acs grade and hexane hplc grade were bought from merck india sodium hydroxide naoh 95 and hydrochloric acid hcl 37 emsure required for adjusting the ph of the reactions were also bought from merck india stock solutions of alachlor were prepared by dissolving the required weight of it in deionized water deionized millipore milli q water was used to prepare all the experimental solutions all the chemicals were used as received without further purification 2 2 synthesis of the nanoparticles n zvi was prepared by modifying the wet synthesis method 35 45 46 briefly a solution of ferric chloride of total volume 100 ml was prepared by dissolving 0 73 g of anhydrous ferric chloride in a mixture of glycerol and water in the ratio of 3 2 this solution was taken in a 500 ml conical flask and was stirred by employing a mechanical stirrer at a speed of 500 rpm approx to this already agitated precursor solution 250 ml solution of sodium borohydride having a strength of 0 25 m was added drop wise which caused the appearance of black colored particles the reaction was complete when the total solution turned black due to the formation of zero valent iron nanoparticles sodium borohydride solution was added in excess to ensure the entire iron to persist in pure metallic phase this was also done to ensure complete reduction as h2 gas is generated as a by product of the medium which increases the reducing character of the medium 47 after the reaction was over the synthesized nanoparticles were filtered dried under vacuum conditions and stored in glass vials which were flushed with nitrogen to generate an inert atmosphere the vials were stored under vacuum conditions till further usage it is worth mentioning here that the synthesis was performed in the absence of any inert gas medium 2 3 particle characterization the synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by x ray diffraction analysis panalytical x pert pro xrd unit to acquire knowledge on their crystallinity and crystal phase purity the x ray diffraction analysis was carried out at an operating voltage of 40 kv utilizing cu kα radiation wavelength of 1 54å in the scan range of 20 to 70 the morphology of the particles was determined by fe sem zeiss sigma analysis while their size was shown by tem tecnai tf20g2st images operating at a voltage of 200 kv the elemental composition of the particles was carried out by edax analysis of the nanoparticles which was attached with the fe sem instrument specific surface area of the synthesized particles was analyzed by performing bet measurements by n2 gas adsorption using micromeritics asap 2020 surface analyzer at a 77 k ft ir analysis was done by nicolet is10 thermo ft ir spectrometer ranging from 4000 cm 1 to 400 cm 1 2 4 batch experimental studies alachlor removal studies were performed in batches under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in 250 ml conical flasks fitted with silicone septum seal 100 ml aqueous solutions of alachlor having a strength of 20 mg l were added to the flasks for the conduction of experiments under anaerobic conditions the reaction vessels containing the pesticide solutions were pre purged with n2 gas for about 30 min prior to the initiation of the reaction ph of the reaction medium was kept unchanged and was not varied until the reactions involving ph were carried out the reaction medium was perturbed by two means mechanical stirring and ultrasonication for the mechanical stirring purpose sealed reaction vessels were rotated end over end by a custom made mechanical stirrer at 450 rpm at room temperature similar experiments were performed employing an ultrasonic bath of 1 5 l capacity 50w 230v 50hz the experimental conditions can be broadly categorized into four groups group 1 consisted of reactions which were performed under aerobic condition by mechanical stirring group 2 was performed under aerobic condition in an ultrasonic bath reactions under group 3 were performed by mechanical stirring under anaerobic conditions and group 4 consisted of reactions performed under anaerobic condition and agitated by means of an ultrasonic bath fig 1 has been provided for better understanding of various experimental conditions parallel experiments conducted consisted of only alachlor solutions in the absence of nanoparticles these served as reference c0 solutions samples were withdrawn from the reaction medium at predetermined time intervals they were filtered by a syringe filter fitted with a membrane filter of pore size 0 22 μm pall corporation all the reactions were performed in triplicate for each experiment and values were averaged subsequently the concentrations of alachlor in the samples were analyzed by gas chromatography 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of the synthesized nanoparticles 3 1 1 tem and fe sem analysis the morphological properties of the formed n zvi nanoparticles were characterized by tem and fe sem analysis fig 2 and si fig 1 from the tem figure a large particle having a flower like pattern can be seen which may be a collection of many particles or a single particle inset an eye guide has been provided to see the flower like pattern one interesting observation for this type of nanoparticle is the absence of chain like dendrites as reported in other papers 46 48 it may be due to the effect of using glycerol that the shape of the nanoparticle is obtained as such whether it be a single nanoparticle or a collection of them but the size is large 130 nm this can be explained by the fact that the ability of precursor ions to react among themselves is dependent upon the movement of the ions which is largely controlled by the solvent viscosity glycerol being highly viscous solvent viscosity 1 412 pa s restricts the movement of the ferric ions and provides a passivating layer on the nanoparticles 49 with an increase in the number of the hydroxyl group the solvent polarity also increases dielectric constant of glycerol being 42 5 and the ion dipole interactions between the solvent and the precursor ions also increase which causes the formation of bigger sized aggregate 50 the fe sem images of the nanoparticles illustrate that the particles have a spherical shape joined to each other by magnetic as well as other types of interactions the particles seem to vary in their sizes but their shape is almost spherical for all 3 1 2 xrd analysis information on the crystallinity and phase purity of the as prepared nanoparticles were obtained from the x ray diffraction studies carried out at 40 kv utilizing cu kα radiation wavelength of 1 54å in the range of 20 to 70 the variation in the xrd plots of the raw and spent catalyst is shown in fig 3 it can be seen that inspite of the aerobic exposure during the process of synthesis there is a negligible presence of any iron oxide resulting from oxidation of the nanoparticles the results of the xrd of the spent catalyst shows the presence of sharp peaks of fe3o4 at 36 5 311 55 7 422 58 2 511 and 63 7 440 refer icsd card no 029129 while for the freshly made zero valent iron nanoparticles pristine peak at 44 5 011 refer icsd card no code 98 002 1567 can be seen this peak seems to be broad in nature suggesting the amorphous nature of the particles 3 1 3 ft ir spectroscopy fig 4 shows the ft ir of freshly prepared and spent n zvi treated at ph 9 ph 7 and ph 5 respectively from the plot it is visible that for n zvi particles a broad peak appears in the range of 3500 3050 cm 1and at 1626 cm 1 due to the presence of the oh group of the alcohol and water molecules adhered to the nanoparticle surface during the process of washing it may also be due to the oh stretching vibration of feooh formed due to aerobic exposure during analysis peaks at 2923 and 2856 cm 1 appear due to the ch stretching 51 a small broad peak at 600 cm 1 and a small sharp peak at 480 cm 1 occur due to the feo stretching owing to surface oxidation of the nanoparticles resulting in the formation of a coating of γ fe2o3 maghemite 52 there is also a broad peak at 1089 cm 1 whose presence is assigned to the formation of γ feooh lepidocrocite 51 no peak for glycerol appears in the spectra for fresh and treated nanoparticles suggesting that the polyhydroxy alcohol forms a protective layer on the nanoparticle surface till the time it is being filtered and washed with water and ethanol so there arises no question of it participating as a reductant to reduce alachlor as confirmed by the spectra a broad absorbance in the region of 570 590 cm 1 is noticed due to the formation of mixed iron oxides in the reaction medium which increases with the increase in the ph value 53 from the analysis it comes clear that the presence of impurities or iron oxides is very less and is mainly due to the process of pellet preparation and the phase purity of the prepared nanoparticles is further certified 3 2 degradation of alachlor primary experiments exhibited the ability of n zvi synthesized in mixed solvent medium to degrade alachlor under various experimental conditions among the preliminary degradation experiment one representative set of chromatographs has been presented in si fig 4 the chromatographic analysis showed that the intensity of alachlor reduced with time the alachlor solution of concentration 20 mg l 1 was almost degraded by n zvi within 120 min of reaction time under ambient temperature and pressure the removal of alachlor and its intermediates by the fe0 h2o system is favored by the accumulation of iron oxides formed due to corrosion of fe0 nanoparticles 54 the batch study of the degradation process was conducted as per the experimental protocol presented in fig 1 the major parameters chosen to see the effect on alachlor degradation were nanoparticle dose initial ph of the reaction and reaction time these three factors were varied for all the four experimental conditions as per fig 1 to assess the overall optimum condition of the degradation system the catalyst dose was varied from 0 4 to 1 8 g l and from 0 4 to 1 6 g l for aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively at an unchanged ph of 6 6 the reaction ph was varied from 3 to 11 for a catalyst dose of 1 g l the reactions were studied for a time span of 120 min for all the cases the reaction medium was perturbed by mechanical stirring and ultrasonic agitation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in order to find out the effect of the mode of mixing of the reactants as well as the effect of the presence or absence of dissolved oxygen many works have been conducted on alachlor degradation to increase removal efficiency for a wide variety of materials including n zvi and modified n zvi see si table 2 various complex interfacial reactions may occur simultaneously or successively on the nanoparticle surface during the alachlor degradation process thus in addition to the intrinsic properties of the nanoparticles some experimental parameters including ph dissolved oxygen do nanoparticle dosage and manner of agitation may also influence these reactions and can ultimately affect the degradation process 55 corresponding degradation parameters have been listed in si table 2 3 3 effect of nanoparticle dosage the degradation of the selected herbicide by different doses of nanoparticles under different experimental conditions has been shown in fig 5 a e the influence of nanoparticle dose at different time intervals was assessed and it has been inferred that a significant percentage of degradation can be achieved within 2 h the effect of time and nanoparticle dose has a synergistic effect on the degradation of alachlor as higher reaction time would amount to higher degradation for different doses fig 5 a d has been plotted for the four experimental conditions described earlier the nature of the degradation kinetics is similar for all four conditions the removal efficiency obtained by varying dose for 2 h of reaction time is presented in fig 5e maximum degradation was achieved under anaerobic environment when solutions were agitated by ultrasonic irradiation the degradation in the aerobic environment obtained by mechanically agitating the reaction medium was found to be lowest the degradation conducted at the highest reaction time of 2 h showed maximum removal for different doses whereas during the initial phase of the reaction the removal obtained was found to be independent of the dose variation in heterogeneous reactions three steps are simultaneously followed which include 1 diffusion of the reactant to the surface of the adsorbent from the reaction medium followed by its adsorption 2 reaction on the surface of the adsorbent and 3 desorption of the products and their diffusion into the solution the effective surface area of the adsorbent is an essential parameter to influence the reaction rate the available surface of the nanoparticles increases with increasing dose thereby increasing the number of unsaturated sites for the adsorption hence higher numbers of pesticide molecules are adsorbed onto the active sites which increase the degradation efficiency iron nanoparticles act as the reducing agent which binds the pesticide on its surface and then reduces it by cleaving the ccl bond converting it to a ch bond 56 57 3 4 effect of ph on the removal ph of a reaction medium has an important role in determining both the reaction pathway and the rate of the reaction zero valent iron having a standard reduction potential of 0 44v acts as a mild reducing agent 33 it has the potential to degrade alkyl halides rx having reduction potential in the range of 0 5 to 1 5 v at ph 7 31 according to the following reaction 3 fe 0 rx h fe 2 rh x the above equation shows the importance of the presence of h ions in the reaction medium batch experiments were conducted in the ph range of 3 11 and the degradation with respect to time at different ph has been presented in fig 6 a e under all the four experimental conditions as mentioned earlier in fig 1 the removal was maximum under anaerobic condition by ultra sonication and minimum for aerobic condition by mechanical stirring it was found that the best removal efficiency was achieved at ph 5 for all the four cases too low or too high ph values seem to have an adverse effect on the reaction rate this can be ascribed to the fact that at low ph iron corrosion accelerates and the passive oxide layers on the metallic iron surface dissolve out however lowering solution ph to high acidic condition 4 might diminish the performance of iron nanoparticles as it could cause a fast loss of iron nanoparticles through iron dissolution and or lead to an excessive accumulation of hydrogen bubbles on the nanoparticle surface which may decrease the available reactive surface area for contaminants removal while at a high ph the performance of n zvi reduce due to additional mineral precipitation which inhibits mass transfer 58 59 the ft ir analysis of the spent nanoparticles at different ph values fig 4 reveals that the peak intensity of γ fe2o3 at 570 cm 1 increases with an increase in the ph value indicating increased oxide formation at higher ph a prominent peak was noticed at 3420 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 for the spent material at ph 5 representing mainly the stretching vibration for the oh bond of γ feooh whose presence can be identified by the sharp peak at 1020 cm 1 similar peaks with lesser intensity were also identified for the spent catalyst at other ph values this indicates that the major iron species formed by degradation at ph 5 is γ feooh degradation is also confirmed by the negligible absorbance for ccl stretching from the graph approving the fission of the carbon halogen bond so it can be concluded from the above analysis that the synthesized nanoparticles are effective in degrading the pesticides 3 5 effect of reaction condition on the removal of the selected pesticide the experimental conditions have an important role in determining the degradation pathway as well as the reaction rate of the reaction the batch degradation study with the variation in dose and ph for various experimental conditions have been shown in figs 5d and 6d respectively it can be seen that ultrasonication is the more efficient method for agitation providing higher removal efficiency the efficiency of ultrasonication lies in the cavitation which initiates with the nucleation of a bubble due to the decrease in the pressure of the liquid being reduced below the vapor pressure of the liquid at the current temperature the bubbles grow and implode resulting in very high pressures and temperatures which provide the activation energy required for the bond cleavage 60 64 as mentioned previously ultrasonication in aqueous medium generate oh radicals but these reactive oxygenated species does not help to break the alachlor molecules much as can be seen from si fig 6 another reason that ultrasonication enhances the speed of the reaction is the iron oxide layers and other debris are removed from the metal surface hence allowing an increment in the number of active sites 55 due to ultarsonication the water molecules split in to h and oh radicals and in presenec of ferrous ion this rection may enhance the influence of presence and absence of the dissolved oxygen in the reaction medium is represented in figs 5e and 6e under anaerobic conditions the removal efficiency is higher as compared to the removal efficiency under aerobic conditions this can be attributed to the fact that dissolved oxygen present in the reaction medium is the competing oxidant which leads to the dissolution of metallic iron and the formation of ferrous ions these may affect the reduction process while themselves getting converted to ferric oxides hydroxides which precipitate on the iron surface thereby constraining further iron dissolution and also increase the ph of the medium 31 this leads to the lesser availability of active sites for contaminant binding and reduction process to take place 4 o2 2h2o fe 0 fe 2 4oh whereas under anaerobic conditions the main oxidant is water leading to the lesser release of hydroxyl ions which decelerates the formation and precipitation of iron hydroxides on the zero valent iron surface 5 fe 0 h2o fe 2 h2 oh 4 conclusion in the present study the effect of solvent viscosity on the structural modification of the nanoparticles and their ability towards alachlor degradation under various experimental conditions has been assessed x ray diffraction study of the as synthesized material revealed the presence of a minimal amount of oxide impurity attributed to the surface exposure at the time of characterization the data obtained from the ft ir studies support the above point further though the viscosity of the solvent helps to maintain phase purity the size of the nanoparticles becomes larger with reduced magnetic interactions as confirmed by the fe sem and tem analysis the distinct flower like pattern and well dispersed nature when synthesized in glycerol is an added feature besides the increased oxidative stability bet analysis shows that the nanoparticles have high effective surface area these nanoparticles have a good potential towards pesticide degradation due to their oxidative stability batch studies showed rapid degradation of alachlor within two hours of reaction time these results support that the experimental conditions strongly influence the rate of alachlor degradation the effect of the nanoparticle dose and ph value on the degrading ability of the nanoparticles has been clearly demonstrated nanoparticle dose of 1 0 g l 1 at ph 5 successfully degraded alachlor molecules up to 90 within 120 min of reaction time under anaerobic condition by ultrasonic irradiation the second order rate equation seemed to best fit to the experimental data the rate constant k2 for alachlor degradation was calculated to be 0 0028 l mol 1 min 1 with a linear regression value of 0 9587 this study illuminates how the properties of a solvent could work on shaping nanoparticle morphology and thus affect the development of properties of the as prepared nanoparticles in degrading environmental

14522,the aim of this work was to compare the performance of tannin and polyaluminium chloride pac in the coagulation process for dairy industry wastewater the conditions of coagulation flocculation with regards to the dosage ph velocity gradient and slow mixing time were optimized and some parameters such as floc aggregation ka and breakage kb coefficients were computed additionally it was carried out a thermogravimetric analysis of the obtained sludge for both coagulants the results showed no statistical differences between the performance of the two coagulants based on chemical oxygen demand colour turbidity and total solids removal particularly the pac showed higher alkalinity consumption and increased the electrical conductivity of the clarified wastewater while tannin showed good performance within a wider ph ranging from 5 0 to 10 0 moreover although the greatest ka values were observed for pac usage the tannin use presented higher resistance to floc breakage during the slow mixing time the obtained sludge from the experiments using tannin accounted for higher volatile solids and fixed carbon and lower ash content when compared to pac in conclusion tannin is a promising alternative for dairy wastewater treatment regarding its process performance and wastewater treatment residuals management keywords dairy wastewater coagulation flocculation tannin pac 1 introduction coagulation is an essential process for surface water and industrial wastewater treatment 1 it consists in a well known process involving destabilization of colloids and other suspended substances so as to promote its aggregation as greater and weightier flocs 2 3 typically inorganic coagulants derived from iron and aluminium salts as al2 so4 3 fecl3 and polyaluminium chloride pac are employed in the coagulation processes 1 2 among these the pre hydrolyzed ones like pac present some advantages over the non hydrolyzed such as lower alkalinity consumption and the generation of a smaller sludge amounts 4 5 alternatively to those inorganic metal based coagulants researchers have been looking for new and natural plant based coagulants which have shown some advantages like the production of biodegradable sludge lower alkalinity consumption and renewable sources origin 1 on this way tannin based coagulant has been being an effective coagulant in the treatment of numerous types of water and wastewater presenting comparable or better performance than inorganic coagulants 6 9 the tannins are macromolecular polyphenols extracted from different vegetable sources such as schinopsis balansae engler castanea sativa miller and acacia mearnsii de wildemann due to the several natural sources extraction tannin chemical structures are diverse described as complex therefore it is still a challenge to determine exactly the chemical structure of tannins 9 nevertheless tannin is present in some plant barks and its presence is related to antimicrobial properties and thermal protection 10 when naturally obtained the vegetable tannin does not present cationic features which is provided after a cationization procedure involving the mannich reaction in this process a quaternary nitrogen is added to tannin polyphenolic structure through a reaction with an aldehyde and an amine producing a higher molecular weight compound 2 even though the cationization which is essential for its application as a coagulant the tannin preserves some original plant extract features like the water solubility moreover tannin has an ampholytic behaviour caused by the presence of quaternary nitrogen and phenolic hydroxyls 9 when tannin is extracted from acacia mearnsii the main monomeric units are gallocatechin and robinetinidol but sometimes there are also catechin and fisetinidol units additionally tannin from acacia mearnsii is condensed tannin 11 these condensed tannins are polymers of flavonol units linked each other by carbon carbon bonds differently from hydrolysable tannins which presents polyester linkage among gallic or ellagic acids in structure 12 the cationized tannin coagulant polymeric chain from acacia mearnsii de wildemann traded by tanac company used in this work has approximately 600 000 g mol 1 and 1000 to 2000 repeating of monomeric units which means a moderate to high molecular weight 6 dairy effluent has a variable composition consisted of high biochemical oxygen demand 1400 to 3383 mgo2 l 1 and high concentrations of suspended solids 28 to 80 000 mg l 1 and pac is constantly applied for the coagulation process 13 in addition the concern on disposal of generated sludge from the coagulation flocculation process has motivated the industry to find a way in managing those sludge appropriately 14 although the application of tannin and pac in water and wastewater treatment is deeply reported to date there are no published studies which have evaluated the use of tannin for dairy wastewater treatment in this context the performance of a tannin based coagulant and pac for treating a real dairy wastewater were comparatively evaluated 2 material and methods 2 1 samples collection storage and preservation raw effluent samples were collected directly from the equalization tank in a real dairy industry described in a previous study 15 collections were performed once a week at alternate days and times aiming to cover possible variances in raw wastewater features after the collection samples were stored in high density polyethene bottles at maximum temperatures of 4 c before been analyzed 2 2 evaluation of coagulants dosage effects the coagulant solutions used for performing the experiments were prepared by diluting commercial pac buschle lepper 18 w w concentration and a tannin based coagulant extracted from acacia mearnsii tanac 25 w w concentration the concentrations of commercial solutions were provided by the manufacturers the evaluation of dosage effects in coagulation and flocculation performances was performed by the application of six different dosages for both pac and tannin based coagulants the dosages were 100 200 300 400 500 and 600 mg l 1 in aliquots of 1 5 l of raw effluent the mixing parameters used in jar test were as follow 90 s at 120 rpm for the rapid mixing 30 min at 45 rpm for slow mixing and 60 min for settling after the coagulant addition ph was adjusted to 6 0 7 0 by adding naoh or hcl solutions all the experiments were carried out at room temperature as soon as the cycle was accomplished samples were collected from the upper clarified effluent for analyzing the following parameters chemical oxygen demand cod colour turbidity total solids ts alkalinity and electrical conductivity the experiments were performed in four replicates to assess the colour and turbidity removal alkalinity consumption and effect in wastewater electrical conductivity for cod and ts removal experiments the tests were carried out in triplicate for the colour turbidity cod and ts removal investigation the experimental design followed a 2 6 factorial experiment consisted by one factor with two levels type of coagulant and another with six levels concentration of coagulant when it comes to the alkalinity consumption and the effect in the wastewater electrical conductivity a linear regression analysis was fitted aiming to observe the trends associated with the coagulant dosage 2 3 effects and optimization of ph in order to assess the ph influence in the coagulation flocculation process the coagulant concentration was fixed this concentration was applied to aliquots of 1 5 l of raw effluent with different ph from 4 0 to 10 0 adjusted by the addition of naoh or hcl solutions the coagulation flocculation performance was expressed in terms of the percentage of colour and turbidity removal the experimental design followed a 2 7 factorial with two levels according to the nature of the coagulant and seven level for the ph the experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 flocculation kinetic once determined the optimal values for concentration and ph for coagulation flocculation process it was studied the best conditions for the velocity gradient and flocculation time firstly it was evaluated the behaviour of flocculation performance for each coagulant over time under different velocity gradients the aggregation ka and breakage kb coefficients obtained from the experimental data were also calculated the study of flocculation kinetic was carried out by monitoring the turbidity removal as a function of slow mixing time under six different velocity gradients as follows 25 40 55 70 85 and 100 s 1 velocity gradients were adjusted based on a calibration curve provided by the jar test manufacturer this curve shows a relationship between the frequency of the stirrer and the respective velocity gradient after sedimentation time 2 h it was measured the residual turbidity the data obtained for each velocity gradient was plotted in an n n0 versus slow mixing time graphic and to each velocity gradient it was fitted curves using the software origin 8 16 aggregation and breakage coefficients were calculated based on the following kinetic equation for flocculation eq 1 1 dn dt k a ng k b n 0 g 2 where n0 initial concentration of primary particles in wastewater m 3 n remaining concentration of primary particles after sedimentation at a gift slow mixture time m 3 ka aggregation coefficient dimensionless kb breakage coefficient s g velocity gradient the concentration of primary particles can be related to wastewater turbidity for this reason it was used this parameter in the calculus to obtain the aggregation and breakage coefficients using a classical approach the integration of eq 1 to initial time 0 and final time of slow mixing t and considering n0 initial turbidity and n final turbidity after sedimentation time for a specific velocity gradient leads to eq 2 2 n 0 n k b k a g 1 k b k a g x e k a gt 1 where t time of slow mixture for that slow mixing time which has presented the best efficiency in the turbidity removal we applied the relation represented in the eq 3 this relation considers that at the point where the tangent to the curve becomes horizontal it is achieved an equilibrium condition it is equivalent to match dn dt eq 1 to zero 3 k b k a 1 g n 0 n once calculated the values for the relation showed in eq 3 the rearrangement of eq 2 can provide the value of ka just as shown in eq 4 therefore taking successive points along the fitted curves for each velocity gradient specifically at the times in which we collected the aliquots during slow mixture time we could calculate mean ka for each single velocity gradient and coagulant 4 k a 1 g t ln 1 k b k a g n n 0 k b k a g all the tests for the obtention of kinetics parameters were done in triplicate 2 5 sludges characterization the samples for the thermogravimetric analysis were obtained from the settled sludge in the jar tests after reached the settling time after the sampling they were dried at room temperature and then powdered to a 60 μm maximum size for the analysis the weight varied from 0 79 to 2 23 g the pyrolysis was performed in duplicate with a heating rate of 15 k min 1 from room temperature to 1173 k under continuous nitrogen flow at a rate of 2 l min 1 2 6 methodological procedures the analysis were conducted according to standard methods for examination of water and wastewater 22nd edition 17 color mg pt co and turbidity ntu were measured in a spectroquant nova 60 merck photometer while cod mgo2 l 1 was analysed in a pharo 300 merck photometer the ph and electrical conductivity measurements were done using a bench multiparameter analyzer thermo scientific the alkalinity was analyzed by titrimetric method the anova was performed at a significance level of 5 using the software assistat 7 7 campina grande federal university brazil and originpro 8 0 originlab corporation means were compared using the tukey s test at a significance level of 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 raw effluent characterization for this work the following parameters cod colour turbidity electrical conductivity alkalinity and ts were evaluated table 1 shows a characterization of raw wastewater based on these cited parameters a wide dispersion in the results for the evaluated parameters was evaluated which is evidenced by the variation coefficients all of them over 20 in fact several authors have pointed high variations in dairy wastewater composition mainly due to the manufacturing of different final dairy products and the different technologic methods employed to this manufacturing 13 18 19 also it was reported seasonal diurnal and hourly variations in amounts of wastewater production and its compositions 19 furthermore pollutants present in effluent and its concentrations can change during the day due to the manufacturing of different products by changing manufacturing methods or alternating cleaning processes to occur simultaneously or at different times in different sectors of the plant the wastewater used to develop this study came from a factory which manufactures mainly cheese but also produces cottage cheese butter milk cream and creamy cheese so there is a lot of different combinations of raw effluent that can be generated by mixing effluent from diverse sectors additionally to the high variations in its composition and generation flow rates the dairy industry plants are responsible for high water use depending on the kind of manufactured dairy product the wastewater generation varies from 0 2 to 10 l of effluent per each litre of processed milk 13 3 2 dosage effects in coagulation flocculation performance 3 2 1 colour turbidity cod and ts removal the obtained results for colour turbidity cod and ts removal are shown in fig 1 the tannin has shown a better performance when compared to pac regarding colour removal at low concentrations the decreasing in the colour was 48 1 68 5 and 73 6 respectively at 100 200 and 300 mg l for the same doses pac could remove 24 5 59 2 and 67 7 additionally considering the high dosages 400 500 and 600 mg l the use of pac decreased 77 4 81 4 and 82 1 of colour respectively and for tannin the removals were 76 2 77 1 and 78 5 the application of tannin did not provide a significant improvement in the colour removal at dosages above 300 mg l whereas pac did not so above 400 mg l junior et al 20 also observed better performance for tannin at lower concentrations when compared to the aluminium based coagulant al2 so4 3 treating textile industry wastewater for colour removal fig 1 also shows results for the turbidity removal compared with the colour removal the use of tannin was responsible for a better performance at lower concentrations reaching the removals of 72 2 86 6 and 89 4 of turbidity at 100 200 and 300 mg l respectively pac provided removals of turbidity of 49 2 74 6 and 81 8 at these same dosages for the dosages above 400 mg l both studied coagulants presented similar results on one hand tannin did not present a significant improvement in its performance above 200 mg l and on the other hand pac did not increase the turbidity removal above 400 mg l once more the data obtained for pac accounted for higher dispersion a maximum standard deviation of 40 3 at 200 mg l when compared to tannin a maximum standard deviation of 12 7 at 100 mg l some studies have also shown the better performance for tannin based coagulants in color and turbidity removal when treating diverse kinds of water bodies such as surface water 7 21 municipal wastewater 7 9 and industrial effluents such as textile industry 7 20 and treatment of vinasse from ethanol production 8 in these studies tannin has frequently achieved a better performance when compared to inorganic coagulants the main effect of factor coagulant was not significant as well as the effect of interaction between factors coagulant and dosage p 0 05 table 2 however the main effect of factor dosage was significant p 0 05 both for colour and turbidity removal table 2 in relation to the cod removal a better performance for tannin at the lowest concentration 100 ppm was observed however for all the other concentrations pac was more efficient moreover the cod decreasing using pac raised to 500 mg l reaching a removal of 51 0 the peak of cod removal associated with tannin use occurred at 400 mg l and the removal 41 6 the results suggested the presence of a high concentration of dissolved organic matter because of the observed high turbidity removal above 90 as a result this performance was associated with the cod removals for tannin and pac indeed shete and shinkar 13 cited in their work that total suspended solids represents only 48 55 of ts in the dairy effluent since coagulation processes can remove mainly suspended colloidal particles our results pointed that suspended solids were the answer for almost a half of total cod of dairy wastewater studying the coagulation flocculation of sugar cane vinasse with a tannin based coagulant souza et al 8 verified similar behaviour even though they have removed almost the whole turbidity in the wastewater only 45 of cod was removed at the highest coagulant concentration 250 mg l additionally pac is water soluble 22 as well as the tannin 1 however a fraction of soluble tannin could increase the cod values due to the organic nature of tannin conversely a different behaviour was found by junior et al 20 when treating textile effluent in their study the cod and turbidity removals were 94 81 and 99 65 respectively using 400 mg l of tannin in the same work these results were compared to those obtained with aluminium sulphate i e 99 29 and 93 72 for turbidity and cod removal respectively the difference between the studies can be explained by the wastewater chemical composition the results obtained for ts showed approximately the same performances both for tannin and pac until 400 mg l above this concentration tannin achieved better performance with a peak of ts removal of 13 6 at 500 mg l the same maximum condition was observed for pac at 400 mg l and removal of 12 6 the use of tannin showed as well as to the other parameters smallest variation in its performance the worse performance at high concentrations for pac should be due to ph adjustment by naoh addition the larger the pac concentration the larger the amounts of sodium hydroxide added for ph adjustment tannin coagulant did not require such a high amount of naoh the main effect of factors coagulant and dosage were not significant at the confidence level used in this study p 0 05 for cod and ts removal table 2 at the same time we did not observe a significant effect of interaction between factors coagulant and applied dosage for both cod and ts removal table 2 3 2 2 alkalinity consumption and changes in electrical conductivity table 3 shows results for the anova for both alkalinity consumption and changes in electrical conductivity anova showed that factors coagulant dosage and the interaction between these factors had a significant effect p 0 05 on alkalinity consumption regarding the main effect of factor coagulant pac consumed more alkalinity than tannin p 0 05 the factor dosage also showed a significant effect on alkalinity consumption p 0 05 owing to the fact of the higher the dose the higher the alkalinity consumption the effect of interaction between factors coagulant and dose is represented in table 4 tukey s test showed statistically higher alkalinity consumption by pac p 0 05 in all studied concentrations except at 100 mg l moreover tannin did not present statistical differences in alkalinity consumption along the tested doses whereas pac did as well as observed by the alkalinity consumption pac was more responsible for increasing the ec of the clarified wastewater although we did not observe a significant effect of interaction between the two studied factors p 0 05 main effect of the factor coagulant was statistically significant p 0 05 this observation evidenced that pac caused higher changes in the ec of clarified effluent than tannin by application of tukey s test at the level of 5 of significance increasement in salinity of freshwater causes several issues for aquatic life because some species are intolerant when exposed to water with high salinity 23 24 not only aquatic species but also humans are affected by high salinity in water one clear example is the increase in the costs for drinking water treatment 25 the individual alkalinity consumption and changes in electrical conductivity caused by the studied coagulants are shown in fig 2 linear regression for both the two coagulants had shown good correlation within the studied range which is evidenced by the factor r2 considering the values resulting from linear regression tannin had an average alkalinity consumption of only 23 69 0 69 of that achieved by pac larger alkalinity consumption implies high amounts of ph correctives for coagulation flocculation processes increasing process costs once it is a ph depending process in fact there are reports which affirm that tannin is more economically viable than inorganic aluminium based coagulants for industrial wastewater treatment 20 our results complied with previously reported information in the literature choy et al 4 have cited that there is no need for ph adjustment when applied natural coagulants due to its very low alkalinity consumption talib et al 26 have reported no significant effects on ph caused by tannin adding to municipal wastewater even at a highest applied concentration 60 mg l in this study at lower tannin doses up to 300 or 400 mg l no ph adjustments were required by contrast to pac partially neutralized coagulants such as pac presents some advantages over salt based coagulants like lower ph influences when added to water or effluent to be treated this influence on ph and alkalinity consumption by these partially neutralized coagulants is related to oh al molar ratio in form to bigger the ratio smaller effects on ph values 27 28 however even with smaller alkalinity consumption when compared to the simple salt based coagulants pac presented significant higher alkalinity consumption when compared to tannin in order to set ph to values between 6 0 and 7 0 it was needed to add naoh after the addition of the coagulants due to higher alkalinity consumption by pac which demanded higher amounts of naoh for ph adjustment and to the hydrolysis of pac we observed a larger increase in ec for this coagulant the same influence caused by tannin was smaller due to the lower requirement of ph correctives and absence of hydrolysis the effects of each coagulant in ec increment are shown in fig 2 the fit for pac results presented a higher r2 value compared to those obtained with tannin regarding the linear regression it claims the pac action is more directly related to the increase in the ec 3 3 ph effects the ph effects in the coagulation flocculation performance were studied at a fixed coagulants concentration of 300 mg l fig 3 shows the results for the two coagulants in the removal of colour and turbidity at different ph table 5 shows anova results for colour and turbidity removal as a function of ph the main effect of factor coagulant was not significant p 0 05 for the colour removal however it was significant for turbidity removal p 0 05 in which tannin had higher turbidity removal for both colour and turbidity removal the main effect of factor ph and the interaction of factors ph and dosage were significant p 0 05 the effect of interaction between ph and coagulant for colour and turbidity removal is presented in table 6 tannin presented good performance in colour removal over 85 from ph 5 to 10 whereas pac showed good results from ph 6 to 10 over 90 although pac has shown better performances in most ph tannin was more effective in a wider range from 5 to 10 whereas pac the better conditions were only over ph 6 turbidity removal presented similar behaviour for colour removal tannin had presented turbidity removal above 90 from ph 5 to 10 pac as well as for colour removal performance good only above ph 6 tannin showed better performance than pac for turbidity at ph 4 and 5 once more tannin showed a broader ph range of effectiveness in fact pac was developed to produces a large amount of alo4al12 oh 24 7 simplified as al13 which is a species more efficient for contaminant removal and the ph plays a major role in the formation of this species 27 29 the observed results for pac regarding turbidity removal comply with those obtained by yang et al 3 that showed good effectiveness from ph 6 to 9 treating water from a river similar values were found by yang et al 30 who observed that pac showed the best performances from ph 6 to 9 treating a humic acid kaolin synthetic water the wider working ph range for tannin was also observed by sánchez martín et al 7 treating surface water with a tannin based coagulant authors have observed good performances from ph 4 to 9 they observed compared with our study a stable effectiveness for tannin coagulant within the evaluated ph range 4 to 9 tannin performed well even at higher ph values and authors attributed this behaviour to amphoteric features of tannin caused by quaternary ammonium and phenolic sites in its structure 3 4 evaluation of kinetics parameters of slow mixing on flocculation performance the kinetic study was carried out at a fixed concentration 300 mg l and ph between 6 0 and 7 0 the obtained data were used to plot the n n0 versus time of slow mixing curves kb ka ratios for every single velocity gradient for pac and tannin were identified at the maximum efficiency condition point for each n n0 versus time of slow mixing curve di bernardo et al 16 after obtaining these kb ka values for each velocity gradient and type of coagulant we selected the best fitting curve for each experimental plotted data using origin 8 0 the best fitting curves were considered on r2 values results for this experimental procedure are shown in table 7 below the average ka for pac was higher in almost all velocity gradients except for 55 and 100s 1 tannin had higher mean kb values at any velocity gradients as expected based on mean kb and ka values for each curve kb ka ratios at best n n0 points were higher for tannin fig 4 shows the n n0 versus slow mixing time experimental data for pac and tannin under several velocity gradients our results are in concern to those obtained by talib et al 26 studying municipal wastewater amendment with tannin and pac they observed that for pac slow mixing times beyond 10 min caused flocs breakage increasing the residual turbidity in our case it was observed at lower velocity gradients 25 40 and 55s 1 a decreasing in n n0 rates until something around 10 min fig 4 after this n n0 rate was higher causing flocs breakage and turbidity increasing at higher velocity gradients it was not perceptible any improvement in turbidity removals the best condition for turbidity removal for pac was obtained testing at 10 min of slow mixing and 40s 1 velocity gradient talib et al 26 have observed that optimum slow mixing time for tannin was also 10 min however when carrying out slow mixing times beyond that up to 100 min they did not observe any turbidity improvement they attributed this fact to characteristic bridging flocculation mechanism for tannin which leads to stronger flocs it also corroborated our results in which we did not observe significant improvement in n n0 rates along slow mixing times fig 4 it means a smaller tendency for flocs breakage for tannin destabilized particles flocs di bernardo et al 16 have cited the two main actions for flocs breakage the surface erosion of particles from the flocs caused by shear forces in turbulent flow over flocs surface and floc defragmentation due to forces acting against each other in opposite sides of the floc our results have shown that even at higher ka and lower kb average values it does not mean a more stable performance for each type of coagulant at any velocity gradient and slow mixing time although pac showed better values for the aggregation and breakage constants this coagulant showed a higher tendency for flocs breakage at longer slow mixing times fig 4 by contrast tannin demonstrated stronger flocs formation and higher n n0 ratios it is an advantage for tannin which means that the flocs are very stable even at higher velocity gradients 3 5 thermogravimetric analysis results for thermogravimetric analysis tga of the sludges obtained in the test are shown in fig 5 the results demonstrated that the two solids had a similar behaviour regarding their thermal degradation starting around 500 k and ending around 900 k when any longer loss of weight was observed the sludge from the tannin tests had its highest degradation rate at 713 k while pac was at 825 k we also observed that at lower temperatures sludge obtained with pac application had higher degradation rates as can be seen in the interval between 540 and 560 k this fact has also been reported by shao et al 31 which affirmed that the presence of metallic species including aluminium decreases the temperature of thermal degradation for the sludge without the addition of metallic oxides shao et al 31 observed thermal degradation starting at 447 k and ending at 847 k with a heating rate of 10 k min 1 under a nitrogen atmosphere cao et al 32 observed degradation of sewage sludge between 473 and 823 k with maximum weight loss rates at 593 and 623 k lower than that observed in our work according to cao et al 32 pyrolytic degradation of organic residues is given in different stages at the temperatures between 593 and 623 k the degradation of carbohydrates and lipids is achieved and at 723 k the protein content is degraded in this work the weight composition of the residue obtained with tannin consisted of 78 85 of volatile compounds 7 32 of fixed carbon and 13 83 in ashes the sludge from pac tests showed 60 89 of volatile compounds 1 56 of fixed carbon and 37 55 of ashes the differences between the two sludges are related to the chemical composition of the coagulants despite the technical advantages of tannin in the wastewater coagulation the organic nature of the sludge is also a strength the use of tannin generates sludge with good potential for thermal or biologic conversion due to its organic composition 20 other authors cited in that tannin produces sludges with higher potential for agricultural purposes when compared to those sludges produced by inorganic coagulants 8 the presence of aluminium and iron in sludges from inorganic based compounds application means a drawback for its agronomic exploitation due to the toxicity of those metals to plants the implications are over crop production yields and plant health and growth 33 however application of an industrial solid wastewater residue as agricultural amended even when produced by organic coagulants like tannin should be carefully studied due to the possible presence of pollutant species related to the specific raw material of the industry 15 34 in addition the phytotoxicity of generated sludge should be performed in order to determine the suitability for agricultural purpose 14 moreover the law requirements have to be fully complied with aiming to not cause impacts to the environment and human health 35 4 conclusions the use of tannin and a traditional aluminium based coagulant performance did not differ statistically for colour turbidity cod and ts removal tannin showed lower alkalinity consumption 23 69 of the alkalinity consumption promoted by pac lower interferences in electrical conductivity and also presented a wider ph range for the application the flocs obtained from tannin usage showed lower breakage along slow mixing time even at higher velocity gradients apart from a better stability the sludge obtained with tannin presented lower ashes content and higher volatile solids and fixed carbon contents overall the tannin based coagulant is a promising feasible alternative for treating wastewater from dairy industry generating sludge with potential for valorization acknowledgement the authors acknowledge the financial support provided by the

14522,the aim of this work was to compare the performance of tannin and polyaluminium chloride pac in the coagulation process for dairy industry wastewater the conditions of coagulation flocculation with regards to the dosage ph velocity gradient and slow mixing time were optimized and some parameters such as floc aggregation ka and breakage kb coefficients were computed additionally it was carried out a thermogravimetric analysis of the obtained sludge for both coagulants the results showed no statistical differences between the performance of the two coagulants based on chemical oxygen demand colour turbidity and total solids removal particularly the pac showed higher alkalinity consumption and increased the electrical conductivity of the clarified wastewater while tannin showed good performance within a wider ph ranging from 5 0 to 10 0 moreover although the greatest ka values were observed for pac usage the tannin use presented higher resistance to floc breakage during the slow mixing time the obtained sludge from the experiments using tannin accounted for higher volatile solids and fixed carbon and lower ash content when compared to pac in conclusion tannin is a promising alternative for dairy wastewater treatment regarding its process performance and wastewater treatment residuals management keywords dairy wastewater coagulation flocculation tannin pac 1 introduction coagulation is an essential process for surface water and industrial wastewater treatment 1 it consists in a well known process involving destabilization of colloids and other suspended substances so as to promote its aggregation as greater and weightier flocs 2 3 typically inorganic coagulants derived from iron and aluminium salts as al2 so4 3 fecl3 and polyaluminium chloride pac are employed in the coagulation processes 1 2 among these the pre hydrolyzed ones like pac present some advantages over the non hydrolyzed such as lower alkalinity consumption and the generation of a smaller sludge amounts 4 5 alternatively to those inorganic metal based coagulants researchers have been looking for new and natural plant based coagulants which have shown some advantages like the production of biodegradable sludge lower alkalinity consumption and renewable sources origin 1 on this way tannin based coagulant has been being an effective coagulant in the treatment of numerous types of water and wastewater presenting comparable or better performance than inorganic coagulants 6 9 the tannins are macromolecular polyphenols extracted from different vegetable sources such as schinopsis balansae engler castanea sativa miller and acacia mearnsii de wildemann due to the several natural sources extraction tannin chemical structures are diverse described as complex therefore it is still a challenge to determine exactly the chemical structure of tannins 9 nevertheless tannin is present in some plant barks and its presence is related to antimicrobial properties and thermal protection 10 when naturally obtained the vegetable tannin does not present cationic features which is provided after a cationization procedure involving the mannich reaction in this process a quaternary nitrogen is added to tannin polyphenolic structure through a reaction with an aldehyde and an amine producing a higher molecular weight compound 2 even though the cationization which is essential for its application as a coagulant the tannin preserves some original plant extract features like the water solubility moreover tannin has an ampholytic behaviour caused by the presence of quaternary nitrogen and phenolic hydroxyls 9 when tannin is extracted from acacia mearnsii the main monomeric units are gallocatechin and robinetinidol but sometimes there are also catechin and fisetinidol units additionally tannin from acacia mearnsii is condensed tannin 11 these condensed tannins are polymers of flavonol units linked each other by carbon carbon bonds differently from hydrolysable tannins which presents polyester linkage among gallic or ellagic acids in structure 12 the cationized tannin coagulant polymeric chain from acacia mearnsii de wildemann traded by tanac company used in this work has approximately 600 000 g mol 1 and 1000 to 2000 repeating of monomeric units which means a moderate to high molecular weight 6 dairy effluent has a variable composition consisted of high biochemical oxygen demand 1400 to 3383 mgo2 l 1 and high concentrations of suspended solids 28 to 80 000 mg l 1 and pac is constantly applied for the coagulation process 13 in addition the concern on disposal of generated sludge from the coagulation flocculation process has motivated the industry to find a way in managing those sludge appropriately 14 although the application of tannin and pac in water and wastewater treatment is deeply reported to date there are no published studies which have evaluated the use of tannin for dairy wastewater treatment in this context the performance of a tannin based coagulant and pac for treating a real dairy wastewater were comparatively evaluated 2 material and methods 2 1 samples collection storage and preservation raw effluent samples were collected directly from the equalization tank in a real dairy industry described in a previous study 15 collections were performed once a week at alternate days and times aiming to cover possible variances in raw wastewater features after the collection samples were stored in high density polyethene bottles at maximum temperatures of 4 c before been analyzed 2 2 evaluation of coagulants dosage effects the coagulant solutions used for performing the experiments were prepared by diluting commercial pac buschle lepper 18 w w concentration and a tannin based coagulant extracted from acacia mearnsii tanac 25 w w concentration the concentrations of commercial solutions were provided by the manufacturers the evaluation of dosage effects in coagulation and flocculation performances was performed by the application of six different dosages for both pac and tannin based coagulants the dosages were 100 200 300 400 500 and 600 mg l 1 in aliquots of 1 5 l of raw effluent the mixing parameters used in jar test were as follow 90 s at 120 rpm for the rapid mixing 30 min at 45 rpm for slow mixing and 60 min for settling after the coagulant addition ph was adjusted to 6 0 7 0 by adding naoh or hcl solutions all the experiments were carried out at room temperature as soon as the cycle was accomplished samples were collected from the upper clarified effluent for analyzing the following parameters chemical oxygen demand cod colour turbidity total solids ts alkalinity and electrical conductivity the experiments were performed in four replicates to assess the colour and turbidity removal alkalinity consumption and effect in wastewater electrical conductivity for cod and ts removal experiments the tests were carried out in triplicate for the colour turbidity cod and ts removal investigation the experimental design followed a 2 6 factorial experiment consisted by one factor with two levels type of coagulant and another with six levels concentration of coagulant when it comes to the alkalinity consumption and the effect in the wastewater electrical conductivity a linear regression analysis was fitted aiming to observe the trends associated with the coagulant dosage 2 3 effects and optimization of ph in order to assess the ph influence in the coagulation flocculation process the coagulant concentration was fixed this concentration was applied to aliquots of 1 5 l of raw effluent with different ph from 4 0 to 10 0 adjusted by the addition of naoh or hcl solutions the coagulation flocculation performance was expressed in terms of the percentage of colour and turbidity removal the experimental design followed a 2 7 factorial with two levels according to the nature of the coagulant and seven level for the ph the experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 flocculation kinetic once determined the optimal values for concentration and ph for coagulation flocculation process it was studied the best conditions for the velocity gradient and flocculation time firstly it was evaluated the behaviour of flocculation performance for each coagulant over time under different velocity gradients the aggregation ka and breakage kb coefficients obtained from the experimental data were also calculated the study of flocculation kinetic was carried out by monitoring the turbidity removal as a function of slow mixing time under six different velocity gradients as follows 25 40 55 70 85 and 100 s 1 velocity gradients were adjusted based on a calibration curve provided by the jar test manufacturer this curve shows a relationship between the frequency of the stirrer and the respective velocity gradient after sedimentation time 2 h it was measured the residual turbidity the data obtained for each velocity gradient was plotted in an n n0 versus slow mixing time graphic and to each velocity gradient it was fitted curves using the software origin 8 16 aggregation and breakage coefficients were calculated based on the following kinetic equation for flocculation eq 1 1 dn dt k a ng k b n 0 g 2 where n0 initial concentration of primary particles in wastewater m 3 n remaining concentration of primary particles after sedimentation at a gift slow mixture time m 3 ka aggregation coefficient dimensionless kb breakage coefficient s g velocity gradient the concentration of primary particles can be related to wastewater turbidity for this reason it was used this parameter in the calculus to obtain the aggregation and breakage coefficients using a classical approach the integration of eq 1 to initial time 0 and final time of slow mixing t and considering n0 initial turbidity and n final turbidity after sedimentation time for a specific velocity gradient leads to eq 2 2 n 0 n k b k a g 1 k b k a g x e k a gt 1 where t time of slow mixture for that slow mixing time which has presented the best efficiency in the turbidity removal we applied the relation represented in the eq 3 this relation considers that at the point where the tangent to the curve becomes horizontal it is achieved an equilibrium condition it is equivalent to match dn dt eq 1 to zero 3 k b k a 1 g n 0 n once calculated the values for the relation showed in eq 3 the rearrangement of eq 2 can provide the value of ka just as shown in eq 4 therefore taking successive points along the fitted curves for each velocity gradient specifically at the times in which we collected the aliquots during slow mixture time we could calculate mean ka for each single velocity gradient and coagulant 4 k a 1 g t ln 1 k b k a g n n 0 k b k a g all the tests for the obtention of kinetics parameters were done in triplicate 2 5 sludges characterization the samples for the thermogravimetric analysis were obtained from the settled sludge in the jar tests after reached the settling time after the sampling they were dried at room temperature and then powdered to a 60 μm maximum size for the analysis the weight varied from 0 79 to 2 23 g the pyrolysis was performed in duplicate with a heating rate of 15 k min 1 from room temperature to 1173 k under continuous nitrogen flow at a rate of 2 l min 1 2 6 methodological procedures the analysis were conducted according to standard methods for examination of water and wastewater 22nd edition 17 color mg pt co and turbidity ntu were measured in a spectroquant nova 60 merck photometer while cod mgo2 l 1 was analysed in a pharo 300 merck photometer the ph and electrical conductivity measurements were done using a bench multiparameter analyzer thermo scientific the alkalinity was analyzed by titrimetric method the anova was performed at a significance level of 5 using the software assistat 7 7 campina grande federal university brazil and originpro 8 0 originlab corporation means were compared using the tukey s test at a significance level of 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 raw effluent characterization for this work the following parameters cod colour turbidity electrical conductivity alkalinity and ts were evaluated table 1 shows a characterization of raw wastewater based on these cited parameters a wide dispersion in the results for the evaluated parameters was evaluated which is evidenced by the variation coefficients all of them over 20 in fact several authors have pointed high variations in dairy wastewater composition mainly due to the manufacturing of different final dairy products and the different technologic methods employed to this manufacturing 13 18 19 also it was reported seasonal diurnal and hourly variations in amounts of wastewater production and its compositions 19 furthermore pollutants present in effluent and its concentrations can change during the day due to the manufacturing of different products by changing manufacturing methods or alternating cleaning processes to occur simultaneously or at different times in different sectors of the plant the wastewater used to develop this study came from a factory which manufactures mainly cheese but also produces cottage cheese butter milk cream and creamy cheese so there is a lot of different combinations of raw effluent that can be generated by mixing effluent from diverse sectors additionally to the high variations in its composition and generation flow rates the dairy industry plants are responsible for high water use depending on the kind of manufactured dairy product the wastewater generation varies from 0 2 to 10 l of effluent per each litre of processed milk 13 3 2 dosage effects in coagulation flocculation performance 3 2 1 colour turbidity cod and ts removal the obtained results for colour turbidity cod and ts removal are shown in fig 1 the tannin has shown a better performance when compared to pac regarding colour removal at low concentrations the decreasing in the colour was 48 1 68 5 and 73 6 respectively at 100 200 and 300 mg l for the same doses pac could remove 24 5 59 2 and 67 7 additionally considering the high dosages 400 500 and 600 mg l the use of pac decreased 77 4 81 4 and 82 1 of colour respectively and for tannin the removals were 76 2 77 1 and 78 5 the application of tannin did not provide a significant improvement in the colour removal at dosages above 300 mg l whereas pac did not so above 400 mg l junior et al 20 also observed better performance for tannin at lower concentrations when compared to the aluminium based coagulant al2 so4 3 treating textile industry wastewater for colour removal fig 1 also shows results for the turbidity removal compared with the colour removal the use of tannin was responsible for a better performance at lower concentrations reaching the removals of 72 2 86 6 and 89 4 of turbidity at 100 200 and 300 mg l respectively pac provided removals of turbidity of 49 2 74 6 and 81 8 at these same dosages for the dosages above 400 mg l both studied coagulants presented similar results on one hand tannin did not present a significant improvement in its performance above 200 mg l and on the other hand pac did not increase the turbidity removal above 400 mg l once more the data obtained for pac accounted for higher dispersion a maximum standard deviation of 40 3 at 200 mg l when compared to tannin a maximum standard deviation of 12 7 at 100 mg l some studies have also shown the better performance for tannin based coagulants in color and turbidity removal when treating diverse kinds of water bodies such as surface water 7 21 municipal wastewater 7 9 and industrial effluents such as textile industry 7 20 and treatment of vinasse from ethanol production 8 in these studies tannin has frequently achieved a better performance when compared to inorganic coagulants the main effect of factor coagulant was not significant as well as the effect of interaction between factors coagulant and dosage p 0 05 table 2 however the main effect of factor dosage was significant p 0 05 both for colour and turbidity removal table 2 in relation to the cod removal a better performance for tannin at the lowest concentration 100 ppm was observed however for all the other concentrations pac was more efficient moreover the cod decreasing using pac raised to 500 mg l reaching a removal of 51 0 the peak of cod removal associated with tannin use occurred at 400 mg l and the removal 41 6 the results suggested the presence of a high concentration of dissolved organic matter because of the observed high turbidity removal above 90 as a result this performance was associated with the cod removals for tannin and pac indeed shete and shinkar 13 cited in their work that total suspended solids represents only 48 55 of ts in the dairy effluent since coagulation processes can remove mainly suspended colloidal particles our results pointed that suspended solids were the answer for almost a half of total cod of dairy wastewater studying the coagulation flocculation of sugar cane vinasse with a tannin based coagulant souza et al 8 verified similar behaviour even though they have removed almost the whole turbidity in the wastewater only 45 of cod was removed at the highest coagulant concentration 250 mg l additionally pac is water soluble 22 as well as the tannin 1 however a fraction of soluble tannin could increase the cod values due to the organic nature of tannin conversely a different behaviour was found by junior et al 20 when treating textile effluent in their study the cod and turbidity removals were 94 81 and 99 65 respectively using 400 mg l of tannin in the same work these results were compared to those obtained with aluminium sulphate i e 99 29 and 93 72 for turbidity and cod removal respectively the difference between the studies can be explained by the wastewater chemical composition the results obtained for ts showed approximately the same performances both for tannin and pac until 400 mg l above this concentration tannin achieved better performance with a peak of ts removal of 13 6 at 500 mg l the same maximum condition was observed for pac at 400 mg l and removal of 12 6 the use of tannin showed as well as to the other parameters smallest variation in its performance the worse performance at high concentrations for pac should be due to ph adjustment by naoh addition the larger the pac concentration the larger the amounts of sodium hydroxide added for ph adjustment tannin coagulant did not require such a high amount of naoh the main effect of factors coagulant and dosage were not significant at the confidence level used in this study p 0 05 for cod and ts removal table 2 at the same time we did not observe a significant effect of interaction between factors coagulant and applied dosage for both cod and ts removal table 2 3 2 2 alkalinity consumption and changes in electrical conductivity table 3 shows results for the anova for both alkalinity consumption and changes in electrical conductivity anova showed that factors coagulant dosage and the interaction between these factors had a significant effect p 0 05 on alkalinity consumption regarding the main effect of factor coagulant pac consumed more alkalinity than tannin p 0 05 the factor dosage also showed a significant effect on alkalinity consumption p 0 05 owing to the fact of the higher the dose the higher the alkalinity consumption the effect of interaction between factors coagulant and dose is represented in table 4 tukey s test showed statistically higher alkalinity consumption by pac p 0 05 in all studied concentrations except at 100 mg l moreover tannin did not present statistical differences in alkalinity consumption along the tested doses whereas pac did as well as observed by the alkalinity consumption pac was more responsible for increasing the ec of the clarified wastewater although we did not observe a significant effect of interaction between the two studied factors p 0 05 main effect of the factor coagulant was statistically significant p 0 05 this observation evidenced that pac caused higher changes in the ec of clarified effluent than tannin by application of tukey s test at the level of 5 of significance increasement in salinity of freshwater causes several issues for aquatic life because some species are intolerant when exposed to water with high salinity 23 24 not only aquatic species but also humans are affected by high salinity in water one clear example is the increase in the costs for drinking water treatment 25 the individual alkalinity consumption and changes in electrical conductivity caused by the studied coagulants are shown in fig 2 linear regression for both the two coagulants had shown good correlation within the studied range which is evidenced by the factor r2 considering the values resulting from linear regression tannin had an average alkalinity consumption of only 23 69 0 69 of that achieved by pac larger alkalinity consumption implies high amounts of ph correctives for coagulation flocculation processes increasing process costs once it is a ph depending process in fact there are reports which affirm that tannin is more economically viable than inorganic aluminium based coagulants for industrial wastewater treatment 20 our results complied with previously reported information in the literature choy et al 4 have cited that there is no need for ph adjustment when applied natural coagulants due to its very low alkalinity consumption talib et al 26 have reported no significant effects on ph caused by tannin adding to municipal wastewater even at a highest applied concentration 60 mg l in this study at lower tannin doses up to 300 or 400 mg l no ph adjustments were required by contrast to pac partially neutralized coagulants such as pac presents some advantages over salt based coagulants like lower ph influences when added to water or effluent to be treated this influence on ph and alkalinity consumption by these partially neutralized coagulants is related to oh al molar ratio in form to bigger the ratio smaller effects on ph values 27 28 however even with smaller alkalinity consumption when compared to the simple salt based coagulants pac presented significant higher alkalinity consumption when compared to tannin in order to set ph to values between 6 0 and 7 0 it was needed to add naoh after the addition of the coagulants due to higher alkalinity consumption by pac which demanded higher amounts of naoh for ph adjustment and to the hydrolysis of pac we observed a larger increase in ec for this coagulant the same influence caused by tannin was smaller due to the lower requirement of ph correctives and absence of hydrolysis the effects of each coagulant in ec increment are shown in fig 2 the fit for pac results presented a higher r2 value compared to those obtained with tannin regarding the linear regression it claims the pac action is more directly related to the increase in the ec 3 3 ph effects the ph effects in the coagulation flocculation performance were studied at a fixed coagulants concentration of 300 mg l fig 3 shows the results for the two coagulants in the removal of colour and turbidity at different ph table 5 shows anova results for colour and turbidity removal as a function of ph the main effect of factor coagulant was not significant p 0 05 for the colour removal however it was significant for turbidity removal p 0 05 in which tannin had higher turbidity removal for both colour and turbidity removal the main effect of factor ph and the interaction of factors ph and dosage were significant p 0 05 the effect of interaction between ph and coagulant for colour and turbidity removal is presented in table 6 tannin presented good performance in colour removal over 85 from ph 5 to 10 whereas pac showed good results from ph 6 to 10 over 90 although pac has shown better performances in most ph tannin was more effective in a wider range from 5 to 10 whereas pac the better conditions were only over ph 6 turbidity removal presented similar behaviour for colour removal tannin had presented turbidity removal above 90 from ph 5 to 10 pac as well as for colour removal performance good only above ph 6 tannin showed better performance than pac for turbidity at ph 4 and 5 once more tannin showed a broader ph range of effectiveness in fact pac was developed to produces a large amount of alo4al12 oh 24 7 simplified as al13 which is a species more efficient for contaminant removal and the ph plays a major role in the formation of this species 27 29 the observed results for pac regarding turbidity removal comply with those obtained by yang et al 3 that showed good effectiveness from ph 6 to 9 treating water from a river similar values were found by yang et al 30 who observed that pac showed the best performances from ph 6 to 9 treating a humic acid kaolin synthetic water the wider working ph range for tannin was also observed by sánchez martín et al 7 treating surface water with a tannin based coagulant authors have observed good performances from ph 4 to 9 they observed compared with our study a stable effectiveness for tannin coagulant within the evaluated ph range 4 to 9 tannin performed well even at higher ph values and authors attributed this behaviour to amphoteric features of tannin caused by quaternary ammonium and phenolic sites in its structure 3 4 evaluation of kinetics parameters of slow mixing on flocculation performance the kinetic study was carried out at a fixed concentration 300 mg l and ph between 6 0 and 7 0 the obtained data were used to plot the n n0 versus time of slow mixing curves kb ka ratios for every single velocity gradient for pac and tannin were identified at the maximum efficiency condition point for each n n0 versus time of slow mixing curve di bernardo et al 16 after obtaining these kb ka values for each velocity gradient and type of coagulant we selected the best fitting curve for each experimental plotted data using origin 8 0 the best fitting curves were considered on r2 values results for this experimental procedure are shown in table 7 below the average ka for pac was higher in almost all velocity gradients except for 55 and 100s 1 tannin had higher mean kb values at any velocity gradients as expected based on mean kb and ka values for each curve kb ka ratios at best n n0 points were higher for tannin fig 4 shows the n n0 versus slow mixing time experimental data for pac and tannin under several velocity gradients our results are in concern to those obtained by talib et al 26 studying municipal wastewater amendment with tannin and pac they observed that for pac slow mixing times beyond 10 min caused flocs breakage increasing the residual turbidity in our case it was observed at lower velocity gradients 25 40 and 55s 1 a decreasing in n n0 rates until something around 10 min fig 4 after this n n0 rate was higher causing flocs breakage and turbidity increasing at higher velocity gradients it was not perceptible any improvement in turbidity removals the best condition for turbidity removal for pac was obtained testing at 10 min of slow mixing and 40s 1 velocity gradient talib et al 26 have observed that optimum slow mixing time for tannin was also 10 min however when carrying out slow mixing times beyond that up to 100 min they did not observe any turbidity improvement they attributed this fact to characteristic bridging flocculation mechanism for tannin which leads to stronger flocs it also corroborated our results in which we did not observe significant improvement in n n0 rates along slow mixing times fig 4 it means a smaller tendency for flocs breakage for tannin destabilized particles flocs di bernardo et al 16 have cited the two main actions for flocs breakage the surface erosion of particles from the flocs caused by shear forces in turbulent flow over flocs surface and floc defragmentation due to forces acting against each other in opposite sides of the floc our results have shown that even at higher ka and lower kb average values it does not mean a more stable performance for each type of coagulant at any velocity gradient and slow mixing time although pac showed better values for the aggregation and breakage constants this coagulant showed a higher tendency for flocs breakage at longer slow mixing times fig 4 by contrast tannin demonstrated stronger flocs formation and higher n n0 ratios it is an advantage for tannin which means that the flocs are very stable even at higher velocity gradients 3 5 thermogravimetric analysis results for thermogravimetric analysis tga of the sludges obtained in the test are shown in fig 5 the results demonstrated that the two solids had a similar behaviour regarding their thermal degradation starting around 500 k and ending around 900 k when any longer loss of weight was observed the sludge from the tannin tests had its highest degradation rate at 713 k while pac was at 825 k we also observed that at lower temperatures sludge obtained with pac application had higher degradation rates as can be seen in the interval between 540 and 560 k this fact has also been reported by shao et al 31 which affirmed that the presence of metallic species including aluminium decreases the temperature of thermal degradation for the sludge without the addition of metallic oxides shao et al 31 observed thermal degradation starting at 447 k and ending at 847 k with a heating rate of 10 k min 1 under a nitrogen atmosphere cao et al 32 observed degradation of sewage sludge between 473 and 823 k with maximum weight loss rates at 593 and 623 k lower than that observed in our work according to cao et al 32 pyrolytic degradation of organic residues is given in different stages at the temperatures between 593 and 623 k the degradation of carbohydrates and lipids is achieved and at 723 k the protein content is degraded in this work the weight composition of the residue obtained with tannin consisted of 78 85 of volatile compounds 7 32 of fixed carbon and 13 83 in ashes the sludge from pac tests showed 60 89 of volatile compounds 1 56 of fixed carbon and 37 55 of ashes the differences between the two sludges are related to the chemical composition of the coagulants despite the technical advantages of tannin in the wastewater coagulation the organic nature of the sludge is also a strength the use of tannin generates sludge with good potential for thermal or biologic conversion due to its organic composition 20 other authors cited in that tannin produces sludges with higher potential for agricultural purposes when compared to those sludges produced by inorganic coagulants 8 the presence of aluminium and iron in sludges from inorganic based compounds application means a drawback for its agronomic exploitation due to the toxicity of those metals to plants the implications are over crop production yields and plant health and growth 33 however application of an industrial solid wastewater residue as agricultural amended even when produced by organic coagulants like tannin should be carefully studied due to the possible presence of pollutant species related to the specific raw material of the industry 15 34 in addition the phytotoxicity of generated sludge should be performed in order to determine the suitability for agricultural purpose 14 moreover the law requirements have to be fully complied with aiming to not cause impacts to the environment and human health 35 4 conclusions the use of tannin and a traditional aluminium based coagulant performance did not differ statistically for colour turbidity cod and ts removal tannin showed lower alkalinity consumption 23 69 of the alkalinity consumption promoted by pac lower interferences in electrical conductivity and also presented a wider ph range for the application the flocs obtained from tannin usage showed lower breakage along slow mixing time even at higher velocity gradients apart from a better stability the sludge obtained with tannin presented lower ashes content and higher volatile solids and fixed carbon contents overall the tannin based coagulant is a promising feasible alternative for treating wastewater from dairy industry generating sludge with potential for valorization acknowledgement the authors acknowledge the financial support provided by the

14523,ammonia containing wastewater often also contains sulfide which severely inhibits biological nitrification in this study the applicability of a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a long fill period to achieve stable nitrification of sulfide containing anaerobic digestion effluent was evaluated during the start up period in which no sulfide was supplied to the reactor phase i experimental days 0 18 ammonium was oxidized to nitrate stably after day 6 during the period in which sulfide was supplied at 32 mg s l 1 d 1 phase ii experimental days 18 30 the nitrification efficiency temporarily decreased to 79 but recovered rapidly to 100 within two days the sulfide tolerance of the sludge in the sbr was evaluated by batch bioassays at the end of the start up period the results showed that the half maximum inhibitory concentration ic50 for the sludge was 0 73 mg s l 1 which was a typical value therefore pre existing sulfide tolerance of the sludge was not the main factor enabling stable nitrification during the sulfide supply period throughout the experimental period the reactor was operated using a long sludge retention time of 139 days the effective sludge retention in the sbr with a long fill period probably promoted the acclimatization of the microbes to sulfide allowing the nitrification performance to remain stable even under sulfide supply keywords nitrification sulfide inhibition simultaneous process sequencing batch reactor anaerobic digestion effluent 1 introduction appropriate management of wastewater discharged from human activities is essential for establishing a sustainable society human derived wastewater often contains a high concentration of nitrogen compounds and sequential nitrification denitrification processes have been used for effective nitrogen treatment 1 the role of nitrification is to oxidize the ammonium to nitrate via the following two steps eqs 1 2 2 before denitrification in which the nitrate is converted to nitrogen gas 1 n h 4 1 5 o 2 n o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 n o 2 0 5 o 2 n o 3 thus a successful nitrification process is a key factor for the complete removal of nitrogen from wastewater however the nitrification process is sensitive to some inhibitors in wastewater such as organic compounds heavy metals and sulfide 3 5 sulfide is a strong inhibitor and exists in many types of nitrogen containing wastewater such as those from petroleum refineries 6 tanneries 7 and food processing plants 8 in addition the effluent from anaerobic digesters ades often contain soluble sulfide along with ammonium sometimes the sulfide concentration is greater than 10 mg s l 1 9 previous studies have demonstrated that low sulfide concentrations severely inhibit nitrification performance table 1 summarizes some previous reports related to the inhibition of nitrification by sulfide in the treatment of waste gas and wastewater kim et al 11 attempted to treat synthetic waste gas containing nh3 and h2s and indicated that nh3 treatment efficiency decreased approximately 70 under high concentration of h2s supply over 200 ppm the mechanism by which sulfide inhibits nitrifying bacteria has also been studied by batch bioassays using a synthetic medium for instance bejarano ortiz et al 12 observed a greater than 50 decrease in the nitrification rate at a sulfide concentration of 3 1 mg s l 1 in synthetic wastewater treatment æsøy et al 13 indicated that supplying sulfide at a loading rate of approximately 10 mg s l 1 d 1 lowered the nitrification efficiency by approximately 70 in a continuous moving bed reactor with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 2 h beristain cardoso et al 14 evaluated the nitrification performance of a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr with an hrt of 1 8 days at sulfide loading rates of 32 and 76 mg s l 1 d 1 they reported that significant inhibition of nitrification was observed during the first two weeks at each sulfide loading rate but the nitrification process then recovered due to acclimatization their use of a relatively long hrt compared to that of æsøy et al 13 probably retained the microbes effectively in the reactor resulting in the recovery of nitrification ability however during an actual treatment process prolonged instability in the nitrification performance leads to a large amount of ammonium entering the denitrification process from which ammonia cannot be removed the remaining ammonia is discharged directly into the aquatic environment causing eutrophication therefore typical continuous cstr operation is likely inappropriate for maintaining stable nitrification efficiency when hs is supplied instead a reactor operation method that can shorten the sulfide inhibition period during the nitrification process should be applied sbr is one of the reactors to be known to retain sludge more effectively than continuous reactors because the supernatant is discharged only after the sludge has settled a higher sludge retention time srt has several advantages such as preventing the wash out of slow growing microbes including nitrifying bacteria from the system and increasing the biodiversity of the microbes therefore sbrs with higher srts are used for the treatment of inhibitory wastewater 15 16 because of the low microbe growth rate under inhibitory conditions 17 the basic operation cycle of a sbr is divided into five periods the fill reaction settling draw and idle periods 18 generally pulse substrate feeding is used for filling and the fill and reaction periods are separated however a high concentration of inhibitory substrates such as sulfide can strongly affect the process of nitrification in contrast sbr operation in which a long fill period is combined with the reaction period might be beneficial for treating high strength inhibitory wastewater because the substrate concentration will not vary significantly throughout the cycle 19 20 thus sbr operation with a long fill period is preferable for inhibitory wastewater treatment however to our knowledge no study has directly reported the reduction of inhibition by using an sbr with a long fill period the aim of this study was to evaluate the nitrification performance of ammonium from anaerobic digestion effluent ade containing sulfide using an sbr with a long fill period 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation an sbr with a working volume of 2 1 l was used nitrifying sludge obtained from an a2o anaerobic anoxic aerobic wastewater treatment plant at the hokubu second water regeneration center yokohama japan was used as the inoculum the ph ionic compound concentrations and volatile suspended solid vss concentrations of the nitrifying sludge were 6 4 0 0 mg nh4 n l 1 37 6 mg no3 n l 1 66 4 mg po4 3 p l 1 32 7 mg so4 2 s l 1 and 3 6 mg vss l 1 respectively this sludge was washed repeatedly with distilled water to remove ionic compounds from the liquid phase and then added to the reactor at a sludge concentration of 2 7 mg vss l 1 centrifuged ade from the hokubu sludge treatment center yokohama japan was used as the substrate after filtration through a glass fiber filter with a pore size of 0 45 μm advantec gc 50 the reactor was operated using a 12 h cycle consisting of three periods the combined filling and reaction for avoiding a high load for a short period 11 5 h with feeding stirrer agitation at 200 rpm aeration and ph control the settling period 20 min and the drawing period 10 min the ade was supplied with an hrt of 3 days the volume exchange ratio ver the ratio of the volume added during an operation cycle to the maximum reactor volume ratio was 0 17 the temperature was controlled at 30 1 c using a water bath the dissolved oxygen do concentration was maintained between 2 0 and 5 0 mg o2 l 1 by regulating the airflow rate the ph was automatically maintained above 7 5 through the addition of 2 n naoh by a process controller the sbr was operated for 30 days during the first 18 days of operation only ade was supplied to obtain stable nitrification ability for ade treatment phase i day 0 17 the filtered ade contained an nh4 concentration of 973 123 mg n l 1 without added hs leading to an nh4 loading rate of 280 43 mg n l 1 d 1 using a 3 day hrt from day 18 to day 30 phase ii hs was supplied along with the ade 0 5 m nahs solution was added to the ade to give an hs concentration 96 mg l 1 corresponding to an hs loading rate of 32 mg l 1 d 1 the removal efficiency of nh4 and hs in the sbr was determined using the following equation 3 removal efficiency c 0 c n c 0 100 where c 0 is the concentration of nh4 or hs in the influent and cn is the concentration of nh4 or hs in the effluent the srt was determined using the following equation 4 srt v x r q x e where v is the effective volume of the reactor q is the volume of effluent per day and xr and xe are the vss concentration of the reactor and effluent respectively in the stable state of phase i day 15 the half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 of hs for the sbr sludge was evaluated via batch bioassays following the method described by zhou et al 9 in order to evaluate the sulfide tolerance of the nitrifying sludge batch bioassays were carried out in triplicate using filtrated and 20 fold diluted ade as the substrate after the addition of 1 5 g l 1 of nahco3 as a buffer layer and 0 3 2 16 and 32 mg s l 1 of nahs 2 2 analytical methods the do and ph in the sbr were measured using a portable do meter iijima denshi co ltd id 150 and a process controller eyela co ltd epc 2000 respectively the major ion composition nh4 no2 no3 s2o3 2 so3 2 and so4 2 of the influent and effluent were analysed via high performance liquid chromatography hplc shodex co ltd electrical conductivity detector cd 5 the nh4 content was analysed using an ic ys 50 column shodex co ltd and 4 mm methanesulfonic acid aqueous solution as the mobile phase nitrogen oxidizing species and sulfur oxidizing species were analysed using an ic i 524a column shodex co ltd with aqueous mobile phases of 2 5 mm phthalic acid with 2 3 mm tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane and of 0 25 mm p hydroxybenzoic acid with 1 2 mm n n diethylethanolamine and 10 vol of ch3oh respectively the hs concentration was determined using the methylene blue method 21 the concentration of h2s in the outlet gas was measured using a gas detector tube gastec co ltd 4ll the dissolved metal concentrations were analyzed via inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy shimadzu co ltd icps 7000 ver 2 1 the total suspended solids tss and vss were measured per the sewage analysis methods 22 3 results and discussion fig 1 a shows the time course of nh4 removal efficiency and nitrogen compound concentrations of the sbr effluent during the experimental phase in which no hs was supplied phase i the nh4 removal efficiency decreased temporarily on day 3 on all other days the efficiency was 100 and there was no no2 accumulation during phase i the no3 n concentration increased gradually reaching a nh4 n concentration of approximately 900 mg n l 1 in the influent these results indicated successful nitrification during the ade only period during the experimental phase in which hs was supplied phase ii the nh4 removal efficiency decreased slightly to 79 and the nh4 oxidation rate also decreased from 350 mg l 1 d 1 to 277 mg l 1 d 1 for two days after hs was introduced day 20 these reductions in the nitrification ability seemed to be caused by sulfide inhibition subsequently the nitrification performance recovered rapidly on day 21 and a 100 nh4 removal efficiency and 350 mg l 1 d 1 nh4 oxidation rate were maintained until the end of the experiment beristain cardoso et al 14 reported that the nitrification process was inhibited after sulfide supply at 32 mg s l 1 d 1 was initiated and the unstable nitrification continued for more than three weeks one possible reason for the rapid recovery of the nitrification ability after initial sulfide inhibition in the current study was that the nitrifying sludge may have had a high sulfide tolerance originally as the inoculum was obtained from a plant that treats anaerobic digestion effluent which often contains hs 9 thus in order to determine the sulfide tolerance of the sbr sludge immediately prior to being exposed to hs the ic50 of the sbr sludge was evaluated at the end of phase i through batch bioassays the sludge showed an ic50 of 0 73 mg s l 1 r 2 0 999 p 0 01 fig 2 which was similar to or lower than previously reported values 4 12 23 for instance bejarano ortiz et al 12 23 evaluated the effect of sulfide on the nitrification activities of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob using serum bottles and reported that these bacteria had ic50 values of 1 2 mg s l 1 and 1 03 mg s l 1 respectively beccari et al 4 evaluated the sulfide tolerance of nitrifying sludge collected from a lab scale reactor via batch experiments they reported that the nitrification efficiency decreased by 28 and 67 when 1 0 and 5 0 mg s l 1 of sulfide were added respectively therefore the ic50 values of this sludge was probably in the range of 1 0 5 0 mg s l 1 thus pre existing sulfide tolerance was not the main reason for the short inhibition period observed in this study sbr operation leads to effective sludge retention in the reactor because the supernatant is only drawn after the sludge has settled in addition the use of a long fill period during sbr operation can avoid temporary spikes in the sulfide load these operational characteristics might promote rapid recovery of the nitrification performance throughout phase ii the supplied hs was completely removed and the so4 2 concentration of the effluent increased gradually fig 1b the produced so4 2 corresponded to 58 of the total amount of hs supplied in phase ii generally hs is oxidized to so4 2 via intermediate substances such as s0 s2o3 2 and so3 2 24 however h2s gas s2o3 2 and so3 2 were barely detected in the outlet gas or the effluent of the sbr therefore approximately 40 of the supplied hs was probably converted to solid state products the ade used in this study contained mn fe ni cu zn ag cd and pb and hs is known to co precipitate with these metals 25 although the metal concentrations decreased throughout the sbr treatment there was no significant difference between the metal concentrations of the effluent in phase i without hs supply and phase ii with hs supply table s1 in supplementary material the production of elemental sulfur s0 also occurs easily under oxidizing conditions 26 therefore some of the supplied sulfide may have been transformed into s0 although s0 remains in the reactor this form of sulfur does not affect the activity of microbes including nitrifying bacteria and sulfur oxidizing bacteria 27 in addition the accumulated s0 is assumed to be gradually oxidized to so4 2 by sulfur oxidizing bacteria or drawn off with the carry over of unsettled excess sludge into the effluent during long term reactor operation thus preventing the accumulation of s0 above a certain concentration table 2 summarizes the start up periods from previous reports concerning continuous nitrification performance under sulfide supply conditions in four of the studies the efficiency of dissolved nh4 oxidation was studied in addition to the efficiency of nh3 and h2s gas purification treatment therefore these studies can be compared in terms of their nitrification performance under sulfide supply the ammonia and sulfur loading rates in the gas treatment studies showed relatively large ranges compared to those in the wastewater treatment studies this is because the purpose of gas treatment studies is to remove ammonia and sulfide from the gas phase rather than from the liquid phase actually the nh3 and h2s gas dissolution efficiencies reported in the studies were relatively high above 70 indicating good gas purification performance on the other hand the removal efficiency of dissolved ammonia fluctuated widely ranging from 7 1 to 98 in particular at high ammonia and sulfide loading rates relatively low ammonia oxidation efficiency was observed due to excess ammonia loading and or sulfide loading 29 30 on the other hand at low sulfide loading rates not exceeding 106 mg l 1 d 1 the supplied ammonia was almost completely oxidized 10 14 28 31 these results suggest that nitrifying bacteria can potentially tolerate a sulfide load of over 100 mg s l 1 d 1 in studies on wastewater treatment relatively low sulfide loading rates were observed compared to those in gas treatment studies this is because the majority of waste gases released from industrial processes e g landfills for waste disposal livestock farming and wastewater treatment contain a higher ratio of h2s than of nh3 whereas wastewater commonly contains more ammonia than sulfide owing to this low sulfide loading rate high ammonia oxidation efficiencies of almost 100 were achieved in a previous study 14 and in the current study the time required to achieve stable nitrification after sulfide was introduced clearly varied depending on the type of reactor used in the gas treatment studies the required times ranged from 5 to 7 days 30 31 these relatively short times were observed at a lower sulfide loading rate probably owing to the effective retention of microbes in the biofilter reactor in the studies on wastewater treatment even though both experiments were conducted at similar ammonia and sulfide loading rates the time required to achieve stable nitrification differed greatly a significantly shorter time was observed in the present study compared to that for cstr operation in the study by beristain cardoso et al 14 the srt was the same as the hrt i e 1 8 days on the other hand in the current study the srt was much longer 139 41 days which probably allowed the retention of the slow growing nitrifying sludge inhibited by hs this result indicates that sequencing batch operation with a long fill period can retain microbes effectively in the reactor possibly improving microbe acclimatization to sulfide 4 conclusions in this study the effect of hs on nitrification efficiency was evaluated for an sbr with a long fill period using ade as the substrate the ade underwent complete nitrification despite the presence of sulfide after an inhibition period of only two days sequencing batch operation with a long fill period which is suitable for retaining sludge within the reactor probably

14523,ammonia containing wastewater often also contains sulfide which severely inhibits biological nitrification in this study the applicability of a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a long fill period to achieve stable nitrification of sulfide containing anaerobic digestion effluent was evaluated during the start up period in which no sulfide was supplied to the reactor phase i experimental days 0 18 ammonium was oxidized to nitrate stably after day 6 during the period in which sulfide was supplied at 32 mg s l 1 d 1 phase ii experimental days 18 30 the nitrification efficiency temporarily decreased to 79 but recovered rapidly to 100 within two days the sulfide tolerance of the sludge in the sbr was evaluated by batch bioassays at the end of the start up period the results showed that the half maximum inhibitory concentration ic50 for the sludge was 0 73 mg s l 1 which was a typical value therefore pre existing sulfide tolerance of the sludge was not the main factor enabling stable nitrification during the sulfide supply period throughout the experimental period the reactor was operated using a long sludge retention time of 139 days the effective sludge retention in the sbr with a long fill period probably promoted the acclimatization of the microbes to sulfide allowing the nitrification performance to remain stable even under sulfide supply keywords nitrification sulfide inhibition simultaneous process sequencing batch reactor anaerobic digestion effluent 1 introduction appropriate management of wastewater discharged from human activities is essential for establishing a sustainable society human derived wastewater often contains a high concentration of nitrogen compounds and sequential nitrification denitrification processes have been used for effective nitrogen treatment 1 the role of nitrification is to oxidize the ammonium to nitrate via the following two steps eqs 1 2 2 before denitrification in which the nitrate is converted to nitrogen gas 1 n h 4 1 5 o 2 n o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 n o 2 0 5 o 2 n o 3 thus a successful nitrification process is a key factor for the complete removal of nitrogen from wastewater however the nitrification process is sensitive to some inhibitors in wastewater such as organic compounds heavy metals and sulfide 3 5 sulfide is a strong inhibitor and exists in many types of nitrogen containing wastewater such as those from petroleum refineries 6 tanneries 7 and food processing plants 8 in addition the effluent from anaerobic digesters ades often contain soluble sulfide along with ammonium sometimes the sulfide concentration is greater than 10 mg s l 1 9 previous studies have demonstrated that low sulfide concentrations severely inhibit nitrification performance table 1 summarizes some previous reports related to the inhibition of nitrification by sulfide in the treatment of waste gas and wastewater kim et al 11 attempted to treat synthetic waste gas containing nh3 and h2s and indicated that nh3 treatment efficiency decreased approximately 70 under high concentration of h2s supply over 200 ppm the mechanism by which sulfide inhibits nitrifying bacteria has also been studied by batch bioassays using a synthetic medium for instance bejarano ortiz et al 12 observed a greater than 50 decrease in the nitrification rate at a sulfide concentration of 3 1 mg s l 1 in synthetic wastewater treatment æsøy et al 13 indicated that supplying sulfide at a loading rate of approximately 10 mg s l 1 d 1 lowered the nitrification efficiency by approximately 70 in a continuous moving bed reactor with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 2 h beristain cardoso et al 14 evaluated the nitrification performance of a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr with an hrt of 1 8 days at sulfide loading rates of 32 and 76 mg s l 1 d 1 they reported that significant inhibition of nitrification was observed during the first two weeks at each sulfide loading rate but the nitrification process then recovered due to acclimatization their use of a relatively long hrt compared to that of æsøy et al 13 probably retained the microbes effectively in the reactor resulting in the recovery of nitrification ability however during an actual treatment process prolonged instability in the nitrification performance leads to a large amount of ammonium entering the denitrification process from which ammonia cannot be removed the remaining ammonia is discharged directly into the aquatic environment causing eutrophication therefore typical continuous cstr operation is likely inappropriate for maintaining stable nitrification efficiency when hs is supplied instead a reactor operation method that can shorten the sulfide inhibition period during the nitrification process should be applied sbr is one of the reactors to be known to retain sludge more effectively than continuous reactors because the supernatant is discharged only after the sludge has settled a higher sludge retention time srt has several advantages such as preventing the wash out of slow growing microbes including nitrifying bacteria from the system and increasing the biodiversity of the microbes therefore sbrs with higher srts are used for the treatment of inhibitory wastewater 15 16 because of the low microbe growth rate under inhibitory conditions 17 the basic operation cycle of a sbr is divided into five periods the fill reaction settling draw and idle periods 18 generally pulse substrate feeding is used for filling and the fill and reaction periods are separated however a high concentration of inhibitory substrates such as sulfide can strongly affect the process of nitrification in contrast sbr operation in which a long fill period is combined with the reaction period might be beneficial for treating high strength inhibitory wastewater because the substrate concentration will not vary significantly throughout the cycle 19 20 thus sbr operation with a long fill period is preferable for inhibitory wastewater treatment however to our knowledge no study has directly reported the reduction of inhibition by using an sbr with a long fill period the aim of this study was to evaluate the nitrification performance of ammonium from anaerobic digestion effluent ade containing sulfide using an sbr with a long fill period 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation an sbr with a working volume of 2 1 l was used nitrifying sludge obtained from an a2o anaerobic anoxic aerobic wastewater treatment plant at the hokubu second water regeneration center yokohama japan was used as the inoculum the ph ionic compound concentrations and volatile suspended solid vss concentrations of the nitrifying sludge were 6 4 0 0 mg nh4 n l 1 37 6 mg no3 n l 1 66 4 mg po4 3 p l 1 32 7 mg so4 2 s l 1 and 3 6 mg vss l 1 respectively this sludge was washed repeatedly with distilled water to remove ionic compounds from the liquid phase and then added to the reactor at a sludge concentration of 2 7 mg vss l 1 centrifuged ade from the hokubu sludge treatment center yokohama japan was used as the substrate after filtration through a glass fiber filter with a pore size of 0 45 μm advantec gc 50 the reactor was operated using a 12 h cycle consisting of three periods the combined filling and reaction for avoiding a high load for a short period 11 5 h with feeding stirrer agitation at 200 rpm aeration and ph control the settling period 20 min and the drawing period 10 min the ade was supplied with an hrt of 3 days the volume exchange ratio ver the ratio of the volume added during an operation cycle to the maximum reactor volume ratio was 0 17 the temperature was controlled at 30 1 c using a water bath the dissolved oxygen do concentration was maintained between 2 0 and 5 0 mg o2 l 1 by regulating the airflow rate the ph was automatically maintained above 7 5 through the addition of 2 n naoh by a process controller the sbr was operated for 30 days during the first 18 days of operation only ade was supplied to obtain stable nitrification ability for ade treatment phase i day 0 17 the filtered ade contained an nh4 concentration of 973 123 mg n l 1 without added hs leading to an nh4 loading rate of 280 43 mg n l 1 d 1 using a 3 day hrt from day 18 to day 30 phase ii hs was supplied along with the ade 0 5 m nahs solution was added to the ade to give an hs concentration 96 mg l 1 corresponding to an hs loading rate of 32 mg l 1 d 1 the removal efficiency of nh4 and hs in the sbr was determined using the following equation 3 removal efficiency c 0 c n c 0 100 where c 0 is the concentration of nh4 or hs in the influent and cn is the concentration of nh4 or hs in the effluent the srt was determined using the following equation 4 srt v x r q x e where v is the effective volume of the reactor q is the volume of effluent per day and xr and xe are the vss concentration of the reactor and effluent respectively in the stable state of phase i day 15 the half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 of hs for the sbr sludge was evaluated via batch bioassays following the method described by zhou et al 9 in order to evaluate the sulfide tolerance of the nitrifying sludge batch bioassays were carried out in triplicate using filtrated and 20 fold diluted ade as the substrate after the addition of 1 5 g l 1 of nahco3 as a buffer layer and 0 3 2 16 and 32 mg s l 1 of nahs 2 2 analytical methods the do and ph in the sbr were measured using a portable do meter iijima denshi co ltd id 150 and a process controller eyela co ltd epc 2000 respectively the major ion composition nh4 no2 no3 s2o3 2 so3 2 and so4 2 of the influent and effluent were analysed via high performance liquid chromatography hplc shodex co ltd electrical conductivity detector cd 5 the nh4 content was analysed using an ic ys 50 column shodex co ltd and 4 mm methanesulfonic acid aqueous solution as the mobile phase nitrogen oxidizing species and sulfur oxidizing species were analysed using an ic i 524a column shodex co ltd with aqueous mobile phases of 2 5 mm phthalic acid with 2 3 mm tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane and of 0 25 mm p hydroxybenzoic acid with 1 2 mm n n diethylethanolamine and 10 vol of ch3oh respectively the hs concentration was determined using the methylene blue method 21 the concentration of h2s in the outlet gas was measured using a gas detector tube gastec co ltd 4ll the dissolved metal concentrations were analyzed via inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy shimadzu co ltd icps 7000 ver 2 1 the total suspended solids tss and vss were measured per the sewage analysis methods 22 3 results and discussion fig 1 a shows the time course of nh4 removal efficiency and nitrogen compound concentrations of the sbr effluent during the experimental phase in which no hs was supplied phase i the nh4 removal efficiency decreased temporarily on day 3 on all other days the efficiency was 100 and there was no no2 accumulation during phase i the no3 n concentration increased gradually reaching a nh4 n concentration of approximately 900 mg n l 1 in the influent these results indicated successful nitrification during the ade only period during the experimental phase in which hs was supplied phase ii the nh4 removal efficiency decreased slightly to 79 and the nh4 oxidation rate also decreased from 350 mg l 1 d 1 to 277 mg l 1 d 1 for two days after hs was introduced day 20 these reductions in the nitrification ability seemed to be caused by sulfide inhibition subsequently the nitrification performance recovered rapidly on day 21 and a 100 nh4 removal efficiency and 350 mg l 1 d 1 nh4 oxidation rate were maintained until the end of the experiment beristain cardoso et al 14 reported that the nitrification process was inhibited after sulfide supply at 32 mg s l 1 d 1 was initiated and the unstable nitrification continued for more than three weeks one possible reason for the rapid recovery of the nitrification ability after initial sulfide inhibition in the current study was that the nitrifying sludge may have had a high sulfide tolerance originally as the inoculum was obtained from a plant that treats anaerobic digestion effluent which often contains hs 9 thus in order to determine the sulfide tolerance of the sbr sludge immediately prior to being exposed to hs the ic50 of the sbr sludge was evaluated at the end of phase i through batch bioassays the sludge showed an ic50 of 0 73 mg s l 1 r 2 0 999 p 0 01 fig 2 which was similar to or lower than previously reported values 4 12 23 for instance bejarano ortiz et al 12 23 evaluated the effect of sulfide on the nitrification activities of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob using serum bottles and reported that these bacteria had ic50 values of 1 2 mg s l 1 and 1 03 mg s l 1 respectively beccari et al 4 evaluated the sulfide tolerance of nitrifying sludge collected from a lab scale reactor via batch experiments they reported that the nitrification efficiency decreased by 28 and 67 when 1 0 and 5 0 mg s l 1 of sulfide were added respectively therefore the ic50 values of this sludge was probably in the range of 1 0 5 0 mg s l 1 thus pre existing sulfide tolerance was not the main reason for the short inhibition period observed in this study sbr operation leads to effective sludge retention in the reactor because the supernatant is only drawn after the sludge has settled in addition the use of a long fill period during sbr operation can avoid temporary spikes in the sulfide load these operational characteristics might promote rapid recovery of the nitrification performance throughout phase ii the supplied hs was completely removed and the so4 2 concentration of the effluent increased gradually fig 1b the produced so4 2 corresponded to 58 of the total amount of hs supplied in phase ii generally hs is oxidized to so4 2 via intermediate substances such as s0 s2o3 2 and so3 2 24 however h2s gas s2o3 2 and so3 2 were barely detected in the outlet gas or the effluent of the sbr therefore approximately 40 of the supplied hs was probably converted to solid state products the ade used in this study contained mn fe ni cu zn ag cd and pb and hs is known to co precipitate with these metals 25 although the metal concentrations decreased throughout the sbr treatment there was no significant difference between the metal concentrations of the effluent in phase i without hs supply and phase ii with hs supply table s1 in supplementary material the production of elemental sulfur s0 also occurs easily under oxidizing conditions 26 therefore some of the supplied sulfide may have been transformed into s0 although s0 remains in the reactor this form of sulfur does not affect the activity of microbes including nitrifying bacteria and sulfur oxidizing bacteria 27 in addition the accumulated s0 is assumed to be gradually oxidized to so4 2 by sulfur oxidizing bacteria or drawn off with the carry over of unsettled excess sludge into the effluent during long term reactor operation thus preventing the accumulation of s0 above a certain concentration table 2 summarizes the start up periods from previous reports concerning continuous nitrification performance under sulfide supply conditions in four of the studies the efficiency of dissolved nh4 oxidation was studied in addition to the efficiency of nh3 and h2s gas purification treatment therefore these studies can be compared in terms of their nitrification performance under sulfide supply the ammonia and sulfur loading rates in the gas treatment studies showed relatively large ranges compared to those in the wastewater treatment studies this is because the purpose of gas treatment studies is to remove ammonia and sulfide from the gas phase rather than from the liquid phase actually the nh3 and h2s gas dissolution efficiencies reported in the studies were relatively high above 70 indicating good gas purification performance on the other hand the removal efficiency of dissolved ammonia fluctuated widely ranging from 7 1 to 98 in particular at high ammonia and sulfide loading rates relatively low ammonia oxidation efficiency was observed due to excess ammonia loading and or sulfide loading 29 30 on the other hand at low sulfide loading rates not exceeding 106 mg l 1 d 1 the supplied ammonia was almost completely oxidized 10 14 28 31 these results suggest that nitrifying bacteria can potentially tolerate a sulfide load of over 100 mg s l 1 d 1 in studies on wastewater treatment relatively low sulfide loading rates were observed compared to those in gas treatment studies this is because the majority of waste gases released from industrial processes e g landfills for waste disposal livestock farming and wastewater treatment contain a higher ratio of h2s than of nh3 whereas wastewater commonly contains more ammonia than sulfide owing to this low sulfide loading rate high ammonia oxidation efficiencies of almost 100 were achieved in a previous study 14 and in the current study the time required to achieve stable nitrification after sulfide was introduced clearly varied depending on the type of reactor used in the gas treatment studies the required times ranged from 5 to 7 days 30 31 these relatively short times were observed at a lower sulfide loading rate probably owing to the effective retention of microbes in the biofilter reactor in the studies on wastewater treatment even though both experiments were conducted at similar ammonia and sulfide loading rates the time required to achieve stable nitrification differed greatly a significantly shorter time was observed in the present study compared to that for cstr operation in the study by beristain cardoso et al 14 the srt was the same as the hrt i e 1 8 days on the other hand in the current study the srt was much longer 139 41 days which probably allowed the retention of the slow growing nitrifying sludge inhibited by hs this result indicates that sequencing batch operation with a long fill period can retain microbes effectively in the reactor possibly improving microbe acclimatization to sulfide 4 conclusions in this study the effect of hs on nitrification efficiency was evaluated for an sbr with a long fill period using ade as the substrate the ade underwent complete nitrification despite the presence of sulfide after an inhibition period of only two days sequencing batch operation with a long fill period which is suitable for retaining sludge within the reactor probably

14524,concern about organic micropollutants which are present in the environment at trace concentrations ng l 1 μg l 1 is related to the adverse effects to organisms exposed to these substances pharmaceutically active compounds phcas may be present in natural waters and usually cannot be removed or degraded by conventional water treatment processes for this reason treatment techniques such as nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro are recommended to improve their removal in this context the present study aims to evaluate the removal of five non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids analgesics and anti pyretic acetaminophen ibuprofen dipyrone diclofenac and caffeine by nf and ro process nf90 and bw30 membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopic sem contact angle and zeta potential retention of phacs was evaluated considering ph feed solution and operating pressure results indicated that nf90 membrane was efficient to reach over 88 rejection for some selected phacs best results were obtained at 20 bar and ph 5 with more than 90 of rejection for nonionic compounds acetaminophen and caffeine exclusion by size is the main mechanism for rejection by nf90 membrane whereas for anionic compounds ibuprofen dipyrone and diclofenac electrical exclusion predominated at ph 5 and 7 rejection results with nf90 membrane show that hydrophobicity has an important role due to the adsorption on the membrane surface conversely lower rejections for hydrophilic compounds were observed due to the adsorption diffusion mechanisms both in nf90 and ro at ph 5 keywords pharmaceutical compounds nanofiltration reverse osmosis rejection efficiency retention mechanisms 1 introduction human health is increasingly dependent on pharmaceutical products also water scarcity and water reuse have become essential issues in water resource management worldwide always considering the conservation of natural water system as a final goal and primary driver of the scientific community as a result they along with environmental and public health authorities have been making a significant effort in order to understand the fate of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs both in engineered urban wastewater treatment processes and in the natural environment this has been reflected in the high number of scientific articles devoted to this subject in the last two decades on the other hand there are no modification of legal regulations yet 1 although usually at very low concentrations compared to other the organic compounds involved there is a considerable group of emerging organic micropollutants that have been detected in raw wastewaters of various natures in surface and groundwaters in drinking water sources and in some cases in treated waters as well this group includes pesticides pharmaceutical products phacs personal hygiene products and several other industrial pollutants 2 the highest possibility of their occurrence is in industrial wastewater or sanitary sewage due to inefficient treatment or even direct discharge without prior treatment which does not comply with legislation socioeconomic and other cultural factors related to the indiscriminate marketing consumption improper disposal and destination of medicines in the countries also contribute negatively for the spread of these compounds in waters and wastewaters 3 removal of some phacs in conventional treatment stations is almost impossible due to several factors including low volatility different hydrophobicity complex structures recalcitrance very low concentrations influence of microorganisms and interaction with other solutes and separation media these compounds remain dissolved in urban effluents or may connect to sludge which later is released into the surrounding aquatic environment and soil in other words a lot of water soluble substances can be transported and distributed more easily in the water cycle causing impact on the environment and human beings 4 5 there is still little knowledge about the impact that can be created by this exposure and what are the long term effects on human health and environment 6 nevertheless some consequences are already known a antibiotics have been blamed for the development of bacterial resistance in the environment b endocrine disruptors affect the reproductive and endocrine system of aquatic organisms inducing genotoxocity acute and chronic toxicity for example causing the feminization of male fish that live in contaminated rivers 7 and c anti inflammatory drug diclofenac induces chronic toxic effects on the fish kidneys after exposure at the dose of 0 001 mg l 1 3 emerging micropollutants from anthropogenic origin are one of the primary pollutant sources particularly speaking of pharmaceuticals they are persistent compounds that present high potential for bioaccumulation low biodegradability and concentration in the range of ng l 1 to μg l 1 in aquatic environments these facts indicate that conventional treatment technologies do not entirely remove them which leads to their subsequent release into the aquatic environment through discharge and or reuse applications therefore there is a need to investigate alternative technologies for their removal in municipal wastewater treatment 2 8 due to this concern different physicochemical processes have been proposed as a tertiary treatment for effluents from water treatment plants among them are membrane separation processes which have proved ability to remove these pollutants achieving high removal rates for pharmaceutical compounds membrane separation processes msp have been increasingly used in the treatment of reused water drinking water and water for industrial purpose and their use has increased exceptionally due to technological economic and environmental needs 8 nanofiltration nf membranes have come a long way since their beginning in the late 1980s nf is a msp that uses pressure gradient as the driving force with properties between those of ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro membranes nf membranes have attracted interest due to their versatility as a separation process their pore size is typically in the order of 1 nm which corresponds to a molecular weight cut off mwco in the range of 100 5000 da therefore this type of process may seem interesting for organic micropollutants removal nf membranes also exhibit a moderate level of charge due to the dissociation of surface functional groups or the adsorption of charged solutes for example polymeric nf membranes contain ionizable groups such as carboxylic and sulfonic acid groups which result in charged surfaces in the presence of an aqueous feed solution nf membranes operate with no phase change and typically at low pressures reaching high rejections of multivalent inorganic salts and small organic molecules this makes the separation process highly competitive regarding selectivity and cost benefit when compared to traditional separations thus nf has found wide range of application across of industrial sectors including water and wastewater treatment pharmaceutical and biotechnological processes and food engineering to name a few as the use of nf technology becomes increasingly widespread efforts will increase for more effective separation projects with the ultimate aim of reducing costs 6 9 10 although ro has a capacity of separation similar to that of nf with high solute rejection rates and in some cases being a concurrent process it has a higher operating cost than nf usually because of the need of high operating pressure to overcome lower permeability and a greater fixed investment membranes used in ro processes do not have pores or convective flow and the separation occurs by the sorption diffusion mechanism in which species permeate and are solubilized in the material that composes the membrane and then diffuses through their thickness moved by a gradient of chemical potential until the desorption step on the permeate side 9 some studies in literature report the employment of nf and ro membranes for the removal of different endocrine disruptors and phacs in real matrices 11 16 according of these studies high removals of compounds can be obtained by the nf and ro membranes many studies investigate the removal of organic contaminants using nf and ro in real matrices spiked with phacs treated municipal wastewaters treated water from drinking water plant surface waters among others and this is the main limitation to study the contribution of each compound separately for the process performance because of the influence from the other compounds and from organic matter existing in these matrices 10 12 14 17 21 in the last decades attention was given to the interactions between contaminants membranes and components in the water that impact the rejection of solutes with different geometries and physicochemical properties 9 membranes can remove phacs either by size exclusion electrostatic repulsion hydrophobic interaction or adsorption 10 12 14 19 22 24 it is noteworthy that the interaction of the solute with water as well as the nature of the polymer responsible for the separation are also fundamental factors for the efficiency of the process thus it is necessary to know the properties and characteristics of the polymers that constitute the polymer matrix so that the membrane separation process can be optimized 5 in addition membrane operating conditions such as feed rate flow recovery pressure and temperature are fundamental for the operation and rejection values 25 size exclusion is always considered the most important mechanism of rejection often the main rejections are expected from membranes that have molecular weight cut off mwco for organic contaminants with a higher molecular mass than the mwco molecular mass is not a correct prediction when the molecules are charged or have a high hydrophobicity 26 verliefde et al 10 evaluated the rejection efficiency of twenty pharmaceutical compounds with different electrostatic charges of nf membranes removal of the pharmaceutical compounds was partially determined by exclusion by molecular weight but the charge of the compounds also appeared to play an essential role in the rejection of neutral solutes ozaki and li 24 studied the influence of molecular mass on the retention of organic and inorganic compounds on reverse osmosis membrane the study concluded that polar compounds either positively or negatively charged are more effectively removed compared to less polar or neutral charged compounds because they interact with the membrane surface the understanding of these interactions is essential for the improvement and selection of suitable membranes as well as for the development of tools that will allow the prediction of process efficiency for a wide spectrum of micropollutants 9 however these effects have not been properly discussed in the literature mainly regarding the evaluation of membrane performance at different ph and zeta potential analyzes throughout the ph range to date the intrinsic relationship between the physiochemical properties of phcas at trace levels the solution ph and the membrane retention behavior remains poorly understood thus this study aimed to evaluate the rejection performance by nf and ro membranes for the following phcas dipyrone paracetamol diclofenac ibuprofen and caffeine and to elucidate their removal mechanisms in different ph conditions these compounds represent different pharmaceutical groups with quite distinct physicochemical properties and are commonly detected in aquatic samples paracetamol n 4 hydroxyphenylacetamide is one of the most commonly used non narcotic analgesic and antipyretic in the world diclofenac 2 4 6 dichlorophenyl aminobenzeneacetic acid has antirheumatic and anti inflammatory use ibuprofen is a derivative of 3 phenoxybenzeneacetic acid which is also one of the most widely used drugs worldwide caffeine is a stimulant of the central nervous system that contributes to the relief of some types of headaches is a respiratory stimulant and an analgesic potentiator it is found in most medications 12 13 17 sodium dipyrone also known as metamizole is a pyrazolonic derivative that acts as analgesic and antipyretic agent and is mainly marketed in sodium form in different pharmaceutical formulations such as oral solutions tablets injectables and suppositories the effect of surface properties such as scanning electron microscopy zeta potential hydrophilicity on membrane performance was deeply investigated using solutions of pure phcas that is one solution for each phac for each membrane process nf and ro also as novelty this study introduces the evaluation of removal of dypirone by membranes since there is no study so far in literature reporting the treatment of water containing traces of this component by nf and ro membranes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents for instrumental analysis the five pharmaceuticals selected as model micropollutants for this study acetaminophen ibuprofen diclofenac

adjust the ph of the ammonium acetate to 4 2 2 scanning electron microscopy sem morphology of nf90 and bw30 membranes was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy fei company quanta 200 photomicrograph of the membrane surface was obtained after membrane skin was carefully removed from the support and fractured with liquid nitrogen and then glued on stubs by carbon conductive tape and covered with a thin layer of gold conductor 2 3 contact angle measurements static contact angle measurements were performed by the sessile drop method using data phisics oca 15 germany at room temperature a droplet of ultrapure water was deposited on the membrane surface after reaching the equilibrium configuration a static image of the droplet was taken and the equipment software calculated the contact angle the measurements were performed at three different points of the membrane surface to obtain the average contact angle value 2 4 zeta potential of the membrane surface zeta potential of nf and ro membranes were determined by streaming potential measurements with an electrokinetic analyzer surpass antonpaar two membrane samples of 55 mm 25 mm were inserted opposite from each other and separated by a spacer forming a thin slit channel the streaming potential was resulted from the pressure driven flow of an electrolyte solution that passes through this channel then the zeta potential was calculated using the fairbrother mastim equation eq 1 28 1 δ φ δ p ζ ε 0 ε r η λ 0 λ h r h r where ζ is the zeta potential mv δφ is the measured streaming potential in the flow cell mv δp is the applied pressure mbar ε0 is the vacuum permittivity f m 1 εr is the relative dielectric constant of the electrolyte solution λ 0 is the bulk conductivity of the circulating electrolyte ms

analysis the membranes were soaked in kcl 0 01 mol l 1 electrolyte solution for 24 h and the zeta potential measurements were performed using the same electrolyte solution at ph ranging from 3 to 10 29 2 5 bench scale experiments 2 5 1 sample preparation a synthetic solution 1 l with 10 mg l 1 was prepared for each selected phac in ultrapure water ibuprofen and diclofenac were initially diluted in 10 ml of methanol because of water solubility limitations ph of the prepared solutions is around 5 for all the drugs considered for assays at ph 4 hcl 1 m was used for adjustment and for assays at ph 7 naoh 1 m was used for adjustment 2 5 2 nanofiltration and reverse osmosis system two commercial nf nf90 and ro bw30 membranes purchased from dow filmtec were used in our study the nominal molecular weight cut off mwco of nf90 is in the range of 200 400 da and of bw30 100 more information about the properties of the nf90 and bw30 membranes is detailed in table 3 a laboratory scale membrane filtration unit was used for all the experiments as shown in fig 1 effective membrane area of the flat membrane cell is 28 26 cm2 temperature of feed solution was kept constant at 23 0 5 c for all the experiments before each experiment the nf and ro plants were washed with ultra pure water for at least 30 min the experiments were performed in batch mode with recirculation membranes were soaked in pure water for 24 h soaked membranes were then compacted in nf system using ultrapure water at maximum operation pressure 20 bar for nf and 30 bar for ro until constant permeate flow was reached membranes permeability was determined by eq 2 with ultra pure water at a flow rate of 40 l h 1 varying transmembrane pressure 2 jw aw δp δπ where jw is water permeate flux l m 2 h 1 aw is water permeability l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and δp δπ are osmotic and hydraulic pressure difference through the membrane respectively feed tank was filled with 1 l of synthetic solution obtained as detailed in item 2 4 1 finally the experiment was initiated by discharging permeate and recirculating the concentrate flow into the feed tank samples of feed permeate and concentrate flows were taken when permeate flow was constant observed rejection r0 of pharmaceuticals and caffeine by the membrane was determined the amount of solute rejected by the membrane was calculated based on the following equation eq 3 3 r 0 1 c p c f 100 where cp concentration of solute in permeate flow and cf concentration of solute in the feed flow the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in both permeate and feed flow were measured using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc 2 5 3 analytical determination concentration profiles of each compound were obtained by high performance liquid chromatography hplc with a diode array detector dad and a reversed phase analytical column zorbax eclipse xdb c18 2 1 100 mm 3 5 μm the method consisted of a binary gradient of ch3coonh4 10 mm mobile phase a and acn mobile phase b at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 proportion of mobile phase b is maintained at 10 for 5 min and then varied to 90 in 20 min holding the value of 90 for 2 min then proportion of mobile phase b decreases to 10 in 3 min and remains so for a further 2 min totaling approximately 30 min of analysis injection volume was 5 μl and the column temperature was maintained at 30 c throughout the analysis acetic acid was used to adjust mobile phase a to ph 4 detection wavelengths were 243 nm for acetaminophen 225 nm for ibuprofen 280 nm for diclofenac and 273 nm for dipyrone and caffeine these five compounds selected as model pharmaceuticals have the advantage of solubility stability polarity and easy separation in the hplc system as well as appropriate light absorption for detection in a diode array detector dad stock solutions containing concentration of 1000 μg ml 1 of the considered pharmaceuticals were prepared in methanol water 1 1 v v analytical curves were prepared from the stock solution with concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 μg ml 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane morphology fig 2 a and b illustrate the sem cross sections of nf90 and bw30 membranes respectively sem clearly shows the morphological microstructure of the surface and cross sections of the membrane material which can be used to predict its performance all membranes show a characteristic morphology of asymmetric membrane with an aromatic polyamide top layer and a polysulfone porous sub layer these commercial membranes are prepared as thin film composites with a thin crosslinked polyamide selective barrier layer synthesized from m phenylenediamine and trimesoyl chloride because of this characteristic they acquire unique separation properties 32 3 2 membrane surface properties contact angle is commonly employed to measure the hydrophilicity of membranes which is controlled by electrostatic and or adsorption interactions between the surface functional groups and water molecules contact angle can be used to relate permeability flux and hydrophobic interactions of the phacs investigated in this study fig 3 shows the contact angle of nf90 a and bw30 b membranes respectively it is possible to observe that membranes have hydrophilic surface when they have contact angle smaller than 90 polyamide membranes have surface functional groups including carboxyl and amino groups which are attributed to the membrane fabrication technique the amino groups are due to interfacial polymerization of polyamide with monomers as reactants the unreacted monomers in the polyamide matrix hydrolyze into carboxyl groups after the membrane is immersed in water 33 in the contact angle experiment a drop of ultrapure water ph around 6 is deposited on the surface of the membrane in this ph deprotonated carboxylic groups pka 1 8 2 4 interact with water by hydrogen bond 34 which gives a hydrophilic surface nf90 membrane has pores that confer greater hydrophilicity than that of dense bw30 membrane carboxyl and amino groups are also located at the pore inner surfaces electrostatic phenomena strongly influences the separation performance of membranes due to surface charge and zeta potential gives some information about the net charge on the surface fig 4 shows the zeta potential of nf90 and bw30 membranes as a function of the ph the isoelectric point iep of nf90 was close to ph 4 and for bw30 was close to ph 3 for ph i e p zeta potential of both membranes is negative due to deprotonation of the carboxyl groups cooh pka 1 8 2 4 on the skin layer 28 dissociation of carboxylic groups tends to be complete with the increase of ph the positive surface charge is a result of the protonation of amino groups protonation these groups exhibit pka at a range of 8 8 10 9 35 fig 5 illustrates the protonation and deprotonation of functional groups according to the ph of the solution a difference in the isoelectric point of the analyzed polyamide membranes is observed in fig 4 tang et al suggest that the bw30 membrane is coated with a layer rich in alcohol functions such as polyvinyl alcohol resulting from a dense membrane post treatment step these groups ch with very weak acid properties result in the same behavior found in this experiment 36 3 3 physicochemical properties of pharmaceuticals compounds phacs functional groups strongly influence the biological and chemicals activities of phacs compounds selected for this study have distinguishing properties that makes them interesting to be compared including molecular weight hydrophobicity dissociation constants dipole moment molar volume molecular radius and diffusion coefficient see tables 1 and 2 to analyse hydrophilic or hydrophobic character of the phacs octanol water partition coefficient kow can be used as an indicator of the sorption properties of a micropollutant this parameter does not consider ph and only reflects hydrophobic interactions however hydrophobicity is a property related to electrostatic interactions surface complexation or hydrogen bonding which depend on the ph which in turn depend on dissociation constant pka of two functional groups 37 compound dissociation constant and the ph influence chemical speciation of the phcas therefore phcas separation with membranes may differ significantly due to differences in charge and physicochemical properties fig 6 shows the microspecies distributions of acetaminophen ibuprofen diclofenac dipyrone and caffeine molecules in ultrapure water acetaminophen and caffeine have similar pka values when the ph pka these species are in their protonated form neutral form acetaminophen contains a phenolic functional group as well as an amide group and above pka point this molecule shows a structure of a free electron pair on the nitrogen atom in the anionic form as shown in fig 6 a 38 the caffeine molecule fig 6 e has a nitrogen atom with a single pair that can be protonated in water at ph pka resulting in a positively charged molecule at ph pka the molecule will deprotonate said nitrogen giving a neutral molecule making it less soluble in water 27 ibuprofen diclofenac and dipyrone have similar pka values figure b c e d respectively at ph below its pka value these compounds are neutral species above these pka values they acquire negative charge 31 ibuprofen has a carboxyl group as a functional group that acquires deprotonated form coo at ph pka 39 diclofenac has weak acid properties with the nh and the carboxylic group presence which may act as either proton donors or proton acceptors in the water 40 dipyrone molecule exhibits anionic form above pka and is a hydrophilic molecule the ph of a solution can affect not only charge but also hydrophobicity and solubility of these substances 30 the solubility and hydrophobicity of these compounds reflect their speciation as a function of the ph acetaminophen and caffeine are hydrophilic log kow 2 while ibuprofen diclofenac and dipyrone are hydrophobic log kow 2 27 however at higher ph values these compounds become less hydrophobic being more soluble in their anionic form which has been confirmed by other researchers 31 for these reasons variations in charge and other physicochemical properties as a function of ph may provide crucial information for remove these contaminants by membrane technology 3 4 removal of the selected pharmaceutical substances by nanofiltration and reverse osmosis the performance of nf membranes was evaluated by measurement of the phacs rejection as a function of feed ph 4 5 and 7 and operating pressure 5 10 15 and 20 bar fig 7 shows the results the absence of data that is observed for diclofenac at ph 4 happens because when hcl was added to adjust the ph it degraded diclofenac making its analysis impossible rejections of the five phacs were above 88 higher rejections were obtained at 20 bar and ph 5 90 for ibuprofen and diclofenac these results indicated that the nf90 membrane was efficient when used to remove selected phacs separation in a nanofiltration process may be favored by steric effects size exclusion and or electrostatic interactions moreover the selected phacs exhibit the additional separation mechanism of adsorption whenorganic matter is mainly hydrophobic or has strong hydrogen bonding characteristics which makes it readily adsorbed on the membranes surface 32 34 acetaminophen and caffeine show similar characteristics regarding rejection as function of ph in the ph range studied in this work 4 7 these compounds are in their non ionic form thereby there is no electrostatic interaction with the membrane which is negatively charged for the range of operating pressures studied the rejection did not vary with the ph of the feed solution this indicates that size effects of molecules and membrane are predominant the differences observed between acetaminophen and caffeine are due to the different sizes of their molecules which causes caffeine to be more rejected by nf90 membranes acetaminophen and caffeine are hydrophilic compounds in water solutions these compounds are solvated and consequently their effective diameter becomes larger therefore they can be rejected more effectively by steric effects 41 for bw30 membrane it was observed low rejection of acetaminophen and caffeine in comparison to other phacs mainly at ph 5 in all range of operation pressure acetaminophen and caffeine are hydrophilic compounds whose preferential orientation favors its absorption diffusion on the membrane surface and inside the pores this was previously demonstrated for other hydrophilic compounds such as endocrine disrupting compounds edcs 30 42 therefore acetaminophen and caffeine accumulated on the bw30 membrane surface due to size exclusion and could eventually diffuse through the membrane polymer matrix towards the permeate side in the ph 5 these compounds are highly hydrophilic 27 pointing to the absorption diffusion phenomenon and explaining the lower rejections in ro membrane r 92 at ph 5 compared to rejections of other pharmaceuticals as shown in fig 8 for the other phacs compounds such as ibuprofen diclofenac and dipyrone the rejection through the membrane bw30 was higher than 98 for diclofenac ph of feed has not had a significant influence on the nf90 membrane rejection at all pressures evaluated retention of diclofenac by the nf90 membrane seems to be largely influenced by steric exclusion due the smaller pore size 0 34 to 0 68 nm 30 31 of this membrane compared to the diclofenac molecule however it is possible that there is contribution from electrostatic interactions to diclofenac rejection attributed to an anionic form of diclofenac molecule at ph 5 and 7 the slight decrease in retention efficiency around ph 5 can be attributed to this effect ibuprofen and dipyrone exist primarily as a neutral species at ph pka value ph 4 4 thus exclusion by size was the only separation mechanism at ph 4 as shown in table 2 ibuprofen is a hydrophobic compound and dipyrone is a hydrophilic compound it is noteworthy that in the absence of electrostatic repulsion hydrophobic interaction between ibuprofen and the membrane surface becomes more prominent improving rejection by adsorption at ph 5 ibuprofen is in its neutral 50 and anionic 50 form when ph is increased to 7 there is a contribution of electrostatic repulsion which increases the retention of the ibuprofen molecule besides the hydrophobicity of ibuprofen decreases significantly as the ph of solution increases 31 this suggests that hydrophobic adsorption of this compound to the nf90 membrane can be weakened reducing rejection values similar observations are related by taheran et al and agenson et al 5 43 in contrast hydrophilic dipyrone molecule can absorb diffuse through the polyamide matrix reducing the observed rejection at ph 7 the electrostatic effects of dipyrone and surface membrane are more expressive because of an increase of the negative zeta potential of the membrane with ph fig 9 illustrates the main phenomena involved in the retention of the compounds acetaminophen ibuprofen diclofenac dipyrone and caffeine at the range of ph studied in this work by nf90 and bw30 membranes the rejection was very similar whitin the pressure range for both membranes this indicates that the phacs flux also increases with solvent flux 4 conclusion the performance of nf ro process for phacs removal from water at different ph conditions was elucidated it is summarized as follows 1 nf produced a practically clean permeate containing less than 12 of pharmaceuticals originally present in water 2 phac rejection by membrane is influenced by a number of parameters including membrane mwco porosity morphology charge and hydrophobicity molecular weight molecular size charge and hydrophobicity of the phacs as well as that of feed water must also be taken into account 3 membranes showed high efficiency in the removal of the selected pharmaceutical compounds permeation of the components is defined by the competition between size exclusion electric repulsion hydrophobic interactions and sorption diffusion mechanisms of the hydrophilic compounds being related mainly to the ph of the medium 4 for nf90 rejection of the acetaminophen and caffeine is independent of ph for the range of evaluated 4 7 because these components are in neutral form the main mechanism of rejection is exclusion by size for diclofenac the rejection at ph 4 and 5 occurs due to the competition between the steric and the electrostatic mechanisms rejection of ibuprofen and dipyrone is highly dependent on the ph of the medium hydrophobic mechanisms are markedly dominant for rejection of ibuprofen unlike dipyrone which is a hydrophilic molecule and therefore mechanisms of exclusion by electrostatic repulsion dominate 5 ro membranes can remove efficiently almost all phacs studied with more than 98 rejection except for the acetaminophen and caffeine these are smaller molecules with high hydrophilicity and reduction of rejection occurs by sorption diffusion mechanisms depending on ph rejection by bw30 membrane is less influenced by electrostatic and hydrophobic effects in comparison to nf90 membrane 
14524,concern about organic micropollutants which are present in the environment at trace concentrations ng l 1 μg l 1 is related to the adverse effects to organisms exposed to these substances pharmaceutically active compounds phcas may be present in natural waters and usually cannot be removed or degraded by conventional water treatment processes for this reason treatment techniques such as nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro are recommended to improve their removal in this context the present study aims to evaluate the removal of five non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids analgesics and anti pyretic acetaminophen ibuprofen dipyrone diclofenac and caffeine by nf and ro process nf90 and bw30 membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopic sem contact angle and zeta potential retention of phacs was evaluated considering ph feed solution and operating pressure results indicated that nf90 membrane was efficient to reach over 88 rejection for some selected phacs best results were obtained at 20 bar and ph 5 with more than 90 of rejection for nonionic compounds acetaminophen and caffeine exclusion by size is the main mechanism for rejection by nf90 membrane whereas for anionic compounds ibuprofen dipyrone and diclofenac electrical exclusion predominated at ph 5 and 7 rejection results with nf90 membrane show that hydrophobicity has an important role due to the adsorption on the membrane surface conversely lower rejections for hydrophilic compounds were observed due to the adsorption diffusion mechanisms both in nf90 and ro at ph 5 keywords pharmaceutical compounds nanofiltration reverse osmosis rejection efficiency retention mechanisms 1 introduction human health is increasingly dependent on pharmaceutical products also water scarcity and water reuse have become essential issues in water resource management worldwide always considering the conservation of natural water system as a final goal and primary driver of the scientific community as a result they along with environmental and public health authorities have been making a significant effort in order to understand the fate of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs both in engineered urban wastewater treatment processes and in the natural environment this has been reflected in the high number of scientific articles devoted to this subject in the last two decades on the other hand there are no modification of legal regulations yet 1 although usually at very low concentrations compared to other the organic compounds involved there is a considerable group of emerging organic micropollutants that have been detected in raw wastewaters of various natures in surface and groundwaters in drinking water sources and in some cases in treated waters as well this group includes pesticides pharmaceutical products phacs personal hygiene products and several other industrial pollutants 2 the highest possibility of their occurrence is in industrial wastewater or sanitary sewage due to inefficient treatment or even direct discharge without prior treatment which does not comply with legislation socioeconomic and other cultural factors related to the indiscriminate marketing consumption improper disposal and destination of medicines in the countries also contribute negatively for the spread of these compounds in waters and wastewaters 3 removal of some phacs in conventional treatment stations is almost impossible due to several factors including low volatility different hydrophobicity complex structures recalcitrance very low concentrations influence of microorganisms and interaction with other solutes and separation media these compounds remain dissolved in urban effluents or may connect to sludge which later is released into the surrounding aquatic environment and soil in other words a lot of water soluble substances can be transported and distributed more easily in the water cycle causing impact on the environment and human beings 4 5 there is still little knowledge about the impact that can be created by this exposure and what are the long term effects on human health and environment 6 nevertheless some consequences are already known a antibiotics have been blamed for the development of bacterial resistance in the environment b endocrine disruptors affect the reproductive and endocrine system of aquatic organisms inducing genotoxocity acute and chronic toxicity for example causing the feminization of male fish that live in contaminated rivers 7 and c anti inflammatory drug diclofenac induces chronic toxic effects on the fish kidneys after exposure at the dose of 0 001 mg l 1 3 emerging micropollutants from anthropogenic origin are one of the primary pollutant sources particularly speaking of pharmaceuticals they are persistent compounds that present high potential for bioaccumulation low biodegradability and concentration in the range of ng l 1 to μg l 1 in aquatic environments these facts indicate that conventional treatment technologies do not entirely remove them which leads to their subsequent release into the aquatic environment through discharge and or reuse applications therefore there is a need to investigate alternative technologies for their removal in municipal wastewater treatment 2 8 due to this concern different physicochemical processes have been proposed as a tertiary treatment for effluents from water treatment plants among them are membrane separation processes which have proved ability to remove these pollutants achieving high removal rates for pharmaceutical compounds membrane separation processes msp have been increasingly used in the treatment of reused water drinking water and water for industrial purpose and their use has increased exceptionally due to technological economic and environmental needs 8 nanofiltration nf membranes have come a long way since their beginning in the late 1980s nf is a msp that uses pressure gradient as the driving force with properties between those of ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro membranes nf membranes have attracted interest due to their versatility as a separation process their pore size is typically in the order of 1 nm which corresponds to a molecular weight cut off mwco in the range of 100 5000 da therefore this type of process may seem interesting for organic micropollutants removal nf membranes also exhibit a moderate level of charge due to the dissociation of surface functional groups or the adsorption of charged solutes for example polymeric nf membranes contain ionizable groups such as carboxylic and sulfonic acid groups which result in charged surfaces in the presence of an aqueous feed solution nf membranes operate with no phase change and typically at low pressures reaching high rejections of multivalent inorganic salts and small organic molecules this makes the separation process highly competitive regarding selectivity and cost benefit when compared to traditional separations thus nf has found wide range of application across of industrial sectors including water and wastewater treatment pharmaceutical and biotechnological processes and food engineering to name a few as the use of nf technology becomes increasingly widespread efforts will increase for more effective separation projects with the ultimate aim of reducing costs 6 9 10 although ro has a capacity of separation similar to that of nf with high solute rejection rates and in some cases being a concurrent process it has a higher operating cost than nf usually because of the need of high operating pressure to overcome lower permeability and a greater fixed investment membranes used in ro processes do not have pores or convective flow and the separation occurs by the sorption diffusion mechanism in which species permeate and are solubilized in the material that composes the membrane and then diffuses through their thickness moved by a gradient of chemical potential until the desorption step on the permeate side 9 some studies in literature report the employment of nf and ro membranes for the removal of different endocrine disruptors and phacs in real matrices 11 16 according of these studies high removals of compounds can be obtained by the nf and ro membranes many studies investigate the removal of organic contaminants using nf and ro in real matrices spiked with phacs treated municipal wastewaters treated water from drinking water plant surface waters among others and this is the main limitation to study the contribution of each compound separately for the process performance because of the influence from the other compounds and from organic matter existing in these matrices 10 12 14 17 21 in the last decades attention was given to the interactions between contaminants membranes and components in the water that impact the rejection of solutes with different geometries and physicochemical properties 9 membranes can remove phacs either by size exclusion electrostatic repulsion hydrophobic interaction or adsorption 10 12 14 19 22 24 it is noteworthy that the interaction of the solute with water as well as the nature of the polymer responsible for the separation are also fundamental factors for the efficiency of the process thus it is necessary to know the properties and characteristics of the polymers that constitute the polymer matrix so that the membrane separation process can be optimized 5 in addition membrane operating conditions such as feed rate flow recovery pressure and temperature are fundamental for the operation and rejection values 25 size exclusion is always considered the most important mechanism of rejection often the main rejections are expected from membranes that have molecular weight cut off mwco for organic contaminants with a higher molecular mass than the mwco molecular mass is not a correct prediction when the molecules are charged or have a high hydrophobicity 26 verliefde et al 10 evaluated the rejection efficiency of twenty pharmaceutical compounds with different electrostatic charges of nf membranes removal of the pharmaceutical compounds was partially determined by exclusion by molecular weight but the charge of the compounds also appeared to play an essential role in the rejection of neutral solutes ozaki and li 24 studied the influence of molecular mass on the retention of organic and inorganic compounds on reverse osmosis membrane the study concluded that polar compounds either positively or negatively charged are more effectively removed compared to less polar or neutral charged compounds because they interact with the membrane surface the understanding of these interactions is essential for the improvement and selection of suitable membranes as well as for the development of tools that will allow the prediction of process efficiency for a wide spectrum of micropollutants 9 however these effects have not been properly discussed in the literature mainly regarding the evaluation of membrane performance at different ph and zeta potential analyzes throughout the ph range to date the intrinsic relationship between the physiochemical properties of phcas at trace levels the solution ph and the membrane retention behavior remains poorly understood thus this study aimed to evaluate the rejection performance by nf and ro membranes for the following phcas dipyrone paracetamol diclofenac ibuprofen and caffeine and to elucidate their removal mechanisms in different ph conditions these compounds represent different pharmaceutical groups with quite distinct physicochemical properties and are commonly detected in aquatic samples paracetamol n 4 hydroxyphenylacetamide is one of the most commonly used non narcotic analgesic and antipyretic in the world diclofenac 2 4 6 dichlorophenyl aminobenzeneacetic acid has antirheumatic and anti inflammatory use ibuprofen is a derivative of 3 phenoxybenzeneacetic acid which is also one of the most widely used drugs worldwide caffeine is a stimulant of the central nervous system that contributes to the relief of some types of headaches is a respiratory stimulant and an analgesic potentiator it is found in most medications 12 13 17 sodium dipyrone also known as metamizole is a pyrazolonic derivative that acts as analgesic and antipyretic agent and is mainly marketed in sodium form in different pharmaceutical formulations such as oral solutions tablets injectables and suppositories the effect of surface properties such as scanning electron microscopy zeta potential hydrophilicity on membrane performance was deeply investigated using solutions of pure phcas that is one solution for each phac for each membrane process nf and ro also as novelty this study introduces the evaluation of removal of dypirone by membranes since there is no study so far in literature reporting the treatment of water containing traces of this component by nf and ro membranes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents for instrumental analysis the five pharmaceuticals selected as model micropollutants for this study acetaminophen ibuprofen diclofenac

adjust the ph of the ammonium acetate to 4 2 2 scanning electron microscopy sem morphology of nf90 and bw30 membranes was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy fei company quanta 200 photomicrograph of the membrane surface was obtained after membrane skin was carefully removed from the support and fractured with liquid nitrogen and then glued on stubs by carbon conductive tape and covered with a thin layer of gold conductor 2 3 contact angle measurements static contact angle measurements were performed by the sessile drop method using data phisics oca 15 germany at room temperature a droplet of ultrapure water was deposited on the membrane surface after reaching the equilibrium configuration a static image of the droplet was taken and the equipment software calculated the contact angle the measurements were performed at three different points of the membrane surface to obtain the average contact angle value 2 4 zeta potential of the membrane surface zeta potential of nf and ro membranes were determined by streaming potential measurements with an electrokinetic analyzer surpass antonpaar two membrane samples of 55 mm 25 mm were inserted opposite from each other and separated by a spacer forming a thin slit channel the streaming potential was resulted from the pressure driven flow of an electrolyte solution that passes through this channel then the zeta potential was calculated using the fairbrother mastim equation eq 1 28 1 δ φ δ p ζ ε 0 ε r η λ 0 λ h r h r where ζ is the zeta potential mv δφ is the measured streaming potential in the flow cell

analysis the membranes were soaked in kcl 0 01 mol l 1 electrolyte solution for 24 h and the zeta potential measurements were performed using the same electrolyte solution at ph ranging from 3 to 10 29 2 5 bench scale experiments 2 5 1 sample preparation a synthetic solution 1 l with 10 mg l 1 was prepared for each selected phac in ultrapure water ibuprofen and diclofenac were initially diluted in 10 ml of methanol because of water solubility limitations ph of the prepared solutions is around 5 for all the drugs considered for assays at ph 4 hcl 1 m was used for adjustment and for assays at ph 7 naoh 1 m was used for adjustment 2 5 2 nanofiltration and reverse osmosis system two commercial nf nf90 and ro bw30 membranes purchased from dow filmtec were used in our study the nominal molecular weight cut off mwco of nf90 is in the range of 200 400 da and of bw30 100 more information about the properties of the nf90 and bw30 membranes is detailed in table 3 a laboratory scale membrane filtration unit was used for all the experiments as shown in fig 1 effective membrane area of the flat membrane cell is 28 26 cm2 temperature of feed solution was kept constant at 23 0 5 c for all the experiments before each experiment the nf and ro plants were washed with ultra pure water for at least 30 min the experiments were performed in batch mode with recirculation membranes were soaked in pure water for 24 h soaked membranes were then compacted in nf system using ultrapure water at maximum operation pressure 20 bar for nf and 30 bar for ro until constant permeate flow was reached membranes permeability was determined by eq 2 with ultra pure water at a flow rate of 40 l h 1 varying transmembrane pressure 2 jw aw δp δπ where jw is water permeate flux l m 2 h 1 aw is water permeability l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and δp δπ are osmotic and hydraulic pressure difference through the membrane respectively feed tank was filled with 1 l of synthetic solution obtained as detailed in item 2 4 1 finally the experiment was initiated by discharging permeate and recirculating the concentrate flow into the feed tank samples of feed permeate and concentrate flows were taken when permeate flow was constant observed rejection r0 of pharmaceuticals and caffeine by the membrane was determined the amount of solute rejected by the membrane was calculated based on the following equation eq 3 3 r 0 1 c p c f 100 where cp concentration of solute in permeate flow and cf concentration of solute in the feed flow the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in both permeate and feed flow were measured using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc 2 5 3 analytical determination concentration profiles of each compound were obtained by high performance liquid chromatography hplc with a diode array detector dad and a reversed phase analytical column zorbax eclipse xdb c18 2 1 100 mm 3 5 μm the method consisted of a binary gradient of ch3coonh4 10 mm mobile phase a and acn mobile phase b at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 proportion of mobile phase b is maintained at 10 for 5 min and then varied to 90 in 20 min holding the value of 90 for 2 min then proportion of mobile phase b decreases to 10 in 3 min and remains so for a further 2 min totaling approximately 30 min of analysis injection volume was 5 μl and the column temperature was maintained at 30 c throughout the analysis acetic acid was used to adjust mobile phase a to ph 4 detection wavelengths were 243 nm for acetaminophen 225 nm for ibuprofen 280 nm for diclofenac and 273 nm for dipyrone and caffeine these five compounds selected as model pharmaceuticals have the advantage of solubility stability polarity and easy separation in the hplc system as well as appropriate light absorption for detection in a diode array detector dad stock solutions containing concentration of 1000 μg ml 1 of the considered pharmaceuticals were prepared in methanol water 1 1 v v analytical curves were prepared from the

vary with the ph of the feed solution this indicates that size effects of molecules and membrane are predominant the differences observed between acetaminophen and caffeine are due to the different sizes of their molecules which causes caffeine to be more rejected by nf90 membranes acetaminophen and caffeine are hydrophilic compounds in water solutions these compounds are solvated and consequently their effective diameter becomes larger therefore they can be rejected more effectively by steric effects 41 for bw30 membrane it was observed low rejection of acetaminophen and caffeine in comparison to other phacs mainly at ph 5 in all range of operation pressure acetaminophen and caffeine are hydrophilic compounds whose preferential orientation favors its absorption diffusion on the membrane surface and inside the pores this was previously demonstrated for other hydrophilic compounds such as endocrine disrupting compounds edcs 30 42 therefore acetaminophen and caffeine accumulated on the bw30 membrane surface due to size exclusion and could eventually diffuse through the membrane polymer matrix towards the permeate side in the ph 5 these compounds are highly hydrophilic 27 pointing to the absorption diffusion phenomenon and explaining the lower rejections in ro membrane r 92 at ph 5 compared to rejections of other pharmaceuticals as shown in fig 8 for the other phacs compounds such as ibuprofen diclofenac and dipyrone the rejection through the membrane bw30 was higher than 98 for diclofenac ph of feed has not had a significant influence on the nf90 membrane rejection at all pressures evaluated retention of diclofenac by the nf90 membrane seems to be largely influenced by steric exclusion due the smaller pore size 0 34 to 0 68 nm 30 31 of this membrane compared to the diclofenac molecule however it is possible that there is contribution from electrostatic interactions to diclofenac rejection attributed to an anionic form of diclofenac molecule at ph 5 and 7 the slight decrease in retention efficiency around ph 5 can be attributed to this effect ibuprofen and dipyrone exist primarily as a neutral species at ph pka value ph 4 4 thus exclusion by size was the only separation mechanism at ph 4 as shown in table 2 ibuprofen is a hydrophobic compound and dipyrone is a hydrophilic compound it is noteworthy that in the absence of electrostatic repulsion hydrophobic interaction between ibuprofen and the membrane surface becomes more prominent improving rejection by adsorption at ph 5 ibuprofen is in its neutral 50 and anionic 50 form when ph is increased to 7 there is a contribution of electrostatic repulsion which increases the retention of the ibuprofen molecule besides the hydrophobicity of ibuprofen decreases significantly as the ph of solution increases 31 this suggests that hydrophobic adsorption of this compound to the nf90 membrane can be weakened reducing rejection values similar observations are related by taheran et al and agenson et al 5 43 in contrast hydrophilic dipyrone molecule can absorb diffuse through the polyamide matrix reducing the observed rejection at ph 7 the electrostatic effects of dipyrone and surface membrane are more expressive because of an increase of the negative zeta potential of the membrane with ph fig 9 illustrates the main phenomena involved in the retention of the compounds acetaminophen ibuprofen diclofenac dipyrone and caffeine at the range of ph studied in this work by nf90 and bw30 membranes the rejection was very similar whitin the pressure range for both membranes this indicates that the phacs flux also increases with solvent flux 4 conclusion the performance of nf ro process for phacs removal from water at different ph conditions was elucidated it is summarized as follows 1 nf produced a practically clean permeate containing less than 12 of pharmaceuticals originally present in water 2 phac rejection by membrane is influenced by a number of parameters including membrane mwco porosity morphology charge and hydrophobicity molecular weight molecular size charge and hydrophobicity of the phacs as well as that of feed water must also be taken into account 3 membranes showed high efficiency in the removal of the selected pharmaceutical compounds permeation of the components is defined by the competition between size exclusion electric repulsion hydrophobic interactions and sorption diffusion mechanisms of the hydrophilic compounds being related mainly to the ph of the medium 4 for nf90 rejection of the acetaminophen and caffeine is independent of ph for the range of evaluated 4 7 because these components are in neutral form the main mechanism of rejection is exclusion by size for diclofenac the rejection at ph 4 and 5 occurs due to the competition between the steric and the electrostatic mechanisms rejection of ibuprofen and dipyrone is highly dependent on the ph of the medium hydrophobic mechanisms are markedly dominant for rejection of ibuprofen unlike dipyrone which is a hydrophilic molecule and therefore mechanisms of exclusion by electrostatic repulsion dominate 5 ro membranes can remove efficiently almost all phacs studied with more than 98 rejection except for the acetaminophen and caffeine these are smaller molecules with high hydrophilicity and reduction of rejection occurs by sorption diffusion mechanisms depending on ph rejection by bw30 membrane is less influenced by electrostatic and hydrophobic effects in comparison to nf90 membrane
