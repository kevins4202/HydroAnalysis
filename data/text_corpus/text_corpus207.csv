between the atmosphere and hydrosphere which occurs naturally in all aquatic ecosystems nakajima et al 2013 rippy et al 2015 the sml covers 362 million km2 71 of the earth s surface and is one of the largest and most important interfaces on our planet aller et al 2005 engel et al 2017 the surface microlayer is an ecotone which impacts various earth fundamental processes including global biogeochemical cycling energy flow climate regulation gas flow between the hydrosphere and atmosphere temperature change and wind speed cunliffe et al 2013 ebling et al 2017 all these processes play a key role in proper functioning of the biosphere hörtnagl et al 2010 the surface microlayer is a gel like proteinaceous hydrated elastic biofilm that is composed mainly of transparent exopolymer particles cunliffe et al 2013 engel and galgani 2015 although the sml as a very dynamic structure is frequently disrupted by wind and ripples waves rainfall water circulation and other environmental perturbations surface microlayers are still remarkably persistent rippy et al 2015 indeed the results of stirred tank experiments suggest that microlayers can self reconstruct their original structure in less than a minute cunliffe et al 2013 according to santos et al 2013 and antonowicz et al 2015 several physical and biological processes such as diffusion flotation convection precipitation adhesion anthropogenic pollution turbulent mixing transport by bubbles primary and secondary production upwelling of subsurface water atmospheric deposition photodegradation and biodegradation contribute to the enrichment of the sml with various inorganic compounds and mainly particulate and dissolved organic matter when compared with the subsurface water ssw dissolved and particulate organic matter can be enriched up to 1000 times in the sml compared to ssw aller et al 2005 the surface microlayer is enriched mainly by the accumulation of organic matter such as proteins carbohydrates lipids nucleic acids chitin pectin and cellulose originating from multiple autochthonous and allochthonous sources the concentrations of which are controlled by various complex physicochemical and biological processes stolle et al 2011 cunliffe et al 2013 perliński et al 2017 the enrichment of organic matter can render the sml both in marine and freshwater ecosystems as a favourable habitat for microbial life zäncker et al 2017 studies agogué et al 2005 and santos et al 2013 has shown that the sml contains elevated numbers of heterotrophic and autotrophic organisms including cyanobacteria other bacteria flagellates algae and invertebrates the organisms within the sml are known collectively as neuston to distinguish from the subsurface plankton cunliffe et al 2013 kostrzewska szlakowska and kiersztyn 2017 the community of bacteria present within the surface microlayer is named bacterioneuston and it is the most numerous group of neustonic organisms antonowicz et al 2015 rahlff et al 2017 bacterioneuston plays an important role in biogeochemical processes in water air exchange of gases and biotransformation of organic matter accumulated in the

function of the sml it is necessary not only to determine its abundance secondary production enzymatic activity and physiological properties but also determine the phylogenetic diversity of that specific group of bacteria hence during recent years numerous investigations related to taxonomic structure of bacterioneuston in freshwater hervas and casamayor 2009 walczak and swiontek brzezinska

poland the catchment area of the river covers 1 623 km2 and over 60 of that area is exploited mainly for agricultural purposes perliński et al 2017 this river carries 15 5m3 s 1 of water into the baltic sea as well as 200 300 thous m3 y 1 of natural and anthropogenic sediments zawadzka 1996 the studied channel is 40 5 m wide and about 6 m deep and is located in the vicinity of the port in ustka 54 35 2n 16 21 2e fig 1 the port in ustka covers an area of 0 3 km2 and its main functions are fishery transport and marine tourism christowa et al 2007 the studied harbor channel is limited by two breakwaters of about 300 m length which are also the final part where the słupia river enters the sea selected chemical and microbiological parameters of the water in the marine harbor channel are presented in table 1 perliński et al 2017 analyzes performed on the bacterioplankton and bacterioneuston in this study were also made on the basis of data collected at the same sampling site the water samples from the channel in ustka were taken from four sites fig 1 site 1 located on the border between the słupia river and the studied channel site 2 located in the central part of the channel site 3 located in one of the water basins called the coal basin site 4 located at the site where the channel enters the sea i e near the heads of breakwaters the precise location of each sampling site was taken with a gps receiver installed on the board of the tugboat the water samples were collected during autumn a in 2012 and winter w spring sp and summer s in 2013 the surface microlayer sml samples thickness 150 250 μm were collected with a 75 75 cm garrett net garrett 1965 of 0 14 mm mesh size the water collected in the net was scrapped off with the wiper and the sample was collected in a sterile bottle the subsurface water was collected at about 0 5 m depth with a horizontal van dorn water sampler adapted for the collection of the samples in flowing water mudroch and macknight 1994 the collected water samples were transferred to sterile bottles using the drain valve prior to sampling the garret net and van dorn sampler were rinsed with distilled sterile water and ethyl alcohol the collected samples of water were transported to the laboratory in ice containers at a temperature that did not exceed 7 c the time between the sample collection and bacteriological analyses usually did not exceed 2 3 h 2 2 determination of phylogenetic groups of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton and their abundance phylogenetic bacterial groups and their cell abundance in the sml and ssw of the studied channel were determined by in situ hybridization fish technique using fluorescence labeled rrna targeted oligonucleotide probes the probe sequences hybridization conditions and references used in this study are given in table 2 for the determination of selected phylogenetic groups of bacteria 20 cm3 of each water sample was fixed with freshly prepared formaldehyde final concentration 4 and filtered through white polycarbonate filters with a diameter of 47 mm and a pore size of 0 2 μm filters were removed from the filtration apparatus rinsed with sterile distilled water air dried and stored at 20 c until the analysis in the laboratory fish hybridization was performed according to glöckner et al 1996 and walczak and swiontek brzezinska 2010 prior to hybridization the thawed filters were cut into small sections the filter sections were placed on glass slides and covered with 20 µl of hybridization solution containing 0 9 m nacl 20 mm tris hcl ph 7 4 0 01 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds variable 0 35 formamide concentrations and 50 ng of cy 3 labeled oligonucleotide hybridizations were carried out at 46 c for 2 h in an equilibrated sealed moisture chamber after hybridization the filters were transferred to wash solution containing 20 mm tris hcl ph 7 4 5 mm edta 0 01 10 sds and a recommended concentration of nacl determined by formamide concentration from hybridization buffer after hybridization cells were stained with sterile 50µg of dapi 4 6 diamidino 2 phenyl indol fluka per cm3 for 15 min in the dark then rinsed with 70 ethanol and air dried on whatman 3m paper the filters were placed on a glass slide mounted with the 4 1 mix of citifluor and vectashield vector laboratories to minimize bleaching walczak and swiontek brzezinska 2010 nikard et al 2014 hybridized

magnification 1000x in all cases bacteria were counted in 20 different fields with minimum of 200 cells abundance per 1 cm3 of water was calculated according to the formula n a b v 1 proposed by zimmermann and meyer reil 1974 where n total number of bacteria in 1 cm3 a average number of bacterial cells in one field of view on the surface of the photo b number of fields of view per filter

of dispersion cd were determined according to velji and albright 1986 in order to compare the investigated layers i e the surface microlayer sml and subsurface water ssw we applied average enrichment factors ef calculated according to the formula presented by santos et al 2013 ef csml cssw where csml and cssw are mean amounts of analysed parameters ef value 1 0 is defined as enrichment while ef value 1 0 as depletion the correlation between the levels of the studied bacteriological parameters was assessed with the spearman rank order test the significance of differences in bacteriological parameters among the sites layers and seasons was assessed by a two way anova according to incera et al 2003 in order to group the analysed parameters as to their specific properties the cluster analysis the ward method and euclidean distance based on ef were applied according to statsoft inc 2012 3 results in the water of the studied channel total prokaryotic cells tpc number varied from a minimum of 2 9 to a maximum of 14 7 cells 105 cm 3 with the mean value equal to 6 6 cells 105 cm 3 during the studied annual cycle table 3 among five studied taxonomic bacterial groups the dominant throughout the year were gammaproteobacteria class and cytophaga flavobacterium group accounting for about one third 28 33 of total bacterial number vibrio and pseudomonas genera were the least abundant in the studied channel accounting for only 6 8 of all identified bacteria the pattern of abundance of taxonomic bacterial groups in the water showed typical ranking i e gammaproteobacteria cytophaga flavobacterium marine alpha cluster pseudomonas vibrio the total prokaryotic cells number in the water along the vertical profiles shows changes fig 2 this parameter was higher in the surface microlayer 6 2 12 4 cells 105 cm 3 than in the subsurface water 3 6 5 7 cells 105 cm 3 based on the values of enrichment factor ef we found that tpc number determined for the sml was on average 1 5 to 2 1 times higher than for the ssw studied show the differences in total prokaryotic cell number along the horizontal profile of the studied channel the maximum values 12 4 cells 105 cm 3 of tpc number in the surface microlayer and subsurface water 5 7 cells 105 cm 3 were determined at the site located on the border between the słupia river and the channel site 1 the lowest total numbers of prokaryotic cell in the sml 6 2 cells 105 cm 3 and ssw 3 6 cells 105 cm 3 were noted in seawater zone site 4 fig 2 data referring to taxonomic differentiation of bacteria inhabiting the surface microlayer and subsurface water are presented in fig 3 we found very similar taxonomic profiles of bacteria in the sml and ssw the bacterial assemblage of both studied water layers was dominated by gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium vibrio and pseudomonas which belong to the class gammaproteobacteria represented a small fraction of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton in the studied channel these data indicate also that all studied taxonomic groups inhabited the surface microlayer more often than subsurface water the highest enrichment factors were recorded in the numbers of gammaproteobacteria ef 2 7 and cytophaga flavobacterium ef 2 5 while the lowest enrichment factors were determined in pseudomonas number ef 1 7 the abundance of five phylogenetic groups of bacteria along the horizontal profile of the studied channel is presented in fig 4 it is also evident from this study that the abundance of the studied taxonomic groups was relatively constant across longitude profile of the studied water basin only gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium occurred most frequently at site 3 and 4 the results shown in fig 5 indicate that the total numbers of prokaryotic cell as well as the abundance of the studied phylogenetic bacterial groups were subject to seasonal fluctuation in winter tpc number was low while the highest numbers of bacteria were recorded during summer and then they decreased during autumn gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium were the most abundant in summer and the lowest numbers of both taxonomic groups were noted in winter in general the abundance of marine alpha cluster varied only slightly across the seasons the numbers of genera pseudomonas peaked in autumn and the highest number of genera vibrio was observed in winter by grouping the results by the sites layers and seasons the factorial anova test was carried out to detect significant differences between the tpc number and abundance of five studied phylogenetic groups table 4 the studied microbiological parameters except abundance of vibrio differed significantly between the studied layers and also expect total number of prokaryotic cell and abundance marine alpha cluster between the seasons total prokaryotic cells number and the abundance of all phylogenetic groups did not differ significantly between the study sites the results of hierarchical dendrogram analysis of the studied phylogenetic groups showed two distinct clusters fig 6 the first cluster 1 comprised three taxonomic groups marine alpha cluster pseudomonas vibrio while the second cluster 2 comprised gammaproteobacteria and flavobacterium cytophaga 4 discussion bacteria play a key role in functioning of aquatic ecosystems and hence the basic parameter used to describe the structure of bacteriocenosis populations in all water basins are their total number and phylogenetic groups mary et al 2006 lo giudice et al 2012 total prokaryotic cell number inhabiting the słupia river estuary comprising the studied channel varied from 2 2 to 14 7 105 cells cm 3 this range was consistent with the ranges reported in other river estuaries such as the lena river estuary 2 0 9 0 105 cells cm 3 saliot et al 1996 hudson river estuary 5 0 16 0 105 cells cm 3 findley et al 1992 minho river estuary 5 4 9 2 105 cells cm 3 anne et al 2006 and the harbor channel of the river buffalo 2 7 16 0 105 cells cm 3 pettibone 1996 taxonomic differentiation of bacterial community inhabiting water in the harbor channel in ustka showed that gammaproteobacteria dominated among five studied phylogenetic groups a high abundance of the gammaproteobacteria population among aquatic bacteria has been documented by the results of many studies the dominance of this phylogenetic group of bacteria has been reported earlier from a variety of estuaries cottrell and kirchman 2003 zhang et al 2003 coastal zones agogué et al 2005 simanato et al 2010 and marine environments cho and hwang 2011 nikard et al 2014 such a large number of gammaproteobacteria in the studied channel most probably is due to the fact that those bacteria have particular genes generating high proteolytic activity alonso et al 2010 in the water of the studied channel protein concentration 21 0 23 8 μg dm 3 and percentage of proteolytic bacteria 23 77 were high perliński et al 2017 and consequently it could induce a high abundance of gammaproteobacteria observed in our study cytophaga flavobacterium was the second most abundant phylogenetic group in the studied channel high proportion of this taxonomic group among bacteria in freshwater and marine environments has been reported in several studies walczak and swiontek brzezinska 2010 arnosti et al 2012 cytophaga flavobacterium has a large number of genes encoding enzymes involved in organic macromolecules hydrolysis and mineralization xu et al 2003 for this reason members of the cytophaga flavobacterium group have often been described as organisms characterized by metabolically high activity able to aerobically degrade complex polymers including high molecular weight compounds such as proteins carbohydrates and lipids hempel et al 2008 which are numerous in the water of the studied channel we distinguished the genera vibrio and pseudomonas from the gammaproteobacteria class due to the fact that these bacteria are potentially pathogenic mudryk et al 2014 this was important in the conducted research due to the fact that the study was carried out in heavily polluted with anthropogenic waste harbour channel where direct contact water people is possible franklin et al 2005 in the north sea showed that more than a half of isolated bacteria were vibrio while in the water of the studied channel that taxonomic genera was the least represented group of bacteria which corresponds to taxonomic bacterial diversity in the takayama river kenzaka et al 1998 the small number of genera vibrio in freshwater and brackish water in the studied channel is probably due to the fact that these bacteria are typical marine organisms which require salt for growth hagström et al 2000 riemann et al 2008 the results of the present study indicated that in the studied channel bacteria occurred more frequently in the surface microlayer compared to subsurface water similarly the research carried out in inland basins walczak and swiontek brzezinska 2010 kostrzewska szlakowska and kiersztyn 2017 estuaries santos et al 2009 and marine environments stolle et al 2011 nakajima et al 2013 demonstrated that the greatest abundance of bacteria was recorded in the surface microlayer and it decreased with the depth the higher bacterial abundance in the sml than ssw could have resulted from many different biotic and abiotic factors high accumulation of macromolecular organic compounds within the surface microlayer like proteins carbohydrates and lipids generate optimal conditions for the development and accumulation of bacterioneuston cunliffe et al 2013 antonowicz et al 2015 besides bacteria inhabiting the surface microlayer are characterised by the presence in the external cell structures of mucopolysaccharides glycoproteins phosphocholine and lecithin polymers which being hydrophobic show properties of active attachment to the surface layer antonowicz et al 2015 zdanowicz and mudryk 2017 at the same time many flagellated planktonic bacteria are able to move from deeper water to the surface layer by diffusion obernosterer et al 2005 nakajima et al 2013 according to vila costa et al 2013 and perliński and mudryk 2017 also solid and liquid atmospheric precipitation can contribute to large amounts of bacteria in the surface microlayer the taxonomic composition of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton of the port channel in ustka was dominated by gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium according to agogué et al 2005 such composition indicates that the surface microlayer species are not different from underlying water species in the studied channel gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium were two fold more abundant among bacterioneuston when compared to bacterioplankton the dominance of these taxonomic groups in bacterioneuston confirms the results of previous studies franklin et al 2005 obernosterer et al 2008 coelho et al 2010 drudge and warren 2014 gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium are dominant members of the bacterioneuston communities probably due to their ability to respond quickly to substrate availability and their high tolerance to bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect of uv radiation stolle et al 2011 rahlff et al 2017 agogué et al 2005 in their study reported that almost half of the isolates from the coastal waters of the mediterranean belonging to gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium showed high resistance to ultraviolet radiation the results of the present study indicated different total number of prokaryotic cell along the spatial profile of both studied water layers in the studied harbor channel the total number of neustonic and planktonic prokaryotic cell was the highest in freshwater zone site 1 and the lowest in seawater zone site 4 probably this variation in the number of prokaryotic cell along the horizontal profile of the harbor channel in ustka may be the effect of changes in water salinity generally a gradient of decreasing tpc number with increasing salinity has been observed in different water basins cunliffe et al 2009 lefort and gasol 2013 and these facts correspond well with our results the relation between prokaryotic cell number and salinity in water ecosystems is negative because bacteria require more energy for the production of osmolytes and less for reproduction cunha et al 2010 perliński et al 2017 beside changes in salinity also estuarine hydrodynamics may impact total prokaryotic cell number according to santos et al 2011 in the ria de aveiro estuary tbn was lower in hydrodynamic zone seawater zone whereas it was higher in more stable zone freshwater and brackish water zone we reported similar results from the channel in ustka according to coelho et al 2010 and nikrad et al 2014 taxonomic diversity of bacteriocenoses in water basins may reflect the variation in concentration availability and degradability of organic matter as well as changes in the level of metabolic activity of microbial populations in our study based on the anova test there were no statistically significant differences in the abundance of the studied taxonomic groups among the study sites of the channel in ustka these results may suggest homogeneity in the composition of organic compounds and lack of differences in their concentrations along the horizontal profile of the studied water basin that corresponds well with the results of earlier studies mudryk and podgórska 2006 walczak and swiontek brzezinska 2010 based on our research it was found that the total number of prokaryotic cell in the port channel in ustka showed seasonal variability the maximum total number of prokaryotic cell in the studied water basin was observed in the summer season these summer maxima correspond with the results obtained in other estuaries marine waters mary et al 2006 takenaka et al 2007 and freshwater reservoirs antonowicz et al 2015 zdanowicz and mudryk 2017 according to these authors the main stimulus for the growth of bacteria in summer is the intensive development of phytoplankton which releases assimilates that are immediately used by bacteria as food or energy substrate summer maxima of the total number of prokaryotic cell in the examined coastal channel may also be the effect of relatively high temperatures at this time of year mudryk and skórczewski 2007 zdanowicz and mudryk 2017 according to cottrell and kirchman 2000 and takenaka et al 2007 temperature is one of the most important environmental factors directly governing bacterial activity resulting in high bacterial abundance our results showed that similar to prokaryotic cell number seasonal variation in the number of determined taxonomic bacterial groups in the water of the studied channel was observed as well also böckelmann et al 2000 in the elbe river zwisler et al 2003 in lake constance and mary et al 2006 at the coastal station in the western english channel reported significant dynamics of seasonal changes in the number of taxonomic bacterial groups according to pinhassi and hagstrom 2000 and crump et al 2003 seasonal changes in abiotic and biotic parameters e g temperature po4 concentration lability of dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll most likely constitute strong structuring factors for microbial communities in different times of the year in water basins gammaproteobacteria and flavobacterium cytophaga were two taxonomic groups dominant in the water of the studied channel and they were the most abundant in summer similar results were obtained in the elbe and spittelwasser rivers brümmer et al 2000 and in eutrophic lake brzezno walczak and swiontek brzezinska 2010 bandekar et al 2016 suggested that high organic carbon concentration high level in primary productivity and very little sensitivity to solar insulation patterns in summer might be responsible for abundance and dominance of these taxonomic groups of bacteria and the results of our study support this thesis the authors of the present study do hope that their research will provide more knowledge about the abundance and phylogenetic diversity of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton inhabiting specific water reservoir i e marine harbor channel 5 conclusion in conclusion we showed that among bacteria inhabiting the surface microlayer and subsurface water in dynamic biotope which is marine harbor channel two phylogenetic groups dominated gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium potentially pathogenic vibrio and pseudomonas represented only a small fraction of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton in the studied channel as well as in the baltic sea the results presented here indicate that all studied taxonomic groups inhabited the surface microlayer more often than subsurface water this study showed also that the abundance of the studied taxonomic groups was relatively constant across longitude profile of the studied water basin and all studied phylogenetic bacterial groups were subject to seasonal fluctuation in our opinion in order to better characterize the prokaryotic community structure in the ustka channel in the future more comprehensive studies like 16s rrna amplicon sequencing analysis should be used in the study of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton colonizing this

used in this study are given in table 2 for the determination of selected phylogenetic groups of bacteria 20 cm3 of each water sample was fixed with freshly prepared formaldehyde final concentration 4 and filtered through white polycarbonate filters with a diameter of 47 mm and a pore size of 0 2 μm filters were removed from the filtration apparatus rinsed with sterile distilled water air dried and stored at 20 c until the analysis in the laboratory fish hybridization was performed according to glöckner et al 1996 and walczak and swiontek brzezinska 2010 prior to hybridization the thawed filters were cut into small sections the filter sections were placed on glass slides and covered with 20 µl of hybridization solution containing 0 9 m nacl 20 mm tris hcl ph 7 4 0 01 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds variable 0 35 formamide concentrations and 50 ng of cy 3 labeled oligonucleotide hybridizations were carried out at 46 c for 2 h in an equilibrated sealed moisture chamber after hybridization the filters were transferred to wash solution containing 20 mm tris hcl ph 7 4 5 mm edta 0 01 10 sds and a recommended concentration of nacl determined by formamide concentration from hybridization buffer after hybridization cells were stained with sterile 50µg of dapi 4 6 diamidino 2 phenyl indol fluka per cm3 for 15 min in the dark then rinsed with 70 ethanol and air dried on whatman 3m paper the filters were placed on a glass slide mounted with the 4 1 mix of citifluor and vectashield vector laboratories to minimize bleaching walczak and swiontek brzezinska 2010 nikard et al 2014 hybridized and dapi stained cells were counted using olympus bx 41 epifluorescence microscope equipped with camera color view iii and fitted with cy 3 filter omega optic inc and dapi filter uv 2a at magnification 1000x in all cases bacteria were counted in 20 different fields with minimum of 200 cells abundance per 1 cm3 of water was calculated according to the formula n a b v 1 proposed by zimmermann and meyer reil 1974 where n total number of bacteria in 1 cm3 a average number of bacterial cells in one field of view on the surface of the photo b number of fields of view per filter

of dispersion cd were determined according to velji and albright 1986 in order to compare the investigated layers i e the surface microlayer sml and subsurface water ssw we applied average enrichment factors ef calculated according to the formula presented by santos et al 2013 ef csml cssw where csml and cssw are mean amounts of analysed parameters ef value 1 0 is defined as enrichment while ef value 1 0 as depletion the correlation between the levels of the studied bacteriological parameters was assessed with the spearman rank order test the significance of differences in bacteriological parameters among the sites layers and seasons was assessed by a two way anova according to incera et al 2003 in order to group the analysed parameters as to their specific properties the cluster analysis the ward method and euclidean distance based on ef were applied according to statsoft inc 2012 3 results in the water of the studied channel total prokaryotic cells tpc number varied from a minimum of 2 9 to a maximum of 14 7 cells 105 cm 3 with the mean value equal to 6 6 cells 105 cm 3 during the studied annual cycle table 3 among five studied taxonomic bacterial groups the dominant throughout the year were gammaproteobacteria class and cytophaga flavobacterium group accounting for about one third 28 33 of total bacterial number vibrio and pseudomonas genera were the least abundant in the studied channel accounting for only 6 8 of all identified bacteria the pattern of abundance of taxonomic bacterial groups in the water showed typical ranking i e gammaproteobacteria cytophaga flavobacterium marine alpha cluster pseudomonas vibrio the total prokaryotic cells number in the water along the vertical profiles shows changes fig 2 this parameter was higher in the surface microlayer 6 2 12 4 cells 105 cm 3 than in the subsurface water 3 6 5 7 cells 105 cm 3 based on the values of enrichment factor ef we found that tpc number determined for the sml was on average 1 5 to 2 1 times higher than for the ssw studied show the differences in total prokaryotic cell number along the horizontal profile of the studied channel the maximum values 12 4 cells 105 cm 3 of tpc number in the surface microlayer and subsurface water 5 7 cells 105 cm 3 were determined at the site located on the border between the słupia river and the channel site 1 the lowest total numbers of prokaryotic cell in the sml 6 2 cells 105 cm 3 and ssw 3 6 cells 105 cm 3 were noted in seawater zone site 4 fig 2 data referring to taxonomic differentiation of bacteria inhabiting the surface microlayer and subsurface water are presented in fig 3 we found very similar taxonomic profiles of bacteria in the sml and ssw the bacterial assemblage of both studied water layers was dominated by gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium vibrio and pseudomonas which belong to the class gammaproteobacteria represented a small fraction of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton in the studied channel these data indicate also that all studied taxonomic groups inhabited the surface microlayer more often than subsurface water the highest enrichment factors were recorded in the numbers of gammaproteobacteria ef 2 7 and cytophaga flavobacterium ef 2 5 while the lowest enrichment factors were determined in pseudomonas number ef 1 7 the abundance of five phylogenetic groups of bacteria along the horizontal profile of the studied channel is presented in fig 4 it is also evident from this study that the abundance of the studied taxonomic groups was relatively constant across longitude profile of the studied water basin only gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium occurred most frequently at site 3 and 4 the results shown in fig 5 indicate that the total numbers of prokaryotic cell as well as the abundance of the studied phylogenetic bacterial groups were subject to seasonal fluctuation in winter tpc number was low while the highest numbers of bacteria were recorded during summer and then they decreased during autumn gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium were the most abundant in summer and the lowest numbers of both taxonomic groups were noted in winter in general the abundance of marine alpha cluster varied only slightly across the seasons the numbers of genera pseudomonas peaked in autumn and the highest number of genera vibrio was observed in winter by grouping the results by the sites layers and seasons the factorial anova test was carried out to detect significant differences between the tpc number and abundance of five studied phylogenetic groups table 4 the studied microbiological parameters except abundance of vibrio differed significantly between the studied layers and also expect total number of prokaryotic cell and abundance marine alpha cluster between the seasons total prokaryotic cells number and the abundance of all phylogenetic groups did not differ significantly between the study sites the results of hierarchical dendrogram analysis of the studied phylogenetic groups showed two distinct clusters fig 6 the first cluster 1 comprised three taxonomic groups marine alpha cluster pseudomonas vibrio while the second cluster 2 comprised gammaproteobacteria and flavobacterium cytophaga 4 discussion bacteria play a key role in functioning of aquatic ecosystems and hence the basic parameter used to describe the structure of bacteriocenosis populations in all water basins are their total number and phylogenetic groups mary et al 2006 lo giudice et al 2012 total prokaryotic cell number inhabiting the słupia river estuary comprising the studied channel varied from 2 2 to 14 7 105 cells cm 3 this range was consistent with the ranges reported in other river estuaries such as the lena river estuary 2 0 9 0 105 cells cm 3 saliot et al 1996 hudson river estuary 5 0 16 0 105 cells cm 3 findley et al 1992 minho river estuary 5 4 9 2 105 cells cm 3 anne et al 2006 and the harbor channel of the river buffalo 2 7 16 0 105 cells cm 3 pettibone 1996 taxonomic differentiation of bacterial community inhabiting water in the harbor channel in ustka showed that gammaproteobacteria dominated among five studied phylogenetic groups a high abundance of the gammaproteobacteria population among aquatic bacteria has been documented by the results of many studies the dominance of this phylogenetic group of bacteria has been reported earlier from a variety of estuaries cottrell and kirchman 2003 zhang et al 2003 coastal zones agogué et al 2005 simanato et al 2010 and marine environments cho and hwang 2011 nikard et al 2014 such a large number of gammaproteobacteria in the studied channel most probably is due to the fact that those bacteria have particular genes generating high proteolytic activity alonso et al 2010 in the water of the studied channel protein concentration 21 0 23 8 μg dm 3 and percentage of proteolytic bacteria 23 77 were high perliński et al 2017 and consequently it could induce a high abundance of gammaproteobacteria observed in our study cytophaga flavobacterium was the second most abundant phylogenetic group in the studied channel high proportion of this taxonomic group among bacteria in freshwater and marine environments has been reported in several studies walczak and swiontek brzezinska 2010 arnosti et al 2012 cytophaga flavobacterium has a large number of genes encoding enzymes involved in organic macromolecules hydrolysis and mineralization xu et al 2003 for this reason members of the cytophaga flavobacterium group have often been described as organisms characterized by metabolically high activity able to aerobically degrade complex polymers including high molecular weight compounds such as proteins carbohydrates and lipids hempel et al 2008 which are numerous in the water of the studied channel we distinguished the genera vibrio and pseudomonas from the gammaproteobacteria class due to the fact that these bacteria are potentially pathogenic mudryk et al 2014 this was important in the conducted research due to the fact that the study was carried out in heavily polluted with anthropogenic waste harbour channel where direct contact water people is possible franklin et al 2005 in the north sea showed that more than a half of isolated bacteria were vibrio while in the water of the studied channel that taxonomic genera was the least represented group of bacteria which corresponds to taxonomic bacterial diversity in the takayama river kenzaka et al 1998 the small number of genera vibrio in freshwater and brackish water in the studied channel is probably due to the fact that these bacteria are typical marine organisms which require salt for growth hagström et al 2000 riemann et al 2008 the results of the present study indicated that in the studied channel bacteria occurred more frequently in the surface microlayer compared to subsurface water similarly the research carried out in inland basins walczak and swiontek brzezinska 2010 kostrzewska szlakowska and kiersztyn 2017 estuaries santos et al 2009 and marine environments stolle et al 2011 nakajima et al 2013 demonstrated that the greatest abundance of bacteria was recorded in the surface microlayer and it decreased with the depth the higher bacterial abundance in the sml than ssw could have resulted from many different biotic and abiotic factors high accumulation of macromolecular organic compounds within the surface microlayer like proteins carbohydrates and lipids generate optimal conditions for the development and accumulation of bacterioneuston cunliffe et al 2013 antonowicz et al 2015 besides bacteria inhabiting the surface microlayer are characterised by the presence in the external cell structures of mucopolysaccharides glycoproteins phosphocholine and lecithin polymers which being hydrophobic show properties of active attachment to the surface layer antonowicz et al 2015 zdanowicz and mudryk 2017 at the same time many flagellated planktonic bacteria are able to move from deeper water to the surface layer by diffusion obernosterer et al 2005 nakajima et al 2013 according to vila costa et al 2013 and perliński and mudryk 2017 also solid and liquid atmospheric precipitation can contribute to large amounts of bacteria in the surface microlayer the taxonomic composition of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton of the port channel in ustka was dominated by gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium according to agogué et al 2005 such composition indicates that the surface microlayer species are not different from underlying water species in the studied channel gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium were two fold more abundant among bacterioneuston when compared to bacterioplankton the dominance of these taxonomic groups in bacterioneuston confirms the results of previous studies franklin et al 2005 obernosterer et al 2008 coelho et al 2010 drudge and warren 2014 gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium are dominant members of the bacterioneuston communities probably due to their ability to respond quickly to substrate availability and their high tolerance to bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect of uv radiation stolle et al 2011 rahlff et al 2017 agogué et al 2005 in their study reported that almost half of the isolates from the coastal waters of the mediterranean belonging to gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium showed high resistance to ultraviolet radiation the results of the present study indicated different total number of prokaryotic cell along the spatial profile of both studied water layers in the studied harbor channel the total number of neustonic and planktonic prokaryotic cell was the highest in freshwater zone site 1 and the lowest in seawater zone site 4 probably this variation in the number of prokaryotic cell along the horizontal profile of the harbor channel in ustka may be the effect of changes in water salinity generally a gradient of decreasing tpc number with increasing salinity has been observed in different water basins cunliffe et al 2009 lefort and gasol 2013 and these facts correspond well with our results the relation between prokaryotic cell number and salinity in water ecosystems is negative because bacteria require more energy for the production of osmolytes and less for reproduction cunha et al 2010 perliński et al 2017 beside changes in salinity also estuarine hydrodynamics may impact total prokaryotic cell number according to santos et al 2011 in the ria de aveiro estuary tbn was lower in hydrodynamic zone seawater zone whereas it was higher in more stable zone freshwater and brackish water zone we reported similar results from the channel in ustka according to coelho et al 2010 and nikrad et al 2014 taxonomic diversity of bacteriocenoses in water basins may reflect the variation in concentration availability and degradability of organic matter as well as changes in the level of metabolic activity of microbial populations in our study based on the anova test there were no statistically significant differences in the abundance of the studied taxonomic groups among the study sites of the channel in ustka these results may suggest homogeneity in the composition of organic compounds and lack of differences in their concentrations along the horizontal profile of the studied water basin that corresponds well with the results of earlier studies mudryk and podgórska 2006 walczak and swiontek brzezinska 2010 based on our research it was found that the total number of prokaryotic cell in the port channel in ustka showed seasonal variability the maximum total number of prokaryotic cell in the studied water basin was observed in the summer season these summer maxima correspond with the results obtained in other estuaries marine waters mary et al 2006 takenaka et al 2007 and freshwater reservoirs antonowicz et al 2015 zdanowicz and mudryk 2017 according to these authors the main stimulus for the growth of bacteria in summer is the intensive development of phytoplankton which releases assimilates that are immediately used by bacteria as food or energy substrate summer maxima of the total number of prokaryotic cell in the examined coastal channel may also be the effect of relatively high temperatures at this time of year mudryk and skórczewski 2007 zdanowicz and mudryk 2017 according to cottrell and kirchman 2000 and takenaka et al 2007 temperature is one of the most important environmental factors directly governing bacterial activity resulting in high bacterial abundance our results showed that similar to prokaryotic cell number seasonal variation in the number of determined taxonomic bacterial groups in the water of the studied channel was observed as well also böckelmann et al 2000 in the elbe river zwisler et al 2003 in lake constance and mary et al 2006 at the coastal station in the western english channel reported significant dynamics of seasonal changes in the number of taxonomic bacterial groups according to pinhassi and hagstrom 2000 and crump et al 2003 seasonal changes in abiotic and biotic parameters e g temperature po4 concentration lability of dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll most likely constitute strong structuring factors for microbial communities in different times of the year in water basins gammaproteobacteria and flavobacterium cytophaga were two taxonomic groups dominant in the water of the studied channel and they were the most abundant in summer similar results were obtained in the elbe and spittelwasser rivers brümmer et al 2000 and in eutrophic lake brzezno walczak and swiontek brzezinska 2010 bandekar et al 2016 suggested that high organic carbon concentration high level in primary productivity and very little sensitivity to solar insulation patterns in summer might be responsible for abundance and dominance of these taxonomic groups of bacteria and the results of our study support this thesis the authors of the present study do hope that their research will provide more knowledge about the abundance and phylogenetic diversity of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton inhabiting specific water reservoir i e marine harbor channel 5 conclusion in conclusion we showed that among bacteria inhabiting the surface microlayer and subsurface water in dynamic biotope which is marine harbor channel two phylogenetic groups dominated gammaproteobacteria and cytophaga flavobacterium potentially pathogenic vibrio and pseudomonas represented only a small fraction of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton in the studied channel as well as in the baltic sea the results presented here indicate that all studied taxonomic groups inhabited the surface microlayer more often than subsurface water this study showed also that the abundance of the studied taxonomic groups was relatively constant across longitude profile of the studied water basin and all studied phylogenetic bacterial groups were subject to seasonal fluctuation in our opinion in order to better characterize the prokaryotic community structure in the ustka channel in the future more comprehensive studies like 16s rrna amplicon sequencing analysis should be used in the study of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton colonizing this

1036,to investigate how habitat type influences species diversity and distribution of algae 115 sampling sites across eight different habitats stream spring lake pool wetland ditch trough hot spring were randomly sampled from ağrı province turkey a total of 392 algal taxa gamma diversity were identified of which 212 taxa 54 08 belonged to bacillariophyta while the rest 180 taxa belonged to seven other groups chlorophyta charophyta euglenophyta cyanobacteria miozoa ochrophyta and cryptophyta 150 taxa were encountered only once the highest alpha diversity was found in ditches h 4 57 235 taxa followed by streams h 4 40 238 taxa and the lowest diversity was recovered in troughs h 2 62 42 taxa relatively high whittaker s beta diversity bw 19 indicated a low level of similarity among sampling sites suggesting that no common taxonomic group was solely effective enough to change dominancy level of any species among the habitats the first two axes of canonical correspondence analysis accounted for 58 1 of the total variance in the occurrence of 152 algal taxa all taxa recovered from more than three samples and described gradients across four environmental variables habitat type ph elevation and water temperature ditches significantly contribution to alpha and gamma diversity in the province although they have relatively small surface area and shallow water compared to other habitat types high alpha diversity in ditches may be related to the positive effect of geographic and climatic factors in mountainous area future possibilities are discussed keywords algae distribution diversity measures altitude ecological factors 1 introduction whittaker 1972 defined three measures of biodiversity across spatial scales alpha α beta β and gamma γ diversity gamma diversity is the total diversity all species accounted in a region while alpha diversity refers to diversity within a given area or ecosystem usually expressed by the number of species or species richness in that ecosystem or habitat beta diversity measures the variation differences or dissimilarities of species diversity between two or more different habitats or ecosystems in other words measures of beta diversity attempt to quantify the number of different species between two or more habitats high beta diversity indices represent a high degree of dissimilarity while a low index value represents a high level of similarity legendre et al 2005 argued that beta diversity is a key concept for understanding ecosystem function and for managing biodiversity studies dealing with biodiversity estimation and distribution of aquatic organisms are generally carried out in large and or continuous water bodies like rivers and lakes della bella et al 2007 nabout et al 2007 passy and blanchet 2007 schuster et al 2015 bortolini et al 2017 jamoneau et al 2018 marra et al 2018 dunck et al 2019 pound et al 2019 in contrast shallow and small temporary waters have been received less attention one of the extensive studies was conducted in water filled tree caves which were classified as microhabitat williams 2006 water filled tree holes are one of the phytotelma habitat plant held waters that host diverse aquatic flora and especially aquatic fauna lackey 1940 maguire 1971 frank and lounibos 1983 yanoviak 1999 kitching 2000 temporary water bodies e g wetlands ditches vary greatly in surface area and volume and can dry out quickly with variable frequencies and variable seasonality arle 2002 williams 2006 however such habitats are well known as reproductive and developmental areas for semi terrestrial and semi aquatic organisms some of previous studies have documented high faunal aquatic insects amphibian etc biodiversity in temporary water bodies williams 2006 therefore temporary water bodies are described as the cinderellas of aquatic science because of being an important component of global landscape williams 2006 for example nicolet et al 2004 discussed the importance of temporary ponds as habitat for rare plant species lukács et al 2013 illustrated the importance of temporary pools for the conservation of high alpha and beta plant diversity külköylüoğlu et al 2013 found relatively high ostracod crustacea diversity in troughs or so called artificially natural habitats accordingly temporary wetlands natural or artificial with small surface size and shallow waters are considered as important habitats for diversity of taxa armitage et al 2003 williams 2006 de bie et al 2008 külköylüoğlu et al 2013 in recent years the number of studies investigating species diversity in temporary wetlands has increased reflecting a growing interest and recognition of the importance of these habitats e g williams et al 2003 de bie et al 2008 balian et al 2010 stendera et al 2012 akdemir et al 2016 külköylüoğlu et al 2019 but studies on the diversity of algae in different aquatic bodies are quite limited yung et al 1986 cardoso et al 2012 zarei darki 2011 2012 the first study in eastern anatolia conducted by ehrenberg 1845 was focused on the diatoms of the murat river the biggest tributary of the euphrates from the hillside of tendürek mountain diyadin ağrı province in the border of muş province turkey the second study in the region was conducted by altuner 2017 however sampling sites in these studies are not located within the boundaries of ağrı province therefore the current research is the first extensive study on algal flora in the region the present study provides an important contribution to our understanding of algal species richness biodiversity and distribution in different aquatic bodies of ağrı province in turkey the aims of the study are i to investigate the role of habitat types on algal community composition in the ağrı province ii to determine correlation between environmental factors and algal species distribution and iii to compare diversity levels i e alpha beta and gamma species diversity of algae among eight different aquatic habitats in the province 2 materials and methods one hundred and fifteen different aquatic sites representing 11 different habitat types in ağrı province in eastern anatolia were randomly sampled between 13 17 may 2015 by külköylüoğlu et al 2019 fig 1 fifteen sampling sites did not include specimens and were excluded from the analyses sampling sites were categorized as one of eight different aquatic habitats as follows lake 8 pond 10 wetland 5 stream 47 spring 7 trough 4 ditch 18 and thermal water 1 during field work 10 different environmental variables ph dissolved oxygen do mg l water and air temperature t c electrical conductivity ec μs cm salinity ppt atmospheric pressure mmhg moisture wind speed m s elevation m were measured in situ before sampling a ysi multi professional plus was used to measure the first six variables and a testo 410 2 model anemometer was used to measure the remaining variables table 1 coordinates of each sampling site were recorded with a garmin etrex vista h gps table 1 more detailed information about the study area can be found in külköylüoğlu et al 2019 algal samples were collected in 250 ml plastic bottles and fixed with 4 formaldehyde solution in situ along with water samples filamentous algae and bottom sludge a mixture of epilithic and epipelic biofilms and well conditioned detritus samples were also collected according to the characteristics of the sampling sites samples were kept in coolers and brought to the limnology research laboratory of bursa uludağ university at least 300

only significant p 0 05 variables were used in the final cca analysis taxa with three or fewer occurrences were excluded from the analyses 152 taxa were included to minimize the influence of rare taxa and or habitats with relatively low species numbers relative abundance of taxa and environmental variables were log transformed to reduce the arch effect of variables on ordination scores however

richness of resident species and rate of migration to the habitat species diversity and richness 4 software seaby and henderson 2006 was used for the calculation of both diversity indexes and

five algal divisions with the highest species richness values for different habitat types are given in table 5 bacillariophyta diversity was highest in streams followed by ditches table 5 fig 6 chlorophyta charophyta and cyanobacteria diversity was highest in ditches followed by streams euglenophyta diversity was highest in ditches and wetlands simper analyses revealed that 16 algal taxa 15 were diatoms accounted for 70 of the total similarity table 5 while 52 taxa accounted for 90 of the total similarity appendix among the 16 algal most similar taxa three diatom species nitzschia linearis n palea and ulnaria ulna accounted for 34 of the total similarity six diatom species nitzschia palea n frustulum n linearis hantzschia amphioxys surirella minuta ulnaria ulna had shannon wiener alpha species diversity values above 3 and the index value h of all species was 4 444 with a jackknife standard error of 0 02119 table 5 4 discussion finding 392 algal taxa γ diversity with relatively high alpha h 4 444 and beta 19 diversity values suggested high variation in the species composition at the local and regional scale of the ağrı province where diatoms accounted 54 of the total number of taxa this finding is consistent with the earlier studies that showed the benthic zones of the rivers and the lakes diatoms were indeed the most dominant group with relatively high diversity abundance and occurrences compared to other algal groups lowe and laliberte 2017 most researchers associate this kind of dominancy and frequent occurrences of diatoms for the cosmopolitan characteristics of the group van dam et al 1994 vanormelingen et al 2008 solak et al 2012 solak and wojtal 2012 in the present study 15 out of 16 species responsible for 70 of the total similarity among habitats were the diatoms observed most commonly during the present study table 5 similar to our findings different studies showed that these diatom species are indeed the most common species in turkey aysel 2005 solak et al 2012 solak and wojtal 2012 such species are also known as ecological generalists kociolek and spaulding 2000 however our results differ from those of some other studies for example zarei darki 2011 studied five different water bodies in iran and found highest species richness in the chloropyta 35 of the total taxa followed by bacillariophyta 23 5 the findings in our study suggest that climatic factors temperature regional differences altitudinal gradient and environmental factors are important determinants in algal species diversity and the predominance of algal divisions barinova 2011 revealed that altitude is a major factor that influenced diatom diversity and distributions in ecoregions of eastern mediterranean israel indeed barinova et al 2013 stated that increasing species rate of diatoms was corresponded to increasing altitude at mountainous areas in pakistan in the present study alpha diversity h was highest in ditches streams and wetlands respectively table 3 similarly külköylüoğlu et al 2019 found the highest alpha diversity for freshwater ostracods collected during the same sampling campaign in streams ditches and ponds uçak et al 2014 reported the highest and lowest alpha diversity values for non marine ostracod species where in natural habitats e g ponds streams springs and creeks and artificial habitats e g canals troughs respectively in contrast de bie et al 2008 documented the highest species richness of cladocerans in lakes however zarei darki 2011 found the highest algal species richness in reservoirs and rivers the lowest diversity values from that study were reported from lakes in total 241 taxa 61 48 occurred in three or fewer samples low occurrence values of algal species contributed to a high beta diversity value in ağrı province indicating highly variable species composition across sites the highest beta diversity values were found in streams and ditches pound et al 2019 argued that beta diversity was influenced by a combination of stress and heterogeneity this corresponds to our findings since both habitats streams and ditches are subjected to natural e g changes in water flow regimes due to dryness and artificial e g anthropogenic activities disturbances high beta diversity values from other habitats types in ağrı province may also be related to habitat heterogeneity passy and blanchet 2007 found that human impact e g stream restoration water discharge etc caused a significant decrease in beta diversity values by causing geomorphic degradation in streams similarly dunck et al 2019 indicated that cultural eutrophication increased functional homogeneity in urban wetlands causing an increase of algal species with similar ecological preferences these studies suggest that sensitive species are replaced by tolerant species e g cosmopolitan species causing a critical reduction in biodiversity as a response to habitat degradation we expected highest species richness in streams since the majorities 47 samples of samples were taken from streams sampling effort in ditches n 18 was nearly 2 5 times smaller than in streams but a similar number of taxa were reported from each habitat 238 and 235 taxa respectively table 3 similar species richness between these two habitats may be related to the characteristics of aquatic sites for example ditches are usually prone to dryness that most species urged to adapt such conditions on the other hand streams are always in movement and such movement prevent occurrence of many species in a certain site wetland habitats were one of the least sampled in the current study however the highest mean number of taxa per site was detected in wetland habitats 24 20 sampling effort must be considered when assessing relationships between species and environmental factors we argue that all of our habitat types have been sampled adequately to estimate species richness henderson s heterogeneity test also suggested heterogeneous distribution of algal taxa among sampling sites where actual numbers of species sampled correspond to the estimated species numbers the maximum number of taxa in a sample 66 was recovered from a ditch followed by a stream 61 and wetland 43 another remarkable point here is that the highest ranges of species richness minimum maximum values were also observed in these three habitat types table 3 we interpret this as a response to higher levels of disturbance in these habitat types the fluvial geomorphology of streams streambed structure flow velocity channel structure is different from other habitats and can cause high intensity disturbance for algae high flow disturbance can have negative effects on the colonization of algae and cause a reduction in taxa richness biggs and smith 2002 ditches are shallow habitats with depths less than 30 cm and small surface areas they have a short hydroperiod so they dry out rapidly during dry seasons especially in low rainfall and at high atmospheric temperatures however these habitats also present ideal reproductive conditions with high nutrient content for many organisms williams 2006 however illustrated that a decline in hydroperiod length caused a decrease in invertebrate species richness in three ditches in such aquatic habitats water temperature increases with increasing atmospheric temperature during the daytime and dissolved oxygen may reach high concentrations as a result of increasing algal photosynthetic activity algae can quickly colonize when environmental conditions are suitable for algal growth since they are microscopic organisms additionally algae generally have short lifespans relative to other aquatic organisms such as benthic macroinvertebrates and macrophytes wanormelingen et al 2008 noted that diatom community structure and diversity are affected by geographical factors independent of environmental conditions the significant effects of water temperature and elevation in the present study fig 3 support this hypothesis the study area is located in south east anatolia turkey and spans a substantial vertical gradient 1500 m large fluctuations in temperature and humidity are not observed in ağrı province due to its terrestrial climatic conditions the mean air temperature for the last 30 years is about 12 1 c and the average annual temperature is 6 2 c in may mgm 2019 consequently ditches may not have been strongly affected by temperature fluctations at least for the past 30 years using data collected during the same sampling campaign külköylüoğlu et al 2019 also found high non marine ostracod species richness referring to alpha diversity in ditch habitats due to the regional climatic conditions ditch habitats may be less ephemeral than elsewhere positively influencing alpha diversity in the province a good understanding of the physiology and ecology of temporary water bodies and modeling them to larger ecosystems can help to answer many ecological and evolutionary questions de meester et al 2005 bacillariophyta was the dominant group in all habitat types however the degree of dominance varies according to habitat types highest bacillariophyta taxa richness was observed in streams 161 taxa followed by ditches 118 taxa table 4 however bacillariophyta also made up the smallest proportion of taxa in ditch habitats 50 fig 6 the highest proportion of bacillariophyta occurred in spring habitats followed by the troughs troughs are examples of artificially transformed natural water bodies springs ground waters külköylüoğlu et al 2013 while springs are natural habitats in this study accordingly finding relatively similar abundance values for bacillariophyta in both habitats fig 6 can be associated with the number of common species of the group where most if not all algal species are tolerant to the environmental fluctuations the high number of algal taxa 392 taxa detected across habitat types in ağrı province shows the importance of large scale geographical sampling stomp et al 2011 stated that microorganism diversity may show significant geographical variation the high level of beta diversity in this study whittaker s ß 19 indicates a low level of similarity between sampling sites and there are no common species among many sampling sites 5 conclusions total of 392 algal taxa gamma diversity belonging to seven algal groups were identified from 100 sampling sites along with relatively high alpha h 4 946 and beta diversity bw 19 values diatoms were determined as the dominant group covering about 54 08 of the total species richness habitat type elevation and some phsico chemical variables water temperature and ph were found the most effective factors on algae species composition diversity and distribution in the

1036,to investigate how habitat type influences species diversity and distribution of algae 115 sampling sites across eight different habitats stream spring lake pool wetland ditch trough hot spring were randomly sampled from ağrı province turkey a total of 392 algal taxa gamma diversity were identified of which 212 taxa 54 08 belonged to bacillariophyta while the rest 180 taxa belonged to seven other groups chlorophyta charophyta euglenophyta cyanobacteria miozoa ochrophyta and cryptophyta 150 taxa were encountered only once the highest alpha diversity was found in ditches h 4 57 235 taxa followed by streams h 4 40 238 taxa and the lowest diversity was recovered in troughs h 2 62 42 taxa relatively high whittaker s beta diversity bw 19 indicated a low level of similarity among sampling sites suggesting that no common taxonomic group was solely effective enough to change dominancy level of any species among the habitats the first two axes of canonical correspondence analysis accounted for 58 1 of the total variance in the occurrence of 152 algal taxa all taxa recovered from more than three samples and described gradients across four environmental variables habitat type ph elevation and water temperature ditches significantly contribution to alpha and gamma diversity in the province although they have relatively small surface area and shallow water compared to other habitat types high alpha diversity in ditches may be related to the positive effect of geographic and climatic factors in mountainous area future possibilities are discussed keywords algae distribution diversity measures altitude ecological factors 1 introduction whittaker 1972 defined three measures of biodiversity across spatial scales alpha α beta β and gamma γ diversity gamma diversity is the total diversity all species accounted in a region while alpha diversity refers to diversity within a given area or ecosystem usually expressed by the number of species or species richness in that ecosystem or habitat beta diversity measures the variation differences or dissimilarities of species diversity between two or more different habitats or ecosystems in other words measures of beta diversity attempt to quantify the number of different species between two or more habitats high beta diversity indices represent a high degree of dissimilarity while a low index value represents a high level of similarity legendre et al 2005 argued that beta diversity is a key concept for understanding ecosystem function and for managing biodiversity studies dealing with biodiversity estimation and distribution of aquatic organisms are generally carried out in large and or continuous water bodies like rivers and lakes della bella et al 2007 nabout et al 2007 passy and blanchet 2007 schuster et al 2015 bortolini et al 2017 jamoneau et al 2018 marra et al 2018 dunck et al 2019 pound et al 2019 in contrast shallow and small temporary waters have been received less attention one of the extensive studies was conducted in water filled tree caves which were classified as microhabitat williams 2006 water filled tree holes are one of the phytotelma habitat plant held waters that host diverse aquatic flora and especially aquatic fauna lackey 1940 maguire 1971 frank and lounibos 1983 yanoviak 1999 kitching 2000 temporary water bodies e g wetlands ditches vary greatly in surface area and volume and can dry out quickly with variable frequencies and variable seasonality arle 2002 williams 2006 however such habitats are well known as reproductive and developmental areas for semi terrestrial and semi aquatic organisms some of previous studies have documented high faunal aquatic insects amphibian etc biodiversity in temporary water bodies williams 2006 therefore temporary water bodies are described as the cinderellas of aquatic science because of being an important component of global landscape williams 2006 for example nicolet et al 2004 discussed the importance of temporary ponds as habitat for rare plant species lukács et al 2013 illustrated the importance of temporary pools for the conservation of high alpha and beta plant diversity külköylüoğlu et al 2013 found relatively high ostracod crustacea diversity in troughs or so called artificially natural habitats accordingly temporary wetlands natural or artificial with small surface size and shallow waters are considered as important habitats for diversity of taxa armitage et al 2003 williams 2006 de bie et al 2008 külköylüoğlu et al 2013 in recent years the number of studies investigating species diversity in temporary wetlands has increased reflecting a growing interest and recognition of the importance of these habitats e g williams et al 2003 de bie et al 2008 balian et al 2010 stendera et al 2012 akdemir et al 2016 külköylüoğlu et al 2019 but studies on the diversity of algae in different aquatic bodies are quite limited yung et al 1986 cardoso et al 2012 zarei darki 2011 2012 the first study in eastern anatolia conducted by ehrenberg 1845 was focused on the diatoms of the murat river the biggest tributary of the euphrates from the hillside of tendürek mountain diyadin ağrı province in the border of muş province turkey the second study in the region was conducted by altuner 2017 however sampling sites in these studies are not located within the boundaries of ağrı province therefore the current research is the first extensive study on algal flora in the region the present study provides an important contribution to our understanding of algal species richness biodiversity and distribution in different aquatic bodies of ağrı province in turkey the aims of the study are i to investigate the role of habitat types on algal community composition in the ağrı province ii to determine correlation between environmental factors and algal species distribution and iii to compare diversity levels i e alpha beta and gamma species diversity of algae among eight different aquatic habitats in the province 2 materials and methods one hundred and fifteen different aquatic sites representing 11 different habitat types in ağrı province in eastern anatolia were randomly sampled between 13 17 may 2015 by külköylüoğlu et al 2019 fig 1 fifteen sampling sites did not include specimens and were excluded from the analyses sampling sites were categorized as one of eight different aquatic habitats as follows lake 8 pond 10 wetland 5 stream 47 spring 7 trough 4 ditch 18 and thermal water 1 during field work 10 different environmental variables ph dissolved oxygen do mg l water and air temperature t c electrical conductivity ec μs cm salinity ppt atmospheric pressure mmhg moisture wind speed m s elevation m were measured in situ before sampling a ysi multi professional plus was used to measure the first six variables and a testo 410 2 model anemometer was used to measure the remaining variables table 1 coordinates of each sampling site were recorded with a garmin etrex vista h gps table 1 more detailed information about the study area can be found in külköylüoğlu et al 2019 algal samples were collected in 250 ml plastic bottles and fixed with 4 formaldehyde solution in situ along with water samples filamentous algae and bottom sludge a mixture of epilithic and epipelic biofilms and well conditioned detritus samples were also collected according to the characteristics of the sampling sites samples were kept in coolers and brought to the limnology research laboratory of bursa uludağ university at least 300 individuals were counted in each sample to derive a measure of relative abundance species identification was done according to the taxonomic keys provided in several studies e g huber pestalozzi 1941

statistical analyses multivariate statistical analyses were applied to determine the relationship between environmental variables and algal taxa we used canonical correspondence analyses cca to evaluated species environmental relationships ten environmental variables were tested together by using forward selection method ter braak and verdonschot 1995 according to forward selection procedure only significant p 0 05 variables were used in the final cca analysis taxa with three or fewer occurrences were excluded from the analyses 152 taxa were included to minimize the influence of rare taxa and or habitats with relatively low species numbers relative abundance of taxa and environmental variables were log transformed to reduce the arch effect of variables on ordination scores however prior to cca suitability of our data for cca was tested by detrended correspondence analysis dca hill and gauch 1980 where length of gradient three or more suggests suitability of data for cca canoco

determine intra habitat diversity whittaker s beta diversity whittaker 1972 was used to compare species diversity among different habitats henderson heterogeneity test was applied to estimate species richness of resident species and rate of migration to the habitat species diversity and richness 4 software seaby and henderson 2006 was used for the calculation of both diversity indexes and

chlorophyta charophyta and cyanobacteria diversity was highest in ditches followed by streams euglenophyta diversity was highest in ditches and wetlands simper analyses revealed that 16 algal taxa 15 were diatoms accounted for 70 of the total similarity table 5 while 52 taxa accounted for 90 of the total similarity appendix among the 16 algal most similar taxa three diatom species nitzschia linearis n palea and ulnaria ulna accounted for 34 of the total similarity six diatom species nitzschia palea n frustulum n linearis hantzschia amphioxys surirella minuta ulnaria ulna had shannon wiener alpha species diversity values above 3 and the index value h of all species was 4 444 with a jackknife standard error of 0 02119 table 5 4 discussion finding 392 algal taxa γ diversity with relatively high alpha h 4 444 and beta 19 diversity values suggested high variation in the species composition at the local and regional scale of the ağrı province where diatoms accounted 54 of the total number of taxa this finding is consistent with the earlier studies that showed the benthic zones of the rivers and the lakes diatoms were indeed the most dominant group with relatively high diversity abundance and occurrences compared to other algal groups lowe and laliberte 2017 most researchers associate this kind of dominancy and frequent occurrences of diatoms for the cosmopolitan characteristics of the group van dam et al 1994 vanormelingen et al 2008 solak et al 2012 solak and wojtal 2012 in the present study 15 out of 16 species responsible for 70 of the total similarity among habitats were the diatoms observed most commonly during the present study table 5 similar to our findings different studies showed that these diatom species are indeed the most common species in turkey aysel 2005 solak et al 2012 solak and wojtal 2012 such species are also known as ecological generalists kociolek and spaulding 2000 however our results differ from those of some other studies for example zarei darki 2011 studied five different water bodies in iran and found highest species richness in the chloropyta 35 of the total taxa followed by bacillariophyta 23 5 the findings in our study suggest that climatic factors temperature regional differences altitudinal gradient and environmental factors are important determinants in algal species diversity and the predominance of algal divisions barinova 2011 revealed that altitude is a major factor that influenced diatom diversity and distributions in ecoregions of eastern mediterranean israel indeed barinova et al 2013 stated that increasing species rate of diatoms was corresponded to increasing altitude at mountainous areas in pakistan in the present study alpha diversity h was highest in ditches streams and wetlands respectively table 3 similarly külköylüoğlu et al 2019 found the highest alpha diversity for freshwater ostracods collected during the same sampling campaign in streams ditches and ponds uçak et al 2014 reported the highest and lowest alpha diversity values for non marine ostracod species where in natural habitats e g ponds streams springs and creeks and artificial habitats e g canals troughs respectively in contrast de bie et al 2008 documented the highest species richness of cladocerans in lakes however zarei darki 2011 found the highest algal species richness in reservoirs and rivers the lowest diversity values from that study were reported from lakes in total 241 taxa 61 48 occurred in three or fewer samples low occurrence values of algal species contributed to a high beta

the estuary 4 discussion the mean crbd of c rhizophorae measured in the nsvbes 0 67 l g 1 h 1 was lower than the rate estimated by scroczynska et al 2012 in the piraquê açu piraquê mirim estuarine system papmes 17 99 l g 1 h 1 located 40 km north of the vitória bay the papmes crbd 27 times higher the nsvbes was achieved with mean and standard deviation salinity of 23 52 4 22 spm of 4 83 2 55 mg l 1 and pomwater 4 14 1 34 mg l 1 scroczynska et al 2012 the crbd method has shown an integrated response of mangrove oysters on a seasonal variability considering that rates were slightly different between october 2015 and april 2016 the availability of seston and its quality c n ratio and size of organic particles have a strong influence on oyster crs with the increase of inorganic suspended matter in april 2016 and the decrease of phytoplankton biomass biodeposition increased almost 40 with increasing aridity in april the source of inorganic material could be associated with resuspension estuarine of bottom sediments the organic fraction of nsvbes sediment is mainly originated from mangrove sources followed by aquatic i e phytoplankton and anthropogenic sources e g fecal and oil sources lehrback et al 2016 this discrepancy can be regarded to distinct environmental conditions in both systems nsvbes and papmes and were primarely relatted to salinity with the latter system with more suitable range for mangrove oyster feeding rates one week before the experiment was carried out by scroczynska et al 2012 heavy rainfall in papmes watershed caused high river discharge and high concentration of organic particulate matter however the low suspended particulate matter content 5 79 mg l 1 recorded by the authors resulted of discrete sampling during the experimental period with no sampling during the peak discharge the experiments were carried out during exceptional climatic conditions from 2015 to 2016 when southeast brazil been under a severe drought with significant adverse effects on watershed runoff nobre et al 2016 the fluvial discharge of santa maria da vitória river smvr main vbes tributary was 2 8 m3 s 1 which is lower than required water withdrawal for treatment and supply part of great vitória needs with almost no freshwater runoff the vbes faced a salinization process with high salinity the rainfall in great vitória station 02040035 ana 2018 in october 2015 and april 2016 was 54 6 and 25 0 mm respectively values below 50 mm were considered as dry months and above 100 mm as rainy months thus april 2016 was very dry during 2015 and 2016 the vbes undergo a salinization process with mean salinity at nsvbes of 30 19 5 13 n 382 records on flood and ebb period of spring and neap tides leite 2018 which may have affected the lower crbd values the lower biodeposits and crbd during dry season could be related to an impoverishment of organic matterial in suspended particles although there were no oyster mortality in biodeposition experiments guimarães et al 2008 found out 34 of c rhizophorae mortality rates during eight days of salinity exposition to 35 and standardized temperature and dissolved oxygen saturation to 26 03 1 53 c and 90 2 5 0 respectively the high salinity impairs the feeding and growth rates consequently due to osmotic imbalance in oyster cells c rhizophorae habitat in the mangrove of nsvbes requirements seem to be following to suspended organic matter which on average contribute with 67 of spm while mean chlorophyll a content indicates typical mesotrophic condition high estuarine turbidity nutrients and suspended mineral particles have been associated to high fluvial discharge despite low fluvial discharges during the crbd experiment the nsvbes seston was relatively abundant in organic matter from autochthonous and other allochthonous sources leite 2018 found hypereutrophic conditions in the upper nsvbes with chlorophyll a content of 136 5 µg l 1 under a flood of the neap tide and smvr discharge of 6 0 m3 s 1 outflow from the wastewater treatment plant of the camburi i e facultative ponds may reach the study area under some estuarine hydrodynamics according to guimarães et al 2008 the euryhaline range of c rhizophorae from 1 to 40 has an optimum from 5 to 25 with optimal feeding rates efficiency in the range of 20 to 30 although field experiments were carried out with salinities above the optimal feeding rates it seems that physiological stress significantly impaired c rhizophorae clearance rates but were not enough to cause oyster mortalities this corroborate the high plasticity of mangrove oyster in dynamic estuarine systems oliveira et al 2014 found out that c rhizophorae was an effective biological filter for shrimp farming effluents the experiment was carried out in the south of bahia brazil with 180 oyster with continuous flow method controlled diet and under ambient conditions of 25 c and salinity below 10 and mean chlorophyll a and spm of 88 18 12 97 ug l 1 and 88 01 5 77 mg l 1 respectively the authors found out that oysters could remove more than 70 of phytoplankton biomass ramos et al 2008 running a experiment in a controlled environment after 6h of hydraulic residence time observed a reduction of 70 6 and 62 1 of suspended particles and turbidity of shrimp farming effluents respectively the oysters crbd found in the literature vary widely according to different methods types of diet provided salinity and other exogenous factors that influence the bivalve ecophysiology clearance rates of pinctada imbricata measured with laboratory continuous flow method pouvreau et al 1999 and in the field biodeposition method pouvreau et al 2000 resulted in similar values of 25 88 and 22 00 l g 1 h 1 dry weight dw respectively estuarine water residence time rt is a key variable in bivalve filter feeders studies kellog et al 2014 gray et al 2016 according to gray et al 2016 the filtered volume of ostrea lurida biomass varies from 3 to 57 between dry and rainy seasons respectively considering the rt 60 days of the yaquina bay oregon usa o lurida has shown cr of 97 for the volume of the bay the retention time to nsvbes is 35 days leite 2018 and considering estimated oyster biomass of 3 77 105 kg km 2 and daily cr of 6 51 106 m3 kg 1 nearly 26 of the vbes volume can be filtered in the bay of brest france bivalve filter

guimarães et al 2014 oliveira et al 2014 rose et al 2015 the management of a healthy vbes which is under high pressure from urban and industrial activities could be addressed with the accretion of new mudflats to maintain and expand mangrove forests young mangrove areas with a higher number of r mangle aerial roots and low dbh zamprogno et al 2016 could increase oyster biomass the global potential for mangrove expansion in a scenario of climate change of increasing temperature can be impaired with the increased aridity and reductions in freshwater input which will likely result in a reduced mangrove coverage and diversity the main physiological base of salinity tolerance for estuarine species is osmotic potentials which regulate water and salt acquisition and transport lovelock et al 2016 in the vbes increasing salinity in interstitial water have been associated with higher evapotranspiration rates which is resulting from reduced flooding frequency this process can cause retraction of mangrove forests zamprogno et al 2016 the scenario of prolonged periods of low river flow during droughts and short periods of extreme high flow sheffield and wood 2008 associated with sea level rise and increasing saltwater intrusion will change estuarine species composition and patterns of energy flow havens 2018 loss of mangroves as a key coastal ecosystem and mangrove oysters as

system papmes 17 99 l g 1 h 1 located 40 km north of the vitória bay the papmes crbd 27 times higher the nsvbes was achieved with mean and standard deviation salinity of 23 52 4 22 spm of 4 83 2 55 mg l 1 and pomwater 4 14 1 34 mg l 1 scroczynska et al 2012 the crbd method has shown an integrated response of mangrove oysters on a seasonal variability considering that rates were slightly different between october 2015 and april 2016 the availability of seston and its quality c n ratio and size of organic particles have a strong influence on oyster crs with the increase of inorganic suspended matter in april 2016 and the decrease of phytoplankton biomass biodeposition increased almost 40 with increasing aridity in april the source of inorganic material could be associated with resuspension estuarine of bottom sediments the organic fraction of nsvbes sediment is mainly originated from mangrove sources followed by aquatic i e phytoplankton and anthropogenic sources e g fecal and oil sources lehrback et al 2016 this discrepancy can be regarded to distinct environmental conditions in both systems nsvbes and papmes and were primarely relatted to salinity with the latter system with more suitable range for mangrove oyster feeding rates one week before the experiment was carried out by scroczynska et al 2012 heavy rainfall in papmes watershed caused high river discharge and high concentration of organic particulate matter however the low suspended particulate matter content 5 79 mg l 1 recorded by the authors resulted of discrete sampling during the experimental period with no sampling during the peak discharge the experiments were carried out during exceptional climatic conditions from 2015 to 2016 when southeast brazil been under a severe drought with significant adverse effects on watershed runoff nobre et al 2016 the fluvial discharge of santa maria da vitória river smvr main vbes tributary was 2 8 m3 s 1 which is lower than required water withdrawal for treatment and supply part of great vitória needs with almost no freshwater runoff the vbes faced a salinization process with high salinity the rainfall in great vitória station 02040035 ana 2018 in october 2015 and april 2016 was 54 6 and 25 0 mm respectively values below 50 mm were considered as dry months and above 100 mm as rainy months thus april 2016 was very dry during 2015 and 2016 the vbes undergo a salinization process with mean salinity at nsvbes of 30 19 5 13 n 382 records on flood and ebb period of spring and neap tides leite 2018 which may have affected the lower crbd values the lower biodeposits and crbd during dry season could be related to an impoverishment of organic matterial in suspended particles although there were no oyster mortality in biodeposition experiments guimarães et al 2008 found out 34 of c rhizophorae mortality rates during eight days of salinity exposition to 35 and standardized temperature and dissolved oxygen saturation to 26 03 1 53 c and 90 2 5 0 respectively the high salinity impairs the feeding and growth rates consequently due to osmotic imbalance in oyster cells c rhizophorae habitat in the mangrove of nsvbes requirements seem to be following to suspended organic matter which on average contribute with 67 of spm while mean chlorophyll a content indicates typical mesotrophic condition high estuarine turbidity nutrients and suspended mineral particles have been associated to high fluvial discharge despite low fluvial discharges during the crbd experiment the nsvbes seston was relatively abundant in organic matter from autochthonous and other allochthonous sources leite 2018 found hypereutrophic conditions in the upper nsvbes with chlorophyll a content of 136 5 µg l 1 under a flood of the neap tide and smvr discharge of 6 0 m3 s 1 outflow from the wastewater treatment plant of the camburi i e facultative ponds may reach the study area under some estuarine hydrodynamics according to guimarães et al 2008 the euryhaline range of c rhizophorae from 1 to 40 has an optimum from 5 to 25 with optimal feeding rates efficiency in the range of 20 to 30 although field experiments were carried out with salinities above the optimal feeding rates it seems that physiological stress significantly impaired c rhizophorae clearance rates but were not enough to cause oyster mortalities this corroborate the high plasticity of mangrove oyster in dynamic estuarine systems oliveira et al 2014 found out that c rhizophorae was an effective biological filter for shrimp farming effluents the experiment was carried out in the south of bahia brazil with 180 oyster with continuous flow method controlled diet and under ambient conditions of 25 c and salinity below 10 and mean chlorophyll a and spm of 88 18 12 97 ug l 1 and 88 01 5 77 mg l 1 respectively the authors found out that oysters could remove more than 70 of phytoplankton biomass ramos et al 2008 running a experiment in a controlled environment after 6h of hydraulic residence time observed a reduction of 70 6 and 62 1 of suspended particles and turbidity of shrimp farming effluents respectively the oysters crbd found in the literature vary widely according to different methods types of diet provided salinity and other exogenous factors that influence the bivalve ecophysiology clearance rates of pinctada imbricata measured with laboratory continuous flow method pouvreau et al 1999 and in the field biodeposition method pouvreau et al 2000 resulted in similar values of 25 88 and 22 00 l g 1 h 1 dry weight dw respectively estuarine water residence time rt is a key variable in bivalve filter feeders studies kellog et al 2014 gray et al 2016 according to gray et al 2016 the filtered volume of ostrea lurida biomass varies from 3 to 57 between dry and rainy seasons respectively considering the rt 60 days of the yaquina bay oregon usa o lurida has shown cr of 97 for the volume of the bay the retention time to nsvbes is 35 days leite 2018 and considering estimated oyster biomass of 3 77 105 kg km 2 and daily cr of 6 51 106 m3 kg 1 nearly 26 of the vbes volume can be filtered in the bay of brest france bivalve filter feeders with a daily cr of 7 42 106 m3 can filter 30 of bay volume hily 1991 considering the percentage of filtration which is 2 3 under current hydrological and hydrochemical conditions c rhizophorae population has a capacity to filter the nsvbes volume in 4 days these findings highlight the key role of bivalve filter feeders as an ecohydrology approach for estuarine management kellogg et al 2014

guimarães et al 2014 oliveira et al 2014 rose et al 2015 the management of a healthy vbes which is under high pressure from urban and industrial activities could be addressed with the accretion of new mudflats to maintain and expand mangrove forests young mangrove areas with a higher number of r mangle aerial roots and low dbh zamprogno et al 2016 could increase oyster biomass the global potential for mangrove expansion in a scenario of climate change of increasing temperature can be impaired with the increased aridity and reductions in freshwater input which will likely result in a reduced mangrove coverage and diversity the main physiological base of salinity tolerance for estuarine species is osmotic potentials which regulate water and salt acquisition and transport lovelock et al 2016 in the vbes increasing salinity in interstitial water have been associated with higher evapotranspiration rates which is resulting from reduced flooding frequency this process can cause retraction of mangrove forests zamprogno et al 2016 the scenario of prolonged periods of low river flow during droughts and short periods of extreme high flow sheffield and wood 2008 associated with sea level rise and increasing saltwater intrusion will change estuarine species composition and patterns of energy flow havens 2018 loss of mangroves as a key coastal ecosystem and mangrove oysters as

1038,water and sediment regulation scheme wsrs is an annual water conservancy project which aims to alleviate sand depositions and reduce flood risks in the yellow river of china since 2002 there are few researches on the sand bar within yellow river tail channel and its estuary from each wsrs effect though these relative researches are important to be carried out for a better understanding of wsrs by interpreting two gf 1 satellite images in the end of 2013 and the start of 2015 after carefully controlling some potential bias factors from the change of water level precipitation or tidal we compared and analyzed the change of sand bars by one wsrs implemented in 2014 in this paper our results indicated this wsrs changed obviously the area shape of sand bars it made the area of the river sand bar decreased totally by 5 55 km2 while the estuarine sand bar increased by 2 08 km2 and it achieved the highest scour efficiency 90 11 in the straight channel but it achieved the lowest scour efficiency 44 71 in the more bends channel from the prospect in the change of estuarine sand bar the west side area increased while the east side area shrank there were some broken small sand bars on the north side and they were forming a large sand bar keywords water and sediment regulation scheme coastal wetlands sand bar reclamation land yellow river tail channel 1 introduction water and sediment regulation scheme wsrs is the application of water conservancy project to regulate the water and sediment flux of rivers in order to alleviate deposition in the channel and reduce the risk of the huge flood event further the yellow river is the second most sediment laden river due to the highly suspended sediment concentration ssc from the yellow river and the serious deposition in its middle and downstream river channel milliman and meade 1983 yao 2014 the yellow river becomes the so called suspended river therefore chinese engineers have constructed some of dams and reservoirs such as the xiaolangdi reservoir to raise the water level of the yellow river channel artificially after reaching a reasonable water level then reservoir administrators can discharge a large amount of water to scour the deposition in the river channel thereby it can effectively reduce the deposition and sediment in the river channel at the same time wsrs directly promotes the land reclamation in the estuarine area wang 2005 except for some occasionally stopped wsrs due to the water shortage such as 2016 and 2017 wsrs has regularly implemented in the yellow river every year and has been executed 16 times by 2018 li 2002 wu et al 2015 wsrs scours the riverbed simultaneously every time by changing the shape of the sand bar in the river channel it has regulated the hydrology ecological connectivity of the wetland in the yellow river estuary yre wsrs has reshaped the landscape pattern of the coastal wetland and also largely affected the habitats of various rivers and wetlands in delta as a special water conservancy project through the north china wsrs was focused by both national and international society therefore many researchers have carried out researches on the issue of wsrs most of the researchers mainly focused on the simulation of sediment transport process song et al 2018 the retrieval of ssc in the estuary yu et al 2018 and the analysis of measured cross section change zheng et al 2018 the long period of suspended particulate matter spm concentration in the yellow river estuary and adjacent sea can explain the correlation between spm and land area and it s a valid approach to dynamically analyze spm temporal variations in the near bay li et al 2019 however it s difficult to explore spm variation in the river channel and yrm due to the slight difference in the most of the time but it can effectively analyze the situation of the river channel and yrm with sand bar properties e g position shape area which have correlation with spm from the high spatial resolution image most of previous researches rarely explored the correlation analysis between yellow river tail channel and its estuary and linked with wsrs some scholars carried out researches on river channel sand bars landscape change in the changjiang river wang et al 2018a however their study did not involve ocean dynamics the yre is affected by not only the human influence of the lijin hydrological station but also the ocean dynamics so the situation of yre is more complicated to be studied the yellow river delta yrd has been changing quickly because of less runoff heavy sediment and complicated ocean dynamics so most researchers investigated the changed coastline of the yrd by carrying out analyzing the effects of land reclamation and channel diversion the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc believes that the study on the coastline must be based in the same month with the same tide level but very few remote sensing images can match the yrcc standard for such a study therefore some scholars adopted the average high tide line method li et al 2012 and the general high tide line method to conduct related researches wang et al 2018b because the tidal level data and the effective image were jointly limited the researchers were difficult to accurately control the tidal level data however the tidal level data is actually an important factor in the change of the yrd and the medium spatial resolution remote sensing image such as landsat tm etm series was difficult to capture the small area in the yre but those small changes in the sand bar can deliver more accurate information about the changing characteristics and the future trend of the delta the objectives of this study are 1 according to the gf 1 remote sensing images which has a high spatial resolution we integrated them with multiple factors of monitoring data such as water level tidal level and precipitation data to eliminate the uncertainty existed in the remote sensing analysis from which authors extracted quantitatively the landscape information of the tail channel and the yellow river mouth yrm before and after the wsrs in 2014 2 the sand bar change was compared and analyzed quantitatively by exploring it within the tail channel and yrm before and after the wsrs in 2014 and authors explored the landscape reshaping effect of wsrs on the tail channel and the yrm this study can assist in a better understanding the scientific basis of the wetland habitat change in the yre it is significant for this study to reveal the evolution mechanism of the wetland in the yrd and to develop a reasonable scientific strategy for wetland conservation in this area 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area the yellow river delta wetland reserve is listed as a hot spot for coastal wetland study from the global scope xiao and zhao 2016 zhang et al 2016 the reserve is located in the eastern part of shandong province china where from 118 42 e to 119 22 e and from 37 33 n to 37 56 n it is the largest estuary delta nature reserve in china due to its typical wetland biodiversity and its important role in rare birds meanwhile it is a very representative example of the estuarine wetland ecosystem in the world the annual precipitation varies greatly in this nature reserve and the seasonal precipitation is also unevenly distributed which is mainly concentrated from june to august according to the monitoring data from 2002 to 2013 the annual average water level is 11 24 m at lijin hydrological station while the annual water level reaches 12 6 m during the period of wsrs the sea area around the yre is half closed and the tides are irregular half day tides in most of the shores shandong yellow river delta national nature reserve administration 2016 the study area is divided into four parts of a b c and d according to the detailed description from the planning report of the yellow river delta national nature reserve in shandong province and the survey information on the yellow river tail channel and the sand bar distribution the total study area is of about 55 03 km2 which keeps 50 km away from lijin hydrological station and 23 km from dongying port fig 1 2 2 data source and preprocessing in order to present the detailed changes in sand bar we selected gf 1 remote sensing images which had the high spatial resolution and integrated them with the hydrological data tidal level simulation data channel water level data precipitation data and storm surge data the tide level simulation data was sourced from the national ocean information center at the dongying port in 2014 while the daily water level data was derived by yrcc at the lijin site in 2014 http 61 163 88 227 8006 hwsq aspx the monitoring data of storm surge was from the gudong oilfield near the northern part of the yellow river delta wetland reserve in 2014 and the precipitation data was derived from the daily weather forecast of kenli county which covers the study area the gf 1 satellite is the first satellite for generating the high spatial resolution imagery as one of the earth observation system of china bai 2013 it has a 2 m spatial resolution for the panchromatic band and an 8 m spatial resolution for the multi spectral band the gf 1 remote sensing images were difficult to be acquired for fully covering the study area at the same time due to the very long shape study area hence we tried to select remote sensing images in the similar dates finally december 9th 2013 was fixed as the date of the image for reflecting sand bar information before wsrs while january 18th 2015 and january 22th 2015 were fixed as the dates for that after wsrs envi 5 3 was applied to implement image preprocessing including radiation correction atmospheric correction geometric correction and registration the pan sharpening fusion method was used to fuse the panchromatic image and the multi spectral image before we clip remote sensing images 3 methods 3 1 selection of remote sensing image acquisition dates the remote sensing image reflects the instantaneous information of the sand bar in the estuary and tail channel we used the different acquisition dates and times remote sensing images to compare and analyze the sand bar change before and after 2014 the key point is making the water level and tidal level elements normalized to a unique standard therefore the inter annual variation of the sand bar can be comparable it is necessary to analyze the hydrological meteorological and tidal level data of the study area for further fixing the reasonable images we comprehensively analyzed for determining the date and time points of remote sensing image acquisition firstly we selected the date with a small amount of precipitation in winter by analyzing the hydrological and meteorological data meanwhile the exposed area of sand bar is steady and clear therefore it is the best time for comparative analysis of sand bar changes in the yellow river tail channel furthermore we need to fix the reasonable date and time for remote sensing images according to the dongying port tidal level data the tides level data were divided into the five periods according to the regularity of the high and low daily tide level data the overall tide level was high from the end of may to the end of september and the difference on tidal level was relatively large between the highest and lowest tide level value in the same day so it was easier to achieve the same standard from the period between december to march because the fluctuation of the tide level was small on the dates within this period fig 2 a we preliminary determined the best dates for extracting remote sensing image data red points as the selection dates on december 9th 2013 before wsrs and on january 22th 2015 after wsrs we focused on the hourly tidal data of the 5 days before and after the remote sensing image acquisition day for further analysis of the potential selection time point according to the calculated hourly tide level data fig 2 b the tidal level data before wsrs was 116 64 cm while the tidal level data after wsrs was 118 47 cm the difference between the two tides level was 1 83 cm a very tiny gap hence it didn t exist a significant error that can bias the comparing of the estuarine sand bar change furthermore there was no precipitation and storm surge in the week before the remote sensing image acquisition time by checking other relevant data the water level data in channel was also analyzed and it showed that measured water level above the mean sea level was 10 45 m on december 9th 2013 while it was 10 47 m on january 18th 2015 according to the water level data from the lijin hydrological station where is no tributary until to the estuary therefore the water level in channel was similar and there was not obvious error in the comparison of the river sand bar landscape therefore we finally selected december 9th 2013 and january 18th and 22th 2015 for the remote sensing images acquisition for comparing the sand bar changes in the tail channel and the yrm finally fig 2 b showed the red points as the remote sensing image acquisition times 3 2 interpretation of river sand bars the river sand bar in the study area were scoured by wsrs and its shape frequently became irregular and small which was different from the other natural rivers sand bar and difficult to monitor by low spatial resolution remote sensing image but the high spatial resolution image can facilitate the observation by monitoring the slight sand bar change so combing the visual judgment by the gf 1 the field investigation and relevant research li 2013 the river sand bars were divided into ellipse sand bar bamboo leaf sand bar sickle shaped sand bar other shape sand bar and bank table 1 presented the classification criteria which is used to distinguish the five types of river sand bar from images the elliptical sand bar which is the sand bar early development form generally with a small area and it always locates at the straight channel with little changes on its width the bamboo leaf sand bar is the sand bar stable development form generally with a larger area circumference and locates at the bow shaped channel the sickle shaped sand bar develops in the natural river bay and bends to the convex bank we referenced the similar image segmentation research method yu et al al 2017 yuan et al 2015 and the multi resolution segmentation method was used to segment gf 1 preprocessing data at the ecognition 8 9 platform after many attempts to analyze and contrast we assigned with image segmentation threshold of 120 the shape parameter of 0 5 the compactness of 0 5 and the weight of each band of 1 the water and the non water were separated according to the threshold of the ndwi eq 1 1 n d w i p g r e e n p n i r p g r e e n p n i r after the initial classification results we achieved the overall accuracy over 85 and the kappa coefficient around 0 72 in order to make interpretation more accurate we carried out further post processing the classification result was manually re corrected by processing the gf 1 on the arcgis 10 2 platform after further manual modification and visual interpretation we classified the study area into the various landscapes including water bank ellipse sand bar bamboo leaf sand bar sickle shaped sand bar other shape sand bar estuarine sand bar and artificial facility it s easy to classified out the water and artificial facility but it s difficult to classified the sand bar without expertise so we classified the sand bar with some field study which could better distinguish each sand bar type and we carried out stepwise classification with expertise in the character of each sand bar type first step the sand bar which is joined to the land could be classified as the bank second step the sand bar whose shape is sickle in the curved channel could be classified as the sickle shaped sand bar third step the sand bar whose shape is ellipse and area is small could be classified as the ellipse sand bar final step the other sand bar could be distinguish from their shape and image acquisition date because most of sand bar are bamboo leaf sand bars before wsrs and most of sand bar are other shape sand bars after wsrs 3 3 landscape change analysis in order to explore further impact of wsrs the sand bar structure information was analyzed from the perspective of landscape we referenced other studies in the application of landscape index he and zhang 2009 kong 2017 and finally selected the patch density pd in the class metrics the aggregation index ai in the class metrics and the contagion contag in the landscape metrics for sand bar landscape analysis all these landscape index were analyzed on the sand bars by running the fragstats 4 2 software pd eq 2 can describe the fragmentation and is fundamental aspect of landscape pattern pd has the same basic utility as number of patches as an index except that it expresses number of patches on a per unit area basis that facilitates comparisons among landscapes of varying size ai eq 3 can reflect the connectivity between the patches of each landscape type the smaller the value the more dispersed the landscape type contag eq 4 can describe the agglomeration and extension of the patches of each landscape type 2 p d n i a ni number of

table 2 showed the transition matrix results between various types of landscapes from which the total variation area of the sand bars was 11 20 km2 including 2 08 km2 as the totally increased area of the estuarine sand bar the accumulated 2 93 km2 minus by the eroded 0 85 km2 the totally decreased area of the river sand bars was 5 55 km2 the erosion of 6 82 km2 minus the accumulation of 1 27 km2 with the this influence statistics of sand bars we concluded that sand bars were mainly existed in the upper and lower channel as for assessing the wsrs scouring efficiency from the aspect of the sand bar erosion area the middle river channel had the highest efficiency 90 11 while the upper channel had the lowest efficiency 44 71 the upper channel low efficiency indicated that the river bend was scoured but the very curved river hindered the transport of eroded sediment to the estuary and the new sand bar would be regenerated again near the scouring place a period later of past scoring the lower river channel received the medial efficiency of scouring by wsrs which meant that the closer to the estuary the lower wsrs scouring efficiency it is reasonable if considering of the role of ocean power near the estuarine area the table 2 showed the result of transition matrix between classified types in the variation of this wsrs in general the total area of river sand bars was decreased while the estuarine sand bar area was increased due to the 2014 wsrs according to table 2 the areas of different types have obviously transited as following the river channel banks was eroded into bamboo leaf sand bar elliptical sand bar and other shape sand bars the bamboo leaf sand bars was eroded into other shape sand bars so it led to an increase in the area of the elliptical sand bar and other shapes sand bars and an decrease in the other river sand bar types area according to the landscape matrix the result of converting water into various types of sand bars indicated that wsrs not only generated new types of sand bars but also changed the positions of them and some estuarine sand bars were transformed into water at the same time indicating an obvious role of marine erosion 4 2 effects on the different parts of the study area by 2014 wsrs since the tail channel was too long and narrow to be analyzed yrm was also divided into three parts and each part of a b c and d was selected for a detailed analysis on its spatial change fig 4 and the different directions of yrm area had significant difference in increase and decrease the western yrm was increased by 2 82 km2 and decreased by 0 12 km2 the northern yrm was increased by 0 06 km2 and decreased by 0 36 km2 the eastern yrm was increased by 0 06 km2 and decreased by 0 37 km2 the western yrm area had a huge variation by extending to the north and the west but the east side of the northern yrm was eroded and shrunk and the area where was the two blocks in northern yrm was increased and trended to the whole block and the area on the north and east side of the eastern yrm was decreased both shape and location of sand bar had changed and most of the sand bar had been stretched to the estuary by comparing the results of interpretations from before and after 2014 wsrs since there were many bends in the upper channel hence the large bank had been eroded into many small area sand bars including small banks bamboo leaf sand bars and some other shapes of small sand bars the existed large bamboo leaf sand bars were eroded into an irregular shape being more fragmented and complicated the middle channel was relatively straightforward hence its both sides sand bars were eroded smoothly though most of them were scattered this scouring made the bamboo leaf sand bar and the different small shape sand bars into the main sand bar types this scouring achieved an obvious effect by eliminating large sand bars in the lower channel therefore the larger sand bars were eroded into broken small sand bars such as bamboo leaf sand bars elliptical sand bars and other shaped sand bars in the entire tail channel after 2014 wsrs 4 3 the landscape variations of sand bars due to 2014 wsrs the landscape indices were presented in the table 3 according to the classified interpretation the contag in 2013 was 76 26 while it was 79 77 in 2015 the variation value was 3 51 and the change rate was 4 60 the pd of estuarine sand bar was reduced which indicating that the patches decreased and gradually became larger patches the ai and the contag of the river sand bars except for the disappeared sickle shaped sand bar showed that wsrs may cause the sand bar distribution to be dispersed spatially but the deposition location did not change very quickly the river channel became smoother after this wsrs according to the results of the contag 5 discussions the channel sand bars have been constantly reshaped by irregular wsrss the sand bar is defined as a formed deposition which is exposed above the water surface li 2013 it has a close correlation with the riverbed which could be reflected by the channel section so it could be an useful indicator to further explore the influence by wsrs based on the monitoring data from the q2 q4 and q7 sections in the study area the changes of each section incised were obviously after the flood season especially those from the q4 were very significantly meanwhile the channel where q2 section erosion located happened mainly in the north bank and continuously been broadened cui 2015 the main scouring were performed in the both sides of the channel and depositing in the middle of the channel the similar results were presented if comparing fig 4 a1 with fig 4 a2 the major erosion happened in the bank of the north channel while the sand bar mainly existed in the center of the channel due to this wsrs therefore the remote sensing interpretation results of this study were further verified by the measured data from the channel sections wsrss promote the land reclamation effect in the yrm by increasing the probability of the hyperpycnal flow which is one of the transport pattern of suspended sediment off the river mouth song et al 2018 during the transporting of suspended sediments off the river mouth different transport patterns which depend on the ssc and salinity have unique accumulation methods the hyperpycnal plume will form if the river density is less than the surrounding density when the river enters the sea unless the hyperpycnal flow will form each wsrs carries a lot of suspended sediment into the sea then it effectively increases the probability of the hyperpycnal flow which form sand bars at the esturarine area xu et al 2014 each wsrs plays a key role in a direct effect to form and change the variation area of sand bars in yrm and it can further explain the mechanism of such a form or change by analyzing the suspended sediment particle sizes and the corresponding changes within the near shore sections the suspended sediment particle size was smaller and more difficult to deposit due to the gradually implementation of wsrs which caused the downstream riverbed to be coarser therefore it resulted in reducing the channel sand bar erosion efficiency and worsening the delta erosion resistance miao et al 2016 long et al 2017 so these results explained that the yrm area existed erosion and the deposition concentration location in channel was stable in our study furthermore the sediment was accumulated at 25 35 km within the current estuary and the estuary delta was gradually expanding to the sea areas on both sides of the yrm but the deposition was in a dynamic change at the near shore wang et al 2015 and the small bay locates between yrm and the gudong seawall is easy to deposit yu et al 2015 according to our study result the yrm was spread on both river banks and mainly deposited on the west side near the gudong seawall although the average increase of the yrd area which is larger than our study result was 8 57 km2 in many years 2002 2015 according to the study from li 2016 so the yrm variation area would be smaller than 8 57 km2 according to this study and it can also indicated that the yrm variation area was smaller than before because the extending length of yellow river tail channel was slow during 1999 2010 zhang et al 2019 the yrm variation area due to 2014 wsrs is similar with those data from other researchers on the other hand our study showed that the yrm area was still large although wsrs implement interval was longer so it indicated other sediment factors expect wsrs factor continued to offset some parts of the sea erosion at the same time the yellow river estuary were modified by many dam projects that can further consolidate the deposition then enhance land reclamation effects therefore our study conclusions been further confirmed by some previous study cases the yrm accumulation position depended on the type of shear front which was influenced by the flood and ebb tide phases during wsrs period wang et al 2006 the tides near yrd basically parallel to the shoreline and have back and force movements which the flood tide direction is southeast and the ebb tide direction is northwest yu et al 2018 during the wsrs period the sediment will be deposited in the southeastern yrm along the flood tide and in the northwestern yrm along the ebb tide after the shear front then we inferred the variation area of sand bars in yrm was influenced by the ebb tide during 2014 wsrs period however it is difficult to accurately describe the shape and location of the yrm sand bars and analyze the formation mechanism with the current data sets xu et al 2014 high spatial resolution images could reflect more details on the sand bar shape after our result and analysis and it is possible to present dynamic information by a series of long period high spatial resolution images each wsrs obviously changed the sand bar area and further profoundly affected the ecological environment in the yrd a wsrs can directly affect the plant habitat of reeds on tidal flats or river channel the patches areas and numbers of both phragmites australis habitats and tidal flats are partly controlled by the fluxes of stream flow or sediment from yellow river and the heavy metals and arsenic as were carried to the yrd by wsrs due to rapid agricultural development upstream of the yrd and heavy applications of agrochemicals and fertilizers then the wetland habitat was seriously polluted bai et al 2012 so wsrs obviously changed the morphological characteristics of the sand bar and also affected the soil properties in the wetland bai et al 2014 from which the breeding of red crowned cranes can be influenced since their habitat types can be changed largely due to the annual or inter annual variation caused by each wsrs bai et al 2015 wang 2017 cao et al 2011 in addition each wsrs also affects the growth and reproduction of marine life the invertebrate assemblage was affected by the fluxes of stream flow and sediment from yellow river at the section of 20 km from the estuary zhang et al 2014 each wsrs changes the sand bar dynamic balance by depositing or eroding then changes the shape area of each sand bar annually li 2013 however the influence factors of each wsrs were complicated these factors include runoff sediment discharge suspended sediment particle size and the boundary condition of the riverbed in the yellow river yao 2014 wang 2005 furthermore each wsrs implementation time issue is also crucial if comparing with the high speed water flow experiment in the colorado river of united states grams et al 2010 which would also leads to change the sand bar largely on the first day of the experiment the sediment deposit was the largest but the erosion exceeded the deposition after three days according to grams study due to the high suspended solids concentration before the experiment some researches indicated that it would result to form a larger sand bar otherwise high speed water flow may erode the sand bar and would not form sand bars wu et al 2004 yuan et al 2012 these previous studies could help us improve the wsrs erosion efficiency in the river channel furthermore better control the yrm area the wetland conservation could guide a reasonable scientific strategy with a new cognition in the channel sand bars it s a scientific approach to discover the situation of channel deposition by the analysis of water level and sand bar interpretation result in channel during the flooding the administrators could monitor potential dangerous location which exists large area of sand bar in high water level meanwhile the location of the diversion dam could be further optimized by the channel deposition the better controlling of dams could improve the water diversion efficiency to solve the water shortage problem in the wetland during the wsrs period 6 conclusions the sand bar landscape change were explored both in the yellow river tail channel and its estuary before and after a wsrs in 2014 the high spatial resolution images were applied to quantitative extract and conduct comparative analysis on the change based on the comprehensive analysis of key influence factors such as tide level water level rainfall and storm surge from which we carried out a further analysis of the potential impact from this wsrs on the land reclamation in the yellow river delta wetland reserve the following conclusions can be drew from this study 1 in general the 2014 wsrs eroded the banks of the yellow river tail channel and change into some small broken sand bars it caused the sand bar to be fragmented though there was not a significant change in the location the sand bar area within the tail river channel totally decreased 5 55 km2 due to this wsrs and been scoured mainly in the straight channel middle channel the curved channel sand bar was vulnerably scoured but the overall erosion efficiency was low from this wsrs which was prefer to form the new sand bars 2 the estuarine sand bar in yrm had a large area deposition in west side and a small erosion area in east side after this wsrs and with a tendency to union some small sand bars on the north side the overall effect from this wsrs showed a movement to the sea from the channel sediment based on the area shape change of the estuarine sand bars the yrm area was increased by 2 08 km2 due to this wsrs indicating an obvious effect on land reclamation in the estuarine area at present few study were carried out to evaluate and analyze the change in tail channel and yrm caused by the single wsrs or multiple wsrss with the support of the remote sensing technology but it is obvious that each wsrs plays a key role in alleviating deposition and land reclamation and it changes the sand bars by activating with many other natural and artificial factors we in this study carefully evaluated the wsrs effects by focusing especially on the land reclamation and the landscape change of the sand bar within the yellow river tail channel and its estuary it provided also a new perspective for the protection of

1038,water and sediment regulation scheme wsrs is an annual water conservancy project which aims to alleviate sand depositions and reduce flood risks in the yellow river of china since 2002 there are few researches on the sand bar within yellow river tail channel and its estuary from each wsrs effect though these relative researches are important to be carried out for a better understanding of wsrs by interpreting two gf 1 satellite images in the end of 2013 and the start of 2015 after carefully controlling some potential bias factors from the change of water level precipitation or tidal we compared and analyzed the change of sand bars by one wsrs implemented in 2014 in this paper our results indicated this wsrs changed obviously the area shape of sand bars it made the area of the river sand bar decreased totally by 5 55 km2 while the estuarine sand bar increased by 2 08 km2 and it achieved the highest scour efficiency 90 11 in the straight channel but it achieved the lowest scour efficiency 44 71 in the more bends channel from the prospect in the change of estuarine sand bar the west side area increased while the east side area shrank there were some broken small sand bars on the north side and they were forming a large sand bar keywords water and sediment regulation scheme coastal wetlands sand bar reclamation land yellow river tail channel 1 introduction water and sediment regulation scheme wsrs is the application of water conservancy project to regulate the water and sediment flux of rivers in order to alleviate deposition in the channel and reduce the risk of the huge flood event further the yellow river is the second most sediment laden river due to the highly suspended sediment concentration ssc from the yellow river and the serious deposition in its middle and downstream river channel milliman and meade 1983 yao 2014 the yellow river becomes the so called suspended river therefore chinese engineers have constructed some of dams and reservoirs such as the xiaolangdi reservoir to raise the water level of the yellow river channel artificially after reaching a reasonable water level then reservoir administrators can discharge a large amount of water to scour the deposition in the river channel thereby it can effectively reduce the deposition and sediment in the river channel at the same time wsrs directly promotes the land reclamation in the estuarine area wang 2005 except for some occasionally stopped wsrs due to the water shortage such as 2016 and 2017 wsrs has regularly implemented in the yellow river every year and has been executed 16 times by 2018 li 2002 wu et al 2015 wsrs scours the riverbed simultaneously every time by changing the shape of the sand bar in the river channel it has regulated the hydrology ecological connectivity of the wetland in the yellow river estuary yre wsrs has reshaped the landscape pattern of the coastal wetland and also largely affected the habitats of various rivers and wetlands in delta as a special water conservancy project through the north china wsrs was focused by both national and international society therefore many researchers have carried out researches on the issue of wsrs most of the researchers mainly focused on the simulation of sediment transport process song et al 2018 the retrieval of ssc in the estuary yu et al 2018 and the analysis of measured cross section change zheng et al 2018 the long period of suspended particulate matter spm concentration in the yellow river estuary and adjacent sea can explain the correlation between spm and land area and it s a valid approach to dynamically analyze spm temporal variations in the near bay li et al 2019 however it s difficult to explore spm variation in the river channel and yrm due to the slight difference in the most of the time but it can effectively analyze the situation of the river channel and yrm with sand bar properties e g position shape area which have correlation with spm from the high spatial resolution image most of previous researches rarely explored the correlation analysis between yellow river tail channel and its estuary and linked with wsrs some scholars carried out researches on river channel sand bars landscape change in the changjiang river wang et al 2018a however their study did not involve ocean dynamics the yre is affected by not only the human influence of the lijin hydrological station but also the ocean dynamics so the situation of yre is more complicated to be studied the yellow river delta yrd has been changing quickly because of less runoff heavy sediment and complicated ocean dynamics so most researchers investigated the changed coastline of the yrd by carrying out analyzing the effects of land reclamation and channel diversion the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc believes that the study on the coastline must be based in the same month with the same tide level but very few remote sensing images can match the yrcc standard for such a study therefore some scholars adopted the average high tide line method li et al 2012 and the general high tide line method to conduct related researches wang et al 2018b because the tidal level data and the effective image were jointly limited the researchers were difficult to accurately control the tidal level data however the tidal level data is actually an important factor in the change of the yrd and the medium spatial resolution remote sensing image such as landsat tm etm series was difficult to capture the small area in the yre but those small changes in the sand bar can deliver more accurate information about the changing characteristics and the future trend of the delta the objectives of this study are 1 according to the gf 1 remote sensing images which has a high spatial resolution we integrated them with multiple factors of monitoring data such as water level tidal level and precipitation data to eliminate the uncertainty existed in the remote sensing analysis from which authors extracted quantitatively the landscape information of the tail channel and the yellow river mouth yrm before and after the wsrs in 2014 2 the sand bar change was compared and analyzed quantitatively by exploring it within the tail channel and yrm before and after the wsrs in 2014 and authors explored the landscape reshaping effect of wsrs on the tail channel and the yrm this study can assist in a better understanding the scientific basis of the wetland habitat change in the yre it is significant for this study to reveal the evolution mechanism of the wetland in the yrd and to develop a reasonable scientific strategy for wetland conservation in this area 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area the yellow river delta wetland reserve is listed as a hot spot for coastal wetland study from the global scope xiao and zhao 2016 zhang et al 2016 the reserve is located in the eastern part of shandong province china where from 118 42 e to 119 22 e and from 37 33 n to 37 56 n it is the largest estuary delta nature reserve in china due to its typical wetland biodiversity and its important role in rare birds meanwhile it is a very representative example of the estuarine wetland ecosystem in the world the annual precipitation varies greatly in this nature reserve and the seasonal precipitation is also unevenly distributed which is mainly concentrated from june to august according to the monitoring data from 2002 to 2013 the annual average water level is 11 24 m at lijin hydrological station while the annual water level reaches 12 6 m during the period of wsrs the sea area around the yre is half closed and the tides are irregular half day tides in most of the shores shandong yellow river delta national nature reserve administration 2016 the study area is divided into four parts of a b c and d according to the detailed description from the planning report of the yellow river delta national nature reserve in shandong province and the survey information on the yellow river tail channel and the sand bar distribution the total study area is of about 55 03 km2 which keeps 50 km away from lijin hydrological station and 23 km from dongying port fig 1 2 2 data source and preprocessing in order to present the detailed changes in sand bar we selected gf 1 remote sensing images which had the high spatial resolution and integrated them with the hydrological data tidal level simulation data channel water level data precipitation data and storm surge data the tide level simulation data was sourced from the national ocean information center at the dongying port in 2014 while the daily water level data was derived by yrcc at the lijin site in 2014 http 61 163 88 227 8006 hwsq aspx the monitoring data of storm surge was from the gudong oilfield near the northern part of the yellow river delta wetland reserve in 2014 and the precipitation data was derived from the daily weather forecast of kenli county which covers the study area the gf 1 satellite is the first satellite for generating the high spatial resolution imagery as one of the earth observation system of china bai 2013 it has a 2 m spatial resolution for the panchromatic band and an 8 m spatial resolution for the multi spectral band the gf 1 remote sensing images were difficult to be acquired for fully covering the study area at the same time due to the very long shape study area hence we tried to select remote sensing images in the similar dates finally december 9th 2013 was fixed as the date of the image for reflecting sand bar information before wsrs while january 18th 2015 and january 22th 2015 were fixed as the dates for that after wsrs envi 5 3 was applied to implement image preprocessing including radiation correction atmospheric correction geometric correction and registration the pan sharpening fusion method was used to fuse the panchromatic image and the multi spectral image before we clip remote sensing images 3 methods 3 1 selection of remote sensing image acquisition dates the remote sensing image reflects the instantaneous information of the sand bar in the estuary and tail channel we used the different acquisition dates and times remote sensing images to compare and analyze the sand bar change before and after 2014 the key point is making the water level and tidal level elements normalized to a unique standard therefore the inter annual variation of the sand bar can be comparable it is necessary to analyze the hydrological meteorological and tidal level data of the study area for further fixing the reasonable images we comprehensively analyzed for determining the date and time points of remote sensing image acquisition firstly we selected the date with a small amount of precipitation in winter by analyzing the hydrological and meteorological data meanwhile the exposed area of sand bar is steady and clear therefore it is the best time for comparative analysis of sand bar changes in the yellow river tail channel furthermore we need to fix the reasonable date and time for remote sensing images according to the dongying port tidal level data the tides level data were divided into the five periods according to the regularity of the high and low daily tide level data the overall tide level was high from the end of may to the end of september and the difference on tidal level was relatively large between the highest and lowest tide level value in the same day so it was easier to achieve the same standard from the period between december to march because the fluctuation of the tide level was small on the dates within this period fig 2 a we preliminary determined the best dates for extracting remote sensing image data red points as the selection dates on december 9th 2013 before wsrs and on january 22th 2015 after wsrs we focused on the hourly tidal data of the 5 days before and after the remote sensing image acquisition day for further analysis of the potential selection time point according to the calculated hourly tide level data fig 2 b the tidal level data before wsrs was 116 64 cm while the tidal level data after wsrs was 118 47 cm the difference between the two tides level was 1 83 cm a very tiny gap hence it didn t exist a significant error that can bias the comparing of the estuarine sand bar change furthermore there was no precipitation and storm surge in the week before the remote sensing image acquisition time by checking other relevant data the water level data in channel was also analyzed and it showed that measured water level above the mean sea level was 10 45 m on december 9th 2013 while it was 10 47 m on january 18th 2015 according to the water level data from the lijin hydrological station where is no tributary until to the estuary therefore the water level in channel was similar and there was not obvious error in the comparison of the river sand bar landscape therefore we finally selected december 9th 2013 and january 18th and 22th 2015 for the remote sensing images acquisition for comparing the sand bar changes in the tail channel and the yrm finally fig 2 b showed the red points as the remote sensing image acquisition times 3 2 interpretation of river sand bars the river sand bar in the study area were scoured by wsrs and its shape frequently became irregular and small which was different from the other natural rivers sand bar and difficult to monitor by low spatial resolution remote sensing image but the high spatial resolution image can facilitate the observation by monitoring the slight sand bar change so combing the visual judgment by the gf 1 the field investigation and relevant research li 2013 the river sand bars were divided into ellipse sand bar bamboo leaf sand bar sickle shaped sand bar other shape sand bar and bank table 1 presented the classification criteria which is used to distinguish the five types of river sand bar from images the elliptical sand bar which is the sand bar early development form generally with a small area and it always locates at the straight channel with little changes on its width the bamboo leaf sand bar is the sand bar stable development form generally with a larger area circumference and locates at the bow shaped channel the sickle shaped sand bar develops in the natural river bay and bends to the convex bank we referenced the similar image segmentation research method yu et al al 2017 yuan et al 2015 and the multi resolution segmentation method was used to segment gf 1 preprocessing data at the ecognition 8 9 platform after many attempts to analyze and contrast we assigned with image segmentation threshold of 120 the shape parameter of 0 5 the compactness of 0 5 and the weight of each band of 1 the water and the non water were separated according to the threshold of the ndwi eq 1 1 n d w i p g r e e n p n i r p g r e e n p n i r after the initial classification results we achieved the overall accuracy over 85 and the kappa coefficient around 0 72 in order to make interpretation more accurate we carried out further post processing the classification result was manually re corrected by processing the gf 1 on the arcgis 10 2 platform after further manual modification and visual interpretation we classified the study area into the various landscapes including water bank ellipse sand bar bamboo leaf sand bar sickle shaped sand bar other shape sand bar estuarine sand bar and artificial facility it s easy to classified out the water and artificial facility but it s difficult to classified the sand bar without expertise so we classified the sand bar with some field study which could better distinguish each sand bar type and we carried out stepwise classification with expertise in the character of each sand bar type first step the sand bar which is joined to the land could be classified as the bank second step the sand bar whose shape is sickle in the curved channel could be classified as the sickle shaped sand bar third step the sand bar whose shape is ellipse and area is small could be classified as the ellipse sand bar final step the other sand bar could be distinguish from their shape and image acquisition date because most of sand bar are bamboo leaf sand bars before wsrs and most of sand bar are other shape sand bars after wsrs 3 3 landscape change analysis in order to explore further impact of wsrs the sand bar structure information was analyzed from the perspective of landscape we referenced other studies in the application of landscape index he and zhang 2009 kong 2017 and finally selected the patch density pd in the class metrics the aggregation index ai in the class metrics and the contagion contag in the landscape metrics for sand bar landscape analysis all these landscape index were analyzed on the sand bars by running the fragstats 4 2 software pd eq 2 can describe the fragmentation and is fundamental aspect of landscape pattern pd has the same basic utility as number of patches as an index except that it expresses number of patches on a per unit area basis that facilitates comparisons among landscapes of varying size ai eq 3 can reflect the connectivity between the patches of each landscape type the smaller the value the more dispersed the landscape type contag eq 4 can describe the agglomeration and extension of the patches of each landscape type 2 p d n i a ni number of

table 2 showed the transition matrix results between various types of landscapes from which the total variation area of the sand bars was 11 20 km2 including 2 08 km2 as the totally increased area of the estuarine sand bar the accumulated 2 93 km2 minus by the eroded 0 85 km2 the totally decreased area of the river sand bars was 5 55 km2 the erosion of 6 82 km2 minus the accumulation of 1 27 km2 with the this influence statistics of sand bars we concluded that sand bars were mainly existed in the upper and lower channel as for assessing the wsrs scouring efficiency from the aspect of the sand bar erosion area the middle river channel had the highest efficiency 90 11 while the upper channel had the lowest efficiency 44 71 the upper channel low efficiency indicated that the river bend was scoured but the very curved river hindered the transport of eroded sediment to the estuary and the new sand bar would be regenerated again near the scouring place a period later of past scoring the lower river channel received the medial efficiency of scouring by wsrs which meant that the closer to the estuary the lower wsrs scouring efficiency it is reasonable if considering of the role of ocean power near the estuarine area the table 2 showed the result of transition matrix between classified types in the variation of this wsrs in general the total area of river sand bars was decreased while the estuarine sand bar area was increased due to the 2014 wsrs according to table 2 the areas of different types have obviously transited as following the river channel banks was eroded into bamboo leaf sand bar elliptical sand bar and other shape sand bars the bamboo leaf sand bars was eroded into other shape sand bars so it led to an increase in the area of the elliptical sand bar and other shapes sand bars and an decrease in the other river sand bar types area according to the landscape matrix the result of converting water into various types of sand bars indicated that wsrs not only generated new types of sand bars but also changed the positions of them and some estuarine sand bars were transformed into water at the same time indicating an obvious role of marine erosion 4 2 effects on the different parts of the study area by 2014 wsrs since the tail channel was too long and narrow to be analyzed yrm was also divided into three parts and each part of a b c and d was selected for a detailed analysis on its spatial change fig 4 and the different directions of yrm area had significant difference in increase and decrease the western yrm was increased by 2 82 km2 and decreased by 0 12 km2 the northern yrm was increased by 0 06 km2 and decreased by 0 36 km2 the eastern yrm was increased by 0 06 km2 and decreased by 0 37 km2 the western yrm area had a huge variation by extending to the north and the west but the east side of the northern yrm was eroded and shrunk and the area where was the two blocks in northern yrm was increased and trended to the whole block and the area on the north and east side of the eastern yrm was decreased both shape and location of sand bar had changed and most of the sand bar had been stretched to the estuary by comparing the results of interpretations from before and after 2014 wsrs since there were many bends in the upper channel hence the large bank had been eroded into many small area sand bars including small banks bamboo leaf sand bars and some other shapes of small sand bars the existed large bamboo leaf sand bars were eroded into an irregular shape being more fragmented and complicated the middle channel was relatively straightforward hence its both sides sand bars were eroded smoothly though most of them were scattered this scouring made the bamboo leaf sand bar and the different small shape sand bars into the main sand bar types this scouring achieved an obvious effect by eliminating large sand bars in the lower channel therefore the larger sand bars were eroded into broken small sand bars such as bamboo leaf sand bars elliptical sand bars and other shaped sand bars in the entire tail channel after 2014 wsrs 4 3 the landscape variations of sand bars due to 2014 wsrs the landscape indices were presented in the table 3 according to the classified interpretation the contag in 2013 was 76 26 while it was 79 77 in 2015 the variation value was 3 51 and the change rate was 4 60 the pd of estuarine sand bar was reduced which indicating that the patches decreased and gradually became larger patches the ai and the contag of the river sand bars except for the disappeared sickle shaped sand bar showed that wsrs may cause the sand bar distribution to be dispersed spatially but the deposition location did not change very quickly the river channel became smoother after this wsrs according to the results of the contag 5 discussions the channel sand bars have been constantly reshaped by irregular wsrss the sand bar is defined as a formed deposition which is exposed above the water surface li 2013 it has a close correlation with the riverbed which could be reflected by the channel section so it could be an useful indicator to further explore the influence by wsrs based on the monitoring data from the q2 q4 and q7 sections in the study area the changes of each section incised were obviously after the flood season especially those from the q4 were very significantly meanwhile the channel where q2 section erosion located happened mainly in the north bank and continuously been broadened cui 2015 the main scouring were performed in the both sides of the channel and depositing in the middle of the channel the similar results were presented if comparing fig 4 a1 with fig 4 a2 the major erosion happened in the bank of the north channel while the sand bar mainly existed in the center of the channel due to this wsrs therefore the remote sensing interpretation results of this study were further verified by the measured data from the channel sections wsrss promote the land reclamation effect in the yrm by increasing the probability of the hyperpycnal flow which is one of the transport pattern of suspended sediment off the river mouth song et al 2018 during the transporting of suspended sediments off the river mouth different transport patterns which depend on the ssc and salinity have unique accumulation methods the hyperpycnal plume will form if the river density is less than the surrounding density when the river enters the sea unless the hyperpycnal flow will form each wsrs carries a lot of suspended sediment into the sea then it effectively increases the probability of the hyperpycnal flow which form sand bars at the esturarine area xu et al 2014 each wsrs plays a key role in a direct effect to form and change the variation area of sand bars in yrm and it can further explain the mechanism of such a form or change by analyzing the suspended sediment particle sizes and the corresponding changes within the near shore sections the suspended sediment particle size was smaller and more difficult to deposit due to the gradually implementation of wsrs which caused the downstream riverbed to be coarser therefore it resulted in reducing the channel sand bar erosion efficiency and worsening the delta erosion resistance miao et al 2016 long et al 2017 so these results explained that the yrm area existed erosion and the deposition concentration location in channel was stable in our study furthermore the sediment was accumulated at 25 35 km within the current estuary and the estuary delta was gradually expanding to the sea areas on both sides of the yrm but the deposition was in a dynamic change at the near shore wang et al 2015 and the small bay locates between yrm and the gudong seawall is easy to deposit yu et al 2015 according to our study result the yrm was spread on both river banks and mainly deposited on the west side near the gudong seawall although the average increase of the yrd area which is larger than our study result was 8 57 km2 in many years 2002 2015 according to the study from li 2016 so the yrm variation area would be smaller than 8 57 km2 according to this study and it can also indicated that the yrm variation area was smaller than before because the extending length of yellow river tail channel was slow during 1999 2010 zhang et al 2019 the yrm variation area due to 2014 wsrs is similar with those data from other researchers on the other hand our study showed that the yrm area was still large although wsrs implement interval was longer so it indicated other sediment factors expect wsrs factor continued to offset some parts of the sea erosion at the same time the yellow river estuary were modified by many dam projects that can further consolidate the deposition then enhance land reclamation effects therefore our study conclusions been further confirmed by some previous study cases the yrm accumulation position depended on the type of shear front which was influenced by the flood and ebb tide phases during wsrs period wang et al 2006 the tides near yrd basically parallel to the shoreline and have back and force movements which the flood tide direction is southeast and the ebb tide direction is northwest yu et al 2018 during the wsrs period the sediment will be deposited in the southeastern yrm along the flood tide and in the northwestern yrm along the ebb tide after the shear front then we inferred the variation area of sand bars in yrm was influenced by the ebb tide during 2014 wsrs period however it is difficult to accurately describe the shape and location of the yrm sand bars and analyze the formation mechanism with the current data sets xu et al 2014 high spatial resolution images could reflect more details on the sand bar shape after our result and analysis and it is possible to present dynamic information by a series of long period high spatial resolution images each wsrs obviously changed the sand bar area and further profoundly affected the ecological environment in the yrd a wsrs can directly affect the plant habitat of reeds on tidal flats or river channel the patches areas and numbers of both phragmites australis habitats and tidal flats are partly controlled by the fluxes of stream flow or sediment from yellow river and the heavy metals and arsenic as were carried to the yrd by wsrs due to rapid agricultural development upstream of the yrd and heavy applications of agrochemicals and fertilizers then the wetland habitat was seriously polluted bai et al 2012 so wsrs obviously changed the morphological characteristics of the sand bar and also affected the soil properties in the wetland bai et al 2014 from which the breeding of red crowned cranes can be influenced since their habitat types can be changed largely due to the annual or inter annual variation caused by each wsrs bai et al 2015 wang 2017 cao et al 2011 in addition each wsrs also affects the growth and reproduction of marine life the invertebrate assemblage was affected by the fluxes of stream flow and sediment from yellow river at the section of 20 km from the estuary zhang et al 2014 each wsrs changes the sand bar dynamic balance by depositing or eroding then changes the shape area of each sand bar annually li 2013 however the influence factors of each wsrs were complicated these factors include runoff sediment discharge suspended sediment particle size and the boundary condition of the riverbed in the yellow river yao 2014 wang 2005 furthermore each wsrs implementation time issue is also crucial if comparing with the high speed water flow experiment in the colorado river of united states grams et al 2010 which would also leads to change the sand bar largely on the first day of the experiment the sediment deposit was the largest but the erosion exceeded the deposition after three days according to grams study due to the high suspended solids concentration before the experiment some researches indicated that it would result to form a larger sand bar otherwise high speed water flow may erode the sand bar and would not form sand bars wu et al 2004 yuan et al 2012 these previous studies could help us improve the wsrs erosion efficiency in the river channel furthermore better control the yrm area the wetland conservation could guide a reasonable scientific strategy with a new cognition in the channel sand bars it s a scientific approach to discover the situation of channel deposition by the analysis of water level and sand bar interpretation result in channel during the flooding the administrators could monitor potential dangerous location which exists large area of sand bar in high water level meanwhile the location of the diversion dam could be further optimized by the channel deposition the better controlling of dams could improve the water diversion efficiency to solve the water shortage problem in the wetland during the wsrs period 6 conclusions the sand bar landscape change were explored both in the yellow river tail channel and its estuary before and after a wsrs in 2014 the high spatial resolution images were applied to quantitative extract and conduct comparative analysis on the change based on the comprehensive analysis of key influence factors such as tide level water level rainfall and storm surge from which we carried out a further analysis of the potential impact from this wsrs on the land reclamation in the yellow river delta wetland reserve the following conclusions can be drew from this study 1 in general the 2014 wsrs eroded the banks of the yellow river tail channel and change into some small broken sand bars it caused the sand bar to be fragmented though there was not a significant change in the location the sand bar area within the tail river channel totally decreased 5 55 km2 due to this wsrs and been scoured mainly in the straight channel middle channel the curved channel sand bar was vulnerably scoured but the overall erosion efficiency was low from this wsrs which was prefer to form the new sand bars 2 the estuarine sand bar in yrm had a large area deposition in west side and a small erosion area in east side after this wsrs and with a tendency to union some small sand bars on the north side the overall effect from this wsrs showed a movement to the sea from the channel sediment based on the area shape change of the estuarine sand bars the yrm area was increased by 2 08 km2 due to this wsrs indicating an obvious effect on land reclamation in the estuarine area at present few study were carried out to evaluate and analyze the change in tail channel and yrm caused by the single wsrs or multiple wsrss with the support of the remote sensing technology but it is obvious that each wsrs plays a key role in alleviating deposition and land reclamation and it changes the sand bars by activating with many other natural and artificial factors we in this study carefully evaluated the wsrs effects by focusing especially on the land reclamation and the landscape change of the sand bar within the yellow river tail channel and its estuary it provided also a new perspective for the protection of

1039,a 200 day tethered litter experiment was performed to evaluate the effects of two dimensions of hydrological connectivity lateral and longitudinal two perpendicular dimensions and three placement treatments surface semi buried and buried on suaeda salsa litter decomposition and nutrient release we used the hydrodynamic condition to represent hydrological connectivity mass loss in semi buried and buried treatments was higher than the surface treatment p 0 05 and the former two were basically the same except for the area farthest from the tidal creek the enhancement of lateral hydrological

treatments in most cases n concentrations increased with enhancing lateral hydrological connectivity while potassium k concentrations showed a decreasing trend under stronger hydrological connectivity phosphorus p and s concentrations were not affected by hydrological connectivity the amount of nutrient release increased with the enhancement of the lateral hydrological connectivity in the surface and semi buried treatments except for n and the longitudinal hydrological connectivity only influenced k under the surface treatments the amount of nutrient release under the surface treatments was lower than another two treatments p 0 05 our findings suggest that the lateral hydrological connectivity has a greater impact on mass loss and nutrient release than the longitudinal hydrological

riedl et al 2013 dick and osunkoya 2000 found that the tides would accelerate the rate of decomposition of mangrove litters and release large amounts of nutrients after one year decomposition however

hydrological connectivity is an integration of hydrological indicators such as flooding frequency and inundation time etc hiatt and passalacqua 2015 tidal creeks are widely distributed in the coastal salt marshes which constitute intricate hydrological connectivity networks however little information is available on the decomposition process from the dimension of hydrological connectivity although some decomposition experiments have been conducted in low medium and high tide flats sun et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 long term flooding in coastal salt marshes may result in sedimentation darke and megonigal 2003 in addition a large number of burrowing crabs exist in coastal salt marshes accelerating litter breakdown and returning into soil wang et al 2010 therefore plant litters may be transferred from the aboveground to the belowground and the microenvironment will alter the decomposition process liao et al 2008 previous studies have focused on the placements of litters such as the standing surface and buried in soil from forests wetlands and agricultural ecosystems holland and coleman 1987 moore et al 2005 zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2014 presented that the remaining mass of leaf litters increased with the buried depth in soil while the remaining mass of roots with different sizes showed different responses to the buried depth however the semi buried pattern between the two stages e g surface and buried ways are still kept unclear in any ecosystems it will be conducive to a comprehensive understanding of the nutrient return patterns of the litters especially in coastal wetlands where the position of the litters is prone to change the primary objective of this work was to explore the mass loss of litters and the release of four nutrient elements i e n p s and k under different hydrological connectivities and three placement treatments a 200 day decomposition experiment was conducted at five areas with different hydrological connectivites based on the longitudinal and lateral dimensions of a typical tidal creek meanwhile we simulated the existence of three placement treatments of litters i e surface semi buried and buried to analyze the litter decomposition processes after the standing stage we hypothesized that the enhancement of hydrological connectivity can contribute to the mass loss and the release of nutrients similarly the remaining mass and nutrient retention will be the highest in surface treatment followed by the semi buried and buried treatments our conclusion will provide theoretical support for the coastal wetland management sector from the perspectives of nutrient cycling 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area lies in the yellow river delta national nature reserve which is located in dongying city shandong province china it has a continental monsoon climate and the rainfall is mainly concentrated in the summer bai et al 2012 coastal salt marshes are the typical wetlands in the intertidal zone and affected by irregular semidiurnal tides sun et al 2016 intricate tidal creek systems with different hydrological connectivities can be found in the yellow river estuary along the secondary tidal creek in the artificial river area with two perpendicular dimensions a total of five sampling areas were selected along the longitudinal from the sea to the land and lateral gradually away from the tidal creek directions lon1 lon2 lat1 lon3 lat2 lat3 which were arranged in a t shape and the interval between adjacent areas was 100 150 m hydrological connectivity reflected by hydrodynamic conditions gradually decreased in the corresponding dimension table 1 suaeda salsa s salsa is the dominant species in the study area the densities of s salsa at lon1 lon2 lat1 lon3 lat2 and lat3 were 12 60 21 53 15 60 29 20 and 52 20 ind 0 25 m2 respectively the study area is rich in benthic organisms among which the more active ones are helice tientsinensis the initial n p s and k concentrations of s salsa litters were 6 11 0 27 4 55 and 3 25 g kg respectively 2 2 experimental design and chemical analyses in april 2018 standing litters of s salsa were collected for decomposition experiment in the study area all litters were washed and dried at 60 c for 48 h in an oven then the litters were cut into small pieces of about 8 cm and each 20 g pieces was tied to facilitate collection using cable ties in early may we placed all the tethered litters in five sampling areas and each tethered litter fixed with a wooden stick inserted 30 cm in the sediment to prevent them from being washed away by the tide to simulate the effects of litter placement patterns on its decomposition we set three different placement patterns placed at the surface above the ground semi buried in soil half above ground and half below ground and buried in soil buried 5 cm below the soil surface each treatment was set up with three replicates all litters were collected after 200 days in the semi buried and buried treatments the soil within 5 cm around the litters were also collected to control the excessively estimated loss all samples were washed after bringing them back to the laboratory and dried at 60 c for 48 h in the oven then the dry weight was determined the initial and remaining litters were ground and passed through a 0 25 mm sieve the c and n concentrations were measured on an elemental analyzer chnos vario el germany after digesting the samples with the hclo4 hno3 hf mixture p s and k were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes the hydrodynamic conditions were determined by a modified method according to erftemeijer and herman 1994 we placed four pieces of gypsums with the same size which were placed in june and harvested in august we used the mass change to represent hydrodynamic conditions all gypsums were dried at 60 c for 48 h after collection to determine dry weight 2 3 data and statistical analyses the mass of remaining litters was calculated by the following equation 1 r d w 200 d w 0 100 where r is the percentage of remaining and initial mass of litters dw200 is the residual dry weight of the litter at 200d g dw0 is the initial dry weight of the litter g and dw0 is 20 g in this study the amount of nutrient release or accumulation was expressed as a percentage compared to the initial nutrient content and was calculated by the following equation song et al 2017 2 e d w 200 c 200 d w 0 c 0 100 where e is the amount of nutrient release c0 is the initial nutrient concentration g kg 1 and c200 is the nutrient concentration g kg 1 at 200d e 100 indicated the net nutrient accumulation and e 100 indicated the net nutrient release one way anova was performed to compare differences in the mass loss nutrient concentration and nutrient release among different study areas or treatments if the data did not meet the premise of anova we used nonparametric tests statistical analysis was carried out using the spss 20 0 software package turkey hsd test or kruskal wallis was used for the multiple comparisons and p 0 05 was considered to be significantly different graphics were created using r tool 3 results 3 1 remaining mass of s salsa litters among the three placement treatments the mass of remaining litters was surface semi buried buried except for lon2 in the semi buried and buried treatments table 2 but there was no significant difference between semi buried and buried treatments p 0 05 except for lat3 p 0 05 along the corresponding hydrological connectivity gradient the remaining mass of s salsa under each placement treatment was the least in the area with the strongest hydrological connectivity and the most remaining mass occurred in the area with the weakest hydrological connectivity however no significant differences were observed along the longitudinal gradient p 0 05 whereas there was a significant difference along the lateral gradient p 0 05 except for the buried treatment 3 2 nutrient concentrations and stoichiometric ratios k and p concentrations of remaining litters were higher than the initial levels and the k concentration was approximately doubled after 200d fig 1 comparatively k concentration was relatively lower at lon1 and lon2 with strong hydrological connectivity in the surface or semi buried treatment p 0 05 generally p concentrations were lower in the surface treatment than those in semi buried and buried treatments however the significant differences were only observed at lon1 and lat2 p 0 05 n concentration in the surface treatment was 1 2 1 5 times as high as that of another two treatments and a significant difference was observed except for lat3 and lon3 areas p 0 05 n concentration did not show a noticeable change along the longitudinal gradient but it decreased significantly with the enhancement of the lateral hydrology connectivity p 0 05 s concentrations of remaining litters were higher compared with the initial concentrations in the surface treatment and they showed significant higher s levels in the surface treatment than those in another two treatments p 0 05 regardless of the hydrological connectivity patterns no significant effects on the levels of p and s were observed p 0 05 both c n and c p ratios of remaining litters were lower than the initial stoichiometric ratios and their ranges were from 35 to 47 and from 362 to 827 respectively fig 2 n p ratios exhibited higher values in the surface treatment while the c s ratios were completely reversed overall n p ratios of remaining litters were lower than the initial ratios c s ratios of remaining litters showed an increasing trend in semi buried and buried treatments 3 3 nutrient release of s salsa litters n p and s had a release process among the three placements the lowest nutrient release level was observed in surface treatment p 0 05 fig 3 under all hydrological connectivity conditions the nutrient release did not show significant difference between the semi buried and buried treatments p 0 05 n release was basically the same under all hydrological connectivity conditions p 0 05 k exhibited an accumulation in the surface treatment and the highest accumulation at lat3 nearly reached 200 longitudinal hydrological connectivity did not show significant effects on the nutrient release p 0 05 but the weaker hydrological connectivity promoted the accumulation of k in the surface treatment the stronger lateral hydrological connectivity accelerated the release of p and s and prohibited the k accumulation except for the buried treatment there were no significant differences in the nutrient release under different hydrological connectivity patterns when litters were buried in soil p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 mass loss of s salsa litters under different hydrological connectivities and placement patterns the litterbag approach is a common method for studying the litter decomposition process however this method is still controversial even though its mesh size can be manipulated to reduce particle loss it obviously hindered the entry of the decomposer especially in coastal salt marshes with abundant benthic organisms bärlocher 2005 karberg et al 2008 previous study indicated that crabs could change the decomposition process by litter fragmentation and feeding zhang et al 2013 hunter et al 2003 proved that predators affected the chemical components of decomposition through fungivorous and bacterivorous fauna in the riparian area therefore the tethered litter approach karberg et al 2008 was used to study the decomposition process in this study litter decomposition varied among different hydrological connectivities and placement patterns previous studies have also shown a close relationship between hydrological connectivity and litter decomposition fuell et al 2013 langhans and tockner 2006 frequent flooding could accelerate the decomposition within a certain wetting and drying cycle baker et al 2001 which is consistent with our results however perez et al 2018 reported that the mass loss of litters did not significantly differ among five hydroperiods with different flooding frequencies we observed significant differences in lateral hydrological connectivity except for the buried treatments table 2 the tendency that the remaining mass of s salsa litters gradually increased as the diminished hydrological connectivity was verified except for lon3 in the buried treatment the litter decomposition driven by hydrological processes in our study could be attributed to the following reasons first leaching and physical fragmentation of s salsa litters could greatly contribute to litter decomposition inundation might exacerbate the leaching of lignin and physical fragmentation of s salsa litters affected by water flow fuell et al 2013 xie et al 2019 second microbial decomposition might be another important reason dry wet alternations have been manifested to accelerate litter breakdown by promoting microbial decomposer activities battle and golladay 2001 our research suggest that more frequent dry wet alternations could facilitate litter decomposition e g at least at lon1 in addition under the variations in dry and wet cycling the activity and production of extracellular enzymes associated with litter decomposition would increase bouskill et al 2016 perez et al 2018 third the effects of the invertebrates could not be ignored previous studies confirmed that invertebrate biomass e g shredders and scrapers was positively correlated with mass loss of litters rezende et al 2018 tonin et al 2014 under stronger hydrological connectivity the relevant invertebrates had a higher probability of migrating with water or settling a positive response between soil moisture and macrobenthic biomass was observed in salt marshes of the yellow river delta li et al 2016 similar results have also been presented by john j hutchens and wallace 2002 who reported that the shredders in the uplands with low moisture and low decomposition exhibited less biomass compared to the bank with higher soil moisture and high decomposition therefore higher decomposition rates were observed at lon1 and lat1 with better hydrological conditions table 1 in any case the remaining mass of s salsa litters under the surface treatments was the highest which was supported by previous studies harner et al 2009 found that the decomposition rate of buried litters in soil was higher than that of the surface placed litters owing to high fungal biomass and enzyme activity vivanco and austin 2006 also observed faster decomposition of underground litters generally the decomposition process was more likely to occur in an aerobic environment while the dissolved oxygen of the underground environment was susceptible to flooding compared with the soil surface which might limit the activities of microbes battle and golladay 2001 neckles and neill 1994 proposed two decomposition modes caused by oxygen availability under flooding conditions including the accelerated decomposition of the surface litters with flooding and the inhibited decomposition of the underground litters caused by anaerobic environment our results supported that decomposition processes were not restricted by oxygen probably because of the frequent tidal floods that made the microbes adaptable bouskill et al 2013 and the appropriate flooding frequency in our study areas could create a suitable environment for litter decomposition in soil zhao et al 2014 the underground litters were more easily accessible to benthos in coastal wetlands which might be the determining factor for the mass loss of litters in this study not all placement patterns had an impact on the litter decomposition the decomposition rates of the litters in the semi buried treatments were sharply reduced compared with the surface treatments and it seemed to be the same as the buried treatments p 0 05 table 2 except for lat3 it implies that at least at the semi buried stage the mass loss of s salsa litters increased rapidly and approached to the burial stage 4 2 variations in nutrient concentrations under different hydrological connectivities and placement patterns on the basis of the initial c n c p and n p ratios of s salsa litters we could predict that the litter decomposition might be mainly controlled by n and p because they have exceeded critical stoichiometric ratios c n ratio of 31 48 william et al 2007 c p ratio of 200 brinson 1977 and n p ratio of 16 aerts and chapin 2000 because the initial c p ratios of s salsa litters were much more than 200 and exceeded 300 after 200d of field decomposition the decomposition process was more severely limited by p leading to an immobilization tendency of p p concentration of s salsa litters placed on the soil surface was lower than that of litters buried in soil whereas significant differences were only observed at lon1 and lat2 p 0 05 p can be oxidized through the heterotrophic processes in soil making it easier for the decomposer to obtain p for immobilization fourqurean and schrlau 2003 the litters placed on the soil surface were only partially exposed to the soil therefore the p immobilization might be relatively lower contrary to our expectations hydrological connectivity did not affect the litter p concentration which indicated that microbes immobilized the similar amount of p under different hydrological connectivities this is inconsistent with the results by sun et al 2012 and it was probably ascribed to the different ranges of hydrological connectivities n limitation could be alleviated relative to p according the initial n p ratios of s salsa litters and the final c n ratios of litters with less than 48 at the end of the experiment indicating that n was no longer a limiting element therefore the litter n concentration did not always increase since the surrounding environment played a dominant role in changing nitrogen concentrations william et al 2007 obviously the lateral hydrological connectivity showed a significant positive effect on litter n concentration this was due to the fact that microbes can access to exogenous n sources from the tidal water to the litters meanwhile floods could change the speed of a certain decomposition stage for instance neckles and neill 1994 presented that the flood reduced the leaching time of litter n leading to n immobilization we observed that litter n concentration in the surface treatment was higher than that in the semi buried or buried treatment which might be associated with abundant benthic organisms in the underground environment because they could accelerate the turnover of biogenic elements sun et al 2016 meanwhile substrates with high c n ratios were not conducive to n immobilization in soil environment because the microbes in soil might adapt to the low nutrient environment and the litter n could be input into the soil through the fungal hyphae especially in nitrogen limiting systems manzoni et al 2008 seastedt et al 1992 in addition litters placed on the soil surface can accumulate n from atmospheric deposition kochy and wilson 1997 similar to p hydrological connectivity had no significant effects on litter s concentration sulfur may be mineralized to achieve optimal decomposition conditions critical ratio of c s 200 vanwesemael 1993 for microbes however s seemed to be immobilized by microbes in the surface treatments and further study is still needed to explain it the litters with lower mass loss in the surface treatments contained more carbon which caused the litters to adsorb more sulfate from the tidal floods stanko golden et al 1994 therefore the relatively higher litter s concentration was observed in the surface treatments k was present in the form of water soluble salt in s salsa litters and it was easy to physically dissolve palviainen et al 2004 have shown that litter k concentration decreased rapidly at the early stages of decomposition however this is not the case in this study litter k might have occurred the leaching loss and then a certain amount of k was delivered to the litters owing to external input e g frequent tides a similar result can be observed that the litter k concentration increased nearly four times from 18th to 96th week ventura et al 2010 the leaching loss of the newly litter k might be accumulated osono and takeda 2004 staaf and berg 1982 as we found that the k concentrations at lon1 and lon2 with lower biomass of s salsa were relatively low fig 1 unlike other elements litter k concentration did not significantly respond to the placement patterns 4 3 net release of s salsa nutrients under different hydrological connectivities and placement patterns nutrient accumulation or release was determined by the remaining litter mass and the nutrient concentrations previous studies have shown that flooding could stimulate nutrient release e g n p and k in the surface placement lockaby et al 1996 wang et al 2018 however wang et al 2018 observed that the intensity of flooding was not benefit to the n and p release of native species in the minjiang estuary we observed that nutrients except for n were released in the place with stronger lateral hydrological connectivities in the surface and semi buried treatments similarly the remaining n levels under the six flooding conditions were the same in the aboveground treatments neckles and neill 1994 hydrological connectivity input n source for microbial immobilization and thus accelerated the decomposition rate of litters in the lateral dimension leading to similar n release of s salsa litters the longitudinal hydrological connectivity had no effects on the nutrient release except for k which might be because the nutrient release of litters was more sensitive to the lateral hydrological connectivity than the longitudinal hydrological connectivity on the same scale our study also showed that placement patterns had an important effect on nutrient release of s salsa litters nutrient released in the surface treatments was significantly lower than those in the semi buried and buried treatments raimundo et al 2008 presented that the release of n p and s were associated with the litter placement patterns however wei et al 2017 reported that the surface and buried treatments showed little effects on the remaining amount of n in the litter this might be attributed to the type and quality of the substrate and the nutrient availability frey et al 2000 we observed that there was no significant difference in nutrient release of the litter between semi buried and buried treatments we speculated that once the litter was partially buried in soil the nutrients would be quickly released accelerating the nutrient turnover in coastal salt marshes on the contrary a large number of aboveground litters existed in coastal wetlands limiting the nutrient release our study also indicates that once the litter is covered by the soil the effect of hydrological connectivity can be ignored in coastal wetlands fig 3 5 conclusions in the current study using tethered litter approach we explored the effects of hydrological connectivities and placement patterns on the remaining mass and nutrient release or accumulation of the litter through the pioneer species s salsa in coastal salt marshes of the yellow river estuary in general the stronger hydrological connectivity trended to accelerate the litter decomposition but it was only observed a significant difference among different lateral connectivities under the surface and semi buried treatments the release of k p and s in s salsa litters increased with the enhancement of lateral hydrological connectivites except for the buried treatments while the longitudinal hydrological connectivity had no effects on the nutrient release of s salsa litters except for k in the surface treatments obviously our hypotheses were partially verified in addition litter decomposition was strongly controlled by the placement patterns mass loss and nutrient release of s salsa litters were the lowest in the surface treatments and there was no difference between the semi buried and buried treatments except the mass loss at lat3 our results indicate that the exposure of litters to the soil will accelerate the decomposition process enhanced hydrological connectivity in coastal wetlands especially lateral hydrological connectivity could accelerate the return of nutrients from the litter to soil the effects of hydrological connectivity on the litter breakdown could be mediated by placement patterns and the decomposition process might not be controlled by hydrological connectivity once the litter has excessive exposure to the soil further research is still needed to focus on temporal changes in litter decomposition and their response of litter placement patterns to changing the external conditions e g sedimentary erosion and crab excavation conflict of interest none

megonigal 2003 in addition a large number of burrowing crabs exist in coastal salt marshes accelerating litter breakdown and returning into soil wang et al 2010 therefore plant litters may be transferred from the aboveground to the belowground and the microenvironment will alter the decomposition process liao et al 2008 previous studies have focused on the placements of litters such as the standing surface and buried in soil from forests wetlands and agricultural ecosystems holland and coleman 1987 moore et al 2005 zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2014 presented that the remaining mass of leaf litters increased with the buried depth in soil while the remaining mass of roots with different sizes showed different responses to the buried depth however the semi buried pattern between the two stages e g surface and buried ways are still kept unclear in any ecosystems it will be conducive to a comprehensive understanding of the nutrient return patterns of the litters especially in coastal wetlands where the position of the litters is prone to change the primary objective of this work was to explore the mass loss of litters and the release of four nutrient elements i e n p s and k under different hydrological connectivities and three placement treatments a 200 day decomposition experiment was conducted at five areas with different hydrological connectivites based on the longitudinal and lateral dimensions of a typical tidal creek meanwhile we simulated the existence of three placement treatments of litters i e surface semi buried and buried to analyze the litter decomposition processes after the standing stage we hypothesized that the enhancement of hydrological connectivity can contribute to the mass loss and the release of nutrients similarly the remaining mass and nutrient retention will be the highest in surface treatment followed by the semi buried and buried treatments our conclusion will provide theoretical support for the coastal wetland management sector from the perspectives of nutrient cycling 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area lies in the yellow river delta national nature reserve which is located in dongying city shandong province china it has a continental monsoon climate and the rainfall is mainly concentrated in the summer bai et al 2012 coastal salt marshes are the typical wetlands in the intertidal zone and affected by irregular semidiurnal tides sun et al 2016 intricate tidal creek systems with different hydrological connectivities can be found in the yellow river estuary along the secondary tidal creek in the artificial river area with two perpendicular dimensions a total of five sampling areas were selected along the longitudinal from the sea to the land and lateral gradually away from the tidal creek directions lon1 lon2 lat1 lon3 lat2 lat3 which were arranged in a t shape and the interval between adjacent areas was 100 150 m hydrological connectivity reflected by hydrodynamic conditions gradually decreased in the corresponding dimension table 1 suaeda salsa s salsa is the dominant species in the study area the densities of s salsa at lon1 lon2 lat1 lon3 lat2 and lat3 were 12 60 21 53 15 60 29 20 and 52 20 ind 0 25 m2 respectively the study area is rich in benthic organisms among which the more active ones are helice tientsinensis the initial n p s and k concentrations of s salsa litters were 6 11 0 27 4 55 and 3 25 g kg respectively 2 2 experimental design and chemical analyses in april 2018 standing litters of s salsa were collected for decomposition experiment in the study area all litters were washed and dried at 60 c for 48 h in an oven then the litters were cut into small pieces of about 8 cm and each 20 g pieces was tied to facilitate collection using cable ties in early may we placed all the tethered litters in five sampling areas and each tethered litter fixed with a wooden stick inserted 30 cm in the sediment to prevent them from being washed away by the tide to simulate the effects of litter placement patterns on its decomposition we set three different placement patterns placed at the surface above the ground semi buried in soil half above ground and half below ground and buried in soil buried 5 cm below the soil surface each treatment was set up with three replicates all litters were collected after 200 days in the semi buried and buried treatments the soil within 5 cm around the litters were also collected to control the excessively estimated loss all samples were washed after bringing them back to the laboratory and dried at 60 c for 48 h in the oven then the dry weight was determined the initial and remaining litters were ground and passed through a 0 25 mm sieve the c and n concentrations were measured on an elemental analyzer chnos vario el germany after digesting the samples with the hclo4 hno3 hf mixture p s and k were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes the hydrodynamic conditions were determined by a modified method according to erftemeijer and herman 1994 we placed four pieces of gypsums with the same size which were placed in june and harvested in august we used the mass change to represent hydrodynamic conditions all gypsums were dried at 60 c for 48 h after collection to determine dry weight 2 3 data and statistical analyses the mass of remaining litters was calculated by the following equation 1 r d w 200 d w 0 100 where r is the percentage of remaining and initial mass of litters dw200 is the residual dry weight of the litter at 200d g dw0 is the initial dry weight of the litter g and dw0 is 20 g in this study the amount of nutrient release or accumulation was expressed as a percentage compared to the initial nutrient content and was calculated by the following equation song et al 2017 2 e d w 200 c 200 d w 0 c 0 100 where e is the amount of nutrient release c0 is the initial nutrient concentration g kg 1 and c200 is the nutrient concentration g kg 1 at 200d e 100 indicated the net nutrient accumulation and e 100 indicated the net nutrient release one way anova was performed to compare differences in the mass loss nutrient concentration and nutrient release among different study areas or treatments if the data did not meet the premise of anova we used nonparametric tests statistical analysis was carried out using the spss 20 0 software package turkey hsd test or kruskal wallis was used for the multiple comparisons and p 0 05 was considered to be significantly different graphics were created using r tool 3 results 3 1 remaining mass of s salsa litters among the three placement treatments the mass of remaining litters was surface semi buried buried except for lon2 in the semi buried and buried treatments table 2 but there was no significant difference between semi buried and buried treatments p 0 05 except for lat3 p 0 05 along the corresponding hydrological connectivity gradient the remaining mass of s salsa under each placement treatment was the least in the area with the strongest hydrological connectivity and the most remaining mass occurred in the area with the weakest hydrological connectivity however no significant differences were observed along the longitudinal gradient p 0 05 whereas there was a significant difference along the lateral gradient p 0 05 except for the buried treatment 3 2 nutrient concentrations and stoichiometric ratios k and p concentrations of remaining litters were higher than the initial levels and the k concentration was approximately doubled after 200d fig 1 comparatively k concentration was relatively lower at lon1 and lon2 with strong hydrological connectivity in the surface or semi buried treatment p 0 05 generally p concentrations were lower in the surface treatment than those in semi buried and buried treatments however the significant differences were only observed at lon1 and lat2 p 0 05 n concentration in the surface treatment was 1 2 1 5 times as high as that of another two treatments and a significant difference was observed except for lat3 and lon3 areas p 0 05 n concentration did not show a noticeable change along the longitudinal gradient but it decreased significantly with the enhancement of the lateral hydrology connectivity p 0 05 s concentrations of remaining litters were higher compared with the initial concentrations in the surface treatment and they showed significant higher s levels in the surface treatment than those in another two treatments p 0 05 regardless of the hydrological connectivity patterns no significant effects on the levels of p and s were observed p 0 05 both c n and c p ratios of remaining litters were lower than the initial stoichiometric ratios and their ranges were from 35 to 47 and from 362 to 827 respectively fig 2 n p ratios exhibited higher values in the surface treatment while the c s ratios were completely reversed overall n p ratios of remaining litters were lower than the initial ratios c s ratios of remaining litters showed an increasing trend in semi buried and buried treatments 3 3 nutrient release of s salsa litters n p and s had a release process among the three placements the lowest nutrient release level was observed in surface treatment p 0 05 fig 3 under all hydrological connectivity conditions the nutrient release did not show significant difference between the semi buried and buried treatments p 0 05 n release was basically the same under all hydrological connectivity conditions p 0 05 k exhibited an accumulation in the surface treatment and the highest accumulation at lat3 nearly reached 200 longitudinal hydrological connectivity did not show significant effects on the nutrient release p 0 05 but the weaker hydrological connectivity promoted the accumulation of k in the surface treatment the stronger lateral hydrological connectivity accelerated the release of p and s and prohibited the k accumulation except for the buried treatment there were no significant differences in the nutrient release under different hydrological connectivity patterns when litters were buried in soil p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 mass loss of s salsa litters under different hydrological connectivities and placement patterns the litterbag approach is a common method for studying the litter decomposition process however this method is still controversial even though its mesh size can be manipulated to reduce particle loss it obviously hindered the entry of the decomposer especially in coastal salt marshes with abundant benthic organisms bärlocher 2005 karberg et al 2008 previous study indicated that crabs could change the decomposition process by litter fragmentation and feeding zhang et al 2013 hunter et al 2003 proved that predators affected the chemical components of decomposition through fungivorous and bacterivorous fauna in the riparian area therefore the tethered litter approach karberg et al 2008 was used to study the decomposition process in this study litter decomposition varied among different hydrological connectivities and placement patterns previous studies have also shown a close relationship between hydrological connectivity and litter decomposition fuell et al 2013 langhans and tockner 2006 frequent flooding could accelerate the decomposition within a certain wetting and drying cycle baker et al 2001 which is consistent with our results however perez et al 2018 reported that the mass loss of litters did not significantly differ among five hydroperiods with different flooding frequencies we observed significant differences in lateral hydrological connectivity except for the buried treatments table 2 the tendency that the remaining mass of s salsa litters gradually increased as the diminished hydrological connectivity was verified except for lon3 in the buried treatment the litter decomposition driven by hydrological processes in our study could be attributed to the following reasons first leaching and physical fragmentation of s salsa litters could greatly contribute to litter decomposition inundation might exacerbate the leaching of lignin and physical fragmentation of s salsa litters affected by water flow fuell et al 2013 xie et al 2019 second microbial decomposition might be another important reason dry wet alternations have been manifested to accelerate litter breakdown by promoting microbial decomposer activities battle and golladay 2001 our research suggest that more frequent dry wet alternations could facilitate litter decomposition e g at least at lon1 in addition under the variations in dry and wet cycling the activity and production of extracellular enzymes associated with litter decomposition would increase bouskill et al 2016 perez et al 2018 third the effects of the invertebrates could not be ignored previous studies confirmed that invertebrate biomass e g shredders and scrapers was positively correlated with mass loss of litters rezende et al 2018 tonin et al 2014 under stronger hydrological connectivity the relevant invertebrates had a higher probability of migrating with water or settling a positive response between soil moisture and macrobenthic biomass was observed in salt marshes of the yellow river delta li et al 2016 similar results have also been presented by john j hutchens and wallace 2002 who reported that the shredders in the uplands with low moisture and low decomposition exhibited less biomass compared to the bank with higher soil moisture and high decomposition therefore higher decomposition rates were observed at lon1 and lat1 with better hydrological conditions table 1 in any case the remaining mass of s salsa litters under the surface treatments was the highest which was supported by previous studies harner et al 2009 found that the decomposition rate of buried litters in soil was higher than that of the surface placed litters owing to high fungal biomass and enzyme activity vivanco and austin 2006 also observed faster decomposition of underground litters generally the decomposition process was more likely to occur in an aerobic environment while the dissolved oxygen of the underground environment was susceptible to flooding compared with the soil surface which might limit the activities of microbes battle and golladay 2001 neckles and neill 1994 proposed two decomposition modes caused by oxygen availability under flooding conditions including the accelerated decomposition of the surface litters with flooding and the inhibited decomposition of the underground litters caused by anaerobic environment our results supported that decomposition processes were not restricted by oxygen probably because of the frequent tidal floods that made the microbes adaptable bouskill et al 2013 and the appropriate flooding frequency in our study areas could create a suitable environment for litter decomposition in soil zhao et al 2014 the underground litters were more easily accessible to benthos in coastal wetlands which might be the determining factor for the mass loss of litters in this study not all placement patterns had an impact on the litter decomposition the decomposition rates of the litters in the semi buried treatments were sharply reduced compared with the surface treatments and it seemed to be the same as the buried treatments p 0 05 table 2 except for lat3 it implies that at least at the semi buried stage the mass loss of s salsa litters increased rapidly and approached to the burial stage 4 2 variations in nutrient concentrations under different hydrological connectivities and placement patterns on the basis of the initial c n c p and n p ratios of s salsa litters we could predict that the litter decomposition might be mainly controlled by n and p because they have exceeded critical stoichiometric ratios c n ratio of 31 48 william et al 2007 c p ratio of 200 brinson 1977 and n p ratio of 16 aerts and chapin 2000 because the initial c p ratios of s salsa litters were much more than 200 and exceeded 300 after 200d of field decomposition the decomposition process was more severely limited by p leading to an immobilization tendency of p p concentration of s salsa litters placed on the soil surface was lower than that of litters buried in soil whereas significant differences were only observed at lon1 and lat2 p 0 05 p can be oxidized through the heterotrophic processes in soil making it easier for the decomposer to obtain p for immobilization fourqurean and schrlau 2003 the litters placed on the soil surface were only partially exposed to the soil therefore the p immobilization might be relatively lower contrary to our expectations hydrological connectivity did not affect the litter p concentration which indicated that microbes immobilized the similar amount of p under different hydrological connectivities this is inconsistent with the results by sun et al 2012 and it was probably ascribed to the different ranges of hydrological connectivities n limitation could be alleviated relative to p according the initial n p ratios of s salsa litters and the final c n ratios of litters with less than 48 at the end of the experiment indicating that n was no longer a limiting element therefore the litter n concentration did not always increase since the surrounding environment played a dominant role in changing nitrogen concentrations william et al 2007 obviously the lateral hydrological connectivity showed a significant positive effect on litter n concentration this was due to the fact that microbes can access to exogenous n sources from the tidal water to the litters meanwhile floods could change the speed of a certain decomposition stage for instance neckles and neill 1994 presented that the flood reduced the leaching time of litter n leading to n immobilization we observed that litter n concentration in the surface treatment was higher than that in the semi buried or buried treatment which might be associated with abundant benthic organisms in the underground environment because they could accelerate the turnover of biogenic elements sun et al 2016 meanwhile substrates with high c n ratios were not conducive to n immobilization in soil environment because the microbes in soil might adapt to the low nutrient environment and the litter n could be input into the soil through the fungal hyphae especially in nitrogen limiting systems manzoni et al 2008 seastedt et al 1992 in addition litters placed on the soil surface can accumulate n from atmospheric deposition kochy and wilson 1997 similar to p hydrological connectivity had no significant effects on litter s concentration sulfur may be mineralized to achieve optimal decomposition conditions critical ratio of c s 200 vanwesemael 1993 for microbes however s seemed to be immobilized by microbes in the surface treatments and further study is still needed to explain it the litters with lower mass loss in the surface treatments contained more carbon which caused the litters to adsorb more sulfate from the tidal floods stanko golden et al 1994 therefore the relatively higher litter s concentration was observed in the surface treatments k was present in the form of water soluble salt in s salsa litters and it was easy to physically dissolve palviainen et al 2004 have shown that litter k concentration decreased rapidly at the early stages of decomposition however this is not the case in this study litter k might have occurred the leaching loss and then a certain amount of k was delivered to the litters owing to external input e g frequent tides a similar result can be observed that the litter k concentration increased nearly four times from 18th to 96th week ventura et al 2010 the leaching loss of the newly litter k might be accumulated osono and takeda 2004 staaf and berg 1982 as we found that the k concentrations at lon1 and lon2 with lower biomass of s salsa were relatively low fig 1 unlike other elements litter k concentration did not significantly respond to the placement patterns 4 3 net release of s salsa nutrients under different hydrological connectivities and placement patterns nutrient accumulation or release was determined by the remaining litter mass and the nutrient concentrations previous studies have shown that flooding could stimulate nutrient release e g n p and k in the surface placement lockaby et al 1996 wang et al 2018 however wang et al 2018 observed that the intensity of flooding was not benefit to the n and p release of native species in the minjiang estuary we observed that nutrients except for n were released in the place with stronger lateral hydrological connectivities in the surface and semi buried treatments similarly the remaining n levels under the six flooding conditions were the same in the aboveground treatments neckles and neill 1994 hydrological connectivity input n source for microbial immobilization and thus accelerated the decomposition rate of litters in the lateral dimension leading to similar n release of s salsa litters the longitudinal hydrological connectivity had no effects on the nutrient release except for k which might be because the nutrient release of litters was more sensitive to the lateral hydrological connectivity than the longitudinal hydrological connectivity on the same scale our study also showed that placement patterns had an important effect on nutrient release of s salsa litters nutrient released in the surface treatments was significantly lower than those in the semi buried and buried treatments raimundo et al 2008 presented that the release of n p and s were associated with the litter placement patterns however wei et al 2017 reported that the surface and buried treatments showed little effects on the remaining amount of n in the litter this might be attributed to the type and quality of the substrate and the nutrient availability frey et al 2000 we observed that there was no significant difference in nutrient release of the litter between semi buried and buried treatments we speculated that once the litter was partially buried in soil the nutrients would be quickly released accelerating the nutrient turnover in coastal salt marshes on the contrary a large number of aboveground litters existed in coastal wetlands limiting the nutrient release our study also indicates that once the litter is covered by the soil the effect of hydrological connectivity can be ignored in coastal wetlands fig 3 5 conclusions in the current study using tethered litter approach we explored the effects of hydrological connectivities and placement patterns on the remaining mass and nutrient release or accumulation of the litter through the pioneer species s salsa in coastal salt marshes of the yellow river estuary in general the stronger hydrological connectivity trended to accelerate the litter decomposition but it was only observed a significant difference among different lateral connectivities under the surface and semi buried treatments the release of k p and s in s salsa litters increased with the enhancement of lateral hydrological connectivites except for the buried treatments while the longitudinal hydrological connectivity had no effects on the nutrient release of s salsa litters except for k in the surface treatments obviously our hypotheses were partially verified in addition litter decomposition was strongly controlled by the placement patterns mass loss and nutrient release of s salsa litters were the lowest in the surface treatments and there was no difference between the semi buried and buried treatments except the mass loss at lat3 our results indicate that the exposure of litters to the soil will accelerate the decomposition process enhanced hydrological connectivity in coastal wetlands especially lateral hydrological connectivity could accelerate the return of nutrients from the litter to soil the effects of hydrological connectivity on the litter breakdown could be mediated by placement patterns and the decomposition process might not be controlled by hydrological connectivity once the litter has excessive exposure to the soil further research is still needed to focus on temporal changes in litter decomposition and their response of litter placement patterns to changing the external conditions e g sedimentary erosion and crab excavation conflict of interest none
