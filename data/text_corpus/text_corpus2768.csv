abundant as rock form the method of obtaining and utilizing the iron oxide nanoparticles is highly compatible with the environment does not have toxic effects and does not require expensive chemicals

min of drying the samples were studied transmission electron microscopy tem images were acquired on a jem 2100 with an accelerating voltage of 60 200 kv provided with a high resolution ccd camera 41 42 3 adsorption studies batch tests were used for the adsorption of pollutants on fe₂o₃ 43 all the experiments were carried out at laboratory scale using 250 ml erlenmeyer flask as batch reactors in a proper adsorption experiment the iron oxide nanoparticles dose has different variations for deciding on the greatest adsorption competence fig 2 present the treatment steps of raw landfill leachate by fe₂o₃ and its recovery and reuse as a start of variating the ph of solution a 5 g of fe₂o₃ was dispersed in 150 ml of raw landfill leachate wastewater at a different particular concentration of ph of 2 3 4 6 8 and 10 using 0 1 mol l hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide at 200 5 rpm the flasks were vibrated in an orbital shaker for 1 h at 25 and atmospheric pressure most of the literatures on pollutants adsorption by fe₂o₃ showed ph from 4 00 to 5 00 is preferred for an excellent removal so in the determination of cod nh₃ n and color ph was monitored in this range of acidity it can be seen that when the ph is 4 there is a maximum adsorbed intensity hence this ph is preferred to observe the effect of adsorbent dose on cod nh₃ n and color iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles does was evaluated by several concentrations of 5 10 20 30 35 40 and 50 g at optimum desire of ph 4 00 the mixture was shaken at room temperature until the equilibrium time was reached in order to study the effect time on the adsorption uptake landfill leachate wastewater was used adsorbent dose was fixed at 20 g and ph at 4 00 to study different contact time of 10 20 40 60 80 100 and 120 min finally to study the effect of temperature on the adsorption of fe₂o₃ the experiments were studied at different temperatures 40 50 60 70 and 80 using an orbital shaker with temperature control with a constant ph dose and contact time three technical replicates of each test were performed to insure accurate measurements and accurate results after the treatment the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2005 and environmental quality control of pollution from solid waste transfer station and landfill regulations 2009 under the laws of malaysia environmental quality act 1974 confirmed all tests that were carried out the experiments were done three times to ensure steady outcomes and in order to examine adsorption studies the mean values were applied the following eq 1 shows the competence in the elimination of cod nh₃ n and color 1 e r c i c f c i 100 where ci and cf represent the initial and final pollutant concentration respectively er is the efficiency removal 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterisation 4 1 1 xrd x ray diffraction in this study iron oxide nanoparticles were obtained naturally the xrd results of natural iron oxide nanoparticles is shown in fig 3 the xrd patterns were from 10 2ө 70 of proposed nanoparticles oxide at controlled temperatures 500 c 44 it can be clearly seen from the figure that fe₂o₃ nanostructure showed high intensity peaks when sonication power was passed 20 w the patterns showed strong peaks from 20 degree the main peaks were observed at 26 5 33 35 41 50 1 53 4 59 and 63 degree which are related with 012 104 110 113 024 116 112 and 214 the pattern peaks can be indexed to the mixture of iron oxides nanoparticles according to jcpds card n 24 0072 the sharpness and intensity of peaks designate well crystallinenature of the natural iron oxide nanoparticles xrd pattern and jcpds card n 24 0072 were confirmed presence of crystalline iron in fe₂o₃ nanoparticles with 31 3 as it mentioned in 45 46 similar studies elsewhere found by 47 49 therefore natural iron oxide were successfully obtained as crystalline magnetic nanoparticles 4 1 2 fourier transform infra red ft ir spectroscopy ftir approved the construction of ore iron oxide nanoparticles fig 4 demonstrates the absorption bands from 600 to 500 cm ¹ assigned to c i stretching group 50 the monitored peak at 1035 cm ¹ in the ft ir spectrum highly endorsed the cooco bond and the same bond got at this peck for a synthesised fe₂o₃ by 51 the peak at 1654 cm ¹ was ascribed to the cc stretching and bending vibration of the alkene groups it is worth noting that the peak at 2370 cm ¹ was ascribed to the o co stretching strong bending vibration of the carbon dioxide the very broad absorption band centred at 3653 cm ¹ and 3693 cm ¹ was assigned to the stretching and bending vibration of the hydroxyl group 52 ft ir spectra investigation of pure iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles shows that most of the peak was at a lower value while the hydroxyl group oh contributed to the highest adsorption meanwhile ftir are accordance with the literature for the synthesis and coating fe₂o₃ and natural iron oxide nanoparticle fe₂o₃ 53 the mechanism of the natural iron oxide can be enlightened depending on the ftir peak assignments taking into considerations of ftir spectroscopically results carbon dioxide and hydroxyl group are the main bonds on the iron oxide particle surface 54 4 1 3 sem edx analysis fig 5 demonstrates the scanning electron microscope sem micrographs of the testers fe₂o₃ pre and post milling unmilled ore magnetic iron oxide evidently shows inhomogeneities regarding particle size distribution due to the big size there is a decrease in the size of the particle to the nano size after milling with relatively better homogeneity the image a with great enhancement reveals clearly that the main rock of iron oxide is in fact agglomerates of much smaller particles the average particle size after milling is between 21 nm 70 nm it was observed that the fe₂o₃ aggregate together after the treatment due to the saturation condition in the presence of the landfill leachate edx analysis garnered information included spectra with peaks conforming to all the various features that are available in the tester fig 5 shows the elements having characteristic peaks of unique energy the diagram illustrates zero pollution with all the metals that were experimented where the highest peak is the iron fe in relation to the composition edx the obtained natural iron oxide nanoparticles present some impurities with main elements of fe and o these impurities carbon aluminium and silicon have a very low weight and percentage in the total amount the presence of these impurities probably due to natural composition of the iron oxide however different studies of synthesis iron oxide nanoparticles have shown impurities after been synthesised as well 55 56 fig 6 demonstrate the tem images of pure iron oxide nanoparticles the high resolution of tem images distribute the particle size of fe₂o₃ in a diameter of 21 nm 70 nm approximately and aggregated to each other the image a confirm that the fe₂o₃ nanoparticles are crystalline as further confirmed by xrd with 31 3 the result shows that iron oxide nanoparticles were mainly obtained as granules with nonspherical shape 4 2 adsorption results the aim of applying batch adsorption tests was to produce the highest adsorption efficacy of fe₂o₃ nanoadsorbents from contaminants in raw landfill leachate the pre characterised leachate determined the concentration of cod nh₃ n and color as shown in table 1 4 2 1 effect of contact time the concentration of the organic and inorganic pollutants in landfill leachate was decided prior to the procedure and after varied time with magnetic nanoparticles the effects of the contacted time on the adsorption of cod nh₃ n and color were studied from 0 to 120 min the results for ore nanoadsorbents are shown in fig 7 clearly fe₂o₃ showed significant effectiveness in the adsorption during the initial phases of the treatment nevertheless cod nh₃ n and color removal by fe₂o₃ was detected to achieve the optimum saturation state after 60 min of contact time fig 8 ashrafi 57 conducted similar study where fe₃o₄ mno₂ core shell magnetic nanoparticles was used the optimum times for the adsorption using fe₃o₄ mno₂ was achieved at 60 min the affinity of the pollutant for fe₂o₃ from wastewater must always be in an excellent performance in order to achieve the equilibrium at a short time scale 58 the faster equilibrium and adsorption time of the fe₂o₃ the more likely the returns to the natural properties of the ore iron oxide nanoparticles based on the results obtained from the experiments above the optimum contact time for fe₂o₃ was selected as 40 60 min 4 2 2 effect of ph the removal rate of cod nh₃ n and color was analysed under a function of ph compound outcomes can be seen in fig 9 the ph was studied in different concentrations as 2 3 4 6 8 and 10 when the landfill leachate interacted with fe₂o₃ with lower ph 2 0 and 3 0 concentration the elimination rate was strengthened nonetheless the removal rate grew even more from 4 0 6 0 the fe₂o₃ efficacy was approved not efficient when the ph of the solution was from 7 to 10 and it was reported as well in similar findings by 59 60 the landfill leachate ph was between 8 and 8 5 at normal temperature as a result when the leachate ph decreased electrostatic reaction happened between the adsorbents and the adsorbates and interacted between a positive and negative charge 61 according to al saad 19 zeta potential for magnetic nanoparticles was measured at different ph and it indicated that the nanoparticles had a positive charge at ph under 4 5 and negative charge at ph higher than 4 6 because of the greater accumulation of the protons surrounding the nanoparticles as a result greater electrostatic repulsion with a lower ph of adsorbent surface can be seen on affirmative pollutants hence the adsorption of affirmative pollutants decreased when there was a rise in ph this degenerated the competition between h and the affirmative pollutants for surface sites and the adsorption of the affirmed pollutant cod nh₃ n and color with iron oxide nanoparticles increased 4 2 3 effect of iron oxide nanoparticles dose competent removal of pollutants from raw landfill leachate was achieved when the peak dose concentration was obtained which prevented the application of excess adsorbent it is worth noting that the investigation of various iron oxide nanoparticles dose was applied under condition of room temperature of 25 and at ph 4 since these nanoadsorbents were in their natural form the dose was higher than expected to reach the highest efficiency removal as seen in fig 10 when the concentration of the fe₂o₃ was varied from 5 to 15 g the percentages of the nh₃ n cod and color removal were 34 9 64 4 and 95 3 respectively however the removal of these pollutants was increased dramatically when there was an increase to the dose of fe₂o₃ to 20 g the rise in adsorption active site along with enhanced nanoadsorbents concentration was attributed by the result 62 the higher growth in concentration of fe₂o₃ after 20 g did not demonstrate any quantitative impact consequent to adsorption in fact it showed a decrease in the removal which may have attributed to high quantity of the fe₂o₃ inside the wastewater facing difficulty of movement 4 2 4 effect of temperature another significant factor was the temperature which affected the reaction time to reach the saturated balanced condition and interacted between both the adsorbents and adsorbate in this study various temperatures were applied on the adsorption of cod nh₃ n and color on the fe₂o₃ 40 50 60 70 and 80 at ph 4 this adsorption study was obtained at mature real landfill leachate concentration as shown in table 1 the results of temperature effects are shown in fig 11 the removal efficiency of the color was the highest at 97 however in the initial stage of the treatment the removal efficiency decreased for the type of pollutants when the temperature increased the adsorption rate increased gradually this increase may have attributed to strong adsorption pressures between the functioning site of the nanoadsorbents and the pollutants in the leachate similar study was conducted by yoon 63 using synthesis magnetic iron oxides nanoparticles by co precipitation method for removal of phosphate from synthesised solution this study indicate that phosphate sorption to the magnetic nanoparticles increased with increasing temperature from 15 to 45 c under acidic solution however a study by satheesh 64 using a synthesis qur α fe₂o₃ with initial cr concentration of 35 mg l ¹ showed that when the temperature increased from 25 to 45 the adsorption rate of cr decreased to 73 3 at 45 at ph of 5 4 this may explained that the adsorption has a weak force between the qur α fe₂o₃ site and cr this indicated the difference in using either modified nanoadsorbents or natural nanoadsorbents since the temperature demonstrated obvious changes in the adsorption rate at high temperature 4 3 regeneration and reuse the regeneration adsorption was conducted by shaking iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles fe₂o₃ that was used for treating landfill leachate which contained cod nh₃ n and dark color in 0 010 m of naoh for a specific time afterwards the nanoabdsorbents were rinsed with distilled water to a ph between 6 0 7 0 65 this process was repeated prior to each experiment with the same fe₂o₃ the optimum variable conditions were adjusted in each cycle which were ph 4 dose 20 g and 60 min the adsorption cycle treatment was carried out 3 times using the same adsorbent fig 12 demonstrates the outcomes cycle 0 is the amount indicating the adsorption of the initial pollutants cod nh₃ n and color concentration removal by fe₂o₃ in the initial regeneration cycle the adsorption was at 92 3 38 1 and 69 4 for color nh₃ n and cod respectively however the percentage of removal dropped gradually for the other cycles after the third and final regeneration cycle the results were 78 8 31 59 3 for color nh₃ n and cod respectively as the number of regeneration increased the poor efficiency of regenerated adsorbents decrease in further adsorption studies may be due to strong interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent the number of active sites available on the surface of adsorbent decreases as the number of regeneration increases this suggests that the adsorption of pollutants onto iron oxide nanoadsorbents is reversible and the bonding between the active sites and the adsorbed pollutant is not strong the findings also suggest that the pollutant loaded nanoadsorbents can be easily desorbed using concentration of base or acid the excellent regeneration capacity suggested that the natural iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles fe₂o₃ could be used repeatedly as a productive nanomaterial for the elimination of pollutants in raw landfill leachate wastewater 5 conclusion in the present study the natural iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles fe₂o₃ has been used successfully in the treatment of raw landfill leachate the efficiency of fe₂o₃ nanoadsorbents to chemical oxygen demand cod ammoniacal nitrogen nh₃ n and color removal was investigated the landfill leachate was pre characterised to determine the concentration of these pollutants the characterisation process showed the concentration of cod nh₃ n and color were 2081 mg l 449 mg l and 2851 pt co respectively the fe₂o₃ was then grained into nanomaterials by mechanical milling subsequently a sieve shaker machine separated the powder to reach average size 47 nm characterisation of nanoparticles was carried out to identify the properties of fe₂o₃ by using xrd ft ir sem edx and tem analysis the effects of contact time ph dose and temperature on the adsorption process were discussed the adsorption of fe₂o₃ was increased when the ph decreased between 4 0 5 0 and this was the maximum removal efficiency that achieved at room temperature adsorption was rapid and the feo₃ nanoparticles reached the saturated point at within 60 min the results showed that fe₂o₃ was extremely efficient to remove color and cod of 97 and 75 9 however it could reach 50 of the nh₃ n removal in addition the feo₃ had a good regeneration and reusability adsorption the reuse studies demonstrate a similar removal efficiency as its first time use this can reduce the concentration pollutants and reduce the use of the nanoparticles to meet up the final discharge hence natural fe₂o₃ can be a feasible substitute in treating landfill leachate to a considerable extent and progressive system declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgment the writers are grateful to the administration of universiti

min of drying the samples were studied transmission electron microscopy tem images were acquired on a jem 2100 with an accelerating voltage of 60 200 kv provided with a high resolution ccd camera 41 42 3 adsorption studies batch tests were used for the adsorption of pollutants on fe₂o₃ 43 all the experiments were carried out at laboratory scale using 250 ml erlenmeyer flask as batch reactors in a proper adsorption experiment the iron oxide nanoparticles dose has different variations for deciding on the greatest adsorption competence fig 2 present the treatment steps of raw landfill leachate by fe₂o₃ and its recovery and reuse as a start of variating the ph of solution a 5 g of fe₂o₃ was dispersed in 150 ml of raw landfill leachate wastewater at a different particular concentration of ph of 2 3 4 6 8 and 10 using 0 1 mol l hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide at 200 5 rpm the flasks were vibrated in an orbital shaker for 1 h at 25 and atmospheric pressure most of the literatures on pollutants adsorption by fe₂o₃ showed ph from 4 00 to 5 00 is preferred for an excellent removal so in the determination of cod nh₃ n and color ph was monitored in this range of acidity it can be seen that when the ph is 4 there is a maximum adsorbed intensity hence this ph is preferred to observe the effect of adsorbent dose on cod nh₃ n and color iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles does was evaluated by several concentrations of 5 10 20 30 35 40 and 50 g at optimum desire of ph 4 00 the mixture was shaken at room temperature until the equilibrium time was reached in order to study the effect time on the adsorption uptake landfill leachate wastewater was used adsorbent dose was fixed at 20 g and ph at 4 00 to study different contact time of 10 20 40 60 80 100 and 120 min finally to study the effect of temperature on the adsorption of fe₂o₃ the experiments were studied at different temperatures 40 50 60 70 and 80 using an orbital shaker with temperature control with a constant ph dose and contact time three technical replicates of each test were performed to insure accurate measurements and accurate results after the treatment the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2005 and environmental quality control of pollution from solid waste transfer station and landfill regulations 2009 under the laws of malaysia environmental quality act 1974 confirmed all tests that were carried out the experiments were done three times to ensure steady outcomes and in order to examine adsorption studies the mean values were applied the following eq 1 shows the competence in the elimination of cod nh₃ n and color 1 e r c i c f c i 100 where ci and cf represent the initial and final pollutant concentration respectively er is the efficiency removal 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterisation 4 1 1 xrd x ray diffraction in this study iron oxide nanoparticles were obtained naturally the xrd results of natural iron oxide nanoparticles is shown in fig 3 the xrd patterns were from 10 2ө 70 of proposed nanoparticles oxide at controlled temperatures 500 c 44 it can be clearly seen from the figure that fe₂o₃ nanostructure showed high intensity peaks when sonication power was passed 20 w the patterns showed strong peaks from 20 degree the main peaks were observed at 26 5 33 35 41 50 1 53 4 59 and 63 degree which are related with 012 104 110 113 024 116 112 and 214 the pattern peaks can be indexed to the mixture of iron oxides nanoparticles according to jcpds card n 24 0072 the sharpness and intensity of peaks designate well crystallinenature of the natural iron oxide nanoparticles xrd pattern and jcpds card n 24 0072 were confirmed presence of crystalline iron in fe₂o₃ nanoparticles with 31 3 as it mentioned in 45 46 similar studies elsewhere found by 47 49 therefore natural iron oxide were successfully obtained as crystalline magnetic nanoparticles 4 1 2 fourier transform infra red ft ir spectroscopy ftir approved the construction of ore iron oxide nanoparticles fig 4 demonstrates the absorption bands from 600 to 500 cm ¹ assigned to c i stretching group 50 the monitored peak at 1035 cm ¹ in the ft ir spectrum highly endorsed the cooco bond and the same bond got at this peck for a synthesised fe₂o₃ by 51 the peak at 1654 cm ¹ was ascribed to the cc stretching and bending vibration of the alkene groups it is worth noting that the peak at 2370 cm ¹ was ascribed to the o co stretching strong bending vibration of the carbon dioxide the very broad absorption band centred at 3653 cm ¹ and 3693 cm ¹ was assigned to the stretching and bending vibration of the hydroxyl group 52 ft ir spectra investigation of pure iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles shows that most of the peak was at a lower value while the hydroxyl group oh contributed to the highest adsorption meanwhile ftir are accordance with the literature for the synthesis and coating fe₂o₃ and natural iron oxide nanoparticle fe₂o₃ 53 the mechanism of the natural iron oxide can be enlightened depending on the ftir peak assignments taking into considerations of ftir spectroscopically results carbon dioxide and hydroxyl group are the main bonds on the iron oxide particle surface 54 4 1 3 sem edx analysis fig 5 demonstrates the scanning electron microscope sem micrographs of the testers fe₂o₃ pre and post milling unmilled ore magnetic iron oxide evidently shows inhomogeneities regarding particle size distribution due to the big size there is a decrease in the size of the particle to the nano size after milling with relatively better homogeneity the image a with great enhancement reveals clearly that the main rock of iron oxide is in fact agglomerates of much smaller particles the average particle size after milling is between 21 nm 70 nm it was observed that the fe₂o₃ aggregate together after the treatment due to the saturation condition in the presence of the landfill leachate edx analysis garnered information included spectra with peaks conforming to all the various features that are available in the tester fig 5 shows the elements having characteristic peaks of unique energy the diagram illustrates zero pollution with all the metals that were experimented where the highest peak is the iron fe in relation to the composition edx the obtained natural iron oxide nanoparticles present some impurities with main elements of fe and o these impurities carbon aluminium and silicon have a very low weight and percentage in the total amount the presence of these impurities probably due to natural composition of the iron oxide however different studies of synthesis iron oxide nanoparticles have shown impurities after been synthesised as well 55 56 fig 6 demonstrate the tem images of pure iron oxide nanoparticles the high resolution of tem images distribute the particle size of fe₂o₃ in a diameter of 21 nm 70 nm approximately and aggregated to each other the image a confirm that the fe₂o₃ nanoparticles are crystalline as further confirmed by xrd with 31 3 the result shows that iron oxide nanoparticles were mainly obtained as granules with nonspherical shape 4 2 adsorption results the aim of applying batch adsorption tests was to produce the highest adsorption efficacy of fe₂o₃ nanoadsorbents from contaminants in raw landfill leachate the pre characterised leachate determined the concentration of cod nh₃ n and color as shown in table 1 4 2 1 effect of contact time the concentration of the organic and inorganic pollutants in landfill leachate was decided prior to the procedure and after varied time with magnetic nanoparticles the effects of the contacted time on the adsorption of cod nh₃ n and color were studied from 0 to 120 min the results for ore nanoadsorbents are shown in fig 7 clearly fe₂o₃ showed significant effectiveness in the adsorption during the initial phases of the treatment nevertheless cod nh₃ n and color removal by fe₂o₃ was detected to achieve the optimum saturation state after 60 min of contact time fig 8 ashrafi 57 conducted similar study where fe₃o₄ mno₂ core shell magnetic nanoparticles was used the optimum times for the adsorption using fe₃o₄ mno₂ was achieved at 60 min the affinity of the pollutant for fe₂o₃ from wastewater must always be in an excellent performance in order to achieve the equilibrium at a short time scale 58 the faster equilibrium and adsorption time of the fe₂o₃ the more likely the returns to the natural properties of the ore iron oxide nanoparticles based on the results obtained from the experiments above the optimum contact time for fe₂o₃ was selected as 40 60 min 4 2 2 effect of ph the removal rate of cod nh₃ n and color was analysed under a function of ph compound outcomes can be seen in fig 9 the ph was studied in different concentrations as 2 3 4 6 8 and 10 when the landfill leachate interacted with fe₂o₃ with lower ph 2 0 and 3 0 concentration the elimination rate was strengthened nonetheless the removal rate grew even more from 4 0 6 0 the fe₂o₃ efficacy was approved not efficient when the ph of the solution was from 7 to 10 and it was reported as well in similar findings by 59 60 the landfill leachate ph was between 8 and 8 5 at normal temperature as a result when the leachate ph decreased electrostatic reaction happened between the adsorbents and the adsorbates and interacted between a positive and negative charge 61 according to al saad 19 zeta potential for magnetic nanoparticles was measured at different ph and it indicated that the nanoparticles had a positive charge at ph under 4 5 and negative charge at ph higher than 4 6 because of the greater accumulation of the protons surrounding the nanoparticles as a result greater electrostatic repulsion with a lower ph of adsorbent surface can be seen on affirmative pollutants hence the adsorption of affirmative pollutants decreased when there was a rise in ph this degenerated the competition between h and the affirmative pollutants for surface sites and the adsorption of the affirmed pollutant cod nh₃ n and color with iron oxide nanoparticles increased 4 2 3 effect of iron oxide nanoparticles dose competent removal of pollutants from raw landfill leachate was achieved when the peak dose concentration was obtained which prevented the application of excess adsorbent it is worth noting that the investigation of various iron oxide nanoparticles dose was applied under condition of room temperature of 25 and at ph 4 since these nanoadsorbents were in their natural form the dose was higher than expected to reach the highest efficiency removal as seen in fig 10 when the concentration of the fe₂o₃ was varied from 5 to 15 g the percentages of the nh₃ n cod and color removal were 34 9 64 4 and 95 3 respectively however the removal of these pollutants was increased dramatically when there was an increase to the dose of fe₂o₃ to 20 g the rise in adsorption active site along with enhanced nanoadsorbents concentration was attributed by the result 62 the higher growth in concentration of fe₂o₃ after 20 g did not demonstrate any quantitative impact consequent to adsorption in fact it showed a decrease in the removal which may have attributed to high quantity of the fe₂o₃ inside the wastewater facing difficulty of movement 4 2 4 effect of temperature another significant factor was the temperature which affected the reaction time to reach the saturated balanced condition and interacted between both the adsorbents and adsorbate in this study various temperatures were applied on the adsorption of cod nh₃ n and color on the fe₂o₃ 40 50 60 70 and 80 at ph 4 this adsorption study was obtained at mature real landfill leachate concentration as shown in table 1 the results of temperature effects are shown in fig 11 the removal efficiency of the color was the highest at 97 however in the initial stage of the treatment the removal efficiency decreased for the type of pollutants when the temperature increased the adsorption rate increased gradually this increase may have attributed to strong adsorption pressures between the functioning site of the nanoadsorbents and the pollutants in the leachate similar study was conducted by yoon 63 using synthesis magnetic iron oxides nanoparticles by co precipitation method for removal of phosphate from synthesised solution this study indicate that phosphate sorption to the magnetic nanoparticles increased with increasing temperature from 15 to 45 c under acidic solution however a study by satheesh 64 using a synthesis qur α fe₂o₃ with initial cr concentration of 35 mg l ¹ showed that when the temperature increased from 25 to 45 the adsorption rate of cr decreased to 73 3 at 45 at ph of 5 4 this may explained that the adsorption has a weak force between the qur α fe₂o₃ site and cr this indicated the difference in using either modified nanoadsorbents or natural nanoadsorbents since the temperature demonstrated obvious changes in the adsorption rate at high temperature 4 3 regeneration and reuse the regeneration adsorption was conducted by shaking iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles fe₂o₃ that was used for treating landfill leachate which contained cod nh₃ n and dark color in 0 010 m of naoh for a specific time afterwards the nanoabdsorbents were rinsed with distilled water to a ph between 6 0 7 0 65 this process was repeated prior to each experiment with the same fe₂o₃ the optimum variable conditions were adjusted in each cycle which were ph 4 dose 20 g and 60 min the adsorption cycle treatment was carried out 3 times using the same adsorbent fig 12 demonstrates the outcomes cycle 0 is the amount indicating the adsorption of the initial pollutants cod nh₃ n and color concentration removal by fe₂o₃ in the initial regeneration cycle the adsorption was at 92 3 38 1 and 69 4 for color nh₃ n and cod respectively however the percentage of removal dropped gradually for the other cycles after the third and final regeneration cycle the results were 78 8 31 59 3 for color nh₃ n and cod respectively as the number of regeneration increased the poor efficiency of regenerated adsorbents decrease in further adsorption studies may be due to strong interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent the number of active sites available on the surface of adsorbent decreases as the number of regeneration increases this suggests that the adsorption of pollutants onto iron oxide nanoadsorbents is reversible and the bonding between the active sites and the adsorbed pollutant is not strong the findings also suggest that the pollutant loaded nanoadsorbents can be easily desorbed using concentration of base or acid the excellent regeneration capacity suggested that the natural iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles fe₂o₃ could be used repeatedly as a productive nanomaterial for the elimination of pollutants in raw landfill leachate wastewater 5 conclusion in the present study the natural iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles fe₂o₃ has been used successfully in the treatment of raw landfill leachate the efficiency of fe₂o₃ nanoadsorbents to chemical oxygen demand cod ammoniacal nitrogen nh₃ n and color removal was investigated the landfill leachate was pre characterised to determine the concentration of these pollutants the characterisation process showed the concentration of cod nh₃ n and color were 2081 mg l 449 mg l and 2851 pt co respectively the fe₂o₃ was then grained into nanomaterials by mechanical milling subsequently a sieve shaker machine separated the powder to reach average size 47 nm characterisation of nanoparticles was carried out to identify the properties of fe₂o₃ by using xrd ft ir sem edx and tem analysis the effects of contact time ph dose and temperature on the adsorption process were discussed the adsorption of fe₂o₃ was increased when the ph decreased between 4 0 5 0 and this was the maximum removal efficiency that achieved at room temperature adsorption was rapid and the feo₃ nanoparticles reached the saturated point at within 60 min the results showed that fe₂o₃ was extremely efficient to remove color and cod of 97 and 75 9 however it could reach 50 of the nh₃ n removal in addition the feo₃ had a good regeneration and reusability adsorption the reuse studies demonstrate a similar removal efficiency as its first time use this can reduce the concentration pollutants and reduce the use of the nanoparticles to meet up the final discharge hence natural fe₂o₃ can be a feasible substitute in treating landfill leachate to a considerable extent and progressive system declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgment the writers are grateful to the administration of universiti

13841,with the development of manganese ore resources a large number of electrolytic manganese residue emr was produced which causes serious environmental pollution like water pollution soil pollution etc the control of water content and decomposition of compound salts are the key issues to harmless treatment of emr among them the control of ammonia nitrogen and manganese content and the decomposition of compound salts are the severe challenges facing the resource utilization of compound salt hence from the perspective of environmental protection and energy saving this work adopted solar electrokinetic remediation methods to treat the emr of an electrolytic manganese plant in guangxi then explores the changes of water content ph value and nh4 n and mn2 content in different regions of electrolytic cell besides sem xrd and xrf were employed to analyze the basic physicochemical properties of the emr before and after the remediation from which it was found that under the action of an electric field mn2 migrated directionally from the anode area to the cathode area and solidified into mn oh 2 and mnooh meanwhile nh4 n migrated to the cathode it formed nh4 2so4 on the surface of the emr which can be easy to separate after 72 h of solar electrokinetic remediation the concentration of mn2 in the cathode area was decreased from 1725 5 mg l 1 to 84 3 mg l 1 and the nh4 n content in the anode area declined from 907 9 mg l 1 to 196 4 mg l 1 in addition nh4 2 mg mn fe so4 2 6h2o and other compound salts can be decomposed into nh4 2so4 and mg mn fe so4 other single salts that can be cleaned easily under the action of the electric field keywords electromagnetic manganese residue electrolysis migrate remediation renewable energy 1 introduction as a strategic resource manganese is in a vital position in the national economy manganese and its alloys are widely used in areas like the aerospace industry chemical industry non ferrous metallurgy food hygiene and electrokinetic technology 1 5 however every 1 t of manganese metal production produces 8 10 t emr 6 7 which is a kind of solid waste with high water content and a large number of nh4 n and mn2 and other environmentally hazardous ions 8 in recent years with the continuous development of electrolytic manganese industry the amount of emr is increasing 9 11 and how to properly treat the emr has become an urgent environmental problem to be solved in recent years domestic and foreign scholars mainly use methods such as stabilization solidification functional material preparation and electrokinetic remediation technology to treat emr 12 aiming to reduce ammonia nitrogen and manganese content in emr to emission limits 15 mg l 1 and 2 mg l 1 respectively the stabilization solidification methods of emr mainly include self cementation method solidification 13 cement stabilization solidification 14 melting and solidification 15 lime stabilization solidification 16 and fly ash solidification 17 chen h l et al 18 utilized co2 and alkaline additives to carbonize and immobilize emr and the concentrations of manganese and ammonia nitrogen in the treated emr filtrate were 0 2 mg l 1 and 9 mg l 1 respectively which reached the national emission standards shu j et al 19 adopted basic combustion raw materials brm to stabilize solidify manganese and ammonia nitrogen in emr the results suggested that manganese was solidified into muscovite mn ca si2o6 calcite mnooh and orthopyroxene mno2 and most of ammonia nitrogen was recycled through nh4 2so4 and nh4 3h so4 2 shu j et al 20 also used phosphogypsum to stabilize solidify emr and found that manganese was mainly solidified into mn3 po4 2 7h2o and mn oh 2 and ammonia nitrogen was mainly converted into struvite the result provided the harmless treatment of emr a new reference for the preparation of new materials by emr sun y et al 21 adopted new adsorption materials as iii by using emr and carried out relevant research on their properties the results indicated that the arsenic content of effluent was 0 042 mg l 1 in the 50 mg l 1 simulated wastewater containing as iii which reached the national environmental quality standard for surface water hou k p et al 22 utilized emr to prepare q sac the compressive strength of which prepared by mixing 10 40 emr could reach 35 65 mpa in 56 days after adding 5 gypsum the early strength and long term strength of q sac were increased by about 50 and 30 respectively with low firing temperature and good mechanical properties furthermore electrokinetic remediation technology as an effective method in soil remediation and the treatment of wastewater sludge and emr etc 23 25 has been widely concerned by researchers kwang wook kim et al 26 adopted oxidation to remove ammonia nitrogen in wastewater and studied the effect of changes in current densities on ammonia nitrogen decomposition benefiting from the fact that oh prevents the adsorption of ammonia nitrogen on the surface of electrode in the solution the system presents the excellent ammonia nitrogen decomposition effect at the current density of 80 ma cm 2 gent et al 27 used electrokinetic in situ remediation technology to dispose of cadmium contaminated soil and added different kinds of chemical enhancers to improve the removal rate of cadmium zhou m et al 28 studied the effect of electrokinetic remediation technology on the removal rate of chromium in soil by solar power supply the result demonstrated that the method was feasible and effective for remediation of chromium contaminated soil eun ki jeon et al 29 carried out electrokinetic remediation experiments on arsenic contaminated soil with ordinary power supply and solar power supply the results indicated that after 5 weeks of remediation the removal rate of arsenic by solar driven system was similar to that of the ordinary dc drive system but the energy consumption of solar system was only 50 of that of dc system tang et al 30 used a combination of biosurfactant and electrokinetic remediation technology to enhance the removal of toxic metals in sludge the results demonstrated that the method could effectively enhance the removal of toxic metals in sludge and improve the conductivity of anode and cathode electrolytes wu et al 31 employed solar power to conduct electrokinetic remediation research on emr their results proved the feasibility of using solar energy to remediate emr the above research results show that remediating emr with solar electrokinetic power is practical and it can reduce energy consumption to a certain extent at present the research on the treatment of emr mainly focuses on the solidification of emr and the removal of heavy metal ions by electrokinetic remediation technology 32 33 however the research on the migration behavior of nh4 n and mn2 in the process of electrodynamic remediation of emr is relatively lacking therefore in this research photovoltaic solar energy was employed to remediate the emr the migration law of nh4 n mn2 and other charged ions in the emr in the electric field provided by the unsteady solar energy was explored the reaction mechanism was deduced by combining the characterization methods of xrd xrf sem ph water content and other parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the emr was supplied by citic dameng mining co ltd guangxi china the nacl used in the experiment is an analytical reagent the power of the solar panel was 50 w the working voltage was 18 v and the working current was 2 77a hunan frontier technology co ltd china the electrolytic cell material was plexiglass 150 mm 70 mm 80 mm the cathode plate was aluminum alloy 6061 and the anode plate was iridium oxide coating dsa the distance between cathode and anode plate was 60 mm the electrolyte was the leachate prepared by simulating the sample leaching with surface water the specific simulation method was to mix emr and deionized water into a beaker at a mass ratio of 1 10 and stir it with a magnetic agitator at a speed of 750 rpm for one hour then extract the simulated leach solution 2 2 experimental methods 500 g emr was placed in the electrolytic cell 150 ml of simulated leachate was added as electrolyte according to the liquid solid ratio of 10 3 mass ratio and nacl of 0 5 wt emr was added in the electrolytic cell to enhance the conductivity of the system as depicted in fig 1 parallel anode plates were inserted on both sides of the electrolytic cell and cathode plates were inserted in the middle the solar panels were placed outside and connected to an indoor electrolytic cell the positive electrode of the solar panel was connected to the anode plate of the electrolytic cell and the negative electrode was connected to the cathode of the electrolytic cell emr was remediated for 72 h with solar energy and sampled at a time interval of 12 h the distance between the sampling point and the anode plate was 0 mm 15 mm 30 mm 45 mm 60 mm respectively named p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 in turn deionized water and remediated emr were added at a liquid solid ratio of 10 1 mass ratio the solution was stirred at 750 rpm for 1 h and then was filtered the obtained filtrate was subjected to manganese content ammonia nitrogen content ph water content and current measurement 2 3 analysis methods a uv vis spectrophotometer produced from general instrument co ltd beijing china was used to measure manganese and ammonia nitrogen content the content of mn2 was determined by potassium periodate spectrophotometry gb t 20975 7 2008 the content of nh4 n was determined by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry hj 535 2009 the water content was measured by drying emr to constant weight after weighing and then calculating after weighing again the emr before and after remediation was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd x ray fluorescence xrf and scanning electron microscopy sem respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of remediation time on the manganese content as detailed in fig 2 after 72 h remediation the manganese content in emr at all sampling points decreased among which the manganese content in emr at sampling points p4 and p5 near the cathode plate declined more significantly while the manganese content in emr near the anode plate decreased less this was because the mn2 in the system migrated to the cathode area directionally under the action of an electric field and reacted with the oh generated by the hydrogen evolution reaction to produced mn oh 2 or mnooh precipitation which led to the obvious decreasing trend of mn2 content in the cathode area in this experiment using solar energy to remediate emr was an unsteady process and the efficiency of electrolytic was related to the outdoor ultraviolet intensity therefore the alternations of day and night as well as weather changes would lead to changes in the power supply level of solar panels so mn2 showed an upward trend within a certain time range when it was in the night or an environment with weak ultraviolet intensity the electric field in the electrolytic cell was not enough to make the charged ions migrate directionally so the cathode area did not produce oh due to the absence of hydrogen evolution reaction as a result mn2 which migrated to the cathode directionally previously would migrate to the area with lower concentration in general after 72 h of electrokinetic remediation the content of mn2 in the cathode area decreased from 1725 5 mg l 1 to 84 3 mg l 1 about 95 11 the content of mn2 in the anode area decreased by about 32 40 3 2 effects of remediation time on the ammonia nitrogen content the content of ammonia nitrogen in emr showed an obvious change with the increase of solar electrodynamic repair time as illustrated in fig 3 after 72 h of solar electrokinetic remediation the ammonia nitrogen content of the emr at each sampling point decreased as the distance from the anode plate decreased p5 p4 p3 p2 p1 this was due to the directional migration of nh4 to the cathode under the action of an electric field resulting in a decrease in the nh4 n content in the anode region similar to summary 2 1 the ammonia nitrogen content of some sampling points showed an upward trend for a certain period during the remediation process when the solar power was weak it was not enough to make nh4 n migrate directionally under the action of the electric field but due to the existence of concentration differences the high concentration of nh4 n near the cathode area would diffuse to the low concentration near the anode area after 72 h of electrokinetic remediation the content of nh4 n in the anode area decreased from 907 9 mg l 1 to 156 4 mg l 1 a decrease of about 82 77 the content of nh4 n in the cathode area decreased by about 17 03 3 3 effects of remediation time on ph another important parameter in the process of solar electrokinetic remediation emr is ph which can directly affect the repair effect of emr the stronger the alkalinity of the cathode the better the solidification effect of nh4 n and mn2 that migrated to the cathode fig 4 presents the ph change curve during the solar electrokinetic remediation it can be seen from fig 4 that the ph of the two sampling points p1 and p2 were both less than p3 which was relatively acidic this is a result of the oxygen evolution reaction taking place at the two sampling points p1 and p2 located around the anode producing a large amount of h making the anode area acidic however at the two points p4 and p5 located near the cathode hydrogen evolution reaction occurred under the action of an electric field producing a large amount of oh which made the cathode area alkaline but due to the directional migration of mn2 to the cathode a certain amount of oh would be consumed making the cathode area only show weak alkalinity the specific reaction equation of the hydrolysis reaction occurring near the cathode and anode plates is as follows 1 h 2 o 2 h 1 2 o 2 g 2 e oxidation occurred at the anode 2 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h h 2 g reduction occurred at the cathode 3 4 effects of remediation time on water content the water content of emr is positively related to the amount of residue and controlling the water content can directly reduce the amount of residue fig 5 manifests the variation of the emr water content of different sampling points with time the water content of different sampling points decreases with the decrease of the distance from the anode plate p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 which means the water content gradually increases from anode to cathode the water content of emr at all sampling points gradually decreased with the increase of time for solar electrokinetic remediation of emr after the simulated leaching solution was added to the electrolytic cell the initial water content in the cell was 38 98 and the average emr water content in the cell was reduced by 13 30 after 72 h of remediation 3 5 effects of remediation time on current it can be observed from fig 6 that the current during the solar electrokinetic remediation presents an unstable change trend because the power supply unit of this experiment is the solar panel and its power supply is closely related to the external environment under the condition of sufficient light the solar panel can provide higher energy and the current value is higher when the light is insufficient the current provided is lower it can be seen from the whole process of electrokinetic that the current value fluctuated obviously in the day and night alternation the current of the solar electrokinetic remediation system of 24 h 9 00 am on the next day was slightly higher than that of 48 h 9 00 am on the third day and when the remediation time was 30 h the current in the electrolytic cell was higher than that of 54 h on the whole as the remediation time increased the current in different periods of the same sampling point showed a gradually decreasing trend which is mainly due to the decrease of water content in the electrolytic cell as the remediation time increases as a result the conductivity in the electrolytic cell decreases gradually 3 6 x ray diffraction analysis x ray diffractometer was used to analyze the sample minerals speed 10 min 1 scanning range 5 90 cu ka target incident light wavelength 0 154 nm tube voltage and tube current respectively was 40 kv 30 ma fig 8 shows the x ray diffraction phase analysis results of the original emr the emr of the cathode and the anode after the solar electrokinetic remediation the sio2 and caso4 h2o in the original emr showed good crystal shapes characteristic peaks of nh4 2 mg mn fe so4 2 6h2o and other compound salts appeared in the xrd pattern 17 after electrokinetic remediation the characteristic peaks of mn oh 2 and mnooh appeared in the samples of the cathode region mn oh 2 was formed by directional migration of mn2 to the cathode under the action of an electric field and combined with oh produced by the hydrogen evolution reaction in the cathode region mn oh 2 is extremely unstable in air and part of mn oh 2 reacts with air to produce mnooh at the same time according to the white crystals produced in the cathode area and its adhesion in the aqueous system during the experiment it can be inferred that the white crystals are nh4 2so4 and the characteristic peak of nh4 2so4 in the xrd pattern of the cathode part can confirm this prediction 3 7 scanning electron microscope analysis the morphology of emr was characterized by sem as described in fig 7 a there were various morphologies of different structures in the emr before remediation mainly block structure with different sizes however in fig 7 b the morphology of emr in the anode region has changed significantly which is mainly rod shaped and evenly distributed according to the xrd it can be inferred that the material is a single salt transformed from compound salt fig 7 c manifests that the emr in the cathode area presented loose flocculent and blocky structure after 72 h electrokinetic remediation according to the xrd analysis the massive structure was mn oh 2 produced by oh and mn2 migrating to the cathode fig 7 d indicates the morphology of white crystal precipitated from the surface of cathode emr which is loose and flocculent it can be seen that the morphology is similar to the flocculent structure of emr in fig 7 c combined with xrd analysis we can determine that the flocculent is nh4 2so4 besides when the emr was polished it was found that the compressive strength of the emr in the anode area the compressive strength of the emr in the cathode area the compressive strength of the original emr 3 8 x ray fluorescence analysis the results of the elemental composition analysis of samples by fluorescence spectrometer are described in table 1 the main elements in emr are si s ca fe al mn k and mg in which mn accounts for about 6 after remediation the content of mn in emr at cathode and anode is reduced to about 3 the decrease of mn content in anode region is due to the directional migration of mn2 to cathode under the action of electric field while that of the cathode region is due to the combination of mn2 and oh produced by electric field to form water insoluble mn oh 2 and mnooh 4 experimental mechanism the basic principle of electrokinetic treatment of emr is illustrated in fig 9 charged ions migrated under the action of an electric field to achieve the purpose of reducing the toxicity of emr leaching the cathode separates hydrogen gas to produce oh and the anode separates oxygen gas to produce h the ph value of the emr near the cathode and anode is changed after h and oh enter it so that the cathode area is alkalized and the anode area is acidified metal ions and ammonia nitrogen are mainly removed by electromigration electrodialysis and electrophoretic migration under the electric field 30 in the process of emr remediation by solar electrokinetic treatment when in the daytime with strong ultraviolet radiation mn2 migrates to the cathode under the action of electric field and then combines with oh produced by cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction to form mn oh 2 which is however extremely unstable in air and is easy to be converted into mnooh nh4 n moves to the cathode in the electric field and combines with so4 to form nh4 2so4 then white nh4 2so4 crystals are produced on the surface of cathode emr in addition clo3 formed by cl in the system in the anode region due to the effect of electric field reacts with nh4 2 mg mn fe so4 2 6h2o transforming the nh4 2 mg mn fe so4 2 6h2o into nh4 2so4 and other single salts in the harmless treatment of emr the introduction of solar electrokinetic remediation can realize the conversion of compound salt in emr and effectively deal with mn2 andnh4 n in it the corresponding reaction formula 11 is as follows 3 m n 2 2 o h mn oh 2 4

cathode area decreases by 95 11 and that in anode area decreases by 32 40 under the action of electric field nh4 in anode region migrated to the cathode and combined with so4 2 to form nh4 2so4 when the remediation time was 72 h the content of nh4 n in cathode area decreased by 17 03 and that in anode area decreased by 82 77 in addition the water content of emr declined from 38 98 to 25 68 with the increase of electrokinetic remediation time which can effectively reduce the amount of emr the results indicate that nh4 2 mg mn fe so4 2 6h2o in emr can be decomposed into nh4 2so4 and single salt after electrokinetic remediation so the partial conversion of compound salt in emr is realized declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments

13841,with the development of manganese ore resources a large number of electrolytic manganese residue emr was produced which causes serious environmental pollution like water pollution soil pollution etc the control of water content and decomposition of compound salts are the key issues to harmless treatment of emr among them the control of ammonia nitrogen and manganese content and the decomposition of compound salts are the severe challenges facing the resource utilization of compound salt hence from the perspective of environmental protection and energy saving this work adopted solar electrokinetic remediation methods to treat the emr of an electrolytic manganese plant in guangxi then explores the changes of water content ph value and nh4 n and mn2 content in different regions of electrolytic cell besides sem xrd and xrf were employed to analyze the basic physicochemical properties of the emr before and after the remediation from which it was found that under the action of an electric field mn2 migrated directionally from the anode area to the cathode area and solidified into mn oh 2 and mnooh meanwhile nh4 n migrated to the cathode it formed nh4 2so4 on the surface of the emr which can be easy to separate after 72 h of solar electrokinetic remediation the concentration of mn2 in the cathode area was decreased from 1725 5 mg l 1 to 84 3 mg l 1 and the nh4 n content in the anode area declined from 907 9 mg l 1 to 196 4 mg l 1 in addition nh4 2 mg mn fe so4 2 6h2o and other compound salts can be decomposed into nh4 2so4 and mg mn fe so4 other single salts that can be cleaned easily under the action of the electric field keywords electromagnetic manganese residue electrolysis migrate remediation renewable energy 1 introduction as a strategic resource manganese is in a vital position in the national economy manganese and its alloys are widely used in areas like the aerospace industry chemical industry non ferrous metallurgy food hygiene and electrokinetic technology 1 5 however every 1 t of manganese metal production produces 8 10 t emr 6 7 which is a kind of solid waste with high water content and a large number of nh4 n and mn2 and other environmentally hazardous ions 8 in recent years with the continuous development of electrolytic manganese industry the amount of emr is increasing 9 11 and how to properly treat the emr has become an urgent environmental problem to be solved in recent years domestic and foreign scholars mainly use methods such as stabilization solidification functional material preparation and electrokinetic remediation technology to treat emr 12 aiming to reduce ammonia nitrogen and manganese content in emr to emission limits 15 mg l 1 and 2 mg l 1 respectively the stabilization solidification methods of emr mainly include self cementation method solidification 13 cement stabilization solidification 14 melting and solidification 15 lime stabilization solidification 16 and fly ash solidification 17 chen h l et al 18 utilized co2 and alkaline additives to carbonize and immobilize emr and the concentrations of manganese and ammonia nitrogen in the treated emr filtrate were 0 2 mg l 1 and 9 mg l 1 respectively which reached the national emission standards shu j et al 19 adopted basic combustion raw materials brm to stabilize solidify manganese and ammonia nitrogen in emr the results suggested that manganese was solidified into muscovite mn ca si2o6 calcite mnooh and orthopyroxene mno2 and most of ammonia nitrogen was recycled through nh4 2so4 and nh4 3h so4 2 shu j et al 20 also used phosphogypsum to stabilize solidify emr and found that manganese was mainly solidified into mn3 po4 2 7h2o and mn oh 2 and ammonia nitrogen was mainly converted into struvite the result provided the harmless treatment of emr a new reference for the preparation of new materials by emr sun y et al 21 adopted new adsorption materials as iii by using emr and carried out relevant research on their properties the results indicated that the arsenic content of effluent was 0 042 mg l 1 in the 50 mg l 1 simulated wastewater containing as iii which reached the national environmental quality standard for surface water hou k p et al 22 utilized emr to prepare q sac the compressive strength of which prepared by mixing 10 40 emr could reach 35 65 mpa in 56 days after adding 5 gypsum the early strength and long term strength of q sac were increased by about 50 and 30 respectively with low firing temperature and good mechanical properties furthermore electrokinetic remediation technology as an effective method in soil remediation and the treatment of wastewater sludge and emr etc 23 25 has been widely concerned by researchers kwang wook kim et al 26 adopted oxidation to remove ammonia nitrogen in wastewater and studied the effect of changes in current densities on ammonia nitrogen decomposition benefiting from the fact that oh prevents the adsorption of ammonia nitrogen on the surface of electrode in the solution the system presents the excellent ammonia nitrogen decomposition effect at the current density of 80 ma cm 2 gent et al 27 used electrokinetic in situ remediation technology to dispose of cadmium contaminated soil and added different kinds of chemical enhancers to improve the removal rate of cadmium zhou m et al 28 studied the effect of electrokinetic remediation technology on the removal rate of chromium in soil by solar power supply the result demonstrated that the method was feasible and effective for remediation of chromium contaminated soil eun ki jeon et al 29 carried out electrokinetic remediation experiments on arsenic contaminated soil with ordinary power supply and solar power supply the results indicated that after 5 weeks of remediation the removal rate of arsenic by solar driven system was similar to that of the ordinary dc drive system but the energy consumption of solar system was only 50 of that of dc system tang et al 30 used a combination of biosurfactant and electrokinetic remediation technology to enhance the removal of toxic metals in sludge the results demonstrated that the method could effectively enhance the removal of toxic metals in sludge and improve the conductivity of anode and cathode electrolytes wu et al 31 employed solar power to conduct electrokinetic remediation research on emr their results proved the feasibility of using solar energy to remediate emr the above research results show that remediating emr with solar electrokinetic power is practical and it can reduce energy consumption to a certain extent at present the research on the treatment of emr mainly focuses on the solidification of emr and the removal of heavy metal ions by electrokinetic remediation technology 32 33 however the research on the migration behavior of nh4 n and mn2 in the process of electrodynamic remediation of emr is relatively lacking therefore in this research photovoltaic solar energy was employed to remediate the emr the migration law of nh4 n mn2 and other charged ions in the emr in the electric field provided by the unsteady solar energy was explored the reaction mechanism was deduced by combining the characterization methods of xrd xrf sem ph water content and other parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the emr was supplied by citic dameng mining co ltd guangxi china the nacl used in the experiment is an analytical reagent the power of the solar panel was 50 w the working voltage was 18 v and the working current was 2 77a hunan frontier technology co ltd china the electrolytic cell material was plexiglass 150 mm 70 mm 80 mm the cathode plate was aluminum alloy 6061 and the anode plate was iridium oxide coating dsa the distance between cathode and anode plate was 60 mm the electrolyte was the leachate prepared by simulating the sample leaching with surface water the specific simulation method was to mix emr and deionized water into a beaker at a mass ratio of 1 10 and stir it with a magnetic agitator at a speed of 750 rpm for one hour then extract the simulated leach solution 2 2 experimental methods 500 g emr was placed in the electrolytic cell 150 ml of simulated leachate was added as electrolyte according to the liquid solid ratio of 10 3 mass ratio and nacl of 0 5 wt emr was added in the electrolytic cell to enhance the conductivity of the system as depicted in fig 1 parallel anode plates were inserted on both sides of the electrolytic cell and cathode plates were inserted in the middle the solar panels were placed outside and connected to an indoor electrolytic cell the positive electrode of the solar panel was connected to the anode plate of the electrolytic cell and the negative electrode was connected to the cathode of the electrolytic cell emr was remediated for 72 h with solar energy and sampled at a time interval of 12 h the distance between the sampling point and the anode plate was 0 mm 15 mm 30 mm 45 mm 60 mm respectively named p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 in turn deionized water and remediated emr were added at a liquid solid ratio of 10 1 mass ratio the solution was stirred at 750 rpm for 1 h and then was filtered the obtained filtrate was subjected to manganese content ammonia nitrogen content ph water content and current measurement 2 3 analysis methods a uv vis spectrophotometer produced from general instrument co ltd beijing china was used to measure manganese and ammonia nitrogen content the content of mn2 was determined by potassium periodate spectrophotometry gb t 20975 7 2008 the content of nh4 n was determined by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry hj 535 2009 the water content was measured by drying emr to constant weight after weighing and then calculating after weighing again the emr before and after remediation was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd x ray fluorescence xrf and scanning electron microscopy sem respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of remediation time on the manganese content as detailed in fig 2 after 72 h remediation the manganese content in emr at all sampling points decreased among which the manganese content in emr at sampling points p4 and p5 near the cathode plate declined more significantly while the manganese content in emr near the anode plate decreased less this was because the mn2 in the system migrated to the cathode area directionally under the action of an electric field and reacted with the oh generated by the hydrogen evolution reaction to produced mn oh 2 or mnooh precipitation which led to the obvious decreasing trend of mn2 content in the cathode area in this experiment using solar energy to remediate emr was an unsteady process and the efficiency of electrolytic was related to the outdoor ultraviolet intensity therefore the alternations of day and night as well as weather changes would lead to changes in the power supply level of solar panels so mn2 showed an upward trend within a certain time range when it was in the night or an environment with weak ultraviolet intensity the electric field in the electrolytic cell was not enough to make the charged ions migrate directionally so the cathode area did not produce oh due to the absence of hydrogen evolution reaction as a result mn2 which migrated to the cathode directionally previously would migrate to the area with lower concentration in general after 72 h of electrokinetic remediation the content of mn2 in the cathode area decreased from 1725 5 mg l 1 to 84 3 mg l 1 about 95 11 the content of mn2 in the anode area decreased by about 32 40 3 2 effects of remediation time on the ammonia nitrogen content the content of ammonia nitrogen in emr showed an obvious change with the increase of solar electrodynamic repair time as illustrated in fig 3 after 72 h of solar electrokinetic remediation the ammonia nitrogen content of the emr at each sampling point decreased as the distance from the anode plate decreased p5 p4 p3 p2 p1 this was due to the directional migration of nh4 to the cathode under the action of an electric field resulting in a decrease in the nh4 n content in the anode region similar to summary 2 1 the ammonia nitrogen content of some sampling points showed an upward trend for a certain period during the remediation process when the solar power was weak it was not enough to make nh4 n migrate directionally under the action of the electric field but due to the existence of concentration differences the high concentration of nh4 n near the cathode area would diffuse to the low concentration near the anode area after 72 h of electrokinetic remediation the content of nh4 n in the anode area decreased from 907 9 mg l 1 to 156 4 mg l 1 a decrease of about 82 77 the content of nh4 n in the cathode area decreased by about 17 03 3 3 effects of remediation time on ph another important parameter in the process of solar electrokinetic remediation emr is ph which can directly affect the repair effect of emr the stronger the alkalinity of the cathode the better the solidification effect of nh4 n and mn2 that migrated to the cathode fig 4 presents the ph change curve during the solar electrokinetic remediation it can be seen from fig 4 that the ph of the two sampling points p1 and p2 were both less than p3 which was relatively acidic this is a result of the oxygen evolution reaction taking place at the two sampling points p1 and p2 located around the anode producing a large amount of h making the anode area acidic however at the two points p4 and p5 located near the cathode hydrogen evolution reaction occurred under the action of an electric field producing a large amount of oh which made the cathode area alkaline but due to the directional migration of mn2 to the cathode a certain amount of oh would be consumed making the cathode area only show weak alkalinity the specific reaction equation of the hydrolysis reaction occurring near the cathode and anode plates is as follows 1 h 2 o 2 h 1 2 o 2 g 2 e oxidation occurred at the anode 2 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h h 2 g reduction occurred at the cathode 3 4 effects of remediation time on water content the water content of emr is positively related to the amount of residue and controlling the water content can directly reduce the amount of residue fig 5 manifests the variation of the emr water content of different sampling points with time the water content of different sampling points decreases with the decrease of the distance from the anode plate p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 which means the water content gradually increases from anode to cathode the water content of emr at all sampling points gradually decreased with the increase of time for solar electrokinetic remediation of emr after the simulated leaching solution was added to the electrolytic cell the initial water content in the cell was 38 98 and the average emr water content in the cell was reduced by 13 30 after 72 h of remediation 3 5 effects of remediation time on current it can be observed from fig 6 that the current during the solar electrokinetic remediation presents an unstable change trend because the power supply unit of this experiment is the solar panel and its power supply is closely related to the external environment under the condition of sufficient light the solar panel can provide higher energy and the current value is higher when the light is insufficient the current provided is lower it can be seen from the whole process of electrokinetic that the current value fluctuated obviously in the day and night alternation the current of the solar electrokinetic remediation system of 24 h 9 00 am on the next day was slightly higher than that of 48 h 9 00 am on the third day and when the remediation time was 30 h the current in the electrolytic cell was higher than that of 54 h on the whole as the remediation time increased the current in different periods of the same sampling point showed a gradually decreasing trend which is mainly due to the decrease of water content in the electrolytic cell as the remediation time increases as a result the conductivity in the electrolytic cell decreases gradually 3 6 x ray diffraction analysis x ray diffractometer was used to analyze the sample minerals speed 10 min 1 scanning range 5 90 cu ka target incident light wavelength 0 154 nm tube voltage and tube current respectively was 40 kv 30 ma fig 8 shows the x ray diffraction phase analysis results of the original emr the emr of the cathode and the anode after the solar electrokinetic remediation the sio2 and caso4 h2o in the original emr showed good crystal shapes characteristic peaks of nh4 2 mg mn fe so4 2 6h2o and other compound salts appeared in the xrd pattern 17 after electrokinetic remediation the characteristic peaks of mn oh 2 and mnooh appeared in the samples of the cathode region mn oh 2 was formed by directional migration of mn2 to the cathode under the action of an electric field and combined with oh produced by the hydrogen evolution reaction in the cathode region mn oh 2 is extremely unstable in air and part of mn oh 2 reacts with air to produce mnooh at the same time according to the white crystals produced in the cathode area and its adhesion in the aqueous system during the experiment it can be inferred that the white crystals are nh4 2so4 and the characteristic peak of nh4 2so4 in the xrd pattern of the cathode part can confirm this prediction 3 7 scanning electron microscope analysis the morphology of emr was characterized by sem as described in fig 7 a there were various morphologies of different structures in the emr before remediation mainly block structure with different sizes however in fig 7 b the morphology of emr in the anode region has changed significantly which is mainly rod shaped and evenly distributed according to the xrd it can be inferred that the material is a single salt transformed from compound salt fig 7 c manifests that the emr in the cathode area presented loose flocculent and blocky structure after 72 h electrokinetic remediation according to the xrd analysis the massive structure was mn oh 2 produced by oh and mn2 migrating to the cathode fig 7 d indicates the morphology of white crystal precipitated from the surface of cathode emr which is loose and flocculent it can be seen that the morphology is similar to the flocculent structure of emr in fig 7 c combined with xrd analysis we can determine that the flocculent is nh4 2so4 besides when the emr was polished it was found that the compressive strength of the emr in the anode area the compressive strength of the emr in the cathode area the compressive strength of the original emr 3 8 x ray fluorescence analysis the results of the elemental composition analysis of samples by fluorescence spectrometer are described in table 1 the main elements in emr are si s ca fe al mn k and mg in which mn accounts for about 6 after remediation the content of mn in emr at cathode and anode is reduced to about 3 the decrease of mn content in anode region is due to the directional migration of mn2 to cathode under the action of electric field while that of the cathode region is due to the combination of mn2 and oh produced by electric field to form water insoluble mn oh 2 and mnooh 4 experimental mechanism the basic principle of electrokinetic treatment of emr is illustrated in fig 9 charged ions migrated under the action of an electric field to achieve the purpose of reducing the toxicity of emr leaching the cathode separates hydrogen gas to produce oh and the anode separates oxygen gas to produce h the ph value of the emr near the cathode and anode is changed after h and oh enter it so that the cathode area is alkalized and the anode area is acidified metal ions and ammonia nitrogen are mainly removed by electromigration electrodialysis and electrophoretic migration under the electric field 30 in the process of emr remediation by solar electrokinetic treatment when in the daytime with strong ultraviolet radiation mn2 migrates to the cathode under the action of electric field and then combines with oh produced by cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction to form mn oh 2 which is however extremely unstable in air and is easy to be converted into mnooh nh4 n moves to the cathode in the electric field and combines with so4 to form nh4 2so4 then white nh4 2so4 crystals are produced on the surface of cathode emr in addition clo3 formed by cl in the system in the anode region due to the effect of electric field reacts with nh4 2 mg mn fe so4 2 6h2o transforming the nh4 2 mg mn fe so4 2 6h2o into nh4 2so4 and other single salts in the harmless treatment of emr the introduction of solar electrokinetic remediation can realize the conversion of compound salt in emr and effectively deal with mn2 andnh4 n in it the corresponding reaction formula 11 is as follows 3 m n 2 2 o h mn oh 2 4 2n h 4 s o 4 2 n h 4 2 s o 4 5 n h 4 2 mg s o 4 2 6 h 2 o h 2 o mgs o 4 7 h 2 o n h 4 2 s o 4 6 2c l 2 e c l 2 7 c l 2 6 h 2 o 10 e 2cl o 3 12 h 8 3 n h 4 2 mn s o 4 2 6 h 2 o cl o 3 3mn o 2 c l 15 h 2 o 3 n h 4 2 s o 4 3 h 2 s o 4 5 conclusion with the solar electrokinetic remediation mn2 can migrate to the cathode to form water insoluble mn oh 2 and mnooh with oh and the content of mn2 in cathode area decreases by 95 11 and that in anode area decreases by 32 40 under the action of electric field nh4 in anode region migrated to the cathode and combined with so4 2 to form nh4 2so4 when the remediation time was 72 h the content of nh4 n in cathode area decreased by 17 03 and that in anode area decreased by 82 77 in addition the water content of emr declined from 38 98 to 25 68 with the increase of electrokinetic remediation time which can effectively reduce the amount of emr the results indicate that nh4 2 mg mn fe so4 2 6h2o in emr can be decomposed into nh4 2so4 and single salt after electrokinetic remediation so the partial conversion of compound salt in emr is realized declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments

13842,it has been estimated that about 15 of the current nitrogen fertilizer demand could be served by recovering the nitrogen content in domestic sewage in most sewage treatment plants employing the activated sludge process the concentrated liquid stream referred to as centrate resulting from anaerobic digestion of the waste sludge offers a good opportunity for recovering nitrogen for use as fertilizer this paper presents a non pressurized gas permeable membrane based approach capable of recovering 98 of the ammoniacal nitrogen in the centrate as high purity fertilizer suitable for crop cultivation in the proposed approach ammoniacal nitrogen in the centrate on the feed side of the hydrophobic gas permeable membrane is preferentially separated and absorbed into sulfuric acid on the product side to yield ammonium sulfate solution a tubular gas permeable membrane reactor developed in this study was able to recover 21 133 g n d per m2 of membrane surface area which is higher than the typical values of 2 62 g n d per m2 reported for more concentrated feeds the highest yield recorded in this study was 2 1 g of ammonium sulfate per liter of centrate scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer confirmed the presence of nitrogen oxygen and sulfur in the recovered fertilizer inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer results confirmed that heavy metal levels in the recovered fertilizer were well below the regulatory levels for land application keywords nitrogen recovery from centrate gas permeable membrane reactor nitrogen removal model transmembrane flux 1 introduction this study is based on the premise that nitrogen fertilizers could be recovered from the centrate resulting from anaerobic digestion of the waste sludge generated at sewage treatment plants stp the motivation for the study is that such recovery could offset about 15 of the demand for nitrogen fertilizers manufactured by the energy intensive haber bosch process lowering its dependence on fossil fuels and emissions of greenhouse gases 1 recovering nutrients as fertilizers for crop cultivation instead of discharging them can also lower the potential for eutrophication in receiving waters 2 3 the aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of a gas permeable membrane reactor in recovering ammonium from centrate for use as crop fertilizer performance of this reactor in recovering nitrogen fertilizers from centrate generated at an stp in las cruces nm is quantified and compared with that reported for current recovery technologies current technologies for recovering n from centrate include air stripping ion exchange struvite precipitation and pressure driven membrane separation 4 13 performance of the air stripping process depends on the degree of dissociation of ammoniacal n in the centrate to gaseous ammonia which in turn depends on ph and temperature provolo et al 6 found that at ph of 9 05 n recovery could be increased from 64 at 30 c to 87 at 40 c but recovery of 84 could be achieved at a lower ph of 7 81 if operated at 50 c tao and ukwuani 7 reported 50 n recovery in 5 h at 97 c by thermal stripping and complete stripping in 3 4 hr at 101 102 c most air stripping studies had concluded that heating of the feed can be beneficial in improving recovery limoli et al 8 reported that instead of air stripping mixing at a ph of 12 can recover 51 of n thornton et al 9 reported 95 removal of ammonium by ion exchange with mesolite as the exchange medium and 5 naoh as the regenerant solution another study using bentonite as the medium reported 52 3 removal of ammonium from municipal centrate at ph 7 8 10 a study using natural zeolite reported 50 removal of ammonium from centrate at ph 8 3 11 although n could be recovered from centrate by precipitation as struvite by adding magnesium chloride mgcl2 its recovery is limited by the available phosphate due to the composition of struvite mg2 nh4 po4 of 1 1 1 recovery of only 4 5 of ammonium has been reported at a ph of 7 5 12 jia et al 13 showed that by adding supplemental potassium phosphate 99 of n in the centrate could be recovered pressure driven membrane processes such as microfiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis have been proposed for separation of n and other chemicals of value mostly from high strength wastes e g livestock wastes these processes concentrate the target chemicals into the retentate for further downstream processing for recovery 14 18 gerardo et al 14 have reported on recovery of nh3 n from anaerobically digested dairy farm sludge by cross flow ceramic microfiltration and subsequent recovery of nutrient solutions of desired n p ratios and metals via diafiltration under varying ph conditions ledda et al 18 reported that 72 of ammonium from centrate of digested cattle manure could be concentrated into the retentate of an integrated ultrafiltration 3 5 4 5 bar and reverse osmosis system since the bulk medium permeates through the membrane in pressure driven membrane systems their performance could decline with time due to membrane fouling 16 18 hence the feed is often pretreated by a series of solid separation processes to minimize membrane fouling for example in the study by ledda et al 18 the feed was pretreated by a screw press and centrifuge yet gradual buildup of foulants on the membrane surface can increase the energy consumption maintenance cost and reduce membrane lifetime making it undesirable for continuous operation 16 non pressurized gas permeable membrane gpm processes have emerged recently for recovering ammoniacal n from waste streams including centrates gas permeable membranes afford preferential and selective diffusion of gas molecules dissolved in a feed solution on the feed side of the membrane towards an absorbing solution on the product side under ambient pressure when applied to centrate treatment at ph greater than 9 26 dissolved nh3 in the centrate dissociates to form nh3 g pka nh3 9 26 and diffuses through the gpm towards an acid solution e g sulfuric acid on the product side of the gpm where it reacts rapidly with the acid to form an ammonium salt e g ammonium sulfate a limited number of previous studies had reported on the application of non pressurized gpms in n recovery from centrates but from livestock wastes laden with high levels of n 1000 3500 mg n l 19 21 garcia gonzalez and vanotti 19 reported recovery of nh4 in swine manure 2290 mg nh4 l by a gpm at 190 mg l d where the ph of the feed ranged 7 7 9 0 dube et al 20 found that mild aeration of the feed side was beneficial in recovering 96 98 of n in 5 days compared to 25 days without aeration similarly riano et al 21 integrated both slow rate aeration and mixing to remove 78 of ammoniacal n from raw swine manure with an initial concentration of 3425 mg l in 7 days both studies by dube et al 20 and riano et al 21 used inhibitors to avoid loss of n by nitrification during aeration a recent study undertook a multi criteria analysis of n recovery processes considering ten performance criteria including pre treatment operating conditions recovery performance chemical and energy demands and post treatment 22 this study identified the emergent gas permeable membrane process as the preferred option over air stripping ion exchange struvite precipitation and reverse osmosis 22 building on the limited literature in this feasibility study it was presumed that gpms could be engineered for n recovery from municipal centrate that typically contains lower levels of ammonia 500 mg n l than in previous studies specific goals of this study were to i quantify n recovery performance of gpms ii examine the purity of recovered fertilizer and iii compare the results of this study with literature reports although dube et al 20 had suggested aerating the feed to enhance n removal we opted to raise its ph to 9 26 instead to minimize energy input nitrification and volatilization of n and maximize dissociation of nh4 to nh3 g as part of this study an empirical model describing the performance of the proposed gas permeable membrane reactor was developed for future scale up and optimization purity of the recovered ammonium sulfate was evaluated against the epa guidelines for land application in terms of elemental composition and heavy metal content to justify its use in crop cultivation 2 materials and methods 2 1 gas permeable membrane reactor gpmr the gpmr developed in this study was of a tubular configuration fabricated out of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene eptfe tube outer diameter 11 1 mm wall thickness 0 2 mm zeus industrial products inc nj serving as the gpm this tubular gpm was submerged in the feed solution centrate contained in a capped glass bottle sulfuric acid solution ph 2 serving as the absorbing solution was circulated from a reservoir through the tubular gpm by a

by dosing concentrated sulfuric acid when necessary schematic of the experimental system is shown in fig 1 five experiments tests a e table s1 in supporting information si were conducted at room temperature 25 c to assess the performance of the gpmr for comparison with literature reports centrate samples ph 7 7 were collected from the stp at las cruces nm where the digested solids were separated from the digestate by a belt press to yield the centrate samples were first filtered 1 5 μm to remove particulates its ph was then raised to the respective test values by adding concentrated sodium hydroxide 5 m during the test runs nh3 n concentration in the centrate was measured hourly and in the acid at the end of each experiment by colorimetric method using a hach spectrophotometer dr 6000 germany to test a hypothesis that mixing of the feed could reduce the feed side mass transfer resistance and enhance the flux of nh3 experiments were run with mixing by a magnetic stirrer and

temporal decrease of normalized concentrations of nh3 n in the feed side centrate in tests a e where n removals ranged 69 98 the lowest removal efficiency 69 was in test a that was initiated with a ph of 9 3 where conjugate acid and base of ammonia exist in equal concentrations in comparison in test d under the same test conditions as in test a except for the initial ph of 10 higher removal of 97 was achieved in the same period 12 h this improvement is attributed to the higher initial ph of 10 where nearly 85 of n in the feed was in the form of nh3 g as opposed to only 52 in test a at ph 9 3 final concentration of nh3 n in the feed after 12 h was 13 mg l in test d while that in test a was 138 mg l low removal in test a was probably due to the gradual drop in the feed side ph to 8 where the degree of dissociation to nh3 was considerably low only 5 2 of n was available as nh3 g the hypothesis that mixing of the feed could enhance n removal was validated by the results of tests d and e where under the same test conditions n removals in the two tests were 42 and 43 mg n respectively however the removal in test e was achieved in 4 h with mixing 204 rpm whereas in test d it took 12 h to achieve comparable removal without any mixing in the five tests the highest removal of nh3 n 98 was observed in test e at ph 10 with mixing it is noteworthy that 95 100 of n removed from the feed was recovered as ammonium salt in the acid with minimum fugitive losses from the final nh3 n concentration in the product side the estimated mass of ammonium sulfate recovered from tests a e ranged 1 7 2 1 g per liter of centrate treated preliminary mechanistic modeling of this process had indicated that the removal rate in the gpmr m g n d is directly proportional to the length of the membrane l m results of tests b c and e all of which were initiated at similar ph and mixed at similar speeds agreed with the preliminary model indications fig s1 in si also mixing was found to impact n removal rate test d and e an empirical model including the effect of both membrane length and mixing was derived from the results of tests a e by linear regression to yield eq 1 where the effect of mixing is accounted by an indicator variable i i 0 without mixing i 1 with mixing as 1 m 0 24 3 84 l 0 26 i with an adjusted r2 of 0 945 for n 5 validity of this empirical model in predicting the removal rate in five other tests f j table s1 is illustrated in fig 3 the degree of fit between the measured and calculated removal rates overall r2 0 97 n 10 is considered adequate for scaling up the gpmr as mentioned earlier we had opted to increase the initial ph of the feed instead of aeration as was done by dube et al 20 and garcía gonzález et al 23 in all the tests other than test a initial ph of the feed was adjusted to 9 26 to increase the abundance of nh3 molecules on the feed side final ph on the feed side remained above 9 26 in all those tests maintaining a high degree of dissociation to nh3 g throughout the experiments thus our strategy is seen to be beneficial in improving removal without the need for continuous ph control which is in contrast to the strategy of dube et al 20 and garcía gonzález et al 23 while dube et al 20 used inhibitors to prevent nitrification the current study achieved similar removals without the need for aeration or inhibitors 3 2 product purity sem image of crystallized ammonium sulfate at 100 magnification is shown in fig 4 a the corresponding elemental analysis by energy dispersive x ray microanalysis spectrometer sem eds is shown in fig 4 b we report this as a preliminary qualitative representation of the recovered fertilizer from fig 4 b it is evident that the abundant elements in the crystals are n o and s the atomic composition of o and s in the crystals are 50 and 31 respectively which are close to the theoretical composition in ammonium sulfate however based on this standardless analysis n is defined as a minor element 10 wt in the sample and is not equal to the theoretical n content of ammonium sulfate this is due to the limitation of the sem eds analysis in its ability to directly correlate the signals emitted by n to its content in the sample 24 heavy metal concentrations in ammonium sulfate recovered in tests c and e are compared against the epa regulations epa 831 b 93 002b in fig s2 of si the final concentrations of nh3 n in recovered acid solutions were used to estimate the expected mass of ammonium sulfate crystals for example in test c crystal mass and results of the inductively coupled plasma analysis translated to heavy metals contents of cd mo ni pb se zn and cu in the crystals as 0 21 0 33 0 46 4 18 8 70 9 88 and 6 57 mg kg of fertilizer respectively similar levels were obtained for test e as well all these values are below the regulatory limits for land application of sewage sludge confirming the purity and suitability of the recovered fertilizer for direct application 3 3 transmembrane flux removal rates of n in tests a e amounted to 0 06 0 97 0 70 0 08 and 0 26 g n d respectively translating to transmembrane fluxes of 21 0 107 1 133 1 29 2 and 91 3 g n m2 d respectively these fluxes are compared in fig 5 with those estimated from literature reports on centrates originating from anaerobically digested livestock manure with higher concentrations of n 19 21 23 25 26 all these studies used eptfe membranes of different diameters and lengths for the experiments but due to varying operational conditions maintained in the same study different flux values were obtained the highest flux estimated from the literature was 62 3 g n m2 d where the feed side was aerated to maintain the ph between 8 3 9 3 26 in comparison the range of flux in tests b c and e with mixing 91 133 g n m2 d is higher than the maximum flux reported in the literature higher flux recorded in our study is attributed to high initial feed side ph of 10 that enabled maximal dissociation to nh3 g and mixing that reduced the mass transfer resistance on the feed side 3 4 air stripping vs gpmr although previous reports had identified air stripping as the process of choice for n recovery performance of the gpmr documented here is seen to be comparable however it has to be noted that the removals reported for the air stripping process were obtained at above ambient temperatures and at higher feed concentrations fig s3 data compiled by shi et al 27 indicated stripping temperatures above 35 c would be necessary for removing 50 n guštin and marinšek logar 28 for example demonstrated 92 8 n removal in a bench scale air stripping column treating centrate from anaerobically digested pig slurry at 50 c while zhao et al 29 reported 90 n removal at 70 c from digested dairy manure alternatively to achieve about 50 removal of n ph of the feed solution must exceed 10 22 due to these limitations the energy requirement for air stripping 2 95 kw h kg n is over 15 folds higher than that for gpmr with higher alkali requirement 22 considering the superior performance of the gpmr possible under ambient pressure and temperature the gpmr warrants due consideration as a viable technology for n recovery from centrate 3 5 outlook gas permeable membrane separation is a promising single step approach 22 to treat low to high strength feed to meet the discharge standards and to recover valuable nitrogen based on the results of this study the tubular gpmr required 5 5 mmol of naoh to increase ph of 100 ml of centrate from 7 7 to 10 0 this alkali demand translated to about 0 13 mol naoh g n removed at 98 efficiency from an initial concentration of 445 mg nh3 n l stoichiometric sulfuric acid demand was estimated as 3 5 kg h2so4 kg n removed unlike the pressure driven membrane processes the gpmr is less prone to membrane fouling because only nh3 g molecules diffuse through the membrane pores 22 30 and there is no permeation of the bulk medium this was affirmed in our experiments where no measurable reduction of n flux was noted the membrane material eptfe selected in this study is known to be chemically stable 31 and is not vulnerable to decay besides being efficient and effective alternate technologies that could retrofit into existing treatment works are expected to be able to operate in continuous mode based on the bench scale performance of the gpmr and the predictive ability of the empirical model developed here eq 1 it is envisaged that it could be readily engineered for larger scale application subjected to a detailed techno economic assessment 4 conclusions feasibility of the gas permeable membrane technology in recovering ammonium sulfate as fertilizer from municipal centrate has been demonstrated here for the first time compared to the preferred current practice of air stripping the proposed approach enabled similar recoveries but without the need for any feed heating ph adjustment of the feed to 10 and mild mixing on the feed side were found to be the optimal operating conditions this feasibility study demonstrated nh3 n recovery efficiency of 98 and a yield of 2 1 g of ammonium sulfate per liter of centrate

13842,it has been estimated that about 15 of the current nitrogen fertilizer demand could be served by recovering the nitrogen content in domestic sewage in most sewage treatment plants employing the activated sludge process the concentrated liquid stream referred to as centrate resulting from anaerobic digestion of the waste sludge offers a good opportunity for recovering nitrogen for use as fertilizer this paper presents a non pressurized gas permeable membrane based approach capable of recovering 98 of the ammoniacal nitrogen in the centrate as high purity fertilizer suitable for crop cultivation in the proposed approach ammoniacal nitrogen in the centrate on the feed side of the hydrophobic gas permeable membrane is preferentially separated and absorbed into sulfuric acid on the product side to yield ammonium sulfate solution a tubular gas permeable membrane reactor developed in this study was able to recover 21 133 g n d per m2 of membrane surface area which is higher than the typical values of 2 62 g n d per m2 reported for more concentrated feeds the highest yield recorded in this study was 2 1 g of ammonium sulfate per liter of centrate scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer confirmed the presence of nitrogen oxygen and sulfur in the recovered fertilizer inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer results confirmed that heavy metal levels in the recovered fertilizer were well below the regulatory levels for land application keywords nitrogen recovery from centrate gas permeable membrane reactor nitrogen removal model transmembrane flux 1 introduction this study is based on the premise that nitrogen fertilizers could be recovered from the centrate resulting from anaerobic digestion of the waste sludge generated at sewage treatment plants stp the motivation for the study is that such recovery could offset about 15 of the demand for nitrogen fertilizers manufactured by the energy intensive haber bosch process lowering its dependence on fossil fuels and emissions of greenhouse gases 1 recovering nutrients as fertilizers for crop cultivation instead of discharging them can also lower the potential for eutrophication in receiving waters 2 3 the aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of a gas permeable membrane reactor in recovering ammonium from centrate for use as crop fertilizer performance of this reactor in recovering nitrogen fertilizers from centrate generated at an stp in las cruces nm is quantified and compared with that reported for current recovery technologies current technologies for recovering n from centrate include air stripping ion exchange struvite precipitation and pressure driven membrane separation 4 13 performance of the air stripping process depends on the degree of dissociation of ammoniacal n in the centrate to gaseous ammonia which in turn depends on ph and temperature provolo et al 6 found that at ph of 9 05 n recovery could be increased from 64 at 30 c to 87 at 40 c but recovery of 84 could be achieved at a lower ph of 7 81 if operated at 50 c tao and ukwuani 7 reported 50 n recovery in 5 h at 97 c by thermal stripping and complete stripping in 3 4 hr at 101 102 c most air stripping studies had concluded that heating of the feed can be beneficial in improving recovery limoli et al 8 reported that instead of air stripping mixing at a ph of 12 can recover 51 of n thornton et al 9 reported 95 removal of ammonium by ion exchange with mesolite as the exchange medium and 5 naoh as the regenerant solution another study using bentonite as the medium reported 52 3 removal of ammonium from municipal centrate at ph 7 8 10 a study using natural zeolite reported 50 removal of ammonium from centrate at ph 8 3 11 although n could be recovered from centrate by precipitation as struvite by adding magnesium chloride mgcl2 its recovery is limited by the available phosphate due to the composition of struvite mg2 nh4 po4 of 1 1 1 recovery of only 4 5 of ammonium has been reported at a ph of 7 5 12 jia et al 13 showed that by adding supplemental potassium phosphate 99 of n in the centrate could be recovered pressure driven membrane processes such as microfiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis have been proposed for separation of n and other chemicals of value mostly from high strength wastes e g livestock wastes these processes concentrate the target chemicals into the retentate for further downstream processing for recovery 14 18 gerardo et al 14 have reported on recovery of nh3 n from anaerobically digested dairy farm sludge by cross flow ceramic microfiltration and subsequent recovery of nutrient solutions of desired n p ratios and metals via diafiltration under varying ph conditions ledda et al 18 reported that 72 of ammonium from centrate of digested cattle manure could be concentrated into the retentate of an integrated ultrafiltration 3 5 4 5 bar and reverse osmosis system since the bulk medium permeates through the membrane in pressure driven membrane systems their performance could decline with time due to membrane fouling 16 18 hence the feed is often pretreated by a series of solid separation processes to minimize membrane fouling for example in the study by ledda et al 18 the feed was pretreated by a screw press and centrifuge yet gradual buildup of foulants on the membrane surface can increase the energy consumption maintenance cost and reduce membrane lifetime making it undesirable for continuous operation 16 non pressurized gas permeable membrane gpm processes have emerged recently for recovering ammoniacal n from waste streams including centrates gas permeable membranes afford preferential and selective diffusion of gas molecules dissolved in a feed solution on the feed side of the membrane towards an absorbing solution on the product side under ambient pressure when applied to centrate treatment at ph greater than 9 26 dissolved nh3 in the centrate dissociates to form nh3 g pka nh3 9 26 and diffuses through the gpm towards an acid solution e g sulfuric acid on the product side of the gpm where it reacts rapidly with the acid to form an ammonium salt e g ammonium sulfate a limited number of previous studies had reported on the application of non pressurized gpms in n recovery from centrates but from livestock wastes laden with high levels of n 1000 3500 mg n l 19 21 garcia gonzalez and vanotti 19 reported recovery of nh4 in swine manure 2290 mg nh4 l by a gpm at 190 mg l d where the ph of the feed ranged 7 7 9 0 dube et al 20 found that mild aeration of the feed side was beneficial in recovering 96 98 of n in 5 days compared to 25 days without aeration similarly riano et al 21 integrated both slow rate aeration and mixing to remove 78 of ammoniacal n from raw swine manure with an initial concentration of 3425 mg l in 7 days both studies by dube et al 20 and riano et al 21 used inhibitors to avoid loss of n by nitrification during aeration a recent study undertook a multi criteria analysis of n recovery processes considering ten performance criteria including pre treatment operating conditions recovery performance chemical and energy demands and post treatment 22 this study identified the emergent gas permeable membrane process as the preferred option over air stripping ion exchange struvite precipitation and reverse osmosis 22 building on the limited literature in this feasibility study it was presumed that gpms could be engineered for n recovery from municipal centrate that typically contains lower levels of ammonia 500 mg n l than in previous studies specific goals of this study were to i quantify n recovery performance of gpms ii examine the purity of recovered fertilizer and iii compare the results of this study with literature reports although dube et al 20 had suggested aerating the feed to enhance n removal we opted to raise its ph to 9 26 instead to minimize energy input nitrification and volatilization of n and maximize dissociation of nh4 to nh3 g as part of this study an empirical model describing the performance of the proposed gas permeable membrane reactor was developed for future scale up and optimization purity of the recovered ammonium sulfate was evaluated against the epa guidelines for land application in terms of elemental composition and heavy metal content to justify its use in crop cultivation 2 materials and methods 2 1 gas permeable membrane reactor gpmr the gpmr developed in this study was of a tubular configuration fabricated out of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene eptfe tube outer diameter 11 1 mm wall thickness 0 2 mm zeus industrial products inc nj serving as the gpm this tubular gpm was submerged in the feed solution centrate contained in a capped glass bottle sulfuric acid solution ph 2 serving as the absorbing solution was circulated from a reservoir through the tubular gpm by a peristaltic pump masterflex at 25 ml min teflon tubing was used for all interconnections a ph controller bluelab corporation limited new zealand maintained the ph of the acid reservoir at a value of 2 by dosing concentrated sulfuric acid when necessary schematic of the experimental system is shown in fig 1 five experiments tests a e table s1 in supporting information si were conducted at room temperature 25 c to assess the performance of the gpmr for comparison with literature reports centrate samples ph 7 7 were collected from the stp at las cruces nm where the digested solids were separated from the digestate by a belt press to yield the centrate samples were first filtered 1 5 μm to remove particulates its ph was then raised to the respective test values by adding concentrated sodium hydroxide 5 m during the test runs nh3 n concentration in the centrate was measured hourly and in the acid at the end of each experiment by colorimetric method using a hach spectrophotometer dr 6000 germany to test a hypothesis that mixing of the feed could reduce the feed side mass transfer resistance and enhance the flux of nh3 experiments were run with mixing by a magnetic stirrer and without any mixing an empirical model was derived to predict the effect of mixing which was validated using results from an additional set of experiments tests f j table s1 in si 2 2 scanning electron

temporal decrease of normalized concentrations of nh3 n in the feed side centrate in tests a e where n removals ranged 69 98 the lowest removal efficiency 69 was in test a that was initiated with a ph of 9 3 where conjugate acid and base of ammonia exist in equal concentrations in comparison in test d under the same test conditions as in test a except for the initial ph of 10 higher removal of 97 was achieved in the same period 12 h this improvement is attributed to the higher initial ph of 10 where nearly 85 of n in the feed was in the form of nh3 g as opposed to only 52 in test a at ph 9 3 final concentration of nh3 n in the feed after 12 h was 13 mg l in test d while that in test a was 138 mg l low removal in test a was probably due to the gradual drop in the feed side ph to 8 where the degree of dissociation to nh3 was considerably low only 5 2 of n was available as nh3 g the hypothesis that mixing of the feed could enhance n removal was validated by the results of tests d and e where under the same test conditions n removals in the two tests were 42 and 43 mg n respectively however the removal in test e was achieved in 4 h with mixing 204 rpm whereas in test d it took 12 h to achieve comparable removal without any mixing in the five tests the highest removal of nh3 n 98 was observed in test e at ph 10 with mixing it is noteworthy that 95 100 of n removed from the feed was recovered as ammonium salt in the acid with minimum fugitive losses from the final nh3 n concentration in the product side the estimated mass of ammonium sulfate recovered from tests a e ranged 1 7 2 1 g per liter of centrate treated preliminary mechanistic modeling of this process had indicated that the removal rate in the gpmr m g n d is directly proportional to the length of the membrane l m results of tests b c and e all of which were initiated at similar ph and mixed at similar speeds agreed with the preliminary model indications fig s1 in si also mixing was found to impact n removal rate test d and e an empirical model including the effect of both membrane length and mixing was derived from the results of tests a e by linear regression to yield eq 1 where the effect of mixing is accounted by an indicator variable i i 0 without mixing i 1 with mixing as 1 m 0 24 3 84 l 0 26 i with an adjusted r2 of 0 945 for n 5 validity of this empirical model in predicting the removal rate in five other tests f j table s1 is illustrated in fig 3 the degree of fit between the measured and calculated removal rates overall r2 0 97 n 10 is considered adequate for scaling up the gpmr as mentioned earlier we had opted to increase the initial ph of the feed instead of aeration as was done by dube et al 20 and garcía gonzález et al 23 in all the tests other than test a initial ph of the feed was adjusted to 9 26 to increase the abundance of nh3 molecules on the feed side final ph on the feed side remained above 9 26 in all those tests maintaining a high degree of dissociation to nh3 g throughout the experiments thus our strategy is seen to be beneficial in improving removal without the need for continuous ph control which is in contrast to the strategy of dube et al 20 and garcía gonzález et al 23 while dube et al 20 used inhibitors to prevent nitrification the current study achieved similar removals without the need for aeration or inhibitors 3 2 product purity sem image of crystallized ammonium sulfate at 100 magnification is shown in fig 4 a the corresponding elemental analysis by energy dispersive x ray microanalysis spectrometer sem eds is shown in fig 4 b we report this as a preliminary qualitative representation of the recovered fertilizer from fig 4 b it is evident that the abundant elements in the crystals are n o and s the atomic composition of o and s in the crystals are 50 and 31 respectively which are close to the theoretical composition in ammonium sulfate however based on this standardless analysis n is defined as a minor element 10 wt in the sample and is not equal to the theoretical n content of ammonium sulfate this is due to the limitation of the sem eds analysis in its ability to directly correlate the signals emitted by n to its content in the sample 24 heavy metal concentrations in ammonium sulfate recovered in tests c and e are compared against the epa regulations epa 831 b 93 002b in fig s2 of si the final concentrations of nh3 n in recovered acid solutions were used to estimate the expected mass of ammonium sulfate crystals for example in test c crystal mass and results of the inductively coupled plasma analysis translated to heavy metals contents of cd mo ni pb se zn and cu in the crystals as 0 21 0 33 0 46 4 18 8 70 9 88 and 6 57 mg kg of fertilizer respectively similar levels were obtained for test e as well all these values are below the regulatory limits for land application of sewage sludge confirming the purity and suitability of the recovered fertilizer for direct application 3 3 transmembrane flux removal rates of n in tests a e amounted to 0 06 0 97 0 70 0 08 and 0 26 g n d respectively translating to transmembrane fluxes of 21 0 107 1 133 1 29 2 and 91 3 g n m2 d respectively these fluxes are compared in fig 5 with those estimated from literature reports on centrates originating from anaerobically digested livestock manure with higher concentrations of n 19 21 23 25 26 all these studies used eptfe membranes of different diameters and lengths for the experiments but due to varying operational conditions maintained in the same study different flux values were obtained the highest flux estimated from the literature was 62 3 g n m2 d where the feed side was aerated to maintain the ph between 8 3 9 3 26 in comparison the range of flux in tests b c and e with mixing 91 133 g n m2 d is higher than the maximum flux reported in the literature higher flux recorded in our study is attributed to high initial feed side ph of 10 that enabled maximal dissociation to nh3 g and mixing that reduced the mass transfer resistance on the feed side 3 4 air stripping vs gpmr although previous reports had identified air stripping as the process of choice for n recovery performance of the gpmr documented here is seen to be comparable however it has to be noted that the removals reported for the air stripping process were obtained at above ambient temperatures and at higher feed concentrations fig s3 data compiled by shi et al 27 indicated stripping temperatures above 35 c would be necessary for removing 50 n guštin and marinšek logar 28 for example demonstrated 92 8 n removal in a bench scale air stripping column treating centrate from anaerobically digested pig slurry at 50 c while zhao et al 29 reported 90 n removal at 70 c from digested dairy manure alternatively to achieve about 50 removal of n ph of the feed solution must exceed 10 22 due to these limitations the energy requirement for air stripping 2 95 kw h kg n is over 15 folds higher than that for gpmr with higher alkali requirement 22 considering the superior performance of the gpmr possible under ambient pressure and temperature the gpmr warrants due consideration as a viable technology for n recovery from centrate 3 5 outlook gas permeable membrane separation is a promising single step approach 22 to treat low to high strength feed to meet the discharge standards and to recover valuable nitrogen based on the results of this study the tubular gpmr required 5 5 mmol of naoh to increase ph of 100 ml of centrate from 7 7 to 10 0 this alkali demand translated to about 0 13 mol naoh g n removed at 98 efficiency from an initial concentration of 445 mg nh3 n l stoichiometric sulfuric acid demand was estimated as 3 5 kg h2so4 kg n removed unlike the pressure driven membrane processes the gpmr is less prone to membrane fouling because only nh3 g molecules diffuse through the membrane pores 22 30 and there is no permeation of the bulk medium this was affirmed in our experiments where no measurable reduction of n flux was noted the membrane material eptfe selected in this study is known to be chemically stable 31 and is not vulnerable to decay besides being efficient and effective alternate technologies that could retrofit into existing treatment works are expected to be able to operate in continuous mode based on the bench scale performance of the gpmr

compared to the preferred current practice of air stripping the proposed approach enabled similar recoveries but without the need for any feed heating ph adjustment of the feed to 10 and mild mixing on the feed side were found to be the optimal operating conditions this feasibility study demonstrated nh3 n recovery efficiency of 98 and a yield of 2 1 g of ammonium sulfate per liter of centrate

13843,in recent years graphene has received much attention in many fields to the extent that it has been mostly able to solve the tremendous human challenge of water scarcity in this research graphene quantum dots gqds were used for the preparation of polyvinyl chloride pvc blended matrix nanofiltration membrane for removing reactive blue 19 dye wastewater improvement in anti fouling performance was tested by filtration of bovine serum albumin bsa solution the gqds were synthesized and characterized using tem xrd ftir uv vis spectrophotometer and fluorescence emission the surface morphology of prepared nanocomposite membranes was identified using afm and sem images by embedding the optimum amount of the gqds to the pvc matrix 1 wt the water flux reached 19 1 l m2 h which is 56 higher than the unfilled membrane in the case of anti fouling properties the flux recovery ratio was improved from 68 8 to 80 0 all of the fabricated pvc membranes have bsa rejection of more than 98 and reactive blue 19 dye rejection of more than 96 it can be concluded that the organic anti fouling characteristics were improved with considerable permeability enhancement without influencing membrane rejection performance keywords graphene quantum dots nanocomposite membrane anti fouling dye separation environmental protection 1 introduction one of the most severe environmental issues is water pollution that contains various contaminants to overcome such a problem purification methods could be applied to provide usable water from wastewater 1 4 as the globe s population increases the demand for water on limited water resources increases hence creating a technology to recycle the wastewater is inevitable more importantly the filtration process such as membranes has attracted the attention of many researchers recently water scarcity causes some drastic issues such as human and animal mortality and environmental pollution 5 6 while resources can be optimally used and restored the wastewater which is composed of industrial household and agricultural wastewater can be a potential resource to overcome water shortages there are various filtration methods like coagulation sedimentation absorption adsorption and membrane processes to treat wastewater from drilling companies agricultural runoff and municipal sewage 7 10 membranes are one of the physicochemical purification methods that can be used to filter out pollutants compared to the chemical treatment methods such as evaporation and thermal treatment membrane technology is inexpensive and faster 11 12 incorporating various materials into the membrane matrix could improve the membrane performance depending on operating conditions membrane fabrication methods can be classified such as tips nips vips and eips 13 16 hydrophilic nanoparticles are utilized to improve the hydrophilicity of the membranes physical chemical strategies can be shown in two various forms such as physical and chemical properties 17 also the nanoparticles could improve the anti fouling performance due to their high flexibility polymer membranes play an important role in many areas such as biosensing 18 ion exchange 19 water purification 20 membrane distillation 21 22 and biomedical 23 and have achieved better performance polyvinyl chloride pvc is one of the most popular polymers because of its benefits such as availability inexpensive 10 psf price decent physicochemical and mechanical properties such as good tensile strength due to the hydrophobic nature of pvc its usage as a filtration system causes some problems including the reduction of the permeation flux decrement of the system efficacy and increase in the membrane washing expenses hence such a membrane should be modified in order to be used for industrial applications 24 26 nanoparticles because of their unique features can be used to modify and improve the filter properties such as hydrophilicity and porosity 27 carbon nanotubes cnts have

coatings films 28 like for instance because of high thermal conductivity and surface area making them useful as electrode catalyst supports in a fuel cell that is utilized in transport application where durability is predominant 29 moreover since a significant part of the human body is made up of carbon it could be considered as a biocompatible material cnts are polymer containing pure carbon which can be manipulated utilizing the extremely rich chemistry of carbon this gives an excellent opportunity to change their structure and to maximize their solubility more importantly cnts are perfect molecularly that make them free of property damaging defects in the nanotube structure 28 cnts have succeeded in many challenges in the field of filtration and show an excellent anti fouling property specifically it has been used in water purification processes along with polyethersulfone pes polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polysulfone psf and pvc membranes using nf uf ro pv mechanisms and mixed matrix and thin films nanocomposites structures contribute significantly to improve performance 30 32 another point is that the quantum dots qds are made of nanocrystals composing a semiconductor core material 33 qd particles have a wider bandgap and therefore require extra excitement energy for light emission at shorter wavelengths qds possess a wide absorption spectrum but limited fluorescent emission spectra such a spectrum range makes qd particularly appropriate for complex recognition especially by employing an exciting light supplier the qd emitting spectrum is 10 20 times brighter compared to an organic fluorophore and thousands of times more durable than traditional dyes 34 qds are novel nanocarbon based materials that have been used in various fields such as chemical assays biosensing bioimaging photocatalysis and electrocatalysis 35 graphene oxide quantum dots gqds were selected because of their nanostructure hydrophilic feature and proper dispersion as an attractive carbon based material gqds have attracted significant interest in a wide range of applications because of their size notable mechanical properties frictionless surface and stability 36 one of the applications of gqds is in the capability of targeting and imaging tumor cells simultaneously 37 38 the broad application of gqds was reported by zhang et al 39 they researched scanning and

performance there was another study on amino functionalized gods agqds encapsulated in thin film nanocomposites as solvent resistance nf membranes which were fabricated using interfacial polymerization and subsequent steps 41 song et al fabricated gqds based membranes as a chlorine resistance and anti fouling membrane 42 there are several nanoparticles embedded in the pvc polymer

technique was used to calculate the porosity ε of the prepared membranes using eq 1 50 1 ε w 2 w 1 ρ a l 100 where w2 is the wet weight of the membranes w1 is the weight of dry membranes ρ the pure water density l is the thickness of the membranes cm and a is the active membrane area cm2 guerout elford ferry equation eq 2 was applied to calculate the average pore diameter 51 2 r m 2 9 1 75 ε 8 η l q ε a δ p η pa s δp kpa and q m3 s stand for water viscosity operating pressure and the pure water flow rate respectively the viscosity of pvc casting solutions containing different amounts of gqds was measured using brookfield dviii ultra usa at 25 c to assess the mechanical strength of the prepared gqds pvc membranes tensile strength of the membranes was analyzed by instron 5566 england the tests were conducted at a rate of 1 mm min using 500 n load cells for the samples with size of 4 1 cm the average of at least four samples was reported 2 5 evaluation of membrane performance the nf membranes performance was evaluated by a self designed dead end filtration set up 52 including 8 parallel cells connected to a compressor for providing pressure fig 1 the active surface area of the

p μ j p r m r f 9 r t r m r f r c 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanomaterials characterization in the present study a facile carbonization technique was utilized for the preparation of gqds using citric acid as a carbon source the tem image of achieved gqds is illustrated in fig 2 a the tem image shows that gqds are almost monodispersed nanoparticles moreover the size distribution of gqds is also displayed in the inset of fig 2a which shows the mean sizes of 6 nm for gqds furthermore the dynamic light scattering analysis fig 2b confirmed the results of the tem image and corresponding particle size distribution ft ir test was applied to investigate the functional groups on the gqds surface and use it as proof of the citric acid conversion to gqds fig 2c the gqds show the typical stretching vibrations of hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups existed in the gqds structure scheme 1 in gqds the stretching vibrations of c h bonds are detected at 2970 cm 1 implying that the graphitization is not completed and some aliphatic c h bonds are available on the edges of the synthesized gqds the as prepared gqds display bonds at 1580 and 1675 cm 1 which relates to the c c and carbonyl c o groups stretching respectively 53 55 a wideband at 3415 cm 1 is attributed to the water hydroxyl oh and carboxylic groups these bands show that the surface of gqds is covered by hydrophilic functional groups the uv vis spectrum of gqds fig 2d possesses two major peaks at 240 and 360 nm related to the π π transitions of graphitic c c domains and n π transitions ascribed to the oxygen comprising functional groups respectively 56 upon an excitation wavelength of 400 nm the maximum emission of 470 nm was acquired as depicted in fig 2e gqds showed an excitation independent luminescent behavior while the source of gqds fluorescence is a subject of recent discussion it is totally accepted that the quantum confinement and edge effects play essential roles in such occurrence thus the excitation wavelength independence of gqds can be related to the homogeneity in size and the surface state of those sp2 clusters responsible for fluorescence 55 the xrd paradigm of synthesized gqds displays a broad diffraction peak focused at 2θ 25 fig 2f showing the relatively disordered assembling and the absence of long range order due to the presence of several oxygen molecules including functional groups in the presented material 57 3 2 characterization of pvc membranes as shown in fig 3 the surface morphology of the modified membranes was studied by sem images the surface of the pristine membrane was denser so that no obvious pores could be detected the membrane surfaces are uniform and there are no cracks and pinholes observed this image demonstrates that the bare and nanocomposite membranes have no brittle construction and the addition of gqds has not unfavorably affected the surface of the pvc membranes due to black color of the used nanosheets it visually could be seen that the membranes with higher amounts of the nanosheets has darker surface in other words more nanoparticles appeared on the surface due to the low dispersity and hard sonication of the gqds nanoparticles 58 59 fig 4 reveals the sem views of the cross sectional area of the membranes it was revealed that all the synthesized membranes have an asymmetric structure that comprises a porous substrate with finger like pores and a dense upper layer this structure is formed due to the quick mass transmission among the solvent and the non solvent through the non solvent phase inversion procedure as can be seen by the addition of gqds the structure is enlarged by comparing the cross sectional sem descriptions of the untouched pvc and all gqds embedded pvc membranes it is found that the gqds addition to the doping solution does not alter the formation mechanism of the pvc membrane structure through the phase inversion method by adding nanoparticles compared with the bare pvc it can be understood that the addition of hydrophilic gqds in solution greatly accelerates the water diffusion from the coagulation bath to the polymer film quicker rate of exchange between solvent and non solvent which causes the development of large finger like or macro voids and increases the porosity 43 table 2 reports porosity average pore size and contact angle results in this table which is based on the comparison of samples with nanoparticles and bare pvc as reported in the first column the porosity changes significantly with increasing nanoparticle percentage the trend is the same as the mean pore size in other words increasing the mean pore size results in increased porosity all samples containing gqds have higher porosity compared to the bare sample the highest for the 1 wt sample in 0 05 to 1 0 wt membranes an increasing trend can be observed in this case the porosity in the 2 wt sample is quite similar to that in the 0 05 wt sample these results are quite consistent with the surface morphologies because of the better the sample the better the dispersity in terms of porosity due to the gqds functional groups the samples containing gqds have better porosity in the structure of the gqds there are some hydrophilic groups approved by ftir spectra in fig 2b which could interaction with polymer chains by growing the hydrophilicity of the dope solution with addition of the gqds the exchange rate of solvent non solvent in the phase separation process improves because of the rapid exchange rate of solvent non solvent the overall porosity of the gqds pvc nanocomposite membranes was enhanced 60 in the 2 wt sample the porosity is lower probably due to the dispersity being more difficult and taking longer for sonicating in other words this change in membrane porosity could be analyzed by looking at the phase inversion mechanism through the membrane coagulation in non solvent in general kinetics and thermodynamics are recognized as two directing parameters adjusting the formation of the phase separation membranes 45 the viscosity results table 2 showed that by addition of gqds the viscosity increased which could delay the phase inversion process and prevent the instant demixing 61 in the case of 2 wt membrane the viscosity effect overcome on the hydrophilicity effect and the porosity and pore size of the membrane was reduced table 2 also exhibited the viscosity results of the dope solutions by different contents of gqds applied to fabrication of the nanocomposite membranes with addition of the gqds the viscosity of the casting solutions was increased by growing the viscosity the phase inversion process is rheologically influenced 25 62 the higher viscosity affects the phase inversion kinetic and overcoming the rheological property causes in diminishing the phase exchange rate during the membrane formation forming a membrane with a lower pore size and porosity the same factors influence the next column reporting the mean pore sizes that is as the porosity rate changed the mean pore sizes also had similar changes which was not unexpected by increase of the pore size the more percent of the total volume of the membrane body will be occupied with free volume and therefore the porosity could be improved given that the nanoparticles are the main cause of the porosity so that the average pore size changes and the homogeneity of the dispersity affect them it can be seen that the size of the cavities has increased with the addition of a larger percentage of nanoparticles with the largest size for the 1 wt sample 41 63 64 the third column in table 2 shows the hydrophilicity of the samples the contact angles of the membrane surface are recorded according to the rule that if the contact angle is above 90 degrees the samples are hydrophobic and have poor wetting and if the contact angle is below 90 degrees the samples have hydrophilic property they were less than 90 degrees and with adding nanoparticles they recorded a lower contact angle than the bare sample confirming that the samples become more hydrophilic by the addition of gqds for water flux tests since the gqds nanoparticles are inherently hydrophilic by adding more nanoparticles the hydrophilicity increased following 65 to industrial application the mechanical strength of a membrane is a significant aspect the tensile strength of the gqds pvc membranes was measured to explore variations in mechanical characteristic of them and the obtained data are presented in table 2 the results exhibited that tensile strength of the bare spvc membrane was 13 1 mpa and addition of gqds enhanced tensile which could be related to the reinforcement impact of nanomaterial additive in matrix of polymer however at high concentration of 2 wt a little reduction in mechanical strength was observed which could be related to the agglomeration of gqds in polymer matrix 66 fig 5 exhibits three and two dimensional afm images of the synthesized gqds pvc membranes containing various percentages of the prepared nanoparticle as a trend the lowest average surface roughness was reported by adding 1 wt gqds in the membrane matrix the surface roughness factors of the synthesized membranes including mean roughness sa root mean square of the z data sq the highest peak sz and the height difference between the highest peak and the lowest valley sy are determined from the afm images table 3 related to the roughness parameters showed that by addition of 1 wt gqds to the pvc casting solution the mean roughness was reduced from 5 38 to 4 19 nm in general hydrophilic nanomaterials decrease the surface roughness of polymeric membranes which could be attributed to hydrogen bonding between functional groups oh cooh etc of the nanomaterial and polymer 51 by decreasing surface roughness the pollutants have less chance to agglomerate in the surface valleys of the membrane consequently the anti fouling properties of the polymeric membranes are improved whereas the higher surface roughness owing to the higher surface area causes an increase in the membrane flux 67 the roughness amounts are slightly elevated by a further rise in gqds to 2 wt the agglomeration of the gqds on the membrane surface at a vast amount of the nanofiller could be the main reason for this increasing trend 3 3 membrane filtration performance the pure water flux from the comparison of the bare samples and gqds nanoparticles containing samples is shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the pure water flux pwf ranged from 8 3 l m2 h for 0 05 wt nanoparticle membrane which was lower than 12 2 l m2 h for the bare membrane to more than 19 1 l m2 h for 1 wt membrane that was improved by about 40 the increase in pwf can be ascribed to the hydrophilicity and lager membrane pore sizes as noted as the gqds content of the sample increases the mean pore radius increases the reduction in the flux of 0 05 wt membrane could be because of the increase of viscosity of dope solution table 2 by the addition of the gqds and the decreased contribution of hydrophilicity effect in very low concentration of the gqds 0 05 wt the effect of viscosity overcomes on the hydrophilicity improvement and the pore size of the resulted membrane decreases and therefore the flux is diminished although the flux rate is expected to improve by adding 2 wt of the nanoparticles it does not happen due to the lack of homogeneous dispersity in this amount of nanoparticles 68 69 overall the flux of pvc membranes is lower than the pes membranes and that could be due to the shorter chain in pvc or to say the least the less functional groups for pure water flux in this type of polymer however this could be resolved by the addition of hydrophilic nanoparticles 26 70 for investigating the anti fouling properties of the synthesized gqds pvc membranes after the pure water flux test the bsa solution was filtered for 60 min after washing the membranes for 20 min again the membranes test was followed by the second pure water flux filtration test the results of all of these steps can be seen in fig 7 in the plot as it is evident in the bsa test the flux decreased over time because a layer of bsa is put on the membrane surface reduces the amount of solution flux and creates a resistance layer on the membrane surface which plugs pores and fouls the membranes as can be seen after washing of the membranes the second pure water flux was very close to the first pure water flux test especially for gqds containing membranes which confirms the good performance of the fabricated membranes against the fouling for more details of bsa solution flux and rejection the results of the bsa solution filtration experiments are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the bsa solution flux improves with increasing gqds percentage due to an increase in membranes porosity mean pore size and hydrophilicity see table 2 as can be seen the 2 wt sample has a flux drop which is due to the agglomeration of gqds in all blended nanoparticle samples the rejection percentage is approximately in the same range more than 98 and all rejection percentages are higher than the bare sample which means that the percentage of nanoparticles was able to perform the removal effect well 71 72 3 4 anti fouling performance as for membrane recovery fig 9 shows the flux recovery ratio of each sample after bsa filtration in other words the frr trends showed that the flux recovery and anti fouling properties of all gqds containing membranes are improved the trend of frr is similar to the first and second pure water fluxes and the bsa flux and the highest percentage was found in 1 wt of gqds in this sample the frr reaches 80 showing good recovery operation and excellent anti fouling characteristics all samples with different percentages of nanoparticles had higher frr than the bare sample in the bare pvc sample frr was recorded to be 68 8 then frr was improved with the addition of nanoparticles to the membrane 73 this anti fouling behavior could be related to hydrophilicity improvement and decrease of surface roughness 19 as shown in table 3 by adding gqds to the pvc matrix up to 1 wt the average surface roughness decreases which causes less fouling of the membranes however in 2 wt gqds pvc membrane due to an increase of roughness parameters the membrane fouling increased and frr was reduced for further details on membrane clogging all membrane resistance parameters including pore resistance rp intrinsic membrane resistance rm cake resistance rc and total resistance rt were calculated and depicted in fig 10 the cake layer formed on the membrane surface which is considered to be reversible sediment is represented by rc while rp represents the sediment resistance due to the irreversible deposition of the membrane surface and the pore attachment reversible sediment unlike the irreversible type can mostly be removed by hydraulic cleaning fig 10 shows all the properties of membrane resistance these results indicate that the overall resistance decreases with the addition of gqds nanoparticles and it can certainly be observed for all the mentioned resistances the results also show that the addition of gqds was a suitable method for reducing rc formed by the cake layer deposited on the membrane surface and rp in nf membranes 74 3 5 dye separation fig 11 shows the filtration results with color pollutants the solution of reactive blue 19 dye fig 11 b with a concentration of 100 mg l and natural ph of 5 76 was applied the rejection percentage of all membranes was recorded to be higher than 95 presenting excellent nanofiltration performance the gqds 2 wt sample has the highest rejection percentage of 97 6 which indicates that this sample is the most appropriate option for color removal as shown first by addition of low amounts of the gqds 0 05 and 0 1 wt a little reduction in the dye rejection could be seen due to increase of membrane porosity and probably presence of some big pores which could increase the passing of the dye molecules however by increase of higher concentrations of the gqds 0 5 wt the functional groups of the gqds act as a repulsion agent and the rejection was improved due to more repulsion between the functional groups of dye and embedded nanomaterials 75 in addition the addition of gqds could help in enhancing the adsorption of dyes in the membrane matrix 76 the results showed that the dye rejection of the prepared gqds blended pvc membranes were not improved however in the same dye rejection ability the anti fouling properties and the permeability of the membranes were improved resulting in high productivity of the membranes 4 conclusion in this study the potential of using graphene quantum dots gqds as a hydrophilic nanofiller was examined for enhancing the pvc based nanofiltration membranes the membrane hydrophilicity was improved by increasing the gqds amount due to the existence of functional groups on the gqds surface helping in improving permeability blending a suitable amount of the gqds to the casting solution enlarged the porosity and mean pore diameter the sem images showed that the fabricated membranes possessed asymmetric shape comprising fingers like pores and a dense surface layer the porosity hydrophilicity and mean pore size improvement by blending a suitable amount of gqds resulted in the enhancement of permeability and anti fouling property of pvc based membranes the pure water flux increased from 12 1 to 19 4 l m2 h by adding 1 wt gqds the gqds containing membranes showed excellent performance and anti fouling property in bsa protein solution test and dye separation test from wastewater declaration of competing

13843,in recent years graphene has received much attention in many fields to the extent that it has been mostly able to solve the tremendous human challenge of water scarcity in this research graphene quantum dots gqds were used for the preparation of polyvinyl chloride pvc blended matrix nanofiltration membrane for removing reactive blue 19 dye wastewater improvement in anti fouling performance was tested by filtration of bovine serum albumin bsa solution the gqds were synthesized and characterized using tem xrd ftir uv vis spectrophotometer and fluorescence emission the surface morphology

than the unfilled membrane in the case of anti fouling properties the flux recovery ratio was improved from 68 8 to 80 0 all of the fabricated pvc membranes have bsa rejection of more than 98 and reactive blue 19 dye rejection of more than 96 it can be concluded that the organic anti fouling characteristics were improved with considerable permeability enhancement without influencing membrane rejection performance keywords graphene quantum dots nanocomposite membrane anti fouling dye separation environmental protection 1 introduction one of the most severe environmental issues is water pollution that contains various contaminants to overcome such a problem purification methods could be applied to provide usable water from wastewater 1 4 as the globe s population increases the demand for water on limited water resources increases hence creating a technology to recycle the wastewater is inevitable more importantly the filtration process such as membranes has attracted the attention of many researchers recently water scarcity causes some drastic issues such as human and animal mortality and environmental pollution 5 6 while resources can be optimally used and restored the wastewater which is composed of industrial household and agricultural wastewater can be a potential resource to overcome water shortages there are various filtration methods like coagulation sedimentation absorption adsorption and membrane processes to treat wastewater from drilling companies agricultural runoff and municipal sewage 7 10 membranes are one of the physicochemical purification methods that can be used to filter out pollutants compared to the chemical treatment methods such as evaporation and thermal treatment membrane technology is inexpensive and faster 11 12 incorporating various materials into the membrane matrix could improve the membrane performance depending on operating conditions membrane fabrication methods can be classified such as tips nips vips and eips 13 16 hydrophilic nanoparticles are utilized to improve the hydrophilicity of the membranes physical chemical strategies can be shown in two various forms such as physical and chemical properties 17 also the nanoparticles could improve the anti fouling performance due to their high flexibility polymer membranes play an important role in many areas such as biosensing 18 ion exchange 19 water purification 20 membrane distillation 21 22 and biomedical 23 and have achieved better performance polyvinyl chloride pvc is one of the most popular polymers because of its benefits such as availability inexpensive 10 psf price decent physicochemical and mechanical properties such as good tensile strength due to the hydrophobic nature of pvc its usage as a filtration system causes some problems including the reduction of the permeation flux decrement of the system efficacy and increase in the membrane washing expenses hence such a membrane should be modified in order to be used for industrial applications 24 26 nanoparticles because of their unique features can be used to modify and improve the filter properties such as hydrophilicity and porosity 27 carbon nanotubes cnts have been used in various applications due to their unique features including high mechanical strength large aspect ratios high surface area distinct optical characteristics high thermal and electrical conductivity these properties introduce them for a broad range of utilization in the field of electronics energy storage biotechnology sensors and drug delivery and other applications multi functional coatings films 28 like for instance because of high thermal conductivity and surface area making them useful as electrode catalyst supports in a fuel cell that is utilized in transport application where durability is predominant 29 moreover since a significant part of the human body is made up of carbon it could be considered as a biocompatible material cnts are polymer containing pure carbon which can be manipulated utilizing the extremely rich chemistry of carbon this gives an excellent opportunity to change their structure and to maximize their solubility more importantly cnts are

property specifically it has been used in water purification processes along with polyethersulfone pes polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polysulfone psf and pvc membranes using nf uf ro pv mechanisms and mixed matrix and thin films nanocomposites structures contribute significantly to improve performance 30 32 another point is that the quantum dots qds are made of nanocrystals composing a semiconductor core material 33 qd particles have a wider bandgap and therefore require extra excitement energy for light emission at shorter wavelengths qds possess a wide absorption spectrum but limited fluorescent emission spectra such a spectrum range makes qd particularly appropriate for complex recognition especially by employing an exciting light supplier the qd emitting spectrum is 10 20 times brighter compared to an organic fluorophore and thousands of times more durable than traditional dyes 34 qds are novel nanocarbon based materials that have been used in various fields such as chemical assays biosensing bioimaging photocatalysis and electrocatalysis 35 graphene oxide quantum dots gqds were selected because of their nanostructure hydrophilic feature and proper dispersion as an attractive carbon based material gqds have attracted significant interest in a wide range of applications because of their size notable mechanical properties frictionless surface and stability 36 one of the applications of gqds is in the capability of targeting and imaging tumor cells simultaneously 37 38 the broad application of gqds was reported by zhang et al 39 they researched scanning and transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy zeng et al 40 reported the covalent bonding of the gqds onto amino modified pvdf membranes that have anti fouling and bactericidal better performance there was another study on amino functionalized gods agqds encapsulated in thin film nanocomposites as solvent resistance nf membranes which were fabricated using interfacial

was measured using brookfield dviii ultra usa at 25 c to assess the mechanical strength of the prepared gqds pvc membranes tensile strength of the membranes was analyzed by instron 5566 england the tests were conducted at a rate of 1 mm min using 500 n load cells for the samples with size of 4 1 cm the average of at least four samples was reported 2 5 evaluation of membrane performance the nf

citric acid as a carbon source the tem image of achieved gqds is illustrated in fig 2 a the tem image shows that gqds are almost monodispersed nanoparticles moreover the size distribution of gqds is also displayed in the inset of fig 2a which shows the mean sizes of 6 nm for gqds furthermore the dynamic light scattering analysis fig 2b confirmed the results of the tem image and corresponding particle size distribution ft ir test was applied to investigate the functional groups on the gqds surface and use it as proof of the citric acid conversion to gqds fig 2c the gqds show the typical stretching vibrations of hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups existed in the gqds structure scheme 1 in gqds the stretching vibrations of c h bonds are detected at 2970 cm 1 implying that the graphitization is not completed and some aliphatic c h bonds are available on the edges of the synthesized gqds the as prepared gqds display bonds at 1580 and 1675 cm 1 which relates to the c c and carbonyl c o groups stretching respectively 53 55 a wideband at 3415 cm 1 is attributed to the water hydroxyl oh and carboxylic groups these bands show that the surface of gqds is covered by hydrophilic functional groups the uv vis spectrum of gqds fig 2d possesses two major peaks at 240 and 360 nm related to the π π transitions of graphitic c c domains and n π transitions ascribed to the oxygen comprising functional groups respectively 56 upon an excitation wavelength of 400 nm the maximum emission of 470 nm was acquired as depicted in fig 2e gqds showed an excitation independent luminescent behavior while the source of gqds fluorescence is a subject of recent discussion it is totally accepted that the quantum confinement and edge effects play essential roles in such occurrence thus the excitation wavelength independence of gqds can be related to the homogeneity in size and the surface state of those sp2 clusters responsible for fluorescence 55 the xrd paradigm of synthesized gqds displays a broad diffraction peak focused at 2θ 25 fig 2f showing the relatively disordered assembling and the absence of long range order due to the presence of several oxygen molecules including functional groups in the presented material 57 3 2 characterization of pvc membranes as shown in fig 3 the surface morphology of the modified membranes was studied by sem images the surface of the pristine membrane was denser so that no obvious pores could be detected the membrane surfaces are uniform and there are no cracks and pinholes observed this image demonstrates that the bare and nanocomposite membranes have no brittle construction and the addition of gqds has not unfavorably affected the surface of the pvc membranes due to black color of the used nanosheets it visually could be seen that the membranes with higher amounts of the nanosheets has darker surface in other words more nanoparticles appeared on the surface due to the low dispersity and hard sonication of the gqds nanoparticles 58 59 fig 4 reveals the sem views of the cross sectional area of the membranes it was revealed that all the synthesized membranes have an asymmetric structure that comprises a porous substrate with finger like pores and a dense upper layer this structure is formed due to the quick mass transmission among the solvent and the non solvent through the non solvent phase inversion procedure as can be seen by the addition of gqds the structure is enlarged by comparing the cross sectional sem descriptions of the untouched pvc and all gqds embedded pvc membranes it is found that the gqds addition to the doping solution does not alter the formation mechanism of the pvc membrane structure through the phase inversion method by adding nanoparticles compared with the bare pvc it can be understood that the addition of hydrophilic gqds in solution greatly accelerates the water diffusion from the coagulation bath to the polymer film quicker rate of exchange between solvent and non solvent which causes the development of large finger like or macro voids and increases the porosity 43 table 2 reports porosity average pore size and contact angle results in this table which is based on the comparison of samples with nanoparticles and bare pvc as reported in the first column the porosity changes significantly with increasing nanoparticle percentage the trend is the same as the mean pore size in other words increasing the mean pore size results in increased porosity all samples containing gqds have higher porosity compared to the bare sample the highest for the 1 wt sample in 0 05 to 1 0 wt membranes an increasing trend can be observed in this case the porosity in the 2 wt sample is quite similar to that in the 0 05 wt sample these results are quite consistent with the surface morphologies because of the better the sample the better the dispersity in terms of porosity due to the gqds functional groups the samples containing gqds have better porosity in the structure of the gqds there are some hydrophilic groups approved by ftir spectra in fig 2b which could interaction with polymer chains by growing the hydrophilicity of the dope solution with addition of the gqds the exchange rate of solvent non solvent in the phase separation process improves because of the rapid exchange rate of solvent non solvent the overall porosity of the gqds pvc nanocomposite membranes was enhanced 60 in the 2 wt sample the porosity is lower probably due to the dispersity being more difficult and taking longer for sonicating in other words this change in membrane porosity could be analyzed by looking at the phase inversion mechanism through the membrane coagulation in non solvent in general kinetics and thermodynamics are recognized as two directing parameters adjusting the formation of the phase separation membranes 45 the viscosity results table 2 showed that by addition of gqds the viscosity increased which could delay the phase inversion process and prevent the instant demixing 61 in the case of 2 wt membrane the viscosity effect overcome on the hydrophilicity effect and the porosity and pore size of the membrane was reduced table 2 also exhibited the viscosity results of the dope solutions by different contents of gqds applied to fabrication of the nanocomposite membranes with addition of the gqds the viscosity of the casting solutions was increased by growing the viscosity the phase inversion process is rheologically influenced 25 62 the higher viscosity affects the phase inversion kinetic and overcoming the rheological property causes in diminishing the phase exchange rate during the membrane formation forming a membrane with a lower pore size and porosity the same factors influence the next column reporting the mean pore sizes that is as the porosity rate changed the mean pore sizes also had similar changes which was not unexpected by increase of the pore size the more percent of the total volume of the membrane body will be occupied with free volume and therefore the porosity could be improved given that the nanoparticles are the main cause of the porosity so that the average pore size changes and the homogeneity of the dispersity affect them it can be seen that the size of the cavities has increased with the addition of a larger percentage of nanoparticles with the largest size for the 1 wt sample 41 63 64 the third column in table 2 shows the hydrophilicity of the samples the contact angles of the membrane surface are recorded according to the rule that if the contact angle is above 90 degrees the samples are hydrophobic and have poor wetting and if the contact angle is below 90 degrees the samples have hydrophilic property they were less than 90 degrees and with adding nanoparticles they recorded a lower contact angle than the bare sample confirming that the samples become more hydrophilic by the addition of gqds for water flux tests since the gqds nanoparticles are inherently hydrophilic by adding more nanoparticles the hydrophilicity increased following 65 to industrial application the mechanical strength of a membrane is a significant aspect the tensile strength of the gqds pvc membranes was measured to explore variations in mechanical characteristic of them and the obtained data are presented in table 2 the results exhibited that tensile strength of the bare spvc membrane was 13 1 mpa and addition of gqds enhanced tensile which could be related to the reinforcement impact of nanomaterial additive in matrix of polymer however at high concentration of 2 wt a little reduction in mechanical strength was observed which could be related to the agglomeration of gqds in polymer matrix 66 fig 5 exhibits three and two dimensional afm images of the synthesized gqds pvc membranes containing various percentages of the prepared nanoparticle as a trend the lowest average surface roughness was reported by adding 1 wt gqds in the membrane matrix the surface roughness factors of the synthesized membranes including mean roughness sa root mean square of the z data sq the highest peak sz and the height difference between the highest peak and the lowest valley sy are determined from the afm images table 3 related to the roughness parameters showed that by addition of 1 wt gqds to the pvc casting solution the mean roughness was reduced from 5 38 to 4 19 nm in general hydrophilic nanomaterials decrease the surface roughness of polymeric membranes which could be attributed to hydrogen bonding between functional groups oh cooh etc of the nanomaterial and polymer 51 by decreasing surface roughness the pollutants have less chance to agglomerate in the surface valleys of the membrane consequently the anti fouling properties of the polymeric membranes are improved whereas the higher surface roughness owing to the higher surface area causes an increase in the membrane flux 67 the roughness amounts are slightly elevated by a further rise in gqds to 2 wt the agglomeration of the gqds on the membrane surface at a vast amount of the nanofiller could be the main reason for this increasing trend 3 3 membrane filtration performance the pure water flux from the comparison of the bare samples and gqds nanoparticles containing samples is shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the pure water flux pwf ranged from 8 3 l m2 h for 0 05 wt nanoparticle membrane which was lower than 12 2 l m2 h for the bare membrane to more than 19 1 l m2 h for 1 wt membrane that was improved by about 40 the increase in pwf can be ascribed to the hydrophilicity and lager membrane pore sizes as noted as the gqds content of the sample increases the mean pore radius increases the reduction in the flux of 0 05 wt membrane could be because of the increase of viscosity of dope solution table 2 by the addition of the gqds and the decreased contribution of hydrophilicity effect in very low concentration of the gqds 0 05 wt the effect of viscosity overcomes on the hydrophilicity improvement and the pore size of the resulted membrane decreases and therefore the flux is diminished although the flux rate is expected to improve by adding 2 wt of the nanoparticles it does not happen due to the lack of homogeneous dispersity in this amount of nanoparticles 68 69 overall the flux of pvc membranes is lower than the pes membranes and that could be due to the shorter chain in pvc or to say the least the less functional groups for pure water flux in this type of polymer however this could be resolved by the addition of hydrophilic nanoparticles 26 70 for investigating the anti fouling properties of the synthesized gqds pvc membranes after the pure water flux test the bsa solution was filtered for 60 min after washing the membranes for 20 min again the membranes test was followed by the second pure water flux filtration test the results of all of these steps can be seen in fig 7 in the plot as it is evident in the bsa test the flux decreased over time because a layer of bsa is put on the membrane surface reduces the amount of solution flux and creates a resistance layer on the membrane surface which plugs pores and fouls the membranes as can be seen after washing of the membranes the second pure water flux was very close to the first pure water flux test especially for gqds containing membranes which confirms the good performance of the fabricated membranes against the fouling for more details of bsa solution flux and rejection the results of the bsa solution filtration experiments are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the bsa solution flux improves with increasing gqds percentage due to an increase in membranes porosity mean pore size and hydrophilicity see table 2 as can be seen the 2 wt sample has a flux drop which is due to the agglomeration of gqds in all blended nanoparticle samples the rejection percentage is approximately in the same range more than 98 and all rejection percentages are higher than the bare sample which means that the percentage of nanoparticles was able to perform the removal effect well 71 72 3 4 anti fouling performance as for membrane recovery fig 9 shows the flux recovery ratio of each sample after bsa filtration in other words the frr trends showed that the flux recovery and anti fouling properties of all gqds containing membranes are improved the trend of frr is similar to the first and second pure water fluxes and the bsa flux and the highest percentage was found in 1 wt of gqds in this sample the frr reaches 80 showing good recovery operation and excellent anti fouling characteristics all samples with different percentages of nanoparticles had higher frr than the bare sample in the bare pvc sample frr was recorded to be 68 8 then frr was improved with the addition of nanoparticles to the membrane 73 this anti fouling behavior could be related to hydrophilicity improvement and decrease of surface roughness 19 as shown in table 3 by adding gqds to the pvc matrix up to 1 wt the average surface roughness decreases which causes less fouling of the membranes however in 2 wt gqds pvc membrane due to an increase of roughness parameters the membrane fouling increased and frr was reduced for further details on membrane clogging all membrane resistance parameters including pore resistance rp intrinsic membrane resistance rm cake resistance rc and total resistance rt were calculated and depicted in fig 10 the cake layer formed on the membrane surface which is considered to be reversible sediment is represented by rc while rp represents the sediment resistance due to the irreversible deposition of the membrane surface and the pore attachment reversible sediment unlike the irreversible type can mostly be removed by hydraulic cleaning fig 10 shows all the properties of membrane resistance these results indicate that the overall resistance decreases with the addition of gqds nanoparticles and it can certainly be observed for all the mentioned resistances the results also show that the addition of gqds was a suitable method for reducing rc formed by the cake layer deposited on the membrane surface and rp in nf membranes 74 3 5 dye separation fig 11 shows the filtration results with color pollutants the solution of reactive blue 19 dye fig 11 b with a concentration of 100 mg l and natural ph of 5 76 was applied the rejection percentage of all membranes was recorded to be higher than 95 presenting excellent nanofiltration performance the gqds 2 wt sample has the highest rejection percentage of 97 6 which indicates that this sample is the most appropriate option for color removal as shown first by addition of low amounts of the gqds 0 05 and 0 1 wt a little reduction in the dye rejection could be seen due to increase of membrane porosity and probably presence of some big pores which could increase the passing of the dye molecules however by increase of higher concentrations of the gqds 0 5 wt the functional groups of the gqds act as a repulsion agent and the rejection was improved due to more repulsion between the functional groups of dye and embedded nanomaterials 75 in addition the addition of gqds could help in enhancing the adsorption of dyes in the membrane matrix 76 the results showed that the dye rejection of the prepared gqds blended pvc membranes were not improved however in the same dye rejection ability the anti fouling properties and the permeability of the membranes were improved resulting in high productivity of the membranes 4 conclusion in this study the potential of using graphene quantum dots gqds as a hydrophilic nanofiller was examined for enhancing the pvc based nanofiltration membranes the membrane hydrophilicity was improved by increasing the gqds amount due to the existence of functional groups on the gqds surface helping in improving permeability blending a suitable amount of the gqds to the casting solution enlarged the porosity and mean pore diameter the sem images showed that the fabricated membranes possessed asymmetric shape comprising fingers like pores and a dense surface layer the porosity hydrophilicity and mean pore size improvement by blending a suitable amount of gqds resulted in the enhancement of permeability and anti fouling property of pvc based membranes the pure water flux increased from 12 1 to 19 4 l m2 h by adding 1 wt gqds the gqds containing membranes showed excellent performance and anti fouling property in bsa protein solution test and dye separation test from wastewater declaration of competing

adsorption malachite green polymer nanocomposite real samples regeneration 1 introduction today the pollution of water resources by the release of dyes from industrial facilities remains a major global environmental challenge 1 3 malachite green mg is a well known cationic dye that is being broadly used in various industries for dyeing silk leather plastic and paper mg dye also act as a fungicidal agent antiparasitic drug and antiseptic substance in fish breeding industry with a high content of nitrogen mg dye was found to be carcinogenic genotoxic mutagenic and teratogenic 4 5 in virtue of the complex chemical structure and stability to heat light and oxidizing agents mg can hardly be eliminated from wastewater by conventional treatment techniques e g coagulation flocculation precipitation filtration sand and biodegradation 6 accordingly it is of paramount importance to develop removal techniques for such dyes prior to releasing into bodies of water among numerous chemical physical and biological techniques for dye removal from wastewaters 7 10 adsorption based techniques are favorable owing to their low cost high efficiency less harmful secondary products possible regeneration of the adsorbent and easy and safe operation 11 to date traditional adsorbent materials such as activated carbon 12 zeolite 13 chitosan 14 clays 15 and polymeric materials 16 have been tested to purify dye contaminating wastewater however their limited adsorption capacity and or difficult separation have limited their further development and application thus there is surely a need for an adsorbent with the large capacity rapid uptake rate simple separation easy application and capability of organic dyes removal 17 18 natural mineral polymers are abundant and cheap and have recently been used in a number of applications in areas such as drug delivery biomaterials agriculture industry and separation processes 19 22 but their application in water treatment has been limited and most do not have a good absorption capacity 23 polymer nanocomposites are three dimensional 3d networks of hydrophilic polymers and have the ability to retain considerable extent of water pollutants in the presence of nanoparticles nps the integration of nps into the polymer matrix further improves mechanical strength great adsorption capacity and lower cost to name a few 24 in this work a novel large 3d polymer nanocomposite containing graphene oxide go poly vinyl alcohol pva and sodium montmorillonite nammt was successfully prepared by a simple and an environment friendly solution mixing evaporation method in this nanocomposite go was used due to its high surface area high water dispersion and oxygen containing surface functionalities 25 the nammt was used due to having a high specific surface area large cation exchange capacity and layered structure and pva polymer was used as a crosslinking agent we hypothesized that these combined unique properties can result in an effective low cost high capacity and recyclable adsorbent for wastewater treatment applications 2 experimental 2 1 materials and instruments the chemicals materials and instruments that have been used in this study are listed in text s1 and s2 in the electronic supplementary information 2 2 preparation of go nammt polymer nanocomposite the modified hummer s method was applied to prepare go from pure graphite powder 26 the preparation of go nammt polymer nanocomposite was carried out by a simple solution mixing evaporation method as follows in a beaker 0 25 g of nammt was dispersed in ultrapure water 50 ml and sonicated for a period of 1 h for exfoliation in another beaker following the dispersion in high purity water 50 ml go 0 5 g was exfoliated by sonication for 1 h then the sonicated nammt water mixture was added to the go suspension under continuous stirring to form a go nammt homogeneous mixture in the third beaker pva 0 1 g was dissolved in ultrapure water 50 ml at 90 c to form a polymer solution subsequently 10 ml of the polymer solution was added to go nammt homogeneous under ultrasound condition at 25 c for 1 h ultimately to obtain nammt polymer nanocomposite following polymerization the final mixture on a glass plate was dried in a vacuum oven at the temperature of 50 c for 24 h the obtained nanocomposite was used for further characterization fig 1 illustrates the detailed preparation scheme of go nammt polymer nanocomposite 2 3 adsorption study adsorption experiments were all performed in a temperature controlled water bath shaker gyromax 939 amerex instruments usa to study the influences of various factors on adsorption obtaining the equilibrium conditions and studying the isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic of mg dye adsorption in equilibrium conditions 1 8 mg of nammt go polymer nanocomposite was added to the mg dye solution 50 ml 100 300 mg l 1 and adsorption process was examined at ph 2 0 12 temperature 10 50 c and contact time 5 45 min the adsorption of mg dye on nammt go polymer nanocomposite was then quantified by measuring the residual mg dye concentration after the adsorption process using a uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 617 nm the following equations eq 1 3 were used to determine qe qt and removal of the mg dye 27 1 q e c 0 c e v m 2 q t c 0 c t v m 3 removal c 0 c e c 0 100 where qe and qt mg g 1 indicated the amount of the mg dye adsorption to the adsorbent and at any time c0 ce and ct denoted the dye concentrations in mg l 1 at initial point equilibrium point and any time t v l denotes the solution volume and m g represents dry adsorbent mass 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of go nammt polymer nanocomposite xrd patterns of go pva nammt and go nammt polymer nanocomposite are shown in fig s1 and also described in text s2 fig 2 shows the surface functional groups and potential binding sites of go pva nammt and go nammt polymer nanocomposite as identified by ftir spectroscopy the main characteristic peaks of go fig 2a are observed at 1725 cm 1 co stretch 1627cm 1 cc stretch 1390 cm 1 coh stretching vibration and 1229 cm 1 co stretch as previously reported in the literature 28 these surface oxygen containing functional groups can act as available sites for adsorption via interactions with adsorbate molecules 29 in addition in the pure pva spectrum fig 2b the main peaks appeared at 3425 oh stretching vibration 1736 cm 1 co stretching vibration of acetate group 1432 cm 1 ch2 bending vibration 1336 cm 1 coh plane bending vibration and 1150 1075 cm 1 co stretching vibration of secondary alcohols of pva the pva contains abundant oh that may be effective for improving the adsorption capacity as well as it can act as a binfing site for the physical cross linking agent 30 31 in the nammt spectrum fig 2c the main peaks appeared at 3631 cm 1 sioh stretching vibration 1470 cm 1 aloh stretching vibration 1112 cm 1 sios i stretching vibration which overlaps with 1046 cm 1 sioal stretching vibration and 626 cm 1 siom bending vibrations where m is the exchangeable na ion metal species the presence of sodium as the predominant exchangeable cation would facilitate the cation exchangeability with mg dye and therefore by this way can be effective in the mg dye adsorption process 32 for go nammt polymer nanocomposite fig 2d the main peak positions of the go nammt and pva functional groups in nanocomposite still remained and the slight changes in the position intensity and shape were obvious in comparison of their pure form this slight change of peaks attributed due to the interactions between the surface of go pva and nammt in the nanocomposite in particular the intensity of co and coh related to go was decreased in the nanocomposite on the other hand the shape and intensity of coh in pva and sio h in nammt were changed these changes further confirm the interactions between pva nammt and the oxygen containing functional groups i e coh and cooh of go nanosheets a possible explanation for such changes could be the presence of the hydrogen bonding interactions between the oh bonds of the above mentioned materials suggesting that in go nammt polymer nanocomposite the main interaction between the raw materials comes from the oh groups that were shown in fig 1 the morphology of the synthesized go nammt polymer nanocomposite is shown in fig 3 fig 3a shows a cross sectional fesem image of nanocomposite as can be seen the nanocomposite has a 3d structure with a thickness of about 1 5 mm with the semi amorphous structure with multi lamellar morphology which is built up by multi dispersed go and nammt nanosheets embedded into the continuous amorphous phase of pva polymer matrix by sonication which was previously proved by xrd results fig 3b was the low magnified fesem image of the middle position of the nanocomposite which shows that the go and mmt nanosheets were homogeneously dispersed onto the pva matrix fig 3c shows a magnified fesem image of the section close to the surface of the nanocomposite in which the clay nanosheet with lamellar structure in middle was being surrounded by exfoliated graphene nanosheets fig 3d and e show the high magnified fesem image of the lamellar structure of nammt and exfoliated go nanosheets respectively the elemental composition and distribution on go nammt polymer nanocomposite were investigated by edx analysis as shown in fig 4 a and b as can be shown the prepared nanocomposite consists of the elements carbon c oxygen o silicon si aluminum al and sodium na the c and o elements indicate the presence of go and pva in the nanocomposite structure also the si al and na elements confirmed the presence of nammt in the nanocomposite structure in addition edx elemental mapping confirms a homogeneous distribution of the mentioned elements over the entire polymer nanocomposite the polymer nanocomposite has a surface area of 230 87 m2 g 1 with a mesoporous structure i e 50 nm pore size 2 nm fig 5 a shows the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of the nanocomposite which was found to follow type iv isotherm with a hysteresis loop of type h3 as an indication of a mesoporous structure and pores with slit shape also the barrett joyner halenda bjh pore size distribution is presented in the inset of fig 5a the mass loss tga and the derivative dtg curves of the go nammt polymer nanocomposite in an argon atmosphere at 20 c min 1 are displayed in fig 5b three main weight loss regions in the tg curve appeared as three peaks in the dtg curve the first major weight loss region 12 73 is visible at 100 300 c and arises from the evaporation of absorbed water molecules in pores of nanocomposite and between the silicate layers during heating 33 and the pyrolysis of oxygen containing functional groups on the go nanosheets 34 the second region 37 05 at 300 600 c possibly in virtue of the decomposition of the cc chain of pva 35 and the combustion of the carbon skeleton of go nanosheet 34 the products obtained in the result of these decompositions were found to be mainly h2o and co2 36 the third weight loss region 4 14 at above 600 c was the result of the dehydration of the remaining oh group which was located on aloa l bonds in the alo6 octahedral sheet of nammt 20 33 and also due to the loss of co and h2 36 the total weight loss at 1000 c was observed to be approximately 53 92 as it is apparent from the dtg curve three weight loss rates can be observed at 118 260 and 284 c which verifies the outcomes of the tga analysis 3 2 adsorption experiments by varying the quantities of adsorbent 1 8 mg we determined the optimum adsorbent dose fig s2a the adsorption of mg dye 100 mg l 1 increased from 41 512 25 mg g 1 to 93 1162 5 mg g 1 after increasing the adsorbent mass from 1 mg to 4 mg the higher surface area and more accessible adsorption sites are the possible reasons for this elevation after 4 mg increasing the amount of adsorbent 5 8 mg had no significant effect on increasing adsorption efficiency increased from 93 1162 25 mg g 1 to 97 1212 5 mg g 1 therefore the amount of adsorbent was fixed to 4 mg for the subsequent experiments the influence of contact time on the adsorption of mg dye by go nammt polymer nanocomposite is demonstrated in fig s2b the removal of mg dye was rapid and adsorption efficiency reaches 84 1050 mg g 1 after 10 min before reaching an equilibrium 89 1112 5 mg g 1 at 20 min the most probable reasons for the rapid absorption rate in the early stages is the presence of various empty sites on the adsorbent surface that have not yet been occupied by mg molecules 37 it was observed that the temperature has a great effect on the adsorption efficiency so that with increasing temperature from 10 to 50 c the adsorption amount of mg dye increased from 937 5 mg g 1 to 1212 5 mg g 1 fig s2c the occurrence of such a phenomenon is closely related to this behavior that with an increase in the temperature the viscosity of the solution decreases thereby leading to the enhanced diffusion rate of dye molecules throughout the exterior surface and the interior pores of the adsorbent 38 however the results revealed that the adsorbent had good potential for mg adsorption even at 10 c 75 removal 937 5 mg g 1 and the mg dye removal amount enhanced from 937 5 mg g 1 to 1150 mg g 1 75 92 removal with the elevation of temperature from 10 to 30 c the impact of temperature on the adsorption capacity showed the temperature over 30 c has a few effects on the adsorption capacity 92 97 and there is no significant increase which is possibly the consequence of the endothermic reaction therefore the equilibrium can be achieved within 30 c conversely high temperatures declined the electrostatic interaction 39 denoting that the mg dye adsorption increases at higher temperatures therefore other adsorption mechanisms rather than electrostatic interaction can be responsible for mg dye adsorption the influence of the mg dye initial concentration on the adsorption efficiency is illustrated in fig s2d it was found that by increasing the dye initial concentration from 15 to 300 mg l 1 the adsorbed amount of dye increased from 199 2 to 1650 mg g 1 however the adsorption effectiveness diminished gradually from 98 6 to 44 after enhancing the initial concentration of mg dye from 25 to 300 mg l 1 the increase in dye adsorption amount by increasing the dye initial concentration may come from additional dye molecules or ions available in the solution at a higher concentration another reason could be related to the larger driving force of mass transfer at higher initial concentrations which leads to greater absorption 40 on the other hand increase of initial dye concentration giving rise to the saturation of adsorption sites at the surface of the adsorbent and the adsorption efficiency decreased as a result the equilibrium initial concentration of mg dye could be achieved by 100 mg l 1 the pka value of mg dye is 6 9 41 suggesting the cationic and anionic forms of mg at ph 6 9 and ph 6 9 respectively meanwhile the ph at the point of zero charge phpzc for go nammt polymer nanocomposite which was measured based on the ph drift procedure 42 found to be 6 4 fig 6 a at ph 6 4 the adsorbent surface was negatively charged due to the formation of hydroxyl functional groups with high density at ph 6 4 however the protonation of the surface functional groups gives the surface a positive charge the relationship between the adsorption efficiency and the initial ph is illustrated in fig 6b when the ph of the dye enhanced from 2 0 to 12 0 the mg dye removal amount increased from 687 5 mg g 1 to 1212 5 mg g 1 75 92 removal however the prepared go nammt polymer nanocomposite in a wide spectrum of ph had high adsorption efficiency even in presence of electrostatic repulsion in the ph range of 6 4 6 9 according to fig 6a adsorption efficiency continued to increase the experimental results from the effect of ph on adsorption showed that the electrostatic attractions have little effect on the process of mg dye adsorption and other interactions such as cation exchange hydrogen bonding n π and π π interactions can be the main mechanisms of adsorption 3 3 adsorption equilibrium isotherms using adsorption isotherms at the equilibrium state we studied the interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbed mg dye molecules and also estimate the adsorption ability of the adsorbent 43 various adsorption isotherm models were utilized for the adjustment of the experimental data and also for the investigation of the adsorption mechanisms of the mg dye onto go nammt polymer nanocomposite fig s3a d table s1 summarizes the obtained results from isotherm models for dye adsorption in the langmuir model it is hypothesized that homogeneous binding sites are preferable on the adsorbent surface while no interactions between the adsorbed species 44 the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity calculated by langmuir isotherm was 1721 mg g 1 which was much higher than other early reported adsorbents for the removal of mg dye from the aqueous systems which are shown in table 1 the separation factor rl as a dimensionless equilibrium parameter was used to study the applicability of langmuir adsorption isotherm the rl values were greater than 0 and less than 1 which is indicative of favorable adsorption of mg dye onto go nammt polymer nanocomposite 45 the linear form of freundlich isotherm describes a heterogeneous surface as well as the multilayer sorption in the freundlich isotherm model the factor 1 n reflects the heterogeneity factor and the adsorption intensity according to the results table s1 the value of n was 6 12 which is between 1 10 demonstrate that the favorable adsorption 46 the value of the e factor in the d r isotherm model was 0 163 kj mol 1 when e value is below 8 kj mol physical absorption can also be considered effective in the absorption process 47 according to table s1 and based on the correlation coefficients the langmuir adsorption isotherm model r2 0 999 was superior to other models freundlich model with r2 0 816 temkin model with r2 0 850 and dubinin radushkevich model with r2 0 986 denoting that the adsorption process is a monolayer adsorption and occurred in a homogeneous surface of the adsorbent 48 3 4 adsorption kinetics fig s4a d illustrates the adsorption kinetic curves of the mg dye adsorption onto go nammt polymer nanocomposite and the kinetic parameters calculated in this study are given in table s2 we applied four kinetic models to fit the experimental data and to investigate the rate limiting steps i e pseudo first order and pseudo second order intraparticle diffusion and elovich models the results indicated that the r2 value in the pseudo second order model 0 999 was higher relative to the pseudo first order model 0 968 intraparticle diffusion model 0 801 and elovich model 0 905 which means the pseudo second order model was more representative for simulating the kinetic data moreover the theoretically adsorbed amount qe at equilibrium calculated using the pseudo second order kinetics model 1231 9 mg g 1 was close to the adsorbed amount at equilibrium obtained from the experiment 1162 5 mg g 1 this observation clearly verifies that the adsorption rate is dependent on the concentration of functional sites of polymer nanocomposite mg dye adsorption involves the chemisorption process and is faster at the higher temperatures 49 considering the aforesaid information it seems reasonable to deduce that the rate controlling step is a chemical reaction that occurred between mg dye and binding sites on the adsorbent 50 51 although the pseudo second order equation has the best fitted order for present experimental data the obtained results from this model are not efficient to predict the diffusion mechanism therefore the intra particle diffusion model was used in determining the major rate limiting and adsorption mechanism fig s4c shows the multistage adsorption of mg dye on the polymer nanocomposite indicating the existence of another rate controlling step besides intra particle diffusion and suggest that both external and internal diffusion may control the mg dye adsorption process also the non zero intercepts of the plots elucidate that the intra particle diffusion is engaged in the adsorption process but it is not the rate limiting step for mg dye adsorption on composite on the other hand because of the non zero of c the adsorption process may involve various adsorption mechanisms 52 3 5 adsorption thermodynamics thermodynamic parameters illustrate the internal energy changes relevant to the adsorption process 53 therefore the relative thermodynamic parameters the changes in the standard free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs were measured for the mg dye adsorption by the eqs 4 and 5 and then the eq 6 was obtained from the combination of the first two equations 54 4 δ g o δ s o tδ h o 5 δ g o rt ln k e 6 ln k e δ s o r δ h o r 1 t where δh and δs values were measured by considering the slope and the intercept of the plot of ln ke distribution coefficient versus 1 t fig s5 the thermodynamic parameters of mg dye adsorption were calculated on go mmt polymer nanocomposite table s3 the negative values of δg were diminished from 8 52 to 16 12 kj mol 1 when the temperature was elevated from 283 k to 323 k denoting that the mg dye adsorption is a spontaneous process and at higher temperatures it becomes more favorable 41 besides the values of δg were 0 and 20 kj mol 1 which reflects that the adsorption is a physisorption process 41 the positive value 47 47 kj mol 1 of δh uncovers that the removal process is endothermic and is supported by the enhancement of adsorption capacity when the temperature increases additionally the adsorption process could be chemisorption in case that the enthalpy of the adsorption process is greater than 40 kj mol 1 42 hence considering the δg and δh values the mg dye adsorption onto go nammt polymer nanocomposite may have involved a combination of physisorption and chemisorption 55 the δs has a positive value which means increasing randomness at the solid liquid interface through the adsorption 56 3 6 desorption and recyclability of the adsorbent desorption studies assist in clarifying the nature of adsorption and potential regeneration solutions for adsorbents which is of crucial importance for recyclability and reuse of the adsorbent towards this end ultrapure water acetone 0 1 mol l 1 methanol 0 1 mol l 1 acetic acid 0 1 mol l 1 and acetic acid methanol 1 2 v v 0 1 mol l 1 were selected to determine the most effective eluting agent for desorption of the mg dye from the go nammt polymer nanocomposite as depicted in fig 7 a the desorption efficiency of mg dye in ultrapure water was very weak which further confirmed that the chemisorption was the major mode of adsorption on the other hand acetone acetic acid methanol and acetic acid methanol solvents were effective in regenerating the go nammt polymer nanocomposite acetone and methanol have both hydrophobic ch3 and hydrophilic oh co functional groups that facilitate the desorption by two main steps first acetone and methanol are adsorbed on the aromatic structure of adsorbent by their hydrophobic groups second acetone and methanol interact via their hydrophobic groups with adsorbent surface functional groups oh cooh and are strongly absorbed on the adsorbent surface thereby blocking the interaction between the adsorbent and the dye molecules therefore it can be concluded that the mg dye molecules are first replaced by methanol acetone molecules and then dissolve in the methanol acetone water solution 57 when acetic acid is used as an eluting agent the number of positively charged sites on the surface of adsorbent increases under acidic conditions ph 5 0 causing electrostatic repulsion between positively charged sites surface of the adsorbent and cationic dye molecules i e increase the desorption efficiency of mg dye despite this electrostatic effect of acetic acid the results from the ph effect on adsorption showed that the electrostatic attraction could not be the dominant adsorption mechanism apparently the acidic solution that contains a large amount of h ions can also be exchanged with the mg ions on the acetic acid water solution given the above explanations this possibility is more likely and could explain why acetic acid has been a success as an eluting agent 58 the effectiveness of acetone methanol and acetic acid solvents showed that the mg dye adsorption on go nammt polymer nanocomposite can be the combination of chemical adsorption mechanisms such as h bonding electrostatic attractions etc however the low desorption efficiency of mg dye in ultrapure water showed that the possibility of physical adsorption could not be ignored according to the results since there was not any significant difference in yield in the use of acetic acid and acetic acid methanol as eluting agents and both solvents were good desorption efficiency of mg dye therefore both solvents were used for the regeneration of adsorbent and their effectiveness was studied for 10th recycles the adsorption desorption of mg dye by polymer nanocomposite as can be seen in fig 7b in the case of acetic acid 0 1 mol l 1 the percentage of mg dye removal until the 6th recycles was about 90 1112 5 mg g 1 but then began to decrease dramatically until in the 10th recycles reached 60 750 mg g 1 the reason for the decrease after the 6th recycles can be related to occupied some adsorption site by solvent molecules and also minor injury to the adsorbent surface functional groups by acetic acid given that it has previously been shown that the surface functional groups play an important role in the adsorption of mg dye by go nammt polymer nanocomposite furthermore the structure and surface functional groups of the nanocomposite after 6th recycles were investigated by the xrd pattern fig 7c and ft ir spectrum fig 7d as can be seen the xrd pattern of the nanocomposite after 6th recycles the adsorption desorption of mg dye are the same as those obtained before adsorption which emphasizes the nanocomposite stability during recyclability however the weakening of adsorbent surface functional groups can be seen to some extent in the ft ir spectrum of the nanocomposite after 6th recycles on the other hand the recyclability of adsorbent by acetic acid methanol 0 1 mol l 1 is shown in fig s6 as can be seen the percentage of mg dye removal until the 10th recycles the mg dye removal reached 85 1062 5 mg g 1 therefore acetic acid methanol was found to be slightly more successful than acetic acid over 10th recycles but acetic acid is more environmentally friendly 3 7 removal mechanisms the data obtained from ftir adsorption kinetics thermodynamics isotherms and desorption study revealed that the mg dye removal by the go nammt polymer nanocomposite was probably by a combination of chemisorption and physisorption which can involve several different mechanisms ftir analysis before and after the mg dye adsorption fig 8 and edx study after the mg dye adsorption fig 9 suggest that dipole dipole and yoshida h bondings n π and π π interactions cation exchange physisorption and electrostatic attractions are among these mechanisms as depicted in fig 10 the effects of the temperature and ph on adsorption demonstrated that electrostatic attractions probably have minor contribution in the adsorption process moreover the outcomes of the enthalpy threshold of 40 kj mol 1 and very low desorption efficiency in water impart that the chemical adsorption mechanisms can be superior to physical adsorption mechanisms based on fig 8 after mg dye adsorption on the polymer nanocomposite the three new peaks of mg dye appeared in 1380 1590 and 1170 cm 1 corresponding to the mono and para disubstituted benzene rings cc stretching vibrations and cn stretching vibrations of mg dye respectively 59 emerged in the polymer nanocomposite spectrum suggesting the involvement of adsorption process in a chemical interaction 41 additionally dipole dipole and yoshida h bonding happened between cooh group and oh group on the polymer nanocomposite surface and also between the nitrogen and the aromatic rings in mg dye structure respectively the results of ftir analysis before and after the removal process also revealed a change in the peak of oh group from 3410 to 3420 cm 1 which affirms the aforementioned h bonds furthermore the results from ftir unveiled that n π interactions between oxygen groups on the nanocomposite surface and aromatic rings of mg dye structure can be supported by the peak of co group changed from 1040 to 1050 cm 1 and π π interactions between π electron donors and acceptors available between the aromatic rings in go and aromatic moieties in the mg dye molecules can be verified by aromatic cc bonds changed from 1630 to 1620 cm 1 to assess the possible cationic exchange processes in the adsorption process we measured the cation na content which was released from the adsorbent after mg dye adsorption by flame photometry table s4 for the calculation of the net cation release the zero content of na in before adsorption of mg dye solution as background concentration was subtracted from the amount of cation released after mg dye adsorption following the adsorption process the presence of the na content in the mg dye solution showed the occurrence of cationic exchange besides the inequality between the amount of cationic release and that of adsorbed mg dye disclosed that the cation exchange mechanism and some other mechanisms influence the adsorption process of mg dye after mg dye adsorption by go nammt polymer nanocomposite apart from the nanocomposite elements c o al si and na a new peak of nitrogen element n related to mg dye structure was detected in edx analysis which verifies the mg dye adsorption on polymer nanocomposite 3 8 application of go nammt polymer nanocomposite to real water samples we further evaluated the removal of the mg dye by our adsorbent under varying challenging conditions in real water samples including tap water mineral water river water lake water carpet cleaning and textile wastewaters the water quality parameters for all filtered waters through 0 45 μm nylon membrane are summarized in table 2 the synthetic samples were composed of only mg dye while real water samples contained various background constituents that may interfere or compete with mg dye adsorption as indicated in the table 2 the adsorption efficiency for tap water mineral water river water and the lake water was above 90 however the adsorption efficiency in carpet cleaning and textile wastewaters was 85 and 78 respectively this decrease results from intense competition or interference of mg dye as a cationic dye with other substances such as the cationic ions which appears to be highly present in these real samples as can be seen in table carpet cleaning and textile wastewaters have much more sodium than other samples and one of the reasons for the significant reduction in dye adsorption in them can be due to sodium however with respect to these results it is rational to conclude that the proposed adsorbent is efficient for removing mg dye from real water samples 4 conclusion in summary go mmt polymer nanocomposite has successfully been prepared via a simple and environmentally friendly solution mixing evaporation technique and exploited as an effectual adsorbent for mg dye elimination from synthetic and real wastewaters the effect of different parameters revealed the excellent matching of equilibrium data with the langmuir model the saturation adsorption capacity of go mmt polymer nanocomposite was 1721 mg g 1 and the pseudo second order model properly described the adsorption process moreover the adsorption thermodynamics was spontaneous and endothermic the interaction between go mmt polymer nanocomposite and mg dye probably was occurred by a combination of chemisorption and physisorption that can be accomplished by dipole dipole and yoshida h bonding n π and π π interactions cation exchange physisorption and electrostatic attractions as per the results of the enthalpy threshold of 40 kj mol 1 and very low desorption efficiency in water the chemisorption mechanisms can be more dominant also according to the desorption studies the best recovery of mg dye can be attained in acid methanol reusability study indicated the adsorption capacity of the go mmt polymer nanocomposite for mg dye was high even after 6 recycles were reused moreover the application of the proposed nanocomposite in the six types of real water samples was successful

dimensional 3d structure allow easy handling and separation during application have high potential to serve as a highly efficient adsorbent for water wastewaters treatment applications keywords adsorption malachite green polymer nanocomposite real samples regeneration 1 introduction today the pollution of water resources by the release of dyes from industrial facilities remains a major global environmental challenge 1 3 malachite green mg is a well known cationic dye that is being broadly used in various industries for dyeing silk leather plastic and paper mg dye also act as a fungicidal agent antiparasitic drug and antiseptic substance in fish breeding industry with a high content of nitrogen mg dye was found to be carcinogenic genotoxic mutagenic and teratogenic 4 5 in virtue of the complex chemical structure and stability to heat light and oxidizing agents mg can hardly be eliminated from wastewater by conventional treatment techniques e g coagulation flocculation precipitation filtration sand and biodegradation 6 accordingly it is of paramount importance to develop removal techniques for such dyes prior to releasing into bodies of water among numerous chemical physical and biological techniques for dye removal from wastewaters 7 10 adsorption based techniques are favorable owing to their low cost high efficiency less harmful secondary products possible regeneration of the adsorbent and easy and safe operation 11 to date traditional adsorbent materials such as activated carbon 12 zeolite 13 chitosan 14 clays 15 and polymeric materials 16 have been tested to purify dye contaminating wastewater however their limited adsorption capacity and or difficult separation have limited their further development and application thus there is surely a need for an adsorbent with the large capacity rapid uptake rate simple separation easy application and capability of organic dyes removal 17 18 natural mineral polymers are abundant and cheap and have recently been used in a number of applications in areas such as drug delivery biomaterials agriculture industry and separation processes 19 22 but their application in water treatment has been limited and most do not have a good absorption capacity 23 polymer nanocomposites are three dimensional 3d networks of hydrophilic polymers and have the ability to retain considerable extent of water pollutants in the presence of nanoparticles nps the integration of nps into the polymer matrix further improves mechanical strength great adsorption capacity and lower cost to name a few 24 in this work a novel large 3d polymer nanocomposite containing graphene oxide go poly vinyl alcohol pva and sodium montmorillonite nammt was successfully prepared by a simple and an environment friendly solution mixing evaporation method in this nanocomposite go was used due to its high surface area high water dispersion and oxygen containing surface functionalities 25 the nammt was used due to having a high specific surface area large cation exchange capacity and layered structure and pva polymer was used as a crosslinking agent we hypothesized that these combined unique properties can result in an effective low cost high capacity and recyclable adsorbent for wastewater treatment applications 2 experimental 2 1 materials and instruments the chemicals materials and instruments that have been used in this study are listed in text s1 and s2 in the electronic supplementary information 2 2 preparation of go nammt polymer nanocomposite the modified hummer s method was applied to prepare go from pure graphite powder 26 the preparation of go nammt polymer nanocomposite was carried out by a simple solution mixing evaporation method as follows in a beaker 0 25 g of nammt was dispersed in ultrapure water 50 ml and sonicated for a period of 1 h for exfoliation in another beaker following the dispersion in high purity water 50 ml go 0 5 g was exfoliated by sonication for 1 h then the sonicated nammt water mixture was added to the go suspension under continuous stirring to form a go nammt homogeneous mixture in the third beaker pva 0 1 g was dissolved in ultrapure water 50 ml at 90 c to form a polymer solution subsequently 10 ml of the polymer solution was added to go nammt homogeneous under ultrasound condition at 25 c for 1 h ultimately to obtain nammt polymer nanocomposite following polymerization the final mixture on a glass plate was dried in a vacuum oven at the temperature of 50 c for 24 h the obtained nanocomposite was used for further characterization fig 1 illustrates the detailed preparation scheme of go nammt polymer nanocomposite 2 3 adsorption study adsorption experiments were all performed in a temperature controlled water bath shaker gyromax 939 amerex instruments usa to study the influences of various factors on adsorption obtaining the equilibrium conditions and studying the isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic of mg dye adsorption in equilibrium conditions 1 8 mg of nammt go polymer nanocomposite was added to the mg dye solution 50 ml 100 300 mg l 1 and adsorption process was examined at ph 2 0 12 temperature 10 50 c and contact time 5 45 min the adsorption of mg dye on nammt go polymer nanocomposite was then quantified by measuring the residual mg dye concentration after the adsorption process using a uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 617 nm the following equations eq 1 3 were used to determine qe qt and removal of the mg dye 27 1 q e c 0 c e v m 2 q t c 0 c t v m 3 removal c 0 c e c 0 100 where qe and qt mg g 1 indicated the amount of the mg dye adsorption to the adsorbent and at any time c0 ce and ct denoted the dye concentrations in mg l 1 at initial point equilibrium point and any time t v l denotes the solution volume and m g represents dry adsorbent mass 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of go nammt polymer nanocomposite xrd patterns of go pva nammt and go nammt polymer nanocomposite are shown in fig s1 and also described in text s2 fig 2 shows the surface functional groups and potential binding sites of go pva nammt and go nammt polymer nanocomposite as identified by ftir spectroscopy the main characteristic peaks of go fig 2a are observed at 1725 cm 1 co stretch 1627cm 1 cc stretch 1390 cm 1 coh stretching vibration and 1229 cm 1 co stretch as previously reported in the literature 28 these surface oxygen containing functional groups can act as available sites for adsorption via interactions with adsorbate molecules 29 in addition in the pure pva spectrum fig 2b the main peaks appeared at 3425 oh stretching vibration 1736 cm 1 co stretching vibration of acetate group 1432 cm 1 ch2 bending vibration 1336 cm 1 coh plane bending vibration and 1150 1075 cm 1 co stretching vibration of secondary alcohols of pva the pva contains abundant oh that may be effective for improving the adsorption capacity as well as it can act as a binfing site for the physical cross linking agent 30 31 in the nammt spectrum fig 2c the main peaks appeared at 3631 cm 1 sioh stretching vibration 1470 cm 1 aloh stretching vibration 1112 cm 1 sios i stretching vibration which overlaps with 1046 cm 1 sioal stretching vibration and 626 cm 1 siom bending vibrations where m is the exchangeable na ion metal species the presence of sodium as the predominant exchangeable cation would facilitate the cation exchangeability with mg dye and therefore by this way can be effective in the mg dye adsorption process 32 for go nammt polymer nanocomposite fig 2d the main peak positions of the go nammt and pva functional groups in nanocomposite still remained and the slight changes in the position intensity and shape were obvious in comparison of their pure form this slight change of peaks attributed due to the interactions between the surface of go pva and nammt in the nanocomposite in particular the intensity of co and coh related to go was decreased in the nanocomposite on the other hand the shape and intensity of coh in pva and sio h in nammt were changed these changes further confirm the interactions between pva nammt and the oxygen containing functional groups i e coh and cooh of go nanosheets a possible explanation for such changes could be the presence of the hydrogen bonding interactions between the oh bonds of the above mentioned materials suggesting that in go nammt polymer nanocomposite the main interaction between the raw materials comes from the oh groups that were shown in fig 1 the morphology of the synthesized go nammt polymer nanocomposite is shown in fig 3 fig 3a shows a cross sectional fesem image of nanocomposite as can be seen the nanocomposite has a 3d structure with a thickness of about 1 5 mm with the semi amorphous structure with multi lamellar morphology which is built up by multi dispersed go and nammt nanosheets embedded into the continuous amorphous phase of pva polymer matrix by sonication which was previously proved by xrd results fig 3b was the low magnified fesem image of the middle position of the nanocomposite which shows that the go and mmt nanosheets were homogeneously dispersed onto the pva matrix fig 3c shows a magnified fesem image of the section close to the surface of the nanocomposite in which the clay nanosheet with lamellar structure in middle was being surrounded by exfoliated graphene nanosheets fig 3d and e show the high magnified fesem image of the lamellar structure of nammt and exfoliated go nanosheets respectively the elemental composition and distribution on go nammt polymer nanocomposite were investigated by edx analysis as shown in fig 4 a and b as can be shown the prepared nanocomposite consists of the elements carbon c oxygen o silicon si aluminum al and sodium na the c and o elements indicate the presence of go and pva in the nanocomposite structure also the si al and na elements confirmed the presence of nammt in the nanocomposite structure in addition edx elemental mapping confirms a homogeneous distribution of the mentioned elements over the entire polymer nanocomposite the polymer nanocomposite has a surface area of 230 87 m2 g 1 with a mesoporous structure i e 50 nm pore size 2 nm fig 5 a shows the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of the nanocomposite which was found to follow type iv isotherm with a hysteresis loop of type h3 as an indication of a mesoporous structure and pores with slit shape also the barrett joyner halenda bjh pore size distribution is presented in the inset of fig 5a the mass loss tga and the derivative dtg curves of the go nammt polymer nanocomposite in an argon atmosphere at 20 c min 1 are displayed in fig 5b three main weight loss regions in the tg curve appeared as three peaks in the dtg curve the first major weight loss region 12 73 is visible at 100 300 c and arises from the evaporation of absorbed water molecules in pores of nanocomposite and between the silicate layers during heating 33 and the pyrolysis of oxygen containing functional groups on the go nanosheets 34 the second region 37 05 at 300 600 c possibly in virtue of the decomposition of the cc chain of pva 35 and the combustion of the carbon skeleton of go nanosheet 34 the products obtained in the result of these decompositions were found to be mainly h2o and co2 36 the third weight loss region 4 14 at above 600 c was the result of the dehydration of the remaining oh group which was located on aloa l bonds in the alo6 octahedral sheet of nammt 20 33 and also due to the loss of co and h2 36 the total weight loss at 1000 c was observed to be approximately 53 92 as it is apparent from the dtg curve three weight loss rates can be observed at 118 260 and 284 c which verifies the outcomes of the tga analysis 3 2 adsorption experiments by varying the quantities of adsorbent 1 8 mg we determined the optimum adsorbent dose fig s2a the adsorption of mg dye 100 mg l 1 increased from 41 512 25 mg g 1 to 93 1162 5 mg g 1 after increasing the adsorbent mass from 1 mg to 4 mg the higher surface area and more accessible adsorption sites are the possible reasons for this elevation after 4 mg increasing the amount of adsorbent 5 8 mg had no significant effect on increasing adsorption efficiency increased from 93 1162 25 mg g 1 to 97 1212 5 mg g 1 therefore the amount of adsorbent was fixed to 4 mg for the subsequent experiments the influence of contact time on the adsorption of mg dye by go nammt polymer nanocomposite is demonstrated in fig s2b the removal of mg dye was rapid and adsorption efficiency reaches 84 1050 mg g 1 after 10 min before reaching an equilibrium 89 1112 5 mg g 1 at 20 min the most probable reasons for the rapid absorption rate in the early stages is the presence of various empty sites on the adsorbent surface that have not yet been occupied by mg molecules 37 it was observed that the temperature has a great effect on the adsorption efficiency so that with increasing temperature from 10 to 50 c the adsorption amount of mg dye increased from 937 5 mg g 1 to 1212 5 mg g 1 fig s2c the occurrence of such a phenomenon is closely related to this behavior that with an increase in the temperature the viscosity of the solution decreases thereby leading to the enhanced diffusion rate of dye molecules throughout the exterior surface and the interior pores of the adsorbent 38 however the results revealed that the adsorbent had good potential for mg adsorption even at 10 c 75 removal 937 5 mg g 1 and the mg dye removal amount enhanced from 937 5 mg g 1 to 1150 mg g 1 75 92 removal with the elevation of temperature from 10 to 30 c the impact of temperature on the adsorption capacity showed the temperature over 30 c has a few effects on the adsorption capacity 92 97 and there is no significant increase which is possibly the consequence of the endothermic reaction therefore the equilibrium can be achieved within 30 c conversely high temperatures declined the electrostatic interaction 39 denoting that the mg dye adsorption increases at higher temperatures therefore other adsorption mechanisms rather than electrostatic interaction can be responsible for mg dye adsorption the influence of the mg dye initial concentration on the adsorption efficiency is illustrated in fig s2d it was found that by increasing the dye initial concentration from 15 to 300 mg l 1 the adsorbed amount of dye increased from 199 2 to 1650 mg g 1 however the adsorption effectiveness diminished gradually from 98 6 to 44 after enhancing the initial concentration of mg dye from 25 to 300 mg l 1 the increase in dye adsorption amount by increasing the dye initial concentration may come from additional dye molecules or ions available in the solution at a higher concentration another reason could be related to the larger driving force of mass transfer at higher initial concentrations which leads to greater absorption 40 on the other hand increase of initial dye concentration giving rise to the saturation of adsorption sites at the surface of the adsorbent and the adsorption efficiency decreased as a result the equilibrium initial concentration of mg dye could be achieved by 100 mg l 1 the pka value of mg dye is 6 9 41 suggesting the cationic and anionic forms of mg at ph 6 9 and ph 6 9 respectively meanwhile the ph at the point of zero charge phpzc for go nammt polymer nanocomposite which was measured based on the ph drift procedure 42 found to be 6 4 fig 6 a at ph 6 4 the adsorbent surface was negatively charged due to the formation of hydroxyl functional groups with high density at ph 6 4 however the protonation of the surface functional groups gives the surface a positive charge the relationship between the adsorption efficiency and the initial ph is illustrated in fig 6b when the ph of the dye enhanced from 2 0 to 12 0 the mg dye removal amount increased from 687 5 mg g 1 to 1212 5 mg g 1 75 92 removal however the prepared go nammt polymer nanocomposite in a wide spectrum of ph had high adsorption efficiency even in presence of electrostatic repulsion in the ph range of 6 4 6 9 according to fig 6a adsorption efficiency continued to increase the experimental results from the effect of ph on adsorption showed that the electrostatic attractions have little effect on the process of mg dye adsorption and other interactions such as cation exchange hydrogen bonding n π and π π interactions can be the main mechanisms of adsorption 3 3 adsorption equilibrium isotherms using adsorption isotherms at the equilibrium state we studied the interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbed mg dye molecules and also estimate the adsorption ability of the adsorbent 43 various adsorption isotherm models were utilized for the adjustment of the experimental data and also for the investigation of the adsorption mechanisms of the mg dye onto go nammt polymer nanocomposite fig s3a d table s1 summarizes the obtained results from isotherm models for dye adsorption in the langmuir model it is hypothesized that homogeneous binding sites are preferable on the adsorbent surface while no interactions between the adsorbed species 44 the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity calculated by langmuir isotherm was 1721 mg g 1 which was much higher than other early reported adsorbents for the removal of mg dye from the aqueous systems which are shown in table 1 the separation factor rl as a dimensionless equilibrium parameter was used to study the applicability of langmuir adsorption isotherm the rl values were greater than 0 and less than 1 which is indicative of favorable adsorption of mg dye onto go nammt polymer nanocomposite 45 the linear form of freundlich isotherm describes a heterogeneous surface as well as the multilayer sorption in the freundlich isotherm model the factor 1 n reflects the heterogeneity factor and the adsorption intensity according to the results table s1 the value of n was 6 12 which is between 1 10 demonstrate that the favorable adsorption 46 the value of the e factor in the d r isotherm model was 0 163 kj mol 1 when e value is below 8 kj mol physical absorption can also be considered effective in the absorption process 47 according to table s1 and based on the correlation coefficients the langmuir adsorption isotherm model r2 0 999 was superior to other models freundlich model with r2 0 816 temkin model with r2 0 850 and dubinin radushkevich model with r2 0 986 denoting that the adsorption process is a monolayer adsorption and occurred in a homogeneous surface of the adsorbent 48 3 4 adsorption kinetics fig s4a d illustrates the adsorption kinetic curves of the mg dye adsorption onto go nammt polymer nanocomposite and the kinetic parameters calculated in this study are given in table s2 we applied four kinetic models to fit the experimental data and to investigate the rate limiting steps i e pseudo first order and pseudo second order intraparticle diffusion and elovich models the results indicated that the r2 value in the pseudo second order model 0 999 was higher relative to the pseudo first order model 0 968 intraparticle diffusion model 0 801 and elovich model 0 905 which means the pseudo second order model was more representative for simulating the kinetic data moreover the theoretically adsorbed amount qe at equilibrium calculated using the pseudo second order kinetics model 1231 9 mg g 1 was close to the adsorbed amount at equilibrium obtained from the experiment 1162 5 mg g 1 this observation clearly verifies that the adsorption rate is dependent on the concentration of functional sites of polymer nanocomposite mg dye adsorption involves the chemisorption process and is faster at the higher temperatures 49 considering the aforesaid information it seems reasonable to deduce that the rate controlling step is a chemical reaction that occurred between mg dye and binding sites on the adsorbent 50 51 although the pseudo second order equation has the best fitted order for present experimental data the obtained results from this model are not efficient to predict the diffusion mechanism therefore the intra particle diffusion model was used in determining the major rate limiting and adsorption mechanism fig s4c shows the multistage adsorption of mg dye on the polymer nanocomposite indicating the existence of another rate controlling step besides intra particle diffusion and suggest that both external and internal diffusion may control the mg dye adsorption process also the non zero intercepts of the plots elucidate that the intra particle diffusion is engaged in the adsorption process but it is not the rate limiting step for mg dye adsorption on composite on the other hand because of the non zero of c the adsorption process may involve various adsorption mechanisms 52 3 5 adsorption thermodynamics thermodynamic parameters illustrate the internal energy changes relevant to the adsorption process 53 therefore the relative thermodynamic parameters the changes in the standard free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs were measured for the mg dye adsorption by the eqs 4 and 5 and then the eq 6 was obtained from the combination of the first two equations 54 4 δ g o δ s o tδ h o 5 δ g o rt ln k e 6 ln k e δ s o r δ h o r 1 t where δh and δs values were measured by considering the slope and the intercept of the plot of ln ke distribution coefficient versus 1 t fig s5 the thermodynamic parameters of mg dye adsorption were calculated on go mmt polymer nanocomposite table s3 the negative values of δg were diminished from 8 52 to 16 12 kj mol 1 when the temperature was elevated from 283 k to 323 k denoting that the mg dye adsorption is a spontaneous process and at higher temperatures it becomes more favorable 41 besides the values of δg were 0 and 20 kj mol 1 which reflects that the adsorption is a physisorption process 41 the positive value 47 47 kj mol 1 of δh uncovers that the removal process is endothermic and is supported by the enhancement of adsorption capacity when the temperature increases additionally the adsorption process could be chemisorption in case that the enthalpy of the adsorption process is greater than 40 kj mol 1 42 hence considering the δg and δh values the mg dye adsorption onto go nammt polymer nanocomposite may have involved a combination of physisorption and chemisorption 55 the δs has a positive value which means increasing randomness at the solid liquid interface through the adsorption 56 3 6 desorption and recyclability of the adsorbent desorption studies assist in clarifying the nature of adsorption and potential regeneration solutions for adsorbents which is of crucial importance for recyclability and reuse of the adsorbent towards this end ultrapure water acetone 0 1 mol l 1 methanol 0 1 mol l 1 acetic acid 0 1 mol l 1 and acetic acid methanol 1 2 v v 0 1 mol l 1 were selected to determine the most effective eluting agent for desorption of the mg dye from the go nammt polymer nanocomposite as depicted in fig 7 a the desorption efficiency of mg dye in ultrapure water was very weak which further confirmed that the chemisorption was the major mode of adsorption on the other hand acetone acetic acid methanol and acetic acid methanol solvents were effective in regenerating the go nammt polymer nanocomposite acetone and methanol have both hydrophobic ch3 and hydrophilic oh co functional groups that facilitate the desorption by two main steps first acetone and methanol are adsorbed on the aromatic structure of adsorbent by their hydrophobic groups second acetone and methanol interact via their hydrophobic groups with adsorbent surface functional groups oh cooh and are strongly absorbed on the adsorbent surface thereby blocking the interaction between the adsorbent and the dye molecules therefore it can be concluded that the mg dye molecules are first replaced by methanol acetone molecules and then dissolve in the methanol acetone water solution 57 when acetic acid is used as an eluting agent the number of positively charged sites on the surface of adsorbent increases under acidic conditions ph 5 0 causing electrostatic repulsion between positively charged sites surface of the adsorbent and cationic dye molecules i e increase the desorption efficiency of mg dye despite this electrostatic effect of acetic acid the results from the ph effect on adsorption showed that the electrostatic attraction could not be the dominant adsorption mechanism apparently the acidic solution that contains a large amount of h ions can also be exchanged with the mg ions on the acetic acid water solution given the above explanations this possibility is more likely and could explain why acetic acid has been a success as an eluting agent 58 the effectiveness of acetone methanol and acetic acid solvents showed that the mg dye adsorption on go nammt polymer nanocomposite can be the combination of chemical adsorption mechanisms such as h bonding electrostatic attractions etc however the low desorption efficiency of mg dye in ultrapure water showed that the possibility of physical adsorption could not be ignored according to the results since there was not any significant difference in yield in the use of acetic acid and acetic acid methanol as eluting agents and both solvents were good desorption efficiency of mg dye therefore both solvents were used for the regeneration of adsorbent and their effectiveness was studied for 10th recycles the adsorption desorption of mg dye by polymer nanocomposite as can be seen in fig 7b in the case of acetic acid 0 1 mol l 1 the percentage of mg dye removal until the 6th recycles was about 90 1112 5 mg g 1 but then began to decrease dramatically until in the 10th recycles reached 60 750 mg g 1 the reason for the decrease after the 6th recycles can be related to occupied some adsorption site by solvent molecules and also minor injury to the adsorbent surface functional groups by acetic acid given that it has previously been shown that the surface functional groups play an important role in the adsorption of mg dye by go nammt polymer nanocomposite furthermore the structure and surface functional groups of the nanocomposite after 6th recycles were investigated by the xrd pattern fig 7c and ft ir spectrum fig 7d as can be seen the xrd pattern of the nanocomposite after 6th recycles the adsorption desorption of mg dye are the same as those obtained before adsorption which emphasizes the nanocomposite stability during recyclability however the weakening of adsorbent surface functional groups can be seen to some extent in the ft ir spectrum of the nanocomposite after 6th recycles on the other hand the recyclability of adsorbent by acetic acid methanol 0 1 mol l 1 is shown in fig s6 as can be seen the percentage of mg dye removal until the 10th recycles the mg dye removal reached 85 1062 5 mg g 1 therefore acetic acid methanol was found to be slightly more successful than acetic acid over 10th recycles but acetic acid is more environmentally friendly 3 7 removal mechanisms the data obtained from ftir adsorption kinetics thermodynamics isotherms and desorption study revealed that the mg dye removal by the go nammt polymer nanocomposite was probably by a combination of chemisorption and physisorption which can involve several different mechanisms ftir analysis before and after the mg dye adsorption fig 8 and edx study after the mg dye adsorption fig 9 suggest that dipole dipole and yoshida h bondings n π and π π interactions cation exchange physisorption and electrostatic attractions are among these mechanisms as depicted in fig 10 the effects of the temperature and ph on adsorption demonstrated that electrostatic attractions probably have minor contribution in the adsorption process moreover the outcomes of the enthalpy threshold of 40 kj mol 1 and very low desorption efficiency in water impart that the chemical adsorption mechanisms can be superior to physical adsorption mechanisms based on fig 8 after mg dye adsorption on the polymer nanocomposite the three new peaks of mg dye appeared in 1380 1590 and 1170 cm 1 corresponding to the mono and para disubstituted benzene rings cc stretching vibrations and cn stretching vibrations of mg dye respectively 59 emerged in the polymer nanocomposite spectrum suggesting the involvement of adsorption process in a chemical interaction 41 additionally dipole dipole and yoshida h bonding happened between cooh group and oh group on the polymer nanocomposite surface and also between the nitrogen and the aromatic rings in mg dye structure respectively the results of ftir analysis before and after the removal process also revealed a change in the peak of oh group from 3410 to 3420 cm 1 which affirms the aforementioned h bonds furthermore the results from ftir unveiled that n π interactions between oxygen groups on the nanocomposite surface and aromatic rings of mg dye structure can be supported by the peak of co group changed from 1040 to 1050 cm 1 and π π interactions between π electron donors and acceptors available between the aromatic rings in go and aromatic moieties in the mg dye molecules can be verified by aromatic cc bonds changed from 1630 to 1620 cm 1 to assess the possible cationic exchange processes in the adsorption process we measured the cation na content which was released from the adsorbent after mg dye adsorption by flame photometry table s4 for the calculation of the net cation release the zero content of na in before adsorption of mg dye solution as background concentration was subtracted from the amount of cation released after mg dye adsorption following the adsorption process the presence of the na content in the mg dye solution showed the occurrence of cationic exchange besides the inequality between the amount of cationic release and that of adsorbed mg dye disclosed that the cation exchange mechanism and some other mechanisms influence the adsorption process of mg dye after mg dye adsorption by go nammt polymer nanocomposite apart from the nanocomposite elements c o al si and na a new peak of nitrogen element n related to mg dye structure was detected in edx analysis which verifies the mg dye adsorption on polymer nanocomposite 3 8 application of go nammt polymer nanocomposite to real water samples we further evaluated the removal of the mg dye by our adsorbent under varying challenging conditions in real water samples including tap water mineral water river water lake water carpet cleaning and textile wastewaters the water quality parameters for all filtered waters through 0 45 μm nylon membrane are summarized in table 2 the synthetic samples were composed of only mg dye while real water samples contained various background constituents that may interfere or compete with mg dye adsorption as indicated in the table 2 the adsorption efficiency for tap water mineral water river water and the lake water was above 90 however the adsorption efficiency in carpet cleaning and textile wastewaters was 85 and 78 respectively this decrease results from intense competition or interference of mg dye as a cationic dye with other substances such as the cationic ions which appears to be highly present in these real samples as can be seen in table carpet cleaning and textile wastewaters have much more sodium than other samples and one of the reasons for the significant reduction in dye adsorption in them can be due to sodium however with respect to these results it is rational to conclude that the proposed adsorbent is efficient for removing mg dye from real water samples 4 conclusion in summary go mmt polymer nanocomposite has successfully been prepared via a simple and environmentally friendly solution mixing evaporation technique and exploited as an effectual adsorbent for mg dye elimination from synthetic and real wastewaters the effect of different parameters revealed the excellent matching of equilibrium data with the langmuir model the saturation adsorption capacity of go mmt polymer nanocomposite was 1721 mg g 1 and the pseudo second order model properly described the adsorption process moreover the adsorption thermodynamics was spontaneous and endothermic the interaction between go mmt polymer nanocomposite and mg dye probably was occurred by a combination of chemisorption and physisorption that can be accomplished by dipole dipole and yoshida h bonding n π and π π interactions cation exchange physisorption and electrostatic attractions as per the results of the enthalpy threshold of 40 kj mol 1 and very low desorption efficiency in water the chemisorption mechanisms can be more dominant also according to the desorption studies the best recovery of mg dye can be attained in acid methanol reusability study indicated the adsorption capacity of the go mmt polymer nanocomposite for mg dye was high even after 6 recycles were reused moreover the application of the proposed nanocomposite in the six types of real water samples was successful
